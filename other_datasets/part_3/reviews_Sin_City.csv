Playing with colour, shadow, etc. Totally cool and brings out the awesomeness of the movie, scenes, actors, actions, etc. Bluray is so freaking clear, I finally know what black really looks like.	5.0	Beautiful Movie.

078886047X	Sin City	A1LBAC84TLIGAX	"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF"""	Sin City quite simply is jaw-dropping. What more could you ask for? An all-star cast, a striking visual look, brilliant storytelling, a crazed and rather demented cast of characters, and well-executed action scenes. Sin City is easily one of the greatest films of all time (The Internet Movie Database also backs this up, considering it's on the top 250 list). This is easily one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not quite perfect, but almost.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film is comprised of three separate storylines, all taking place in Sin City. One story focuses on a disgraced cop accused of kidnapping and child molestation after being framed by a powerful political individual who will not let his son be brought to justice for his crimes against little girls. Now the cop must protect a stripper (a girl who is now 19 he rescues at the beginning of the film from the crazed child molester.) and prevent her from being hunted down by her kidnapper, raped, and killed. The second storyline focuses on a man who is out to seek revenge for his murdered girlfriend Goldie, while running from the police because he has been accused of the murder by a powerful religious official, and now he has to find the killer and the religious official responsible for it while having the girl's twin sister tag along with him. The third story focuses a man named Dwight who defends his girlfriend from her violent ex-boyfriend and her Old Town Girls (A homicidal gang of gorgeous prostitutes who run the Old Town section of Sin City), when the Old Town Girls accidentally kills a group undercover cops, Dwight is tasked with getting rid of the bodies to protect their reign over Old Town and not anger the police and mobsters and have them come after them.MUSIC: The musical score was excellent and fit the film perfectly through every moment.ACTION: This film is modeled like an old black and white film, with small touches of color here and there. The action scenes are quite brutal and disturbing at times, but are loaded with shootouts and dismemberments of people. The action scenes were well done, but this film is definitely not for kids at all.ACTING: The acting was really good, which is no surprise considering the all-star cast of people. The dialogue was also good, and it did feel believable. Unfortunately, I do have to complain that sometimes the dialogue got a little long-winded and dragged on. This is only a small complaint though, but it does put a blemish on this film.OVERALL: This is a must-have for any DVD collection. This film is totally brilliant and well-executed in every regard.THE GOOD: The striking visual style, the action scenes, the acting and actors, the brilliant storytelling, and the great music.THE BAD: Moments of long-winded dialogue.	5.0	A STUNNING MASTERPIECE  9.5 OUT OF 10	2009-04-25	3	1	2
078886047X	Sin City	A2O8RIDCJ0H83V	Acoma	I was not familiar at all with any of Frank Miller's graphic novels so I came into this film unaware of his previous work. I rented this last night and fully expected it to suck. This was definately not the case and what I ended up with was a very good piece of cinema and great stories.This is Film Noir. There are no real heroes. Everything is very dark. To sum this film up in one sentence it would have to be this - The good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse. It takes about ten minutes to get the feel of what they are trying to convey, after which you are sucked in. The plots and characters are alive and real. These are stories and if you like a gritty tale of human nature's darker side you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Fine cinema	2005-09-07	3	2	1
078886047X	Sin City	A16B0C3PSIMJ6C	A. Cruanas	The original DVD was great, but splitting the individual stories up into 3 seperate movies, with additional scenes each, makes this DVD top-notch.  Its much more bearable to sit down and watch one story at a time now, I can even get my wife to watch and enjoy them now! Plus another cooking school on disc 2!	5.0	Awesome	2006-08-16	10	5	5
078886047X	Sin City	A3LNXUXY3X5W37	Adam Dembowitz	Do you like Bruce Willis and Clive Owen?  Do you like Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson?  Do you like treachery, guns, sex, and blood?  If so, pick up a copy of Sin City.  There isn't anything about the movie I would change, except Michael Clarke Duncan's cameo is kind of forced.  I'm excited for the sequel.  Excellent supporting performances by Elijah Wood, Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino, and especially Benicio Del Toro.	5.0	Sin City	2007-03-09	8	4	4
078886047X	Sin City	AT1J4MGWHVZEG	Adam J. Bernstein	Sin City lived up to all the anticipation i had for it! They created what is more of a comic interpitation of a moive and less of a movie interpitaion of a comic.They got a fantastic cast that really brought Miller's world to life. Clive Owen, Micky Rourke, Bruce Willis are all the spitting image of there characters. This movie is hands down fun! Its action packed, and stunning. It will DEFNITLY be an addition to my DVD collection.	5.0	BEST MOVIE OF 2005!! PERIOD!!	2005-04-07	4	2	2
078886047X	Sin City	A2ZN3WLQZCBCZO	Adam Willis	If you like beautiful women, good dialogue, kick-ass action sequences, and an insane depth of actors giving awsome performances than chances are you will like this movie. Sure some of the scenes are a little much, for instance Hardigan ripping off parts of the human annatomy that makes most men cringe. Being based on Frank Millers graphic novels, and by graphic I mean it in every sense of the word, you are going to see some ultra-violence, but the gore and blood are bearable due to the films color scheme, and the rest is left to ones own twisted imagination. For the people who identify Elijah Wood with the friendly hobbit from the Shire be prepared for a whole knew range of his acting ability. His haunting performance alone is 5 stars. Don't bring the jeolouse girlfriend to the movie, the women on screen demand all the attention. Enjoy.	5.0	She said her name was Goldie	2005-09-30	3	0	3

078886047X	Sin City	A1X9RGY6D98LHO	"adiadv ""adiadv"""	"Miller, Roderiguez and Tarantino combined their talents to create an amazing film. I clapped and said, ""Bravo"" after it was over. Kinda scary since I watched it by myself!! But I sincerely thought it was that good.It's a comic book vividly brought to life. The special effects are outrageous and over-the-top, just as they should be. It's fun to be drawn into a fantasy world that's full of action, suspense and death-defying feats.The use of color was both brilliant and stunning. Among other things, it purposefully spares you the gory images of brutally violent actions - just enough to remind you that it is a fictional world. But there's plenty of graphic violence and gore (among other things) ... so this most definitely isn't one for the kids!The cast includes dozens of actors from diverse backgrounds. Like most films Tarantino is involved in, you'll see unexpected performances from people you probably never have imagined in that role. They're given an opportunity to demonstrate their diversity and they always shine. I'm not giving Tarantino all the credit in choosing the cast, I'm just saying that I expected it when I saw his name - and I was not let down.I loved it."	5.0	Bravo!	2011-07-27	3	3	0
078886047X	Sin City	A3SPEEGU06X0TF	Adolfo Y. Hernandez	This film was beatiful. The hyper violence, sexual dicptication of women, and pulp literay style of diction is what makes this film geared toward a specific audience of both the orignal comic and film noir. The film is not the the easily squimish, and in fact may be shocking to the causual viewer. For fans of noir, pop culture, john woo/terentino, and pulp, this is pure candy.If you couldn't get enough of the film, rest assured that the source comics will not dissappoint as well.	5.0	True to Form	2006-02-14	5	2	3
078886047X	Sin City	AZSN1TO0JI87B	A. Estes	"Look, I'm going to be honest here. There's nothing I can tell you right now, in this review, that you haven't heard before in other reviews. There's also nothing that can be put in print that will ever do justice to this movie. You just have to see it for yourself. ""Sin City"" is simply the most entertaining movie I have ever seen in theaters. No one talked during this movie, that's how engrossing and just plain cool it is.""Sin City,"" inspired by the graphic comics by Frank Miller (who shares directing credits alongside those ""troublemakers"" Robert Rodirguez and Quentin Tarantino) will likely be unlike anything you have ever seen. First off, the movie is gorgeous, shot in stark black and white, with color making a few choice cameo appearances. It's a very violent movie, very over the top. Not only are people shot in the crotch and beheaded rather liberally, but there are two, count 'em, two swirlies! And there's chunks in that soup, people! Talk about down and dirty! The violence reaches a certain point where it becomes surreal and almost comical (much like the ""Evil Dead"" movies) and helps push the movie as the ultimate fantasy that it is. The movie itself jumps around a lot in time (a trademark of Tarantino, you can see where he had his hands in this) and plays out through a variety of seemingly unrelated scenes, that don't appear to link together until the very end. The casting choices were also very interesting. More seasoned actors like Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan and Michael Madsen appear alongside unpredictable and riskier choices like Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl (I'll never look at him the same) and Alex Bledel (TV's ""Gilmore Girls""). Surprisingly, everyone does a convincing job in their roles, even though they are all just support to the real stars: the sex and the violence. Be warned folks, this is not a movie for your children, or even the faint of heart, to see.""Sin City"" is really the ultimate movie-going experience. After you walk away from it, you will find yourself chattering about it endlessly. It leaves a lasting impression, and is destined for mega-cult status. Truly a film you'll need to see over and over again to absorb everything. If over-the-top violence and nudity don't bother you, I promise you will enjoy yourself at this movie. Believe the hype, this is an incredible film."	5.0	This Is What Movies Are All About	2005-04-07	2	1	1

078886047X	Sin City	A13EV9JB9W06EW	"agent_antichrist ""random annoying advertisment"""	(some small spoilers)This is the closest I think anyone has ever come to adapting a comic to film, it's not just adapted to a film like so many other comic to film renditions, the comic *is* the film. At points it reminds of Casablanca while meeting a massive bloodbath. Bits of color flash or blend making you notice key emoting, physical acting, action, personallity and scenery effect that reflect what's shown in comic pannels. There are also amazing comic style angles brought to life in the cinematography. Any key moment in the again hyper-styleized  action, violence, scenery and purposfull pulp novel/ comic over acting is highlighted, close uped or strangely angled to reflect and emphisize exactly what the comics do while at the same time being alive. truely the most original cinematography in a very very long time. But if your looking for a fairly realistic stylized film working with common logic you've come to the wrong place. It's an exersize in harsh gratuity in a dark and almost alternate world and it couldn't be more satisfying. Everything is overblown and defies physics and all reality, human characters dive through windows of moving vehicles, smash faces through brick walls, talk to the decapitated, have specialty killing skills take out massive amouts of people avoiding utter oblivion through common comic (and film) deus ex machina such as the jammed gun at the last second, hookers look like fettish models straight out of expensive european modeling agencys and run city sections territorally, and don't forget the ninja, and theese are just to name a few. The story (like everything else) is utterly gratuitous in disturbing, fleshy, smoky, grimy, gritty sequences of terrible events with only the good the sick and the sickest (characters). A brilliant peice of film that will hopefully be rememebered for it's trail blazed in black, white, blood, booms, badabooms and bullets for decades to come. So yeah, I loved it.

078886047X	Sin City	A1S2ALXR4IFMDT	"A. Gindy ""Movie Maniac"""	It has been said many times before, but i'm gonna say it again. This is the coolest looking movie I have ever seen. Rodriguez did an amazing job directing this masterpiece of a movie. The visualizations look like they leaped right out of Frank Miller's books. This movie looks so amazing, I could watch it with the sound muted and still enjoy it. It is so appealing to the eye to see nothing but blacks, whites, and greys. Then to have the slightest color come into play sends your mind whirling. To see nothing but black and white and all of a sudden see green eyes or red lips is a pleasing surprise. If you move past the visuals, you get the fantasic acting by a great ensemble cast. Everyone gave unbelievable performances. The other thing that is awesome is the interweaving of three seperate stories into one seamless movie. All in all, I loved everything about this movie. From the opening scene to the credits, I couldn't take my eyes off of the TV. And if you like Tarantino, watch for a scene in which he directed.	5.0	WOW!!	2006-07-27	4	3	1
078886047X	Sin City	A1AUOVXPT5MYX4	"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx"""	"Whether you like it or whether you don't, if you like movies, you ""must see"" this film. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: ""Spiderman 2"", or ""Sin City"". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as ""literal truth"" as ""Spiderman 2"", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as ""Sin City"", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling ""American Splendor"", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after ""Frank Miller's Sin City"". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original ""Star Wars"" was in its day."	4.0	This is a great movie	2007-03-13	9	4	5

078886047X	Sin City	AV1R199BSRBL6	"A. Knepper ""StAr_review"""	"I'm absolutely stunned at the rave reviews this absurdity has recieved. This movie was comedic where it tried to be serious, it was inexplicable when it should have been realistic, and it was above all irritating to watch. Everyone I was with came to that same consensus. And don't think I'm some thirty-five-year-old uncultured religious fundamentalist whining about violence and sex in movies. I'm a fifteen-year-old guy who went to the movie with other fifteen and sixteen year old guys.First, the good. If all you care about in a movie is hot women, you've got it covered. The style that the movie was shot in was also quite entertaining. It was certainly a feast for the eyes, which makes me wonder if the critics are that easily swayed by a new idea to give a movie a shining review. If it weren't for the splashes of brilliant color in between all the grey, would the critics have thought it was such a great, groundbreaking movie? No. They would have said it was inexplicable and humorous, such as I. Now let me move on to the truly awful:Can someone please explain to me why after the main character in the middle segment got ran over by a car twice, shot with a gun over and over and over again, and punched out, he can still get back up and walk around shooting people. No, not just shooting people-killing them instantly with one shot! Does anyone else see the inconsistency here? Also, was it truly necessary to have an incapacitated head start speaking in the middle of a serious action sequence? Was that meant to be a joke? I couldn't tell.Furthermore, isn't the ""hookers run this city and have a pact with the police"" thing a little cliche and played out? Also, the pulling off of penises made me want to gag.The acting was horrendous, but what else should you expect from Brittany Murphy, Taryn Manning and Jessica Alba? Even Bruce Willis, a favorite of mine, disappointed (For a good new Bruce flick, catch ""Hostage"").Without it's stylized directing and visuals, it would be dubbed a piece of crap by the critics and by audiences alike.But, you could still go for a good laugh, I guess.Grade: D-Cliche-filled cheese."	1.0	The Worst Movie I've Seen This Year	2005-04-09	48	19	29

Hey, that's okay, comic books are now in style and it seems as if a comic book movie is coming out every other month, with a fantasy movie coming out in the months between.  Having said that, I will also say I don't like a movie because it fits that criteria.  Two examples would be ""Hellboy"" and ""Daredevil""...two movies which could have been better but were unfortunately lacking.  This all leads me to ""Sin City"".  This movie is amazing.  You either love it or you hate it, I guess.  I loved it.  It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels.  A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie.  Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here.  The recut, extended, unrated DVD is also amazing.  I'm not going to admit that I (cough) pirate movies, but my normal DVD attitude is ""why buy the cow...""  Well folks, this is a cow worth buying.  If you loved the movie, you'll love the DVD.

Consistently sharp, contrasty as hell with solid ""BLACK"" blacks, no evidence of grain or compression artifacts, and no bleeding whatsoever...it's a SOLID performance from Mirimax/Dimension.

Overall, this is a faultless presentation.Video: 5/5Audio:The sound on this baby packs quite a punch, and right from the word go you'll be pleasantly surprised. Make sure you crank this up to full volume, as it deserves this experience to be fully appreciated. Overall, a nice job boys.Audio 4.5/5Extras:Now, this is the first UMD disc that i own, to spoil you with more than just your usual trailers.

078886047X	Sin City	A15GYIWLUP59RU	Alex Antonopoulos	I have read the graphic novels ''Hard goodbyes'',''A dame to kill for'',and ''The big fat kill'',and sure,the last one was the best comic I have ever read(and I'm a comic collector,so imagine),but I never expected this...I mean,this was just too good to be true.When I saw the trailer,I thought Robert Rodriguez wouldn't do much to the film,since this is a straight adaptation from the comics.I sure was wrong.Robert's genuine raises this film into the highest level it could go.The scene directed by Quentin Tarantino isn't as violent as I expected(which I believe that it's a good thing),and surely not as other scenes in the film.Yes,the violence gets kinda freaky at some points,but never over the edge.And the characters?Man,what a bunch of wonderfull characters!Marv is a good guy in a sinfull city,making his beast come out of him,but only on the bad guys.Never on the good guys.Esspecialy the ladys.Kevin is a phycopath,who only recognises one man as a friend,as a guide.All the others...he just wants to eat them.Justifying his terrible acts with the connection that he supposedly gets from God,he has no guilt for his victims.Dwight is also a good guy,trying to protect the girls of Sin City.A good guy who starts getting mad because of the sin all around him.Gayle,although she may seem like a woman full of anger,is really keeping this anger for the protection of the other girls.Overall,she would sacrifice herself for them.Jackie Boy is a typical hypocrite,doing some really bad things,and then telling himself that he's a good guy.Hartigan is the most innocent of all the men in the film,a man with honour and umbelievable self-sacrifice.Nancy is the most innocent girl in the film,a person that sees Hartigan as a father and a lover figure at the same time.All those characters make the best film that I have ever seen 'till now.A comic book on screen.A film-noir to beat all other films.A legend.You will all recognise your character in Sin City.Your character might be Hartigan,might be Dwight,might be Nancy,Marv,Jackie Boy,heck,it might as well be Kevin!But you will find yourself.Because,as Marv greatly puts it:''Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything''.	5.0	Wow...	2005-06-29	3	2	1
078886047X	Sin City	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	One way that this film does this is by digitally affecting the film by providing it with unnatural color schemes that are identical to the ones in the graphic novels.  Now, the reality of the movie/genre/graphic novels, is a kind of hyper realism that doesn't feel realistic (this is fictional after all) although you know that some of the things that happen in the movie could happen and the film plays with these conventions well.  Noir is a genre that takes the audience into the mind of an everyday person and shows how they can be corrupted by sin, but still being a conflicted and basically good until their sin is found out and they're destoyed.  Well, in this movie there aren't many of these characters, most of them are sinners and gladly and accept the consequences indefinitely.  This is where the movie is the most interesting in the way that the color scheme both allows the action to go to extremes and get away with it because it presents an unreality and if you choose to view the perspective of the movie/graphic novel as the dream world of gritty noir characters than you have a good idea of what the film is like.  What's unexpected are how many portions of this film are so darkly humorous like when Benicio Del Toro's character is being drowned in the toilet by Clive Owen, it's completely unrealistic and we laugh at his plight because he deserves it and will do anything to get out of it, anything short of apologizing and backing off.  Yes, although this color scheme helps the film get past its aggressive, super-violent and gruesome content that doesn't mean you don't feel the effects of it.  They are still there, but you are always aware of the unreality and that somewhat deadens the effect and probably likens your reaction to the way the characters feel.  I felt the movie was as true to the graphic novels as possible even going as far as to call the movie plagiarism (That would be if Frank Miller weren't as involved as he is).  The movie is brilliant, if viscerally so, but although it is based on a graphic novel and anything slightly animated is bound to attract kids, this film is anything, but for kids.  I've mentioned the violent content without going into the more bloody details, but the sex is just as present and I'm not sure this dreamworld is one that you want your kids to know about yet, at least until they're older and have a better understanding of classic film noir, because as I said before this is a tribute and at the same time it's an update of the genre. Enjoy at your own risk.  By the way, I just have to give a shout out to Mickey Rourke who put in a great performance.  It's so big that it's almost too much for the rest of this film to stand up to.  I'm glad to see that he can still be used to great effect in films.	5.0	It succeeds in presenting and commenting on the genre of film noir	2005-08-10	4	2	2

078886047X	Sin City	AGEIT17HENDIS	Alfred Johnson	"No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, &lt;em>femme fatale&lt;/em> to muddy the waters also get a pass. Of course when I think of noir it is 1940s-50s noir, black and white in film and in the good guys-bad guys constellation with a little murder and mayhem mixed in to keep one's eyes open just in case there is no &lt;em>femme fatale &lt;/em>to muddy the waters. Neo-noir, such as the film under review, Sin City, is another matter, perhaps. Here's the why of the perhaps.Central to the old time &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> was the notion that crime did not pay and as stated above the bad guy(s) learned that lesson the hard way after a little mussing up or a date with a bullet. Kids' stuff really when compared to the over-the-top action of this three vignettes series on modern day good guys versus bad guys. Three separate male characters, all tough guys and guys you would want to have at your back if real trouble headed your way, are trying, trying within the parameters of common sense or believability, to clean up slices of Sin City. Sin City as the rather obvious name implies, is in the grips of corruption from the top down, including in virtually every civic institution. Our avengers are trying to cut a wedge into that bad karma by individually, one, tracking down a bizarre, politically connected heir whose thing was slice and dice of very young girls, two, avenge the death of a high class call girl who was kind to one tough guy, and, three, keep the pimps and cops at bay in the red light district where the working girls have set up their own Hookers' Commune.All of this doing good is, of necessity in today's movie world, linked up with, frankly, over the top use of violence of all sorts from cannibalism to barbaric death sentences, well beyond what tame old time noir warranted. Apparently the succeeding crime waves since the 1940s have upped the ante and something like total war is required to exterminate the villains. That and some very up-to-date use of cinematography to give a gritty black and white feel to the adventures. And also a not small dose of magical realism, suspension of disbelief, and sparseness of language to go along with the plot and visual action.But here is the funny thing, funny for an old-time crime noir aficionado, I really liked this film. Why? Well go back to the old time crime noir premise. Good guys (and then it was mostly guys- here some very wicked ""dames"" join in and I know I would not want to cross them, no way) pushed their weight around or tilted at windmills for cheap dough or maybe a little kiss. They got mussed, up, trussed up, busted up in the cause of some individual justice drive that drove the ""better angels of their natures."" Guess what, sixty years later, a thousand years advanced cinematically, a million years advanced socially (maybe) and these guys are still chasing windmills. Nice, right."	5.0	Out In The  2000s Crime Noir Night	2011-07-18	4	0	4
078886047X	Sin City	A39IBJB2PBVC7I	Alistair McHarg	"When the tv show Miami Vice first became popular, a colleague described it to me as the ""triumph of style over substance."" What he meant was that the window dressing - clothes, cars, music, setting - was more important than the stories.Today this phenomenon is so familiar that we frequently confuse veneer with content, especially in cases where there is no content - read Paris Hilton among others. In Sin City you find the full flower of this evolution.Rodriguez has taken the two-dimensional comic images of Frank Miller, (in combination with the one-dimensional characters and plots), and succeeded in making them even more two-dimensional. The film is visually mesmerizing, a spellbinding combination of heavily made-up actors, digital backgrounds, and high-tech special effects. It has the flatness of a comic, and like a comic, it is impenetrable.So compelling is the visual style achieved here that you quickly forget that the plots are moronic, the characters both ludicrous and repulsive, the reliance on exhausted stereotypes pitiful, and the entire vibe simultaneously decadent and corrupt on one hand, on the other self-satisfied and smug.Sin City is a place where everyone is guilty, every day is dark, and every problem is solved through violence. Rodriguez and Tarantino are still the two bad 12-year olds who must be separated because they are disruptive to the rest of the class.If you want to see another example of what happens when these two miscreants collaborate, check out From Dusk Till Dawn, a film which certainly has earned a place on any Worst Movies Of All Time list."	5.0	The Triumph Of Style Over Substance	2006-01-09	6	2	4

078886047X	Sin City	A37PV5GMP2ILJC	Amanda Richards	"To understand and appreciate this movie you'll need a little background information.  First of all, it's not one story, but a combination of three stories from the graphic novels of the same name, with a short clip from another story as an introduction.The introductory skit, starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, is from ""The Customer is Always Right"", the others being ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"".Shot in a way that is as close to the original comics as possible, the movie is in black and white, except for certain highlighted objects in the frames that are vividly colored in stark contrast.  Without significant amounts of nudity, it earns its rating because of the violence which is central to the plots, and boy, does that white blood flow and fly.The movie smells of Tarantino, but he only directs one small, and of course totally weird, bit, the majority being done by Robert Rodriguez, and Frank Miller, author of the novels.Each segment is illuminated by star power such as Jessica Alba (Nancy), Rosario Dawson (great as Gail), Benicio Del Toro (outstanding as Jackie Boy), Michael Clark Duncan (Manute), Carla Gugino (Lucille), Rutger Hauer (Cardinal Roark), Jaime King (Goldie/Wendy), Michael Madsen (brilliant as Bob), Brittany Murphy (Shellie), Clive Owen (Dwight), Mickey Rourke (brilliant as Marv), Elijah Wood (creepy as Kevin) and not forgetting Bruce Willis (Hartigan), in one of his best performances ever.  I also liked Devon Aoki as ""Miho"" whose role brought back memories of Kill Bill and the Crazy 88.Without knowing the source, the movie would be a bit confusing, as characters can be seen appearing in all three stories, and after a while, some of the female stars start looking alike.  There's nothing light about this movie, and it may not be for everybody, but the action keeps coming and the blood keeps pumping, and it's hard to look away.Amanda Richards, September 24, 2005"	4.0	"A ""3 in 1"" festival of violence"	2005-09-24	5	4	1

078886047X	Sin City	A2T5Y2NYFIY62Z	Amazon Customer	Sin City is a guilty pleasure, plain and simple.  It features some pretty bad acting at times (cough Jessica Alba cough), and some laughable special effects.  That being said, it features an art style that is absolutely gorgeous and storylines that are engrossing.  Sin City is filmed to look like a comic book come to life, and in that goal, it succeeds.  The black and white mixed with limited and strategic coloring is beautiful on screen and is visually one of the most unique movies ever made.The film is broken up into four stories that all stand on their own but are connected to each other to create a complete experience.  I watched the extended cut which actually separates all of the stories and has you watch them one at a time, instead of being all cut together like in the original release.  I actually prefer and recommend the original, theatrical version over the separated extended cut.  The original cut put the scenes in the order that the directors intended you to view them.  You lose that creativity in the extended cut resulting in a less satisfying experience.Even though there is some questionable acting at times, Sin City is a one of a kind experience featuring a strong narrative, brutal violence, and some unforgettable characters.	4.0	A Bloody Good Time	2014-04-01	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A3MA7SDWD1HJE5	Amazon Customer	I saw this film in the theater and hated it. It came off like a teenage boy trying hard to write a Tarantino script. Everything the two bumbling henchmen said struck me like the guy who wrote it was writing it just so people would have something to quote from the movie.The multiple dismemberment or castration scenes were just pointless and ridiculous. When someone has their genitals pulled off and it bores you, you know there's something wrong. It seemed like the point was to be shocking and cutting edge, but like I said, they missed the mark here and I was really just tired of it by the time the ninja prostitute showed up.I will say that I really liked the cinematography. The look of the movie was great, and that was the part (going into it) that I thought I'd like the least, but it ended up working very well. I would have rather seen them only use color at certain times or for highlighting important things to the audience, instead of just randomly giving a guy red shoes, but I guess that's okI thought the camera angles, the way the shots were framed, all that was needlessly repetative (6 or 7 shots with a thonged woman's butt in the left foreground, and the person talking in the right background, for instance), but no more so than the actual script, so maybe that's not something anyone else cares about	1.0	Trying Too Hard	2005-06-20	34	15	19
078886047X	Sin City	ABUQ780GW5ELG	"Amazon Customer ""immortal74205"""	"Sin City is the best film of 2005 (with the exception maybe of 'Star Wars Episode III'). Rodriguez, Miller, and Tarantino do a fantastic job of bringing a visual masterpiece to film. The movie behaves as though you're watching the graphic novel (which I think was the point). Bruce Willis leads an all-star cast as a cop with a bum ticker and ready to retire. Mickey Rourke does the best job in the film as the vicious animal Marv, who is out to avenge the death of a hooker he barely knows. The film is split into four main stories. The first is the story of a man (Josh Hartnett) who courts young women, then kills them.  The second is Hartigan's story (Willis), where he is after a kidnapper and murder of young girls. Then we have Marv's story, which deals with a creepy and sadistic Elijah Wood. The final story is 'A Dame to Kill For,' where Dwight (Clive Owen) must try to stop a creep (Benicio Del Toro) from hurting the local group of hookers with his gang. This one is the third best story. The Marv story is the best, then Hartigan's then Dwight's, then the Man's story (which is the shortest). They pretty much all interact with each other as well, even though they are each stand alone stories. There is lots and lots and lots of violence, and plenty of nudity (especially on the part of Carla Gugino, ""Spy Kids""). Definitely get this one!"	5.0	Best film of the year	2005-08-31	9	3	6

As a fan who has read all three of those stories many, many times, I simply felt that the proper titles should have been given, since the editorial review, and another review mixed up the titles.  Marv was in ""Sin City"", Hartigan was in ""That Yellow Bastard"" and Dwight was from ""The Big, Fat Kill"".  Unfortunately, this was not a direct translation, and as always, the books are far better.  I look forward to the director's cut to see if some of my favorite lines that were absent make it in.

078886047X	Sin City	A1ZOF747O5EB6R	Andrew Desmond	"""Sin City"" is a comic book on a big screen.  Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.A synopsis of ""Sin City"" would probably be that all the violence, the plots and the characters cannot be believed at the end of the day.  Rather, the viewer is dwelling in the world of comics where heroes can take a terrible beating but still return for more and the characters are nastier, meaner and more unrelenting than could ever be the case in real life.I saw this film with my 18 year old son who believed it to be the most violent movie he had ever seen.  To an extent he was right although this ignores the fact that the characters were part of a modern world comic strip.  Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.""Sin City"" has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.  Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.  It may be a woman's eyes, it may be her dress or it may be the skin colour of a baddie.  On this scale, ""Sin City"" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer.  There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time."	4.0	More Surreal Than Real	2005-07-21	4	3	1
078886047X	Sin City	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	`Sin City' is a film you will either love or hate.  There is a lot going on and sometimes it gets hard to figure out who is doing what but if you slip into the mode that is `Sin City' is will all put itself together for you.  You just have to want to `get' this movie.  I wanted to `get' this movie, and you know what, I did, and with each and every watch through I `get' it even more.  The fact remains that Sin City is above and beyond brilliant film making.  It's visually stunning and completely captures the imagery that Frank Miller created with his graphic novels.  It's dark, gritty and aggressive; violent and seductive.  `Sin City' is an amalgam of everything that makes `sin' in general so grotesque.  In other words, it's the dark underbelly of a life all too often glamorized.`Sin City' takes three stories from the `Sin City' alumni and interweaves them throughout one another to create the appearance of one long story.  The three stories used (`The Hard Good-Bye', `The Big Fat Kill' & `That Yellow B*****') all feature some strong if not flawed characters that have a habit of making some very poor decisions.  What is strange though is that we form attachments to these characters despite their behavior and we find ourselves rooting for them in the long run.  You see, despite their flaws and transgressions they are victims themselves and warrant our support.The acting is spot on for the type of film that this is.  I've heard some friends talking about the cheesy dialog and the wooden acting but what they fail to realize is that this is a comic book adaptation and it takes that very literally.  Robert Rodriguez brilliantly crafted a world that is so similar to the one Miller created frame for frame it feels like reading a comic, like peering into Miller's graphic novels.  The acting thus corresponds with this vision.  The dialog is at times even word for word from the books, and the way the characters respond and or interact is classic comic exaggeration.  It all comes together to create the perfect backdrop for the film.Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and especially Mickey Rourke nail their performances, adding depth to the film as a whole.  Jessica Alba actually pulls out her finest performance to date (who would have guessed it) and made me proud, and I think she's nothing more than a hard body so she took me by surprise.  Elijah Wood is effectively creepy, something I didn't think he had in him, and his character stayed with me long after the credits were rolled.  As a whole the performances are strong and are all memorable, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson coming to mind as key supporting players who make an impact.Yes, there are flaws to be found within `Sin City' but to me they are few and far in between.  I love what Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino were able to accomplish here and I eagerly await their efforts with `Sin City 2'.  If they are even half as successful with the second act I will be a happy man.  So just sit back and absorb the imagery for even if `Sin City' is not you cup of tea you can't help but admire the art that is set before you with each passing frame.	5.0	Picture book perfection; a film that stands out as unique and exciting...	2007-11-19	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"I had been waiting to see this movie for months now, and I was afraid that it would disappoint me like some other movies that I have really looked forward to lately (namely The Phantom Menace and Matrix: Reloaded).  So myself and three friends went to see it earlier, and when it ended, I thought one thing: WOW!  This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone-induced action.WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!Robert Rodriguez co-directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a ""Special Guest Director"") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever.  In fact, Rodriguez sees this film as a translation rather than an adaptation.There really isn't a central plot; rather, the movie is about 3 seperate stories that share certain characters and all take place in Basin City, the most morally bankrupt town ever, which rightfully earns the nickname Sin City.  To call this an all-star cast would be an understatement.  Some of the many actors included in this film are: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Britanny Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Jamie King, Marley Shelton, and Rosario Dawson (yeah, I know that's a lot), and while some of them have very small roles (Wood and Aoki have no dialogue, although neither of them have a small part), all of them are pitch-perfect in their roles.The movie begins with a short segment entitled ""The Customer is Always Right"", with Harnett as The Salesman and Shelton as The Customer.  Up next, is the set-up for ""That Yellow Bastard"", a story about Jim Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a bad heart who is trying to bust the son (Stahl) of a powerful Senator (Boothe) who likes to rape little girls.  Next is ""A Hard Goodbye"", a tale about a huge brute named Marv (Rourke) who falls hard for a beauty named Goldie (King).  They share a passionate night together, but Marv awakes to find Goldie dead in their bed.  A search for ""justice"" ensues, with Marv beating the life out of anyone who has information on the hit.  The story also has Gugino as Lucille, Marv's parole officer, Wood as Kevin, an amazingly gifted killer, Hauer as Cardinal Roarke (the brother of the Senator from ""Yellow Bastard""), and Sin City creator Frank Miller as a priest.  The second story is called ""The Big Fat Kill"".  It deals with Dwight (Owen), an ex-photographer (this isn't explained in the film, but there is a graphic novel that sets up the Dwight character prior to the events of this story) and now a sort of mercenary who goes to Olde Towne to help defend Gail (Dawson) and her fellow prostitutes from Jackie Boy (del Toro), a deranged maniac with a penchant for violence against women.  This segment also has Murphy as Dwight's girlfriend Shellie, Bledel and Aoki as fellow hookers Becky and Miho (deadly little Miho), and Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, a hired goon for an unnamed mobster.  Finally, ""That Yellow Bastard"" is the last major story.  It picks up after the events of the previous part of the segment.  Hartigan has been sent to prison, because Senator Roarke spun things to make it appear as if he raped little Nancy (played by Alba in her adult incarnation).  Believing Nancy to be caught by Roarke's men, Hartigan gets out and seeks her out to protect her again from people who want revenge upon him for killing (?) Roarke's son.These stories are extremely gritty, violent, and even a little depressing.  (SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is ""The Big Fat Kill"".  There are scenes involving shootings, stabbings, decapitation (or almost so), even cannibalism.  One guy even gets his genitals ripped off.  Also, there is a lot of full frontal nudity (although, from what I understand, nowhere near as much as there was in the books).  So if you feel in any way uncomfortable with any of the above-mentioned things, avoid this movie.  If not, then I highly suggest seeing this film.As I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.  I can hardly think of anyone else who could fill the roles of any characters in this movie.  Although, I must say that Willis, Wood, Aoki, Dawson, and Rourke were the big standouts in my mind (even though, as I stated earlier, Wood and Aoki have no dialogue).  Speaking of dialogue, under any other circumstances, the dialogue in this film would be terrible.  However, the actors and situations make it awesome.  Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing.The visuals are stunning.  The film is shot almost completely in black and white.  Although, every now and then, there are splashes of color (certain cars, Dwight's shoes, women's eyes and hair, one of the villains).  Also, many of the shots mirror the panels from the comics.With all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2-hour thrill ride.  Once again, if you don't mind excessive violence, I would highly suggest seeing this movie."	5.0	Sinfully Awesome	2005-04-01	13	11	2

Unfortunately Dwight's(Clive Owen) story was a real drag(thus why I give this 4 stars instead of 5 and why I say I liked this movie for the most part). I was so bored at that part and was glad it wasn't the last story. That would have been really bad to end the movie with that story. And the prostitutes were annoying too. But if I just ignore that part and focus on the rest of the movie I really really liked it even if it was violent and a ""guy flick""(naked girls). I recommend this movie to adults only and those who don't care about violence, nudity, and swearing. If you are a parent and you let your kid watch this you are one messed up parent! This is totally NOT a kid flick! And it does deserve it's ""R"" rating and 18 years and up warning!"	4.0	Interesting and different.	2005-07-15	4	2	2

078886047X	Sin City	A1534MBU6VJXYN	"Anthony Nasti ""Tony"""	"""Sin City"", Robert Rodriguez's ""translation"" of Frank Miller's classic graphic novel series, is not a film for everyone. It's the type of film you either love or hate, no in between.""Sin City"" is, in more ways than one, like ""Pulp Fiction"". Both films have oodles of violence, a large ensemble cast (even ""PF'S own Bruce Willis has a role), and even Quentin Tarrentino himself directs a sequence. ""Sin City"" also uses ""Pulp Fiction's"" method of combining several different stories into one movie.The first story deals with grizzled veteran cop detective Hartigan (Willis), who is searching for little Nancy Callahan, an 11 year old girl who has been kidnapped by the sadistic son (Nick Stahl) of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan manages to save little Nancy, but when his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) seemingly turns the table, it looks as if Hartigan is done for.The next story focuses on Marv (Mickey Rourke). Marv is a hardened ex con trying to go straight with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Carla Cugino). One night, he meets Goldie (Jaime King). Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him. However, that night, Goldie is murdered in Marv's bed. This was done naturally to frame Marv. Determined to clear his name, Marv is led through a wild maze to find who killed Goldie, seeking the help of her twin sister Wendy (King). He is led to Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role that will make you forget that this is the same guy who played Frodo), a sadistic cannibal who preys on prostitutes. He manages to defeat Kevin, but in order to protect the ones he loves, Marv is forced to turn himself in and give up his life.The next story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen), who has recently hooked up with hyperactive barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy). When Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) pays a little visit and roughs Shellie up, Dwight seeks revenge. He is led to Oldtown, where he runs into Gail (Rosario Dawson), an old flame and leader of a brigade of prostitutes. A shootout between the cops, Jackie Boy and his gang means a war between the cops and the mob in Oldtown. Determined to stop it before it happens, Dwight drives the bodies out to an abandoned tar pit. However, before he gets there, local crime boss Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) gets wind of this, and sends his men out to kill him. He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter. This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.The fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter. Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over. But he soon learns that Roark's son, whom he thought he killed, has resurfaced, and is out to finish the job. He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her. This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.To put in simple terms, ""Sin City"" is an excellent movie. It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well. This two disc special edition is loaded with bonus features and is a dvd that belongs in your collection."	5.0	"The ""Pulp Fiction"" Of Comic Book Movies"	2006-01-14	2	2	0
078886047X	Sin City	A1BEYB12OGFPHB	Anthony Regolino	"First, 2 words on the SPFX and the way it's filmed: SO WHAT? Would you eat a plate of crap & onions at a fancy restaurant just because they pretty it up? No, and so too should you not assign artistic merit to this kind of crap just because of how it's filmed. I will only be addressing the (lack of) quality in the story, which tops John Waters' A Dirty Shame for stupidest movie of the year award. Don't think I'm offended at all by the violence; I grew up on a daily diet of slasher films and action movies, thrilling over beheadings and such. But unless you're 12 years old, there's nothing much to interest anyone of average intelligence or maturity. And the nudity isn't even satisfying. Frank Miller in interviews looks like one of those scary gunshop owners who are obsessed with conspiracy theories and Nam, and I suppose this film reflects what results from giving someone like that the funds to write and direct a movie. I'm utterly embarrassed for the actors in it, some of whom are ordinarily good if given decent dialog and characters--not here obviously! And the virtual reality/video game action scenes are an insult to one's intelligence. Having someone get hit by a car a few times, get up and brush it off only works for superheroes. And stepping off a ledge and landing on one's feet also requires superhuman ability, as in Underworld where it is filmed much better and looks way cooler. The only thing I liked was how they reworded ""filmed and edited by"" as ""shot and cut by"" in the opening credits, reflecting the violent nature of the film. But it went all downhill from there."	1.0	Perhaps the only review that attacks this film	2005-08-31	47	22	25
078886047X	Sin City	A3JVF9Y53BEOGC	Anthony Thompson	This movie is beautiful, ugly, touching and shocking all at once. From the moment it starts, it has you in it's grip and won't let you go. It is unlike anything seen before. It is intense. It is violent. And it's tone is very dark. But it's passion draws you in. And the physical world that Frank Miller created has been faithfully reproduced by Robert Rodriguez and his team. This is a landmark movie. And the performance by Mickey Rourke as Marv is Oscar-caliber. He has vindicated those of us who have always believed he was a great actor in the tradition of Brando and DeNiro.	5.0	Rourke is back!	2005-07-02	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	A29Y34ALWJUGB5	"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment"""	I found this a very difficult movie to rate. I wanted so badly to give it a five because of the movie itself, but I also wanted to give the Unrated edition a three for the package, as it is very disappointing. So, I settled on a solid four. Here's why.Firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent. It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike. Sin City doesn't even try to explain itself. The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick. It's filled to the brim with Arnold-esque one-liners. The surreal style of this film makes all the characters seem like super heroes of sorts (not strange, considering Frank Miller, the god of American comics, created this series). In fact, everything that happens in this movie would make other movies bad. Who wants to listen to the thoughts of a character, something that's usually left in books? Yet in Sin City it words. Who still likes Arnold one-liners, what with all those Arnold impressions going on anymore? Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans. Who wants surrealism in their movies? Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people. All this comes together to make Sin City the all-time greatest comic-book movie.Now, for the Sin City Uncut edition, the only true bonus here is the graphic novel, which I have yet to read myself (review coming later). It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book. After that, there is little to keep my interest. Some of the special features found here should have been included in the first edition of Sin City, which I foolishly wasted my money on not knowing this edition was coming. Plus, unless you watch both versions of the movie back to back, you'll never be able to tell which scenes were added. The breakdown of stories so that you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything. It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who has the original version. If you don't have that version, however, pick this up quick. It is still a superior version, only not by much.	4.0	The Special Edition Sin City	2005-12-27	8	6	2

078886047X	Sin City	A21M7JSRRQFC0G	A On Amazon	They had genious advertising for this movie (which is what got me highly intrigued in the first place). The trailer song was hot, and the actual visuals on the trailer were good as well. I'm actually surprised because comic books and these types of movies do not really interest me but there was something that really made me want to see the movie. I'm glad I went to see it. At first when I walked out of the theatre I didn't know what to think, but I realized I really liked the movie. The picture and visuals worked really well. The movie was in black and white, but there were occasional clever uses of color (blue eyes, red lips, yellow face, etc). It was really much like a comic book made to life. I can't imagine how much work this must have taken. Some of the dialogue might have been a little cornballish, but I can imagine this is the case because it seems like this movie was supposed to be set in a different time, so the talking was a bit different. Some people may find it really violent but I didn't. So if you are really put off by violent scenes and such, be cautioned. There are three different stories in this movie... I thought the acting was really well done and I happened to like most of the characters. I think the character that surprised me the most was Elijah Wood's. Elijah Wood plays an unusual character...very much unlike Frodo. Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke also contribute some good acting. Other actors in this movie include Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki and Bruce Willis among many others. A highly attractive cast in this movie which also adds to the glamorous visuals. Most likely you will end up having a favorite character. I'd certainly recommend seeing the film. If you liked the movies Kill Bill, or most movies of that kind, or you are also a comic book fan, then I think you would appreciate it. It's not built like your average Hollywood movie.	4.0	Ok...Wow	2005-06-27	2	1	1

078886047X	Sin City	A3ZM7BO3TWS08	Ardbeg	Yes, the violence is completely over the top and sensational. Yes, it is difficult to believe that a single man could take on a squad of fully armored riot police and win.  These are not what make this movie what it is.  What makes this movie one of the best I have seen in years lies in three areas:The first is believability of character.  I never onced doubted the  truth of these characters, definitely a testament to the skill of the actors involved.The second is a distinct and totally immersive style.  The colors the lighting all serve to bring you completely into Sin City.  This is due mainly to the films close adherence to the books it was based on. In fact with the exception of a few lines of dialog , Director Robert Rodriguez could not have adhered more closely to the comics.The third, and most important to me, is the completely real morality of this movie.  Morality in life is never black and white, although we might like it to be, it is always shades of gray.  This departure from your standard hollywood trash really puts this one over into 5star category.  This is one case where ambiguous is not a bad thing.  They are not all bad and they are not all good, they fall right in where the rest of us are.As for the DVD itself, it comes with a very interesting behind the scenes featurette with cast interviews.  The DVD also shipped to me with a limited edition slipcover which is definitely an incentive to order early.In summary this film has incredible style, raw emotion and a refreshing realistic morality. All of which serves to make this one of the best films to come out in any category in the past several years.5 out of 5!	5.0	Exceptional	2005-09-21	3	1	2
078886047X	Sin City	A3ONCOK36KPOV8	A Reviewer	"Sin City is a visually striking film. It fully succeeds in capturing the feel of the graphic novel it is based on and of Film Noir in general. The acting is also good, within the limitations of the comic book-style chosen by the film-maker. The interlinked stories are well told. Some of the comments of previous reviewers are, however, puzzling. For example, in a film which is filled with eye-gouging, torture, mutilations, and amputations, not a few reviewers found time to comment on the ""graphic nudity"", which consisted of a couple of brief, shadowy shots of breasts. One aspect of American Culture I have always found puzzling is the propensity to view the most ghastly and sadistic forms of violence as ""good wholesome entertainment"" while a glimpse of an exposed nipple on television sends the whole nation into hysterics. Don't get me wrong, I love this country, but that is a bit of a paradox. A second odd comment I've seen concerns the supposed mysogyny of this film. Yes, most of the female characters are prostitutes, but the film is about the underbelly of society. Most of these women are portrayed as intelligent, strong, and perfectly capable of defending themselves. They are actually shown in a far more positive light than any of the male characters, who are almost universally portrayed as brutal, sadistic cavemen who are apparently obsessed with attacking other men's genitals. If anything, the film is more anti-male (mysandrous?) than mysogynistic."	4.0	Good Film-Some Odd Reviewer Comments	2005-08-26	3	3	0

I read the comics and Mickey Rourke did an excellent job as Marv.  It was like I was reading the comics all over again it was amazing the way that they put the books on screen.  The cast in this was amazing Jessica Alba as Nancy, Elijah Wood as the sick and twisted killer Kevin, Bruce Willis as the troubled cop Hartigan, Benicio del Toro, Jamie King as Goldie, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy as Bencio's ex girlfriend, Clive Owen as her new boyfriend, Josh Hartnett as the assassin, Devin Aoki as Miho, Alexis Bledel as Becky (I loved her eyes), Frank Miller did appear in this as a priest, all in all I loved the cast.  Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller did an excellent job I have never seen anything truer to a book before.This is NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN.

It was too long and too boring. This movie is more for the guys because there is so much female nudity, i as a female, do not care if a film has nudity, but this film as unneccisary nudity. The lack of a plot really made this movie make me want to leave the theater, i could not wait until it was over. it is very comic book style, because the action, and blood bath scenes look so fake and ridiculous. Certain actors like Elijah Wood, do not fit the role they were cast in. in all, the acting, no plot and no story, and the unneccisary nudity makes this film an utter piece of mindless trash.	1.0	The longest peice of trash not to see	2005-07-14	108	7	101

Other than that, this movie is fantastic and everything a comic book movie should be. You say it is too gory? It is rated R for a reason and if you were to read the comics, they are exactly the same way.

An instant classic, like  Pulp Fiction on mescaline but at the same time standing by itself as possibly the best comic book adaptation. I have all the confidence in the world saying that because watching this film is like watching the graphic novel come to life. You hear critics say that about countless adaptations, but with this one, that statemant is about as literal as it gets.The city itself is amazingly constructed, the characters are legendary and lovable, just about every one of them's bad news and has some sort of psychological defect, whether its delusional psychosis, Mania, or Sadism or all three or even more. The story and dialouge arent necessarily original or even serious, but its not really meant to be, this film is a valentine to the noir and pulp comics of the golden age. The cinematography is as brilliant as it is beautiful. I truly can't describe at all how great it all is, you just have to sit down and take it all in for yourself, though not recommended for the kiddies, since each scene is riddled with ultra-violence and T&A; galore.quite simply, a movie miracle, 'nuff said...	5.0	I could give it 1000 stars more...	2005-07-03	5	3	2
078886047X	Sin City	A1WB5NZYY5XR8A	"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col..."	"Good things come to those who wait. And it's been a long wait to see Frank Miller's Sin City come to the big screen. As an avid fan of all the original Sin City graphic novels, and indeed anything by Frank Miller, the wait was almost too long.When I heard Robert Rodriguez had snatched the rights to do the film I was both disappointed and intrigued. Frank Miller's Sin City books had been a hot commodity in Hollywood for some time, but Miller is one of those oh-so-rare artist who'd rather see the integrity of the work be upheld than make a quick buck. He knew Hollywood would never tell his stories his way. So how did Rodriguez, the Hollywood maverick who built his success off the Spy Kids franchise, land the rights? By adapting one of Miller's short stories into a 5-minute film complete with full special effects and a name actor in Josh Hartnett. Miller who is reputed to have said something along the lines of, ""this isn't a test screening, this is the opening of the film,"" was immediately sold on the project. Such was his dedication to bringing Miller's vision to the screen that he made Miller co-director of the film losing his DGA membership in the process.In the post-Lord of the Rings era we've seen what a small-time director can do with passion, dedication, and most importantly, a love of the source material. Peter Jackson did it, and Sam Raimi is re-affirming it with Spider-man. Would Robert Rodriguez be next? Yes and no.Sin City is an almost panel for panel direct adaptation of three of Frank Miller's graphic novels (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard). In it's accuracy, Rodriguez's dedication to the material is clear. But where Frank Miller is a master of visual storytelling (in his medium), Rodriguez is not. Where Frank Miller is a master of written dialogue, the delivery of the same words in the film comes off corny at times. There's a part where Michael Madsen delivers some lines so bad you'll swear you've seen better in an elementary school play. And I fault the directing for that.As long as you understand you aren't watching Raging Bull (probably the last great black & white film) and that this is fiction at it's pulpiest, you'll discover the film isn't bad. But it isn't for everyone. Sin City chock full of gun-toting machoism and boob-showing sexism, and I suspect many of the female persuasion won't get as much out of it as we men. But that's a good thing for those of us who don't want to see our films made metro-sexual. And when I say macho, I don't mean crap like Steven Seagal movies or all these new movies with gangsta-rappers who wanna be film stars. Frank Miller digs to the core of the male psyche and unearths real masculinity even if it is taken to the near-absurd by the outlandish characters he creates. Sin City is macho in ways that Hollywood will probably never understand.So is it worth seeing? If you like violent, sexy, noir pulp-fiction then definately. If you like the books, this is about as an accurate translation you've ever could have seen. The only real problem with this film is that Robert Rodriguez is not nearly as skilled in his craft as Frank Miller is in his. Regardless, if there is a sequal, I'll be first in line."	4.0	If only Rodriguez were as good as Miller	2005-04-05	6	3	3

I do have to say though, that this is not a movie for people that don't care for excessive violence and nudity.

078886047X	Sin City	A2TJMNDHSGN3H5	as-seen-on-tv	"Most action films today, or in any day, rely on special effects and explosions more so than plot and character development. Although ""Sin City"" is not a complete exception, it is a stand out from other ""click, click, boom"" action movies.The movie comprises of interlocking stories throughout involving different characters. These stories aren't like ""Seinfeld"" where each of them dose something different that somehow relates to each other and everything is resolved at the end. Much like the story telling of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"", the movie is shown out of sequence, to relate with each character's segment.The acting for the most part is what stood out for me. Excellent performances by Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood, who gives one of the most creepiest villain performances I've seen, without uttering a word.Robert Rodriguez is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. Not only did he co-direct the movie, he ""shot and cut"" it (yes that is an actual credit, just look at the back of the DVD) and directed the music as well. I guess when he made a movie over a decade ago with a $7,000 dollar budget, he knows how to do different jobs.The only fault in ""Sin City"" is that it is hard to have a strong connection with the characters. When one dies, and many do, you don't have such a strong feeling as you would, say if the movie surrounded one character. The only ""main"" character seemed to be Bruce Willis. Yes he seems to be reprising his role from ""Die Hard"", but he dose it well, and for me was the one of the only characters you cared about.Final thought: The movie is not as violent as you are lead to believe. Kill Bill or the Matrix was more violent than Sin City, but the violence is in a ""comic book style"", and to sum up what that means here, the blood is almost entirely white..."	4.0	A very diffrent action film	2005-08-21	7	5	2

It has 3 or four stories that are not hard to follow at all. The action is hardcore and the ladies of Old Town are capital H-O-T. One thing I love is the black and white of the film and how only certain things are in color. Like a red dress, golden hair, blue eyes, and so forth. Just certain features of people and places are in color, which is really cool. Sin City is one of those films that will never get boring or forgotten.	5.0	sin city	2010-08-06	1	1	0
078886047X	Sin City	A2VIBW6JFZ10MQ	Author Ty	"First, let me say that Sin City is the type of movie I normally love to watch---a gritty crime drama that doesn't shy away from realistic language, violence and adult situations in order to create a dark, moody atmosphere.  Second, let me add that I like everyone involved with this film.  I think most of the actors are great, I like just about everything Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino have ever done, and I admire Frank Miller's writing.The bad news, then?  This movie just wasn't very good.The main draw of the film is that it's made to look like a comic book come to life, and in that sense it's a success; the visuals are darkly stunning, and the whole film is, overall, ""cool"" to watch, for want of a better word.  Unfortunately, though, this film is mainly nothing but cliches and tired old story lines about crooked cops, hookers with a heart of gold and rugged detectives that we've seen a million times.  The dialogue is laughably bad and the actors seem stiff and wooden delivering it; you almost feel like you're watching your local middle school putting on a dramatic adaptation of some 1940s black-and-white gangster movie.The movie also goes way, way, way over the top with the violence.  I can watch just about anything and not be bothered, but this film was basically a two-hour barrage of heads being chopped off, men being shot (or stabbed) in the crotch, and other men being turned into swiss cheese by bullets.  When you can't go more than five minutes without showing a bloody killing, you know you've run out of ideas as a filmmaker.Overall, this is the type of movie that 12-year-old boys would see and go ""Wow!

It has excellent performances by a multitude of stars and accurately captures the style and substance of Frank Miller's ""graphic novels.""Yes, it is a ""film noir"" in the extreme and full of gore and violence.  But if you watch it as it is intended -- a larger than life cartoon portrayal -- I think you will enjoy it.I watched the movie again in DVD when it was first released and enjoyed it even more on the second watching as I ""got"" more of the story line the second time around.  Still the original release DVD disappointed due to its lack of special features.The Recut, Extended, Unrated edition more than makes up for the disappointing originial DVD release.  Perhaps most impressive is the presentation of the separate tales in separate segments as they were told in the original Miller works.  This allows each to stand on its own and the addition of more and clarifying footage.  One sees how each story relates to the others in a different way than in the theater version in which the separate stories are intertwined througout the feature.The commentary by directors Rodriguez and Miller is excellent are all the other special features.If you haven't already bought the original DVD, skip it and buy this version.

Well, I'm sitting in the theater waiting for this to start and thinking about how great that last movie I saw was. It was The Pacifier btw and it rocked unlike this carp. Well, this thing starts and immediately something is wrong. I yell to the guy and tell him to turn up the color or something but he says that's how the movie is. WTFzzors? I just saw The Pacifier which was awesome in color and now I have to watch this carp trying to be a relic from the 1950s? If I wanted to watch a boring movie with bad dialogue in black and white, I'd rent Citizen Kane or Seven Samurai. I come to the movies to be entertained not to watch boring talk with no color. Pass this carp up. Go see The Pacifier with Vin Diesel instead. He's a much better actor than anyone in this movie.	1.0	This is like the worst thing I've ever seen	2005-05-28	105	8	97

This movie is just a bunch of short stories told in one-liner phrases. The whole story of the guy trying to get vengeance for the death of a prostitute he had a one night stand with was absurd to me. Especially when he claims to love her. Don't get me wrong the cinametogrophy or whatever you call it is pretty but I turned the movie off after Elijah Wood shows up in a house full of severed heads. I guess if you're a fan of Frank Miller or Robert Rodriguez then it's for you.

It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made. As a result, Sin City has to be strongly recommended to fans of either.	4.0	Stylish and highly stylized	2006-02-22	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	AK7CAW3N1XZV6	"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth"""	"First of all, I should say up front that Sin City is not the kind of movie that I would generally choose-I'm not a reader of comic books (or, as they now seem to be called, graphic novels), and although I do enjoy the action genre at times, I'm not a big fan of relentless, unnecessary violence.  And Sin City just might be the most violent film I have ever seen, so much so as to be to the point of absurdity (although, given that this IS an adaptation of a graphic novel series after all, maybe that is appropriate).The movie is actually a compilation of several interconnected stories, chronicles which are told via frequent shifts amongst both characters and time.  The style and general feel of the movie is quite similar to another dark film, Pulp Fiction, although I found Sin City to be more violent and less funny.  The movie opens with a short sequence between a man and a woman, two characters who I still haven't been quite able to place within the context of the rest of the film.  The main stories each feature a chief character:  Bruce Willis as a cop nearing forced retirement but out to save a little girl, an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as an ex-con out for revenge, Clive Owen as a vigilante who goes after the wrong man, and finally, back to Bruce Willis still playing the hero eight years later.  Each principal keeps up a constant stream of narration throughout their segment; this helps to provide necessary background information but becomes annoying after awhile.  However, the cinematography shines, as the film is shot mostly in gritty black and white with occasional splashes of color.  The lack of color actually diminishes the impact of the violence somewhat given that blood generally appears in the film as white, not red.  Did I mention that the movie is violent?  If you are sensitive to fight scenes, frequent maimings, and (not to mention) several beheadings, this movie is NOT for you.If you are a fan of DVD extras, this set is replete with them; at times, I was more intrigued by these than the movie itself.  Disc 1 contains the extended theatrical release plus extras which focus on some of the film's special features, such as the cars, costumes, props, and make-up that went into the making of the movie.  The car segment was particularly interesting, as it shows how various classic cars were sought out to help give the Sin City its film noir feel.  Disc 2 includes some more unique extras, including a fascinating ""green-screen"" version of the film shown at high speed:  in less that 10 minutes, you can view the entire movie sans most of its props and background scenes.  This disc also features each of the stories told individually-as originally conceived by creator Frank Miller-rather than morphed together as in the theatrical release.  Finally, this deluxe set contains a complete Sin City graphic novel of The Hard Goodbye (the story which stars Mickey Rourke).While not exactly my cup of tea, this movie was undeniably entertaining, with the included extras definitely making the deluxe edition worthwhile.  From what I could tell, the film stayed very true to Frank Miller's original graphic novels (almost TOO true, as the dialogue had moments that were undeniably comical, but not in the good way), and so I'm sure Miller's fans will be thrilled with this big-screen adaptation.  If you thought that Pulp Fiction was too tame, this movie is likely to be right up your alley, but those who prefer their action films with less violence should seek entertainment elsewhere."	3.0	Hours of entertainment via a violence-packed action feature and loads of DVD extras	2005-12-05	10	8	2

078886047X	Sin City	AR9SWRG4RQA9Y	Big Bad Daddy	First off, I am a huge Frank Miller fan! Read the Sin City comics from the start. While I respect the great effort to remain faithful to the source material, I think this movie fails on many levels. Some of the acting is terrible, lines that might work in a comic book word balloon just come off stiff and goofy on screen. Michael Madsen's acting stands out the most! Was he underpaid?The CastBad - Frodo as serial killer? Bruce Willis as a 60 year old cop? Jessica Alba, great body, no acting skills - see Fantastic Four, or entire career. Bleh. Wouldn't less famous actors have been a better choice?Good - Mickey Rourke as Marv. Roy Batty (I mean Rutger Hauer) actually works as a Cardinal. Rosario Dawson, perfect look for Gail. Brittany Murphy as Shellie, perfect! These are all based on look, acting is mediocre for the most part, I blame the script more than anything.The LookThe film is both faithful to the source material and beautiful, environments, clothing, rain all bathed in a world of impenetrable shadow and glowing light, work as they did on the comic book page. But the actors faces are lit with more definition, mid-tones, etc. which is weird. A world bathed in shadow should effect people too, right? When actors are not the primary focus on screen, the look is incredible. Other times, actors just seem pasted on top, very distracting.Most comic book movies are hurt by odd changes to the source material. Others by avoiding the big expensive special effects, no Galactus in Fantastic Four! Sin City suffers from the opposite.If you want to see a movie with the look of Sin City where the actors and environments mesh perfectly, check out Renaissance! The Sin City story is better, but visually, Renaissance works much better.Maybe Sin City 2 will be better, regardless of my disappointment, I will see the sequel.	2.0	Faithful, yetdisappointing	2007-11-30	4	3	1

Filled w/ violence, gore, insanity and murder, this is the hideous underbelly of hell on earth! Robert Rodriguez / Frank Miller have fashioned the perfect comic book on film. The overblown characters and impossible action take place in the netherworld of their combined imaginations, leaving us w/ a masterwork of incredible, explosive entertainment. Every evil person is a nightmarish ghoul or demon, embodied so well by the silent, stealthy, cannibalistic Kevin (Elija Wood). Every anti-hero is a darkened, jaded soul w/ one last shot at redemption. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen are the grand trinity of retribution and cold, hard justice. Their characters dole out the vengeance, and pay dearly for their trouble. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, and Rosario Dawson are just three of the many idealized, ultra-hot females worth killing and dying for. SIN CITY is a bleak universe soaked in corruption and death. It's police (Benicio Del Toro), it's politicians (Powers Boothe), and it's clergy / church (Rutger Hauer) are all rotting, stinking institutions, held together by greed, perversion, and terror.

078886047X	Sin City	A14QAT1XDSCLEO	Bitcetc	"The Ultimate ""Non-Chick Flick""Whether you like it or whether you don't, if you like movies, you ""must see"" this film. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: ""Spiderman 2"", or ""Sin City"". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as ""literal truth"" as ""Spiderman 2"", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as ""Sin City"", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling ""American Splendor"", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after ""Frank Miller's Sin City"". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original ""Star Wars"" was in its day.Visually, cinematographically, the movie is genius. If you've seen the trailers, you knew that something new and excitingly ""awe-ful"" (no, I don't mean ""awesome"") was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head.The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as ""Marv"", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as ""Dwight"", this is a man's movie. I haven't even mentioned Elijah Wood in a role that will forever keep him from being typecast as a lovable hobbit, Benecio Del Toro, who quite literaly metamorphoses into a ""dirty cop"" on screen, Michael Madsen and Nick Stahl. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.It does bother me that we haven't yet grown out of this teenaged vision of violence, but nowhere else is it so satirically, so poetically translated onto screen. As virtually ""bloody"" as this movie is, and as much as I say I abhor violence, I was laughing with the young male audience at the violent hyperbole which permeates the story. I am also bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings.  ""All women"",  except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--,  who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for ""political correctness"" outside the theater.But if you have a mind to suspend disbelief, and live for 126 minutes in Frank Miller's graphic world, choose Mickey Rourke for the ride. His features are modified to look even more ""comic book"" than the more recognizable Willis or Owen, but he is so completely Marv that he blows us away when he's blowing away the bad guys (OK, the worse guys). Mickey Rourke is the hard act to follow in this film. He is too much. He is over the top. But he carries us over the top with him, like King Kong with Faye Wray.""Hardboiled"" is a wishy-washy, weak-kneed way to describe the spectacularly and terrifyingly gender-driven bloodlust that fuels the film. All of the ""heroes"" are more than flawed, but they are all violent, and both welcome and expect it toward themselves in the same way they dish it out.Someday, I dream, Tarantino and Rodriguez will put their genius at film as medium in the service of a philosophical idea that they recognize as bigger than themselves. They have perfected stylistized violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up to some masculine heroic ideal. I cannot even imagine how wonderful, how superb, how phenomenal that film might be, if they were to grow up, explore the universe a little bit more, and take us with them.

078886047X	Sin City	A2GM1BMYFCXR1M	B. Kamper	"It strikes me as funny that the ""star"" that this edition of the movie that Amazon.com opts to promote is Jessica Alba.Basically, Sin City is an adaptation of Frank Miller's series of graphic novels/comic books, which I haven't read.  What you'll find if you're not a comic/graphic novel geek is a compelling visual experience.  It has the standard Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino level of violence, so be careful.  This is an edgy, engaging journey through a different world.  What Rodriguez/Miller do with color and movement in the movie is really interesting.  The directors end up relying on the Tarantinoesque Pulp Fiction mode of semi-related stories to get through the movie, but the experience seems to me to be more aesthetic than narrative.Do the benefits of the ""Special Edition"" really add up to the cost?  I don't know.  I could barely tell the extra scenes that were in this addition, but I find that the many bonus features and the multitude of commentary tracks made this edition more worthwhile than the ""plain jane"" version."	4.0	As Fine an Adaptation of a Comic Book as you'll find	2006-02-26	1	0	1

Next I got excited about the whole thing and bought all the graphic novels that the movie was based on... and I read all those. While reading them, I applied each actor's face with the characters. So when I came time to see the actual movie, I not only understood what some of the visual ""oddities"" where (e.i. Marv's bandages on his face, Contrasting bricks in shadows), but I was actually greatly amused that those details were included in the film. Also, it wasn't hard at all getting used to the casting, since I already had in mind while reading the books.I must say, that those who haven't read the Graphic novels are missing a small (i repeat, small) edge to the film. It's much more amusing when you're watching the movie and are consistantly reminded of how f***ing accurate it is to the graphic novel. It's amazing... and i'm not even the biggest advocate of extreme-o super accurate adaptions. but this quality of the film cannot go unnoticed.As for those who hate ""this piece of crap"" film. well, they obviously have tastes should have never got them interested to watch the film in the first place.

078886047X	Sin City	A3AF8P0GINFADV	Black Barbie	"Without being familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novels, I did not know what the essence or analysis of ""Sin City"" was, all I knew was it was apparently a film that 'embodied' what some people feel is the real vision of the comic book. Of course, this depends on who you are debating with but to a novice like me, it was an engaging, no holds barred, Maltese Falconesque detective story with great character-driven stories intertwined.So many famous faces in this film yet does celebrity ensure quality? Overall, the famous faces in ""Sin City"" pay off, for example: Mickey Rourke was brilliant as Marv -- a troubled actor but onscreen, he is at his best. Bruce Willis flexed some acting muscle here and I didnt even think of ""Die Hard"" once -- his performance showed that he has matured -- could a comeback be in his path? Some people think the famous faces are distracting but they add a menacing quality film (remember Woods as Frodo? think AGAIN. he was excellent as Kevin and not to mention Benicio del Toro who was so convincing that you might not even recognise him despite that makeup)Some people may say that this film objectifies women as trophies, raging Amazons etc but I think it links with the themes of corruption, decadence and lost innocence. Jessica Alba has come a long way since 'Dark Angel' - she has a certain luminous quality to her that translates through film. Rosario Dawson is crazy in this film - the contrasting women (the brazen Brittany Murphy, innocent Alba, the silent but deadly Devon Aoki) in this film is what I think adds depth to the female presence.Last Thought I: visually stunning, fast-paced adventure yet with thought-provoking symbolism (a corrupt priest allies with a disturbed cannibal of a boy?

Years later, I collected all 7 of the Sin City graphic novels and just after reading the first novel &#34;The Hard Goodbye&#34; you see how faithful the film was to this book. It includes pieces from a few other Sin City novels and short stories as well. Scenes taken right from the panels, dialogue taken directly from the page with little to no alterations... and you would think maybe that was Rodriguez taking the easy way out, or that it would be lame. That seemed to be most people's gripe with Zach Snyder's Watchmen. It's actually the complete opposite, I think it's exciting to read it and then see exactly that in a film. Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant director and partnered with Frank Miller himself, and Quentin Tarantino... He can't lose. Sin City is a great movie for all, fans of the books or not.

078886047X	Sin City	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`Sin City' directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller is truly a fantasy cartoon for grown-up men. As this particular release of the film to DVD has virtually no extras, I can devote all my space to considering the movie.As a major fan of some both violent and avant-garde movies such as `Zardoz', `La Femme Nikita', `Kill Bill', and `Straw Dogs', my biggest problem with this movie is reconciling the violence with the art of the film. I suspect this issue is as old as the Greek playwrights and their philosophical critics. The most recent issue on this stage was the controversy over Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ'.I think the issue can be stated as a question on the extent to which visceral reaction to illegal violence, sex, sadism, or whatever can outweigh the negative reaction to this social pathology or actually enhance the artistic experience, as the right amount of salt improves the taste of virtually all food.For starters, I believe there are great masses of viewers who will simply be so repulsed by what they consider inappropriate violence. To them, I give a gentle lecture on the Bill of Rights and a copy of the DVD `Hitch' or `The Wedding Date' as an alternative.The landmark movie for establishing the correct aesthetic for violence in film is `Bonnie and Clyde'. Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise. This argument has been successfully played out in hundreds of movies, not the least of which was the recent `Saving Private Ryan'.I believe the problem of relating this argument to `Sin City' is confounded by the comic book fantasy style of this film. It is really hard to make any case for the film as an examination of a gangster's impotence or an American army captain's dedication to duty in war when the main characters are plainly cut from a fantastical cloth. No one short of Rasputin survives strangulation on top of gunshot wounds on top of severe angina and lives to the last reel. The other side of the coin may be that the argument that the aesthetic of `Sin City' is classic 1940's film noir taken to its logical conclusion. This may be seen as `The Maltese Falcon' or `The Long Goodbye' as done by Rodriguez and Tarantino, with the part of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett taken by Frank Miller.All this is a rationalization to the fact that the pathological and unrealistic violence in this movie can put off even people who may be disposed to like this kind of movie. Basically, my sense of implausibility of the events in this film outweighed my sense of guilty pleasure from all the violence. `Kill Bill' may have taken me to the brink of that abyss. `Sin City' may have gone that one step too far.But what then explains the good reviews garnered by this film. Does `two thumbs way up' tell me I'm taking on just a little too much old age prudery and that maybe I have to recalibrate my aesthetic sensibilities?I will say that the cinematic artistry in the production of the movie is excellent. All the effects are done to a level which far exceeds that other recent blue screen epic, `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (aside from having a much better story as well). The only annoyance in the graphic artistry was where in most scenes, blood was seen as a bright red in this black and white world, while in one scene with one victim, all blood was white, not red. Very confusing!Another triumph was from the casting director. With Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke and Benicio DelToro, we are just missing Harvey Keitel and Gary Oldman to complete our rogue's gallery of seriously dark heroes and heavies. The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type. I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.I also enjoyed the sly little graphic Easter eggs such as the makes of the various automobiles, including, I believe, a Chevy Corvair, 1957 Chevy station wagon and the great finned 1959 Cadillac. Also, while the location of `Sin City', named `Basin City' is vague, there is a clear reference to Interstate 287 that runs through some of the most darkly fabled minor cities of New Jersey such as Perth Amboy.The movie is based on three largely unconnected episodes with one of the three serving as a bookend to the other two, opening the movie briefly, to be picked up after running through the other two stories. It is hard to tell where Tarantino's contribution may have come in. My first guess would be as the director of the Bruce Willis bookending story, but I suspect it is more likely he directed and choreographed the scenes in which the female ninja character does her stuff.It is hard to evaluate the acting. There is no question that the male leads, Willis, Rourke, and Clive Owen carry their weight and that the heavies are suitably heavy, but the thin dialogue and the fantastic biology and physics seen in many scenes prevents us from really becoming fully engaged with the characters.The bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.	4.0	New Chapter in film noir history.

078886047X	Sin City	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	Okay all of you comic book lovers out there, let's look at this film for a minute. And I don't mean check out the nice hooters on this gal or that, or watch neon-yellow blood spurt from a man's ...uh ...private area as they're ripped off. I mean LOOK at the film.I love to watch action in films as much as the next gruesome guy. I enjoyed the new release of SERENITY in theaters. And I thought PULP FICTION and KILL BILL were pretty darn good films, too. But they had a POINT!What was the plot of SIN CITY? Can anyone tell me? What was the purpose behind all this bloodshed?For me, there has to be action and reactions to bloodletting, not just violence for the sake of violence.I will say that it was engaging to watch the black and white sceenshots mix with bright colors, but that's just visuals. There HAS to be more.Now I'm not a tree-huggin', peace-marching, free-lover, but if you want to see part of what's wrong with our culture of violence, check out this film. It has sex, violence during sex, disembowling procedures, disembowling during sexy scenes, and ...oh yeah, more violence.Holy bashed-in brains, Batman!	3.0	Rip! Tear! Blood! Guts!	2005-10-25	8	2	6

The editing, filming techniques are, in my opinion, nothing short of phenomenal. If you get the chance to see the green screen and director's versions, do so. The directors choices, over and over again, are amazing. Being in the industry, I look at films in terms of editing, score, directing, etc. Still and all, a great piece.

I am not familiar with the comic book this is based on, but I will need to acquiant myself with it, due to this movie.Sin City had a really good, original and exciting storyline, the direction was good, the acting was fine, and the casting was really good. Perfect. Did I mention Rosario Dawson is/was hot? Sin City is a dark film, hawking back to the days of Film Noir. All the characters were on the wrong side of the tracks, just some more so then others. The movie was also very violent, but that is to be expected I guess.I would have to say that I haven't been this impressed with a movies originallity and style, since Pulp Fiction. By the way, one thing to mention. This movie reminds me a little of a book I just read, called ""Blue Goblins"", which dealt with an apocalytic future, sex, drugs, violence, and gangs; it was a good book if you like this type of material.So, to close you have a good,exciting, original styled dark-themed movie; with an excellant cast (with a hot Rosaio Dawson), good direction, and good story. I would strongly recommend this movie!"	5.0	Hot damn! Rosario Dawson is hot! The movie was really good too!	2005-11-16	2	0	2
078886047X	Sin City	A1CUIW4WO4IVZ2	Bob Langill	"Some movies are so deep, so subtle, you can watch them over and over, and pick up something new every time. Sin City isn't like that. Flash Gordon was my former number one guilty pleasure. When I watched it, and now, when I watch Sin City, the fun comes from seeing the same things each time: when I hear Marv tell a guy ""That's a nice coat you're wearing,"" I know the guy's in big trouble. Although it never happens, I half expect to hear Marv tell Cardinal Roark, ""That's a nice robe you're wearing.""Maybe I shouldn't call it a guilty pleasure. Siskel and Ebert both gave it thumbs up, but this movie aims at being low-brow. Usually, good drama comes from good villains. Sin City villains are all one-dimensional. They are bad, mean, nasty people. They run everything, run over everyone, and have an exaggerated sense of justification for what they do. We want them to die slow, horrible, painful deaths. As Marv puts it ""I love hit men. No matter what you do to them, you don't feel bad.""While the villains do whatever they want, the heroes: Marv, Hartigan, and Dwight McCarthy are all driven by a strong sense of obligation. They can't just walk away from the situations they're in. They have to squeeze some justice and fairness out of it; at least, they have to try. Marv is the one most willing to do monstrous things, but, despite the fact that he has ""a condition"", he's also the one who most clearly spells out what people should or shouldn't do.Sin City is a graphic novel put in motion. The story telling uses graphics and plenty of violence. There's violence, but it isn't gratuitously displayed. The most violent parts are masked by graphics or related to us . . . ""it wasn't until I showed him all those pieces of himself. . .""  In addition to masking violence, the graphics set a tone and context that straight cinematography won't give you. Right in the opening scene, the rain makes an appearance that sets a tone and tells a story.The graphics pull us into Sin City's unreal world that has very real people in it. That's why I visit so often."	5.0	My #1 guilty pleasure	2013-09-11	2	1	1

While Mickey Rourke actually sort of reminds me of King Kong. He's out of control and you know he's got to die but still its a shame. Sin City itself is set in a world where money has bought all power. In other words, it's the Republican vision of the future.	4.0	Casablanca for the 21st century	2011-07-06	2	0	2
078886047X	Sin City	A1WOP060TY23LD	"Bob Vonhusenheimerschmidtsenberger ""Bob"""	As a film buff and Robert Rodriguez apprentice, the moment I saw the trailer for this film, I knew that I had to see it. My hopes were foiled again and again by the fact that no other 13 year old, (at least one that I know), had seen the film. Five months I waited. Five months I fought for my cause. Finally, after bickering to an extreme, I convinced my mom to at least SEE the movie. Half way in, my hopes were dashed; she walked saying NO WAY. But perserverance was on my side, and I convinced her to sit through the rest. After te most agonizing 45 minutes of my life, she said the words I needed to hear.I saw this morning and I am here to say...WOW. Now do not take this review the wrong way, I do not suggest this movie for MOST 13 year olds. It was full of gratuitous and, at some points, downright disturbing, violence. If your resume of films you have been allowed to see and have been unfased by include: The Passion of the Christ, Kill Bill Vol. 1, The Patriot and Saving Private Ryan, and your citizenship grades in school are consistently perfect, then PROBABLY, you should be able to see this film. If not, good luck. After all, luck was on my side.And now: a general review of the film. This film is my personal new favorite film. Not because of the gratuitous violence, but because of its overwhelmingly cool nature. In my opinion, this film is one of the few modern films that is able to show that there is no good without bad, no happy without sad, no justice without SIN.Sin City is a world in which the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are far worse. Its unrealistic nature and black and white cinematography are the two things that keep the violence in check, and allow some of it to be comical. Some seens are so Robert Rodriguez, and by that I mean fantastical gunplay that brings a smile to your face. Its comic book dialogue makes it ring true to the storyline.Recommendations: Once upon a Time in Mexico, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, Spiderman 2, and Batman Begins.All in all, I found Sin City to be a brilliant and well-crafted film.Enjoy.	5.0	KLAK!

078886047X	Sin City	A11GU0SCX77O8E	Bookdude	Sin City is an empty, hollow, incoherent, poorly edited, pathological piece of snuff porn; it tries to gloss over this with lots of beautiful camera work, but it's just like putting a silk dress on a rotting corpse. Each of this movie's stories are  so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash.

Though Sin city does tend to exeel these movies by one point. The acting. Mikey Rouke steals the show as Marv, the hulkish  thug whose main purpose is to find the killers of the love of his life, and give them some street justice. His story is compelling and very, very, violent. Well I take that back the most violent story would have to be Bruce Willis who plays Hartigan , a violent ex cop who wants to protect a stripper from his past misadventure that has her also involved, in this story line you actually see a mans testicles ripped off............actually that was...........god .........burr. Anyway overall all the stories are downright violent. There is one more but I would not want to intrude like I did before..Now as for dvd news Rodrigues is giving out a threatical release and an extended release.Also he will bring in more Sin city movies from now on, and will be planning to release a new one 2008 or 9, so get ready.Yours trullyfilm critique of the week.	5.0	Oscar worthy	2005-05-24	2	2	0

The whole movie, from start to finish is narrated. It's like the directors are playing ""dollies"" with the actors. Or as if they don't trust the actors to convey the stories correctly or the viewer to understand, so they're going to tell you exactly what the story is. Ho, hum. And I don't care how much violence there is in this film, because there is an overabundance they could do less with, it is still a ho-hummer. The movie is apparently a chain of ""pulp fiction"" stories, most of them having nothing to do with anything or each other, other than to stretch the movie out so it won't be a short film. I'm guessing Tarantino's attempt to remake the Switchblade Sisters fails miserably and unconvincingly. I don't think the Switchblade Sisters would return as a gang of prostitutes.Skip this movie and read a comic book instead.

078886047X	Sin City	APZFBM29WXBAD	Bouqet for a Siren	"this was an incredibly well-made film. robert rodriguez, veteran of the ""el mariachi"" series, and guest director tarantino do a fine job of directing an excellent cast. rourke, willis, wood, dawson, and alba all turn in brilliant performances. and the look of the film is truly breath-taking. despite the fact that all the scenery is pretty obviously cgi generated, it's still spot on, corresponding almost exactly to miller's unique illustration style. the city is dirty, gritty, sexy, dangerous.however, the underlying message of the movie is one that i find infuriating, which is probably more of a problem with frank miller than with the cast and crew. despite the fact that the film features strong, independent female characters, like gail, the gun-toting dominatrix of old town fame, these powerful women still are forced to go running to men for protection when the going gets really tough.in order to communicate the message that violence and exploitation of women is wrong, miller creates a world of violence and exploitation. the series is clearly an attempt by a man to integrate himself into modern feminist canon. it tells us that girls do indeed kick ass, but they still need men to defend them. that women are strong, but men will always be stronger. while i don't agree with the other side of this argument either, that a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle, i still feel as if miller's intentions are hypocritical at best.so definitely watch this film. it's worth a viewing. it's visually stunning, violent, exciting, and perverse. just try not to think about it too much, because it's bound to leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth, particularly if you happen to be female."	3.0	cinematically satisfying, ideologically infuriating	2005-09-16	3	2	1

078886047X	Sin City	A16Z4CUXYD9U27	"Brandon A. Martin ""the jokA"""	"I have quite a few things to say after seeing this movie and reading almost every review on this site.  Every comment from those that loved it to those that hated it.  From the 15 year old that shouldn't have been let in the theatre w/o his Mommy in the first place to the ""top-rated critic"" that prolly had more expectations then all of us put together before they even went in the theatre.  I'm not saying each person doesn't have their own basis for their opinions, but it seems everybody has pre-conceptions for a movie of this hype long before they even give it a chance.  Drop your expectations and you'd be surprised how much you can enjoy ANY movie.  However, I'm going to start with my personal opinion and try my best not to include any factual information yet so bear with me:First things first, people that cry and whine about the gore and ""degrading"" representation of women and nudity and the fact that you can't relate to the characters - what exactly did you in all your teenage/feminist ignorace expect from a rated R movie called ""SIN CITY""?  It's seems to me that so many uptight people automatically see or hear something that SEEMS a certain way and they don't bother to think into the hidden meanings.  The hookers that show skin but are tough as nails simply show the adversity and determination of women to struggle through the pimps and killers and fight back the only way that ever gets things done.  So many bleeding hearts want to believe that war is bad, but they shouldn't deny the fact that the changes that COME from war are necessary.Secondly, I am an aspiring actor and a movie buff beyond many peoples' understandings.  Do most of you nay-sayers even understand how difficult it is to ""act cheesy""?  I've done quite a few theatre shows, and as a mandatory skill, you have to overact.  You HAVE to be cheesy to appropriately pervey the meaning behind the plot.  I truly believe the acting was exceedingly excellent and not as easy or crappy as so many of you haters think.  Each charater was shown in the way they needed to be from the pages of the comic by their respective actors/actresses.  When a director tells you, ""Ham this up and be corny!"" you friggin do it and hope you do it well.  And they all did just that.Finally, again, only as my opinion, I believe this movie was an original, complex, risque masterpiece that needed to be done before someone else did it WRONG.  Do you people truly believe the directors/writers said in the middle of a scene, ""Hold on!  We shouldn't put that in, people might get offended.""  Gimme a break folks, what the #@$! do they make movies for?  Movies are an escape from reality and are meant to tug at your emotions, even if that happens to be disgust or hate.  Actually, do you haters dislike this movie because maybe it's a little TOO close to reality for your tastes?  Does it scare you only because this seems to be what our world is working towards?  Good deeds are never rewarded...evil lurks everywhere, even where you least expect it...the beauty that you see on the surface doesn't always match underneath...  That's what this movie really shows and I think it bothers alot of you.  This is the underbelly of what our planet is slowly building towards and that makes you mad that we can enjoy it as entertainment.Now, the facts:  This movie was as original as they come.  It had very distinct lessons to learn from EVERY character.  It had star power that each showed off, if anything, their diversity.  It is true to the comic and is an amazing genre-bending story that has been attempted and failed at every time...until now.My suggestion to anyone reading these reviews that hasn't seen it (or that have and simply want to hear others' opinions), don't think too hard when you watch it.  Don't pick apart what you do and don't like about each scene.  Watch the movie and, at the end, decide for yourself.  You'll either love it or hate it...there doesn't seem to be much middle ground here.  Use your brain and not your eyes to figure this one out.Personally, as a wannabe actor, a movie freak, and a comic book artist/reader I can't wait to own this one and put it at the front of the stack!the jokA"	5.0	Get over yourselves and think...	2005-05-09	9	6	3

If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere.I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that ""Sin City"" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la ""Pulp Fiction,"" and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good.The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office. ""Sin City"" is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen-year-old in all of us, and what fun it is.Grade: A"	5.0	Sick but Sinsational	2005-04-29	4	3	1

The DVD leaves a lot to be desired as there are no special features aside from a small featurette.  I have heard rumors about a super edition later in the year with all extras you could ask for, and I'll wait to get it then.The movie, however is probably unlike anything you have ever seen.  It is one of the few comic book movies that doesn't alter things in apology for being a comic book movie.  It is completely unrealistic, it doesn't really try to look real.  But it does look very cool.  I had a great time watching the movie.  It is a very adult movie as the violence is very extreme at times.

078886047X	Sin City	A3H2CKTFZ3B3GD	Brian Hawkinson	Sin City really did turn out to be a great comic book movie. The cinematography was great, the acting good and the storyline flowed, albeit in disjointed scenes, leaving you with the feeling that you got a complete picture.Through the adventures of a few misfits battling the ruling Roark family (the Senator and his son, as well as the Cardinal) we get a tale that is moving and fun. Through and through is the underlying moral of sacrifice, which isn't overdone, but instead firmly imbedded amidst the gory and violent encounters that are in practically every scene. The use of colors to accentuate characters and scenes is amazing, adding much to the storyline.At times it can be looked at as unrealistic but, lets face it, it is a comic book movie, so suspend reality for 2 hours and let yourself be taken for a ride, that is if you don't mind watching a little violence. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.	5.0	A great comic book movie	2005-11-05	4	1	3
078886047X	Sin City	A17JWQFH3H9BHK	Brian Mattrisch	This movie itself is pretty different. Much like a moving comic book presentation. But it is the use of black&white; along with the colors that make it such a visually stunning film. Even if you don't like the film it is worth watching for that. Personally, I like the film. Yes there is some very violent scenes, but I was raised on reading comic books and the violence here is almost the same as comic book violence. I was not at all offended. Also I felt the story line was good. But if you don't even like it after you watch it, you'll have to admit the visuals are stunning.Brian	5.0	Fantastic cinematography	2009-04-26	2	1	1
078886047X	Sin City	A2ZS9LHY3IGZ0I	B. Rooney	What can I say about the movie.  The movie itself is amazing...no pure Genius.  Frank Miller's comics are riveting and with his guiding hand, Robert Rodriguez could not have translated his masterpiece to the screen any better.  Together they set a new standard for comic movies and noir.HOWEVER!  I would not advise buying this DVD yet.  The extended and Uncut version will be released within months.  That is the only reason this DVD got only 3 stars...otherwise it would have easily gotten 5.  The DVD set to release in December will be more than worth your wait.In sum, the movie, the acting, the style, everything about the film itself is amazing, ingenious, the description can go on.  but WAIT for the extended DVD in December.

078886047X	Sin City	A3EYOITBD7ZXOV	BruceWayne	"I'll be honest with you...I went to the theater to see this, and walked out shortly after the horrible exchange of dialogue between Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen at the beginning.Bad mistake.It arrived on DVD, and out of absolute boredom I suppose, I purchased a copy telling myself, ""I'll give it a chance.""  Glad I am.  Good it was.  Now I realize you're not reading ""Newsweek"" or something so I won't go into every single pro and con of this film but I'll tell you one thing---it's action packed, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's clever...and there are some REALLY bad performances at the first.  Somehow Michael Madsen drags Bruce Willis' performance down, because later on in the film, Willis returns to his former glory.  Perhaps because by then he's paired with Jessica Alba, and not the fat-guy from Reservoir Dogs.Finally, I guess I was trying to give this three and a half stars, because it's really better than a flat three, but not quite a four, if ""Batman Begins"" is a five.  What really hurts this film in the long-run will be it's playback value.  I know what happens.  The big BANG! SHOCK! is over.  As much as I loved it, and though it's sitting on my shelf, I haven't yet forced myself to watch it twice.  I WILL...eventuallly...but what about three times?

I found it confusing and hard to follow. Basically it tells three different stories and each one starts in the middle with no real back story.  So your left to figure out what's going on. This really hampered the enjoyment of the movie for me at first.Once it was over though and I set back and digested what I had just watched, I found that I really liked it.

There is no comparsion to the real violence in the HBO Spawn TV series.  Beside all the killing and sex and stuff like that, the movie is full of motion. Things move in this movie.  They don't stand still by the dialogs.  They really make a comic book alife.  This puts Stan Lee's The Hulk to shame.  Well... he tried.They have a wonderful casts.  I was WOW by the number of familiar faces in this movie.  The reason for me to go see this movie is Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis.  Jessica Alba really can dance and she is very sexy in the movie.The only thing that is not that good in this movie is that about 3/4, the movie is getting a little bit boring. After that, it gets back to action. And the most terrible thing is that they only give Jessica Alba very short screen time.  They should show her dance longer, and give her more dialogs.	4.0	kill kill kill	2005-04-16	7	0	7

It's filled with violent, black comedy and adult theme...but that is what Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's work are famous for and the reason (some) people love it...me one of 'em!The PQ is great, the way the monochrome contrasts the purposely expressed colours of reds and yellows and blue is just truly dazzling and eye popping! I luv it!!! Worth my every cent buying it in BD!!!!!The extras are abundant, ranging from the recut version of the film to background information on how it evolves from comic book to movie ranging from wardrobe design to cars...but sadly only some of the extras are in HD...Highly recommended for those that wants to treat their eyes!

078886047X	Sin City	A3TT7UIIMZ9WE3	"C. Alston ""but in this case, ZM2K"""	I saw this movie on opening day and was instantly blown away by it.The graphics in this movie (just like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, both of which being completely filmed against blue screens) make this movie quite fun to watch, and the black and white effect takes you deep into the gritty world of Basin City. Also, I must mention the absolutely brilliant narration. It introduces the characters and their situation very well, and served as a raw opener for each character. Miller has proved his worth writing the original comics, and does so yet again directing this movie. Rodriguez does another fine film, and receives (quite frankly, deserves) respect for sticking to the comics so well. Taratino again proves his curious love for blood in movies. For anyone who hasn't seen it, this movie is three stories. One is that of Marv, a man who falls deeply in love with a woman, only to see her killed on the same night. He goes off in search of the killer, murdering himself on the way. Then there's that of Hartigan, who only has one thing in life that matters, and that's the safety of skinny little Nancy Callahan. He's got to keep her safe; that's all that matters. Dwight, the 2nd to last story in the film, gets to witness the fall of the truce between Whoreland and Copville (those aren't the actual names, but that's pretty much what they are.) The order of these stories are - 1\2 of Hartigan, Marv, Dwight, & other 1\2 of Hartigan. Before I leave off, I'll give you a warning. This movie is incredibly violent, and if you're easily phased by blood and gore, stay away. (For example - a guy gets an axe in the head, another guy gets a swistka-shaped bladeon his eyebrow, another guy gets all four of his limbs cut off, etc., etc...) Like the title of my review suggests, this film is great for any noir fan, but you definately can't be of the faint of heart, or stomach for that matter.

How could Bruce Willis fall downstairs to star in a goofy movie like Sin City. That Hollywood  is more than goofy, everybody knows that, esp. us, ""old timers"" who saw in their younger years good old King Kong, Gone with the Wind, Ben Hur & James Steward in any of his movies. It seems to me like good actors take anything that comes their way as they one by one have been loosing their acting careers and stand in an unemployment line unless they belong to a so called ""minority!"" If I were an actor of Bruce Willis's type, I would get together w/other top caliber actors & create a ""new Hollywood"" company without those 4 letter words & sexual perversity. People or public is just dying to see real good movies. And, I must add, those cartoons for kids could really use also some redoing too - nice looking characters & not monstreous & ugly looking faces of kids & people.

078886047X	Sin City	A3IBYRSA490ZOA	C. Chow	"This DVD contains an interview with Frank Miller where he states that his reaction to the very idea of a `Sin City' movie was the same as mine, ""Sacrilege! This cannot be happening! Why does Hollywood want to destroy the name of another good comic book?""But `Sin City' is not a good comic book, it's the best there is. (A least in the genre of action.) I was very pleasantly proven wrong by `Sin City' the film. Frank Miller directs an amazing adaptation of his stories that is sure to please fans of the comic book, and normal people too.Why it works: The key reason why `Sin City' works is that it is amazingly faithful to the comic, almost word-for-word. I still remember those classic lines 13 years later. The film is an anthology of `Sin City's 3 best stories, the original `Sin City' from `DHP', `Sin City: The Big Fat Kill', and `Sin City: The Yellow Bastard'. The film is even faithful in that it contains surprisingly little profanity for an R rated action movie, because as fans know Miller rarely uses profanity. Really the only unfaithful thing is the absence of Miller's racial slurs.Well cast: The trailers boast an all-star cast of Hollywood's A list. While normally I sense dread with an ""all star cast"" as a sign of making up for a lack of good characters, here they were very well cast. Clive Owen probably stands out the best as Dwight (even though he can't shed his accent). I really felt the actors portrayed the characters of `Sin City' faithfully. And my fears that bigger stars' characters may be given larger roles was unfounded.Eye Candy: Just like the comic the film is non stop orgy of visually stunning eye candy. Making you say, ""Wow look at that!""My last fear was that the trailers boasted ""Directed by Robert Rodriguez."" Films directed by Robert Rodriguez are bad. Films that boast they are directed by Rodriguez are even worse. Let me calm your fears. Rodriguez clearly had no greater role in the production of this film than the bestboy. I'm sure that will anger Rodriguez's loyal fans but too bad. You can't tell me the director of `Spy Kids' made this masterpiece.It's good to see this film generating interest in the under valued medium of comic books. Normal people I know who wouldn't pick up a comic book if their lives depended on it are asking, ""Can I borrow the `Sin City' comics from you?""So in conclusion, whether you own every Frank Miller comic ever written or think `Sin City' is a computer video game, you will love this film for its great characters, intense plots, and dazzling eye candy."	5.0	A Faithful Adaptation Of A Great Comic	2006-03-20	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A1N00127IDBHD6	CConn	"Going into the spring of 2005, Sin City quickly became the most anticipated film....well, really the only greatly anticipated movie of a rather dull spring movie season. This was not without good cause; in making Sin City directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller were attempting to do something which had never even been thought of up to this point; to make a direct comic book translation. Not an adaptation, a translation. A translation of page to screen. Going in, of course, there were some doubts about whether this could even be done. Well, I'm glad to say, Rodriguez and Miller triumphed in their revolutionary task. Sin City is everything it could be, and maybe a bit more.But before all of that. Before the springtime hype of Sin City...I had already jumped the bandwagon. Several months before, actually. All the way back to the late summer of 2004 when Sin City's director Robert Rodriguez released an 8-minute preview of his film. It was, in short, utterly fantastic. The tone was unbelievably pulpy, the cinematography revolutionary, and the acting almost classic. As if this film were shot in the 40s or 50s rather than the current day. As a avid fan of Film Noir these were all very, very good signs for me.Of course, having been introduced to this...genius, really, I immediately ran out and purchased one of the many graphic novels Sin City is based on; The Hard Goodbye. Frankly, it was the best comic book I ever read. Still is. The combination of gritty, noir-to-the-max storytelling, and stark back and white art was simply mind-blowing. Just as the film that would proceed it, The Hard Goodbye was groundbreaking, and just plain damn good. Sin City was now one of my most anticipated films of 2005, if not the most anticipated.But, as a cruel twist of fate would have it, just as Sin City was FINALLY being released theatrically, I came down with a rather nasty cold, which prevented me from seeing it for almost 2 weeks. When I finally recovered however, and made it to my local theater to see what I just knew would be a masterpiece, I was...to put it bluntly, a bit let down. I loved the opening short-story, which I had already seen thanks to the 2004 preview, as well as the first story of Marv, and The Hard Goodbye. But sadly, the other two tales The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard seemed very hollow, too fast-paced, and even a bit pointless.At first, I chalked this up to over-hype on my part. Raising my expectations too high. Then, later, I realized the true cause; while I had read The Hard Goodbye, I had not yet explored the other two adapted novels. This knowledge, and experience, of the source, is quite key I believe to fully...realizing Sin City's greatness. Having now read both of the other books, and seen Sin City the film again, I can confirmed that is true...for me at least. I am now able to enjoy Sin City to its fullest. So now moving past my problems of pre-conceived notions and lack of knowledge for the source material, I can deliver my ""true"" review of Sin City.The three stories which make up Sin City, obviously, are all similar in plot and tone. It's all about revenge and violence. And it's hammered at you fast and often. Due to the whole method of direct translation, the pacing is quick, but enjoyable. We are almost whisked through scene after scene, story after story. As our lead character(s) deliver hard-boiled monologues to tie it all together. This pacing also allows for excellent ""rewatchability"" factor. The two hours goes by quickly, and you'll never mind popping it into the DVD player as often as possible. The violence in the film is, as you probably have heard, gratuitous and sometimes grotesque. However it all takes on a very cartoony-feel as characters survive impossible psychical torment and pain. Getting hit in the face with a sledgehammer or getting hit by a car means nothing in Sin City, and our heroes (or villains) come out of it with barely a scratch. Even the more serious injuries inflicted (such as a two castration), is done in such a way that makes it seems, as crazy as it sounds, a bit less brutal than the stuff we usually see in violence-ridden films.Save for a hammy and unbelievably over-the-top Michael Madsen (which I won't go into), nearly all of the performances in Sin City are first rate. Some even bordering on the spectacular. One of these, is the film's undoubtable star, Mickey Rourk as the brutish Marv. His performance is both mean and nasty. But, oddly...likeable. In his writings creator Frank Miller injected Marv with a large amount of solemn dignity and empathy, and Rourk brings this to life beautifully. Marv's a bad guy. But a bad guy with good intentions, and a good heart. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Jessica Alba and rest of the All-Star cast all give noticeable strong performances. Even Elijah Wood's silent role as the mute cannibal Kevin is excellent in an eery and villainous tone.The score of the film is impressive as well. Written by Rodriguez himself, it's an excellent collection of classic bass lines, and horn pieces adding to the cult tone of the film.Of course, if you're talking about Sin City, you have to talk about the visuals and CGI. These are both done excellently. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. From it's comic book originated shot selection and angles, to its stark black, white and silver palate, Sin City is truly art brought to life, and its truly a pleasure to view and watch. The CGI, while nothing groundbreaking, is near perfectly blended with live actors and sets, to really bring alive this city of corruption and crime. But the best feature of the CGI would have to be its overall ambiguity. Except for a bad animation here or there, it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, which should assure this film will stand the test of time and technological advances.The movie obviously isn't for everyone. Some may very well me turned away, or even disgusted with the violence and bleak resolution of the film. But for fans of the genre, like myself, Sin City is just about as perfect as any film could hope to be. Despite a flaw or two inherent in this type of translation, the director, writer, and actors all play their parts perfectly in not only bring the comic book to the screen, but bring the screen back to comic books."	5.0	Revolutionary Filmmaking	2005-07-09	8	7	1
078886047X	Sin City	A38F6UBQJI9QG1	"C. Copeland ""Film Fanatic"""	Genre: Action, Drama, Dark ComedyGenre Grade: AFinal Grade: AThis was a spectacular movie with great achievements on all levels. Robert Rodriguez hasn't made a movie this good since From Dusk Till Dawn in 1996. However I think he has found an entirely new element and I hope he makes a sequel to this awesome flick soon.I am not even going to comment on the amazing cinematography and style of this film because it's so obvious that it is top-notch. I will comment on the story though - a strong one that molds together to fit into a story that comes together in the end without ever confusing the audience as to what is going on and who is who. The dialogue seemed like it had been written by Tarantino himself, sticking to the classic, bold lines that make you grin and really root for the characters. Even Jessica Alba did a great job in her acting! I do wish Britney Murphy would have been in more of it, she is a great actress and so underrated, in my opinion. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, and Mickey Rourke all did a great job with their characters as well.Great movie, but definitely one to keep kids away from. It is extremely gruesome (not so bad since it's in black and white) and it steps across new boundaries in mainstream film. Think Silence of the Lambs meets Se7en meets classic crime drama, and you got Sin City. Great movie!!Oh, and I found out which part of the film Tarantino directed. It's about a 3-4 minute sequence and once I found out it was quite obvious that it was Tarantino who had directed it.

Black and white scenes and absurd colors make this movie very unique. Players (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen) performance are great. There are three stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) in the movie, each is very interesting. In the first story, Marv wants to find killer of his girlfriend just got from the bar. Secondly, Dwight protect his girlfriend from ex-cop and try to prevent chaos caused by him, and finally Willis try to save young lady who saved long time ago and got into jail due to her.This is another digital masterpiece and very creative story.

I love it when films become instant cult classics purely based upon the originality of the media - bad or good. To see his world transferred to a feature film was quote ""A dream come true"" It seems that a wide range of viewers actually dislike the films dialogue and plot transfer. I believe that this is due to the direct script from the original comic book. At times it can read rather dull, but if you have seen any of the Sin City graphic novels, you can quickly understand that it is all part of a stylish flow which can be easily accepted once understood.A long time coming, this film could have probably turned out to be an easy disaster for both Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, going the way of other comic to film transfers. Luckily with full control over the production (a rarity in this industry) both were able to sculpt the feature into a beautiful mold of dark comedy, ultra violence, sex, and all that good stuff. Both directors show us that it is not about the content specifics, it is how you go about using them. My rating for this film would have been perfect except for the script transfer, however that is how the cookie crumbles when jumping directly from Comic to Film. A must see for any cult film enthusiast, however I strongly recommend reading at least one of Frank Millers books to grant yourself a better understanding of the ""flow"" before simply diving into this twisted dark tale, or better yet - collection of dark tales."	4.0	Its all about Style	2005-09-08	1	0	1

Fox	"How very sad the way studios try to increase profits on movies by releasing and then rereleasing with more extras, more footage, ect.I have been waiting for Sin City to come out for purchase since I saw it in theaters. This is how movies based on graphic novels should be shot. So the original literature comes to life. Not in a cheap knockoff movie that only loosly follows the source material like other films. I only wish ""V for Vendetta"" was being done with the respect to the original style and vision Sin City was. That is a fantastic graphic novel and I highly recommend it.Anyway, I feel sorry for everyone who bought the first version, they'll have a harder time reselling it after this expanded one comes out. But really, this move was so obvious. The origianl version has such a short list of DVD extras (almost none) that everyone should have known another version would be coming out, so I didn't buy the original. This is EXACTLY what happened with Pulp Fiction, and today you can't even find the original DVD release in video rental, they only carry the ""Collector's Edition""."	4.0	I KNEW IT!	2005-09-17	3	2	1

But the fact is, this film (based on Frank Miller's graphic comics) and its directors (Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller himself) should be commended. Shot entirely behind green screen technology this film does, in many ways, what the Matrix did by redefining movie-making and what we will see on the big-screen in the future. Simply stated, this movie is an unapologetic feast for the eyes; everything you'd expect from a movie titled ""Sin City."" But because of the recent split within Miramax the ""Special Edition"" version of Sin City won't be out until next year some time, but if you're a fan or could care less about the extra features (for now), then jump right on in, the water is fine."	5.0	Everything You'd Expect	2005-08-20	3	1	2

It's kind of a cross between a black and white comic book and real actors...no not Roger Rabbit!  What really makes this movie great are the emotions and personalities of the characters.

078886047X	Sin City	A39YZF4O904AA5	"Chi Hyon Yi ""thunderer"""	I think Miller likes to take things to the next levels and be extreme. In an interview I read he liked the works of Ayn Rand, and her novel the Fountainhead. The character of Howard Roark in the novel is echoed in the villianous Roark characters in Sin City. I think Miller is commenting on free will taken to the extreme and shows the negative side of this in his work of Sin City. Where as Rand is optimistic, Miller is the pessimist. In a world where film noir is taken to the next level, Politics and Religious figures take advantage of their power and commit sexual acts without remorse. (...) Where everyone is pretty much the antihero and where men become caricatures of a film noir hero, our heroes have become bad and the antiheroes have to run wild exacting proper justice. Even the action in the work becomes a little ridiculous because I think Miller is caricaturing the world and shows us that this film noir world is extreme and extreme action must be taken and sometimes this is ridiculous. Miller is showing us the evolution of the film noir and that means, taken to the extreme, being a man means to be brutish lug who slap around helpless females. He is showing their evolution of their negative nature right? But the white light is love in this ying yang relationship in film noir, that is worth fighting for.	5.0	evolution of film noir	2005-05-03	5	2	3

Unfortunately, a movie should do more than just look great. The throwaway dialogue and cliche self-destructive characters coupled with the non-stop over the top violence, seems to have no point, other than to overload us with bullets and blood, not to mention enough view of skin, to keep teenage boys busy for awhile.

078886047X	Sin City	A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ	Chris Fung	"Sin City is definitely one of the must-see movies for this century, but be warned, this is not your regular kind of movie. If you want to see pedestrian, boring fantasy movie making, or trite, one-dimensional moralizing, stick to the horrendousness that is the Star Wars Prequels.Frank Miller's Sin City is far, far more than just a splatter-fest although it's got violence a-plenty.  If violence worries you at all, then DON'T GO.  However, if you can dig it, then I'll say this: the physical violence in this movie is deliberately cartoonish, and therefore much less psychically scarring than say ""Silence of the Lambs"".  There's other kinds of violence in Miller's creative work, however and on that I'll say more later.The movie is visually beautiful. It is _very_ much in keeping with Miller's graphic novels, but whilst  the graphic novels were completely black and white, Sin City the movie is actually super-saturated dark blues and grays. There is very little real black in the movie except Rosario Dawson's outfit  (what little there was of it anyway).This point has also been made before but it's worth saying again:  The movie is NOT meant to be realistic. This is the key to Frank Miller's whole visual style (of which more below).  If you like your movies literal and simpering then STAY AWAY from this movie. You won't like it, and you don't belong in the movie theater.As many, many other people have pointed out, the movie is _meant_  to be stylized, so the acting, the dialog and the visual style are all meant to be larger than life. Good grief. Have we become so blinkered, mentally-enslaved and unimaginative as a society that people can't even figure that out?  What stylization does is allow the ideas and emotional contours in the movie (and in Miller's graphic novels) to become more salient.  As with other non-realist forms of art, the deliberate break from naturalistic images allows us to see past the images to the ideas and feelings beneath them, and that's what a lot of people seem to have missed.On the subject of the acting, yes Mickey Rourke and Benicio did great jobs, but they also had the best lines.  I think the WOMEN in this movie acted their asses off, especially given the limited amount of talking they had.  What this meant was that a lot had to be conveyed by physical movement and facial expression.  Dawson did this wonderfully as Gail, the leader of the Second Amendment -hoisting prostitutes, and Jessica Alba did a pretty good job too although she hid way too much behind her  ""Little Nancy"" persona. This, I think, gave her much less to work with and so Alba's Nancy wasn't nearly as interesting a character as Dawson's Gail.  Personally I thought Devon Aoki's Miho was great.  No emoting, but then she wasn't supposed to. Before the movie came out, I had read some fan-boy stuff about how Zhang Ziyi would have been a better choice for Miho, but I don't think so.  Ms. Zhang is far too given to facial histrionics. Ms Aoki was perfect.  Also excellent was Brittany Murphey as Shellie the waitress, this was a spot-on casting decision, as Shellie has Murphey's Jersey Girl persona written all over her.Lastly, one of the defining themes in Miller's writing career from ""Batman: the Dark Knight Returns"", through ""Ronin"" and ""Daredevil"" to Sin City, is his profound contempt for the hypocrisy and self-servingness of those in authority.  Those who are attracted to order and paternal moralism will hate this movie because these are exactly the things that Miller has his characters take on.  One of the things that Sin City and Dark Knight share is the stark distinction between violence you do while doing the right thing and violence done while going along to get paid, or because you enjoy using your authority to prey on others. _This_ is the difference between the villains and the heroes in this movie.Violence then, in Miller and Rodriguez's world becomes a way for the dispossessed to reclaim their dignity and agency.  It's fantasy, it's id-laden but it's meant to be a work of fiction not a blue print for social justice.Note that Miller does not say that violence is 100% successful: Both Marv and Hartigan must die at the end of their respective vengeance quests.  In fact, the only male figure who survives is (interestingly) Dwight, the only guy who allies himself with powerful female characters (Rosario Dawson's Gail and Devon Aoki's Miho). Lone males, it seems, are more vulnerable than men and women working together.Miller's Sin City  is definitely less diverse and more androcentric than the Wachowskis' Matrix universe, but you don't have to be PC all the time to make a useful point.  Sure the prostitutes were all female, and sure this leaves the whole business of who the sex trade is set up for to one side. But the prostitutes in Sin City were independant workers, running their own society without male bosses and profiteers (a very far cry from the real-world sex trade, of course) and their independance is what they were fighting to protect.  For this reason, and because the real villains in this peice were all male. I think this is a far more complex movie than a lot of people want to think it is.  Skimpy outfits and sex work does not simply equate to misogyny.Go see this movie. It is a complex and compelling riff on morality, friendship, fighting city hall and (mostly) losing, getting old and getting by.  The delighted vengefulness which imbues this movie comes from nothing so much as our own outrage when the suits and their toadying minions stomp down on the rest of us: ""Kill him for me Marv. Kill him good."""	5.0	Free your mind and your *** will follow	2005-04-14	3	3	0

078886047X	Sin City	A33IZJVCKFKDPU	Chris	"As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's ""Graphic"" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie.  The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.  However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good-doers, but they are also crooks (with the exception of Bruce Willis' character, John Hartigan).  This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City.For the most part, this movie plays out like a Quentin Tarentino film.  The movie consists of three stories, which are not in chronological order, that eventually intertwine with eachother.  The first of those stories is about aging cop John Hartigan trying to save young Nancy Callahan from a serial rapist.  Hartigan gets betrayed by his partner (Michael Madsen) and is set-up for the kidnapping and an alleged rape.  This story concludes at the end of the movie.The second story revolves around Marv (Mickey Rourke).  Marv is a big, ugly guy that has a beautiful girl come into his life one day and he can't figure out why.  Well, she is murdered and Marv is set-up for the crime.  This eventually spirals into Marv going on a hunt for the person who killed his ""angel"".  The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.  With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his ""angel"" for a showdown.The female escorts also help out Dwight (Clive Owen) in the thrid story.  Dwight becomes involved with a waitress (Brittany Murphy) and has to deal with her one-time companion Jack (Benicio Del Toro), who is the type of guy that always has a posse follow him around for protection purposes.  Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.  Its Dwight's job to try to prevent this truce from ending and to prevent a sort of ""mob war"".All of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.  Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.  As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.  The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.  Also the colorization of the film is also something that has never been done before.  Some characters or particular item have color, while the majority of the film is in a black comic book looking color.  The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect.My suggestion would be to see this film.  It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.  Also, the film may have changed the comic book genre forever.  If you have a weak heart, this may be too violent.  Otherwise, if you enjoy action movies with a good storyline and great visuals, then you should definately check out this movie."	5.0	It Would Be a 'Sin' To Miss This One	2005-04-03	8	7	1

Yes! It is. Violent. Grisly. But, beautifully shot and designed. From the rain, to the snow, to the faces, to the colors and yes... the blood.All who were involved with Sin City earned some serious brownie points with me because you gave us what we all have been hungry for, for so long. You took us and our imaginations to a new place. You told us stories that pulled no punches and kept us on our toes.In a slew of Non-original, cookie-cutter, same old same old films, mixed with all the lack of new idea remakes, SIN CITY proved to me that the film business still has a pulse.Sin City, with a phenominal cast (Mickey Rourke may have saved his career here), delivered on a phenominal level. With its 60s style and Humphrey Bogartish delivery, it packed a tremendous punch of creativity, design, grit and grime.With it's beautiful black and white colors and the occasional splash of red, it moves like a painting... with 3 intertwining stories of the inhabitants of Sin City. The low, the lower and the even lower... with an occassional splash of righteousnous.Yet, after watching Sin City, I couldn't help thinking that there were so many more stories to be told. I want to see more, and I want to read Frank Miller's books now.  I want to see Senator Roarke get what he deserves!!  He has to!This movie is great. It really is. If anything, even if you don't like violence, hitting the play button, YOU WILL see something new, original and CREATIVE.Finally... I'm only giving it 4 stars because the DVD is sorta bare bones...

That alone is an amazing achievement and I wish I ended up liking the movie more than I did.There are 3 different stories told here, all taking place in the title location of Sin City. Mickey Roarke plays a low life trying to avenge the murder of a prostitute who showed him kindness. The second story has Clive Owen, a murderer, seeking revenge on Benicio Del Toro, a low-life cop, on behalf of his new girlfriend. The last tale is an odd love story between old washed-up cop Bruce Willis and the girl he saves from a psycho when she is 11.The cast is wonderful on paper, but not all of them give good performances. Some of the dialog and voice-over narration is very well done and some is laughably bad. The film overall is too long and drags after awhile. There is a lot of violence and blood which I have no problem with, except that it was overdone. There comes a point when it doesn't mean anything anymore.This movie affected me somewhat, but not completely. It is darkly beautiful to look at, even through all the blood.	3.0	3.5 stars--Visually stunning	2005-12-11	9	5	4
078886047X	Sin City	A1CGRM83IQNBGE	Christopher Oliva	"The task, or the responsibility, of a director to take on a project involving the adaptation of a comic book is crucial.  It is crucial in respects of getting the job done.  It is critical for the director to capture the spirit of the story, characters and setting.  If this is not achieved, then the project fails.  This is why most comic book, or in this case graphic novel, adaptation to film does not achieve the superiority that Sin City surpasses.This is the best comic book or graphic novel film ever made.  Frank Miller's Sin City is a creation beyond the imaginative nightmare.  It has style with fashion, affection and hate.  It chills your bones, makes you squirm forcing a smile out of you where you can't help but feel the adrenaline-charged images on the screen as if you were experiencing them.  Robert Rodriguez has ingeniously redefined ""reproduction"" in a new postmodern experience.  The replica on the screen is incredibly audacious and it achieves itself as a visual masterpiece, exploring our subconscious of colors and graphic images with characters we love to hate and hate to love.Done on a scale of almost all computer generation with no real sets, the film captures the reality of the environment the characters are situated in that we do not feel in the CGI that we are exposed to, or see, in films like Troy (2004).  For most films, computer generation does not work because actors do not act real to the environment.  In Sin City we have a story and setting that fits the medium that Rodriguez and Miller create.Sin City has three intertwining stories told at separate time periods involving us much like Pulp Fiction (1994).  These stories follow Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen).  They work within a framing device that opens and closes the door on us in the world of Sin City.  Hartigan is an almost sixty year old cop trying to catch a pedophile (Nick Stahl) that has kidnap a young girl named Nancy.  He is beat, broken down and worn out, but understands his duty and will cross the line to get it done.  Marv is about two or three times the size of a defensive lineman who is out to seek justice for the murderer of Goldie (Jaime King), a hooker with a ""heart of gold.""  He loves her and will stop at nothing, no matter what the consequence, to seek equity in his eyes.  Dwight wants to protect his girl, Shellie (Brittany Murphy), from Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro).  He is a cool clever guy that accidentally gets involved in a war.  This is the story where Tarantino puts his signature as the guest director.  The stories each start our engines with interest with Hartigan cracking down on the pedophile, Marv waking up next to a dead Goldie, and Dwight in a jam with Jackie Boy and his girl.  The film follows these three stories but involves us in many others with vividly fresh characters played by Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett and numerous others.The film recreates the film noir of the golden days where the characters on the screen acted as gods of cinema.  This film is visually stunning and the characters are just as extreme as the stories.  Sam Spade couldn't even survive this town.  Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino give Sin City a touch of elegance and a bath of brilliance."	5.0	Visually Stunning Reproduced Film Noir	2005-05-03	3	2	1

078886047X	Sin City	A148WZM02X2DVI	"Cinema Crazed ""Terminal"""	"Cannibal teens, psychotic hookers, talking dead bodies, yellow skinned child rapists, and a disfigured psycho with an affinity for trench coats. The third corner of hell? No, it's all mundane in Sin City, thus is the oddities presented in the Frank Miller created series of graphic novels. Miller set forth a legacy in 1991 when he created a series of incomparable visionary graphic novels called ""Sin City"" which had no superheroes, no intergalactic madmen, and no demonic entities, only the horror of mankind and the back alleys of the worst city in the world. Miller created a dark grim neo-noir series that would forever be revered among comic book creators, and when this movie was set to release, I never read any of the issues. While, being a hardcore comic geek I was aware of Sin City, I had never read the novels, and I bought them as soon as possible, and I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps it's something within mankind the series reflects, taboos that Miller tackles within the smoky haze, never-ending darkness, and introversion amidst the heroes whom are constantly teetering over to the dark side to justify the means.One thing Frank Miller mastered with this series was though the books basically examined evil men fighting evil men, you could easily distinguish which people were fighting for a good cause and which people weren't. ""Sin City"" is an amazing series of comic books with incredible stories of crime and vengeance and director Robert Rodriguez presents a 99 percent accurate depiction in his adaptation of the hit series. Rodriguez sacrificed a lot for the sake of converting the series to the big screen and having Miller along with him directing at his side, they created one incredible piece of filmmaking that will surely become a classic. For years, even to this day, pretentious bookworms still like to refer to comic books as nothing but a kids medium with nothing to add to intellect or even imagination, but Miller basically proved them wrong turning a kids medium into an versatile medium with series and stories worthy of literature.Sin City is not for kids, and as evident by the R rating, Rodriguez does not shy away from the violent content featured so prominently in the book. For people who have yet to read the books, they'll be disgusted and simply offended by the violent content featured, but the violent content does manage to bear a relevance in the books presenting the grim atmosphere present only in noir. And perhaps the most annoying of the crowd of skeptics and critics are the neo-feminists who basically dismissed this movie as sexist and misogynistic to women when basically men are depicted basically the same way. Women are hookers, lesbians, and sadomasochists, men are rapists, child molesters, killers, and abuse women. See how it all evens out Ms. L.S. from a certain Entertainment magazine? Well, they're basically wrong, and ignorant in their ways. Childish, ain't I?Rodriguez along with Miller at his side manages to capture the mood perfectly for the book with everything from the comic books adapted on the screen with pin point accuracy, and this comic book fan is pleased. I loved the series, and was satisfied to see Rodriguez stuck true to the source material featuring a world comprised mostly of computer generated effects but manages to accurately capture the mood and dark atmosphere in which the tales take place. The story is set with three segments, all intertwined with one another to make the fluid story of Sin City, all of which is topped off with an amazing all-star cast of actors including Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and many other people from Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro right down to the bad-ass Powers Boothe, all of which are mixed in the tale of Sin City; and all of the dramatic operas are about vengeance and revenge, not to mention the great opening, and closer, which was the first time I actually enjoyed seeing Josh Hartnett on screen. I'd have to devote a list to the number of stars who appeared in this film, but it is surely an ensemble piece that even made Jaime King look talented! That's a feat in itself that Rodriguez and Miller accomplish.The entire cast gives excellent performances and a few performances basically stood out for me, especially a certain Mickey Rourke who is just bad ass as the disfigured Marv who is framed for killing the only girl who ever loved him, and then there's Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson whom are just great in their segment. The most dramatic of the segments is left for last starring Bruce Willis as retired cop John Hartigan who nearly kills the senator's son, who happens to be a child killer, and is framed for the crime. The segment includes three good performances from Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and Nick Stahl who plays bad so, so good. I wish he were the villain more often. The movie, which has been compared to ""Pulp Fiction"" (I love the books but that comparison is a bit of a hyperbole, and I'm not even a Tarantino fan), is one of the best comic book movies ever made, simply because it keeps the original quality of the book while losing none of the cache from the stories and never compromises Miller's artistic integrity which Hollywood would have originally done, and Rodriguez as always gives some amazing direction.The storyboards for the film consisted of pages from the actual comic used, and it's like taking scenes from a movie on to a new movie. Miller always prided himself in being a rebel. Having had many bad experiences with Hollywood, he declared that he'd make his books like movies, and the man is brilliant. Read his work on Daredevil, Batman, and this series, and you shall see. You shall see, my friend. Miller is like a movie director who never was. If studio execs, my mortal enemy, hadn't jerked this guy around, he would have made an amazing director, and it took Rodriguez, another Hollywood stalwart to see that. It takes brilliance to notice brilliance, and Rodriguez did much of the movie's work in his own home studio and really managed to pack a wallop of the movie for fans of both comics and noir, and Rodriguez doesn't alienate non-comic book fans, he invites people to bask in the excellence that is Sin City, but he does something some studios have yet to do, he honors the fans in the process. Seriously, I can discuss this movie forever, but I'll spare you the extra reading.Hot chicks, big guns, bad ass bruisers, what more could you ask for? This is neo-noir for the new millennium baby, and one of the best comic book movies ever made that noir fans will also really enjoy. Yes, the line above was clich&eacute;, but I don't care, this movie rocked with excellent performances, great stories, great direction, and just a hip style that hasn't been achieved since ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie kicks Hollywood in the nuts, and I hope they felt that."	5.0	Miller's spirit on screen--	2005-09-14	5	2	3

So, I probably wouldn't be interested in seeing the comic for this. But I have to say that this is absolutlely, the most stupid, pathetic, movie I've ever seen. If I could rate it with 0 stars, I would. After about 5-10 minutes, I completely lost interest. For the first time in my life of watching movies, I felt like getting up and walking out. However, I didn't as I was with a friend. Partway through the movie, my friend told me she didn't care for the movie either and we both said that we couldn't wait for it to end. Afterwards, my friend and I talked about how horrible the movie was. Other people in the theatre also mentioned their displeasure with the movie.

078886047X	Sin City	A305VLFLU7BOH1	C. K. Mayne	Frank millers sin city was the high light of 2005. this was what films were supposed to be, unique and spellbinding. and now comes a worthy dvd. the dark stylish basin city has never been so appealing. the first disk features the orginal cut and a few special features. they don't last that long but are informative and get straight to the point. the second disk features the extended cut but there are only a few minutes added and a few seconds here and there but it's exiting to see what's been added. there are some good additions like the green screen cut of the film where you watch the film speeded up in it's orginal green screen format. but there are some strange editions like the breakfast tacos cooking school.the only real problem is the packaging. it's really flimsy and it bends easily. the copy of the hard goodbye is loose and because it moves around it only damages the packaging even more. it looks really nice but that just makes it worse when it gets damaged.overall one of the best films ever made gets one of the best dvd treatments ever.i wouldn't give it any lower then 5 stars because the film and extras are what i paid for not the packaging.can't wait for Sin City 2 + 3	5.0	mind blowing but bad packaging	2006-02-21	1	0	1

078886047X	Sin City	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that ""Sin City"" was being made into a movie, I shuddered.  I could just imagine what Hollywood would do to it: cast it wrong, colorize it, water it down, change crucial plot points, sap it like ""Howard the Duck.""My spirits lifted when I learned it would be directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, though I wasn't sure what to make of the fact that so much of it would be digitally generated.In the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print-to-screen adaptation as this.  The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique.I liked this movie a lot but at the same time, it left me feeling a little strange.  It's like seeing your favorite indie band suddenly catapaulted from obscurity to arena-sized stages, hearing your favorite obscure song become a Top Ten hit.It also made me wish there was a way I could've experienced it without having read the books first, because if you've read the books, you know almost every single thing that's going to happen when and how it's going to happen.  That's more a criticism of myself as a reader/viewer than it is of the artist or filmmakers. On the other hand, as close as the transition is, the material still unavoidably loses something when recreated in live action, just by the nature of the severity of the actions.  Miller's sharp images are paced as precisely as rifle reports and there's a strange difference between, say, seeing a drawing of Marv dragging a man behind his car and seeing several seconds of footage of Marv dragging a man behind his car.  Still, had I been given the choice between seeing an accurate adaptation and a bad adaptation, I definitely would've chosen this one.  This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation."	4.0	A labor of love for fans of the books (+one reader's regret)	2005-04-25	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1I7FEEO6UOIBJ	"Clayton ""Clay"""	I thought that Sin City was an instant classic. I thought that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller had made an awesome movie. I also thought that the guest directing of Quentin Tarantino was amazing. Even though I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 1 or 2, I think that Sin City will be a great film for the ages. Also, the cast all played amazing roles in the movie and the casting directors all picked the right people for the movie. Here is my review about the casting and the directors job:First off, the casting call was an amazing job. I thought that when I saw the movie that they looked actually like the real comic. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is saving a girl named Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a bunch of killers. First off, I thought that the casting of Bruce Willis and Nancy Callahan as Jessica Alba was an amazing choice because he has the scar and he has the look and everything. I think that this story was an amazing choice because Bruce going against the Yellow Bastard was an awesome scene and a story.In the beginning, The Man (Josh Hartnett) and Shellie (Brittany Murphy) start talking about the city and how much of a sin it is. Then, The Man shoots Shellie, but she lives and the movie starts.Then it starts off with Marv (Mickey Rourke) getting with a girl named Goldie (Jaime King). Then, she dies with no scars and no bruises by a guy named Kevin (Elijah Wood). First, the casting of Mickey Rourke of Marv was like it just happened for him because I thought that he looked exactly like Marv. So, Marv goes on a rampage and goes looking for the killer of Goldie until he meets up with a girl named Wendy who is the twin of Goldie. The two go on a rampage and get the killer Kevin. In the end, Marv is in trouble with the cops and the people. In the end, he is in prison with an electric chair and he is dead. Goldie and Kevin were great casting calls for the movie.The second and final (since I told the last one), is about people named Dwight, Shellie, and Jackie Boy. Dwight (Clive Owen) is on a run to save the hookers of Sin City and trying to get the head of Jackie Boy, that the cops have so far. Shellie (Brittany Murphy) is in the beginning of this story trying to stop Jackie Boy (Bencio Del Toro) to abusing her. When Jackie Boy goes to the bathroom, Dwight goes and kills him, not knowing that he is a cop. When he finds out that he is a cop, he's got to stop the rest of the cops so that they don't find out about his head. He teams up with Miho (Devon Aoki) to save the person that he loves who happens to be Gail (Rosario Dawson) from Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) and the person that told them, Becky (Alexis Bledel). Although Becky lives, the rest of the cops die and Gail and Dwight are happily together in Sin City.I think that Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job making this a black and white movie with some color (kind've like the comic). Although, when I first heard of this movie, I wasn't really excited to see this movie. Then, I read some reviews and heard from people that this is an awesome movie. I watched it and it is way better than most of the movies that I have seen lately. Great casting calls for all of the people and make sure that you go and you watch this movie because you will not be dissapointed.In a rating for this movie out of ten, it will give it a 9/10.Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity, and sexual content including dialogue.	5.0	A Great Movie With Lots Of Action	2005-08-27	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	A303IXEFASLHN4	Clifford Lynn	I rate this movie 4&1/2 stars. The movie surrounds 3 major story lines that is not your typical linear film but does eventually connect,  like Pulp Fiction or Go. I first saw this movie with low expectatcions due to all the negative vibe surrounding the film from word of mouth. Some of these critics are much too hard on films that is not meant to be taken seriously!! It's a comic book movie with an ultra violent tone and is not for everyone. If you like movies like Fight Club, Four Rooms, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, I think you will not be disappointed. What are we all so politically correct that we have to set proper guidelines to make it a good movie?  The tone of the movie is very well done with the scenery of the set, the black and white vintage feel with emphasis of color on eyes, lips and other features that I feel are important characteristics that bring out the characters and style.  The mood and music is very well done! Also an extremely good all star cast for the film.  Jessica Alba is supper hot, and so is Rosario Dawson in this film.  5 stars on the film scoring for Robert Rodriguez.  One of the best films of 2005 for sure!!	5.0	Excellent movie!!

078886047X	Sin City	A3AQDK1F0YQKAS	"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado"""	Wow. 'Sin City' is an uncompromising, no-holds barred, in your face, brutal, raw, and savage cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions. This is an instant classic, but be warned, it's not for the faint of heart or those who lack intestinal fortitude.I was blown away by the look and feel of this movie. It's so dark and gritty that one can practically taste the blood and evil that oozes off the screen. The characters, heroes and villains and alike were seriously hardcore, and so real their presence was undeniable. What I particularly liked was that the heroes were more like anti-heroes, Marv in particular, whose character traits were morally ambiguous although ultimately one of the quintessential good guys.My hats off to Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino for pouring their heart and soul into this incredible realization of a complex and unique tale of the classic good vs. evil. Their passion for film making shows and combined with the incredible cast as well as the comic book look, they've revolutionized film making forever by combining heretofore unused styles and concepts. They took a risk by going all out as far as violence, nudity and atmosphere goes, and it paid off, big time. I can't emphasize how thrilled I am that a movie is finally made the way it was MEANT to be, rather than trying to appeal to a certain demographic, or trying to be mainstream.The film was quite different than I expected it to be, definitely far more violent, but it's still an experience unlike any other. Escapism at its best because it transports the audience from reality into a whole other world that is frighteningly alot like our own in many ways. A parallel world in a sense, but where the sins of mankind are put in a rather clear perspective. I liked the plot element of the church and government represented as these evil entities and what measures and ideologies that both institutions condone and sometimes embrace wholly. Granted it was extreme symbolism but not too far from the truth in terms of principle, and by juxtaposing those horrible sins of society to the backdrop of a primarily black and white existence, humanity's corruption is highlighted and contrasted, ultimately raising awareness as to how morally bankrupt our own world is, primarily on the level of men in power.I have seen two different half hour specials on the behind the scenes making of 'Sin City' which provides interviews with most of the cast as well as the directors and others involved with the project. It's obvious that the directors produced a labor of love, and the cast were immersed in their parts and totally dedicated to realizing Frank Miller's dream. As Miller said himself, this film is a dream come true.About the only thing I didn't like about the film was Bruce Willis' character's ending. To me that contradicted his gumption and integrity, and really didn't make too much sense.That aside, the film is brilliant on all levels. For once CGI was used properly and complemented the story and characters rather than becoming the focal point. I enjoyed the humor in this film, and it was nice with some comic relief in such a dark and disturbing setting. If you're a fan of action films and comic books set to a solid, deep story, by all means see this film.	4.0	Sin City Breaks the Mold	2005-11-13	3	1	2
078886047X	Sin City	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" is a bleak, foreboding cartoonish group of interlocking vignettes depicting the criminal element of corrupt Basin City.  The flick is stylishly filmed in predominantly black and white with occasional splashes of color to enhance the characters festooned against impressive computer generated backgrounds.  The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"".Pulp drama veteran Bruce Willis plays angina suffering cop Martigan who on the verge of retirement is compelled to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the clutches of Nick Stahl a psychotic rapist and killer.  The trouble is that Stahl is the son of corrupt Senator Roark, Powers Boothe and therefore protected.Mickey Rourke, whose style fits like a glove in ultra violent movies, plays career criminal, the seemingly indestructible Marv.He seeks to avenge the murder of a gorgeous hooker Goldie played by the attractive Jaime King.  Goldie was the only gal to ever pay the fierce looking Rourke, made up with facial and mandibular prostheses, any attention.  He goes on a killing spree that includes Elijah Wood, the cannibalistic murderer of his precious Goldie.Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro star in another of the seemingly relentlessly violent stories.  Owen plays Dwight, the avenging angel of the gorgeous prostitutes of Oldtown.  The automatic weapon toting prostitutes represented by Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, and Alexis Bledel among others are allowed to govern their turf in a deal forged with the cops.  This truce is threatened when dirty cop del Toro and his boys make trouble in Oldtown and wind up getting dispatched.  Owen helps the ladies quash the evidence that could topple the delicate balance that exists.Miller's slick transformation of his graphic novels to the screen using an impressive and formidible cast created a graphic yet highly entertaining movie experience."	5.0	An intense dark journey	2005-09-11	1	1	0
078886047X	Sin City	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	WARNING: This film contains graphic stylized violence including torture, as well as sexuality/nudity, coarse language, and disturbing themes.Only a sick and twisted mind could conceive of the warped stories that are found in the graphic novel series Sin City. Frank Miller is just such a mind. His morbid fascinations with corrupt authority figures, hypocritical religions, sleazy yet strong-willed women, and violent anti-heroes are thrust into the spotlight in his work. With his comic books and graphic novels, we are given a disturbing glimpse into his worldview. His characters are tainted with cynicism, darkened by madness, haunted by guilt, plagued by lust, and drenched in blood. Naturally his stories have been a commercial success despite their controversial subject matter, so it's no surprise that Hollywood producers, directors, and writers have sought to adapt them into films. This is something Frank Miller has always been reluctant to allow... up until now that is. Filmmakers and friends, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino unite their perverse adolescent minds and together they bring Frank Miller's Sin City to vivid life in a stark and oppressing film, which will leave its viewers desiring a thorough shower in order to wash away the residue of the film's immoral characters.Basin City, better known to its inhabitants as Sin City, is a shady underworld of crime and corruption. It's a place where crooked cops patrol the streets, where serial killers and sex offenders go free, where the church buries its own sins, and the noblest men are psychotic vigilantes. In this dog-eat-dog environment, only the strong survive and the pressures and strain of survival fracture the human psyche. No one is innocent, no one is pure and even Sin City's most charismatic denizens are scum. In this world diversion takes the form of strip bars and brothels, evil hides behind the mask of propriety, and revenge and redemption are the same.The film is divided into three stories. They are:1. Detective Hartigan has been tracking down a powerful senator's son, who kidnaps, rapes, and murders young girls. Hartigan is betrayed by another cop, his partner in fact, who is under the pay of the senator. Hartigan takes the fall for the senator's son only to protect one of the intended victims. Years later he is let out of jail and tries to save that same girl from the senator's wrath, but she has become a stripper and fallen in love with Hartigan, the man who once saved her. Soon Hartigan realizes that he was part of a plan to bring her out into the open where the senator's son can carry out his wicked desires.2. Dwight is an enigmatic criminal with a soft spot for damsels in distress. When his new girlfriend is beaten up by her abusive ex, Dwight plans to teach him a lesson. Dwight chases him into the red light district where a band of vigilante prostitutes kills him, only to discover that he was a cop with a destructive ego. Now Dwight and the prostitutes must fend off corrupt officials and the mob in order to keep their territory to themselves.3. Meanwhile Marv, a deformed schizophrenic brute, seeks bloody retribution after the woman he slept with is killed and he's framed for the murder. In his attempt to solve the mystery of her death and avenge her, he discovers a plot that leads to one of the city's most powerful families, corruption within the government, police force, and the church. He pulls off his brutal revenge but he ultimately pays the price in the end.These three tales interlock like pieces to a sinister puzzle, each piece bringing the audience closer to the story's completion, showing us the seedy underbelly of Basin City from multiple perspectives.Much like Pulp Fiction in its fragmented narrative, Sin City unfolds out of chronological order, which is perhaps the film's greatest flaw. However the film is boosted by the dramatic visual style of Miller, Rodriguez, and Tarantino who imbue it with the atmosphere of a 1940s noir film and the savage violence of 1970s action cinema. Most of the movie was shot against a green screen and then CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) artists created the surrounding environments. This made it possible for the filmmakers to replicate Frank Miller's graphic style; the high contrast black and white metropolis, the inverted shadows cast upon brick walls, the saturated red of blood splatters, and the golden yellow of a vixen's hair.The morally ambivalent characters are brought to life by a talented ensemble cast including Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Marley Shelton, Nick Stahl, Bruce Willis, and Elijah Wood.The film won't appeal to everyone. It's gratuitous depictions of violence and sex are proof of that. However, if taken with a grain of salt, Sin City is an entertainingly over-the-top exploitation masterpiece that faithfully recreates Frank Miller's imaginative graphic novels.Also recommended:Frank Miller's Complete Sin City LibraryFilm Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's EditionReservoir DogsPulp FictionKill Bill Vol. 1Kill Bill Vol. 2El MariachiDesperadoOnce Upon a Time in Mexico	4.0	A Grim and Gritty Modern Noir	2008-08-21	0	0	0

The acting is great and very reminiscient of older films, and the film has a dark, edgy, highly stylistic look to it (thanks undoubtedly to the comics, of course). Black and white with instances of color works really well for the film. I love the fact that two of Sin City's chapters (the first and the third one) have enough emotional depth to match their film noir feel. And the second chapter is just a balls-out action flick, and a sort of a nice respite from the other stories. For some it might seem out of place, but it worked great for me.I can't say enough great things about Sin City. It's just that good.	5.0	Breathtaking visuals and great stories.	2005-04-18	2	1	1

078886047X	Sin City	AHGA03S51E73I	crystalcrys	">>They call it ""Sin City"".  Maybe that's why I didn't like it.In all truthfulness, it was a REALLY good movie.  No use in doubting that.  It was a REALLY good movie, and yet......I didn't like it.Apart from being just a little too long, by the time we reached the half-point of the film, I was already sick of it.  Yes, it's called ""Sin City"" and there is a reason why it's called ""Sin City"", with all the violence and brutality and sleaziness helping the film live up to its name--its title, but the fact of the matter is, they exhausted all those entities, along with others, to the core.In the first hour, I was amazed by Sin City.  Its luminescent, lucid, at times blazing, grades of black and white.  Its piercing action and racy dialogue.  The unexpected outbursts of red, yellow, green, and blue.  The characters you find yourself enchanted with, the characters you rush to hate and hesitate to love.  All this, the first hour gave me.But then, the film ran on....and on.  They exhausted their use of violence, gore, and brutality.  It really did make me kinda sick.  There were parts at which I felt like gagging.  Too MUCH gore.  Too MUCH brutality.  ""Sin City"" &lt;--no lie.  Maybe I should of expected all that ""sin"", but really, they exhausted this word, too.  Many characters got the sh*t beat out of em.  Likewise, this film got the sh*t beat out of it.  By gore, by brutes, by sleazy, twisted men, who made me feel like screaming.  I sat, writhing in my seat, finding no other solution to my fuming awkwardness.They threw the blood at us, and it became annoying.  An overly excessive use of gore.  I can take it in moderation, hell, I can take a lot.  SIN is not just gore.  Makes you wonder if they realize that.  GORE is a product of sin, but it is not its equivalent.Once again, this film is REALLY good.  But I didn't like it."	3.0	It's a REALLY good movie, but I didn't like it.	2005-04-09	7	5	2
078886047X	Sin City	A2RLK9KKVGEETZ	"C. Tsao ""Seaview1"""	Frank Miller, the lord of graphic comic novels, has been given his just due in a sumptuously stylized film version of his Sin City.  Lovingly brought to the screen by Robert Rodriguez with an assist by buddy Quentin Tarantino, this tale of vengeance and lust in a dark metropolis is unlike any movie in recent years in terms of consistent technique and visuals serving a group of interconnected stories in which the outcasts of civilization engage in urban survival while attempting to maintain a sense of honor and love.  It is also an extremely violent film.On a dark, rainy night, three major stories parallel each other.  The first story has Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) search for a missing girl before a serial killer strikes again. With his unsavory partner, Bob (Michael Madsen), he finally tracks down the killer in a bang-up finish, or is it?  A separate story has a brutish exconvict, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who seeks revenge for the murder of a hooker.  He is befriended by a parole officer, Lucille (Carla Gugino), a waitress, Shellie (Britanny Murphy), a stripper, Nancy (Jessica Alba), and a hooker, Gail (Rosario Dawson).  His search for the killer pulls him into a grisly world of murder led by psychopaths, dirty cops, and corrupt, political leaders.  Another story has a loner, Dwight (Clive Owen), protect his waitress girlfriend from a gang led by Jack (Benicio Del Toro) and a mob boss, Manute (Michael Clark Duncan).  Things come full circle once events unfold, and surprises are unveiled with seemingly unrelated events and characters linked together.To say more would spoil a smorgasbord of film noir and stylized action.  There are some clever plot twists and surprises along the way.  People's loyalties are constantly in question, and the three male leads are surrogate avengers for justice, redemption and salvation. The film's structure is reminiscent of Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction and even P. T. Anderson's Magnolia where various people meet in a series of vignettes and affect others who are seemingly unconnected.  There are moments that seem influenced by past films.  Certainly Sam Raimi's (Spiderman) earlier Darkman was a direct precursor to Sin City.  There is a scene with Clive Owen driving with a corpse that is a sort of homage to the 1945 horror classic The Body Snatchers.  Rutger Hauer plays a religious leader in a scene not unlike the scene in Blade Runner where ironically Hauer reversed roles as an assassin in that film.  A marvelous action piece with a female samurai warrior has all the earmarks of Tarantino who picks up where Kill Bill left off.It is fascinating to watch what is essentially a pre-storyboarded film with the graphic novel serving as a blueprint for the film.  `Shot and cut' by Rodriguez himself, the film feels very consistent with a true auteur's vision.  Frank Miller imagined it, and Rodriguez made it happen.  This is Rodriguez' most assured film thus far, and it is a living, breathing comic book in the best sense.  Despite the wide commercial appeal of successful comic adaptations of Spiderman and X-Men, Sin City is perhaps the most authentic and uncompromising transfer of such material.  Much of what is depicted onscreen is predominantly a fabrication of computer generated special effects and trendsetting photography within which the actors interact.  The black and white photography is at times gorgeous and downright nightmarish with the strategically accented color schemes similar to the best shots in Pleasantville and Schindler's List.  There is no doubt that the visuals of this film have been achieved with painstaking detail and success.A dream cast features a wealth of actors and actresses, any two of whom could have front lined separate features on their own.  Willis and Owen are quite effective as heroic, yet flawed personas, but it is Mickey Rourke who is a standout in what amounts to a comeback film.  Even under his Frankenstein-like makeup, his humanity and toughness shine through.  He makes the most of a potentially ridiculous role.  In addition, while the males are mostly rugged, disheveled hulks, the females are beautiful and extremely sexy (sleazy?) to say the least.  Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, and Carla Gugino, (sorely missed from her brief Karen Sisko tv series) sizzle on the screen as they crossover different storylines.  The performances are all fairly convincing once you excuse the occasional, awkward voice over narration.Some things are left hanging plot wise.  Many characters are almost caricatures; we have to accept them at face value without much depth.  We never fully understand the psychopathic monster that is played by Elijah Wood.  Where did he come from and why is he purely evil?  Likewise, a partnership, betrayal, and reconciliation at the beginning of the film are never fully explored.  The dialogue is a bit Jekyll and Hyde with some hokey lines followed by a series of sharp, humorous ones.This is a film superficially filled with nudity, explicit language, taboo subject matter, and buckets of bloody violence.  This is going to be offensive to many people who are put off by intense scenes of mayhem, but to those who thrive on the film noir of adult comic books, it is a dream come true.If this adaptation is a one shot deal, the filmmakers gave it their best efforts.  It is entirely plausible to have a sequel with an entirely different cast (even though a number of the principles survive this entry.)  This movie is a splendid exercise in look and mood with emotional substance, no mean feat.  It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are game, just hang on and enjoy the ride.  Ironically, although Sin City is a graphic film in every sense of the word, this tale of haunted characters in an amoral world is ultimately a moral film.	4.0	Sin City is a triumph for hardcore fans	2005-03-31	13	11	2
078886047X	Sin City	A1Z3LU078VNOA6	C. Wynes	"Oh. My. God.  Blu-ray was made for this.Every single pore on an actor's face.Every single strand of an actor's hair.This is one of the two or three most impressive live-action blu-ray discs ever released.  The stylish part-animated scenes are beautiful with their detail in backgrounds and crispness in foregrounds.  The close-ups show every crater in every face, every reflection off a spot of blood on every cheek, every fuzzy hair on every lip or brow.  Even dark scenes have no apparent black crush.  Not a trace of disturbing film grain or digital noise touches this picture.  There may never be another occasion to make a film on blu-ray disc that is this pretty, this perfect in every respect.  The opening scene is one that many filmgoers have dreamt of seeing in beautiful digh-definition, with glourious colours added in just the right places, and finally here it is.A film noir mixed with comic-book sensibilities, ""Sin City"" is a masterpiece of popular art.  It's ""Pulp Fiction"" with better art direction and an even more stylized sense of the absurd setting.  It's the hardboiled detective's own incarnation of John Ford; it's the art house Akira Kurosawa for nihilists who wished they were romantics.The film is a visual treat, 90% black & white but with coloration added for artistic purpose in spare amounts.  Its detail and style are unparalleled.  Nobody makes a film like this anymore, nobody ever dared, and it's a miracle the Weinsteins funded this one in the first place.The Canadian blu-ray disc release got alot of positive press when the US version was yet unreleased.  The US version lives up to every expectation and is excellent in every respect.  If you have the DVD version of this film, this is one of the few I insist you upgrade to blu-ray.  But don't trade your old one in, as this one doesn't have the pack-in bonuses like the graphic novel included with the DVD edition."	5.0	A visual and story-telling treat for the ages	2009-07-18	9	8	1

078886047X	Sin City	A3JJBK5BEM1IJ	DAB II	This is a fantastic take on taking comic books to film. Robert Rodriquez's understanding of the comic book medium is what makes this film so wonderful. Even if you don't like Frank Miller's writing style, you have to appreciate the technical aspects of the film in adapting his stories to the screen. So far most comic book films are just re-created into a new story that is possible for both fans and new viewers to accept. With the exeception of Ghost World, the writer and artist has no real control of the movie. But with Sin City Frank Miller was involved as a director, so the stories stay pretty true to their roots. My only dissapointment is that there are not the traditional extra features of Robert Rodriguez DVD's. Like his 10 minute film school or mini documentaries on how he makes his films. Compared to Once Upon A Time In Mexico with the hours of extra features, I felt a bit shorted on this DVD with only one small featurette.	5.0	The best comic book adaptation so far.	2005-08-16	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	Ok so I already wrote a review for this, a pretty long one at that and for some reason it never showed up so I'm writing another one.  I wanted to say that this movie, although not AMAZING as some would think, was actually really really good for what it was.  I walked into this movie with different expectations, not to say that my expectations were better, just different.  I've never read the comics and maybe thats why it was so weird for me, but it stayed true to comic style in writing and camera shot.  Because of the comic style dialog it comes across quite corny.  That aside, you have to look at this film with different eyes.  Your not watching a film, your watching art.  And I might say, Rodriguez paints one amazing picture.  The imagry, the omage to Miller, the tribute to the comic was really amazing.  As I said, I've never read the comics, but after seeing the movie I picked up a few at the bookstore and flipped through, and I might have to say that Rodriguez did Miller proud.  The plot is full of twists and turns, small subplots that interwine together all involving strippers, hookers, canibals and pedophiles.  The first story revolves around Marv whos been set up by canibals to take the fall for the murder of a hooker.  He sets out to find her killer and ends up taking the rap for it in the end.  The second revolves around (Clive Owen) who is defending his girlfreind from her abusive x and starts a war between the hookers and the cops.  The last revolves around Hartigan (Bruce Willis)who in the opening saves a girl from being raped by a pedophile and is shot (what apears like to death) but we see is really hospitalized.  Things happen and 8 years pass and he now has the chance to save the now grown up stripper (played by Jessica Alba) from the pedophile again.  The plot is really moot compaired to the briliant way the film is shot.  The violence is brutal and relentless, but since 90% is done in black and white it really isn't as graphic as it could be and for all you horny men out there who are vying to see Jessica Alba naked...she doesn't!  The film is really a hodgepodge of scenes and to be quite frank after walking out it took me a while to rememeber what happened to whom.  Don't go for the acting, don't go for the story, go for Roberts art...and you'll be happy you did.	3.0	Different	2005-06-08	5	1	4

078886047X	Sin City	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	It's always a thrill to see a movie get the DVD treatment it deserves, and Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut - Extended - Unrated is a really fantastic package loaded to the gills with all kinds of good stuff.  If you're a Sin City fan, you'll want to just take a day off and indulge yourself in this ultimate Sin City experience - and it will take you the better part of a day to watch and go through everything this little box holds.  Even if you bought the regular DVD when it came out, I really think you'll want to upgrade to this special edition.I was unfamiliar with Frank Miller and his series of Sin City graphic novels.  When I first saw trailers for the film, all I knew was that Jessica Alba was in it, and that was reason enough for me to want to see it.  When you don't know Miller's work, the trailers for the film are hard to get your head around.  You're intrigued by the unique look of the film, with all the dark, gritty backgrounds and the selective use of color in certain scenes, but it isn't easy to figure out what the film is about, exactly.  When you do sit down and watch the film, you're just blown away: the whole look of the film is absolutely mesmerizing, unlike anything you've seen before; the cast is just full of one huge star after another turning in dazzling performances; the stories are dark and haunted and just draw you right in; but it's the characters most of all that captivate you.The film is really four stories assembled into one finished product.  The Customer is Always Right is a short introduction for what is to come - and then Marv takes over.  Marv is one of the most fascinating characters to come along in years.  He's a huge, ugly guy, a thug and killer you can't help but like and respect - and Mickey Rourke is simply amazing in the role.  Marv has the night of his life with a gorgeous woman named Goldie (Jaime King), then wakes up to find her dead.  Framed for the crime, Marv swears to find Goldie's killer, and he lets nothing stand in his way.  Even if it means dying, he's not going to back out - just because Goldie was nice to him.  There's plenty of violent action in this story, and Elijah Wood is surprisingly good as Kevin, an almost superhuman killer who eats his victims.  Then we're off to The Big Fat Kill, where Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro steal the show, along with Devon Aoki as the beautifully lethal Miho.  She dishes out a lot of graphic violence, including a most excellent beheading.  Alexis Bledel lights up the screen with eyes you could dive right in to.  There's a fair bit of dark comedy in this one, including one incredibly funny bit you won't want to miss.  Finally, there's the story of Hardigan and little Nancy Callahan, a girl that good cop Hardigan saved from a brutal rapist/murderer before having the tables turned completely over on him.  Skinny little Nancy grew up strong and drop-dead gorgeous (like I said, I would buy the movie just for Jessica Alba), but she's still in danger - and only Hardigan can save her from That Yellow Bastard (basically a yellow Ferengi thanks to the damage Hardigan did to him eight years earlier -it's not easy regrowing a set of family jewels, you know - those side effects are brutal).  Bruce Willis is masterful as the tough and gritty yet sensitive Hardigan.It's impossible to truly describe these stories - you just have to see them for yourself.  The performances are so darn good that this movie actually gets better every time you watch it - and this special edition DVD gives you plenty of chances to do just that.  Along with the original theatrical release, you get the uncut version of the movie, split up into four separate, independent chapters; there's some 23 minutes of extra footage - including a couple of scenes that really help embellish the storylines.  You get two commentaries (one with co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, the other with Rodriguez, Quentin Tarentino, and Bruce Willis).  My favorite version features a recording of the Austin premier audience reaction; the depth of the dark comedy in these stories didn't really hit me full force until I was able to join in with that live audience atmosphere.  As if all that isn't enough, though, you also get a series of great featurettes.  Herein is where you truly learn to appreciate the film.  The vast majority of the actual filming was done in front of a green screen, and many of the actors who performed in the same scenes never even met.  And it was all filmed very quickly - all those great backdrops and that unique atmosphere made with CGI.  It's incredible to see just how this movie was shot and put together.There's nothing else out there remotely like Sin City.  It truly makes Frank Miller's comic come to life - for the most part, the movie mirrors the graphic novels themselves almost frame by frame.  Director Robert Rodriguez calls this an anti-movie; in a sense, Miller actually drew his comics in such a way that they could never be filmed.  Rather than adapt the graphic novels to film, Rodriguez went the other way - he adapted the film format to the graphic novels.  When you look at the movie in comparison to the books (and you get a copy of The Hard Goodbye with this DVD package), you'll see exactly what he means.  Sin City is truly an unparalleled, 100% complete success.  I just can't get enough of it.	5.0	Truly the ultimate Sin City experience	2005-12-14	9	8	1
078886047X	Sin City	AEV4NXGCQ449D	Daniel Robbins	"I'm a comic geek, pretty much as ravenous for comics as they come, so I REALLY wanted to like this movie; furthermore, I liked Frank Miller's comic work on which this film is adapted.  But with much disappointment, I cannot give this film a good rating.  In fact, the only reason I do give it two stars is that I'll give them credit for trying new things, like trying to transfer the ""look"" of the comic onto the screen - and maybe for Bruce Willis' role, as well.  But the sum of the parts is that this is a disappointing film.The movie's biggest flaw is that it tries much too hard to be ""noir,"" as if a room full of Hollywood executives were sitting around saying ""let's make this noir.""  It simply doesn't work that way.  I don't how to articulate exactly the kind of artificiality that the film exhudes, but I would use a film like Kill Bill as a contrast: in that film, Tarantino is able to make a kung-fu movie; he didn't make a movie that ""tried"" to be a kung-fu movie.  Apply that to this film, except the other way around.  It tries way too hard to be something, so much that it is distractingly apparent.  The film seems to be saying ""look at these stylized, hyper-visuals; look at this black and white; look at this ultra-violence,"" without once really asking us to look at the movie itself.  I honestly wish I could have given this movie a better review, but I just can't.  If you did like it, you will love the comic, which is much better (though I still wouldn't put it at the top of my most recommended comics list)."	2.0	Reaching too hard for noir	2006-04-21	12	3	9
078886047X	Sin City	A2GYX971VETQBV	Daniel R. Sanderman	"Stunning.  Simply stunning.  SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.  Watching it was like being thrown into the dark graphic novels that comprise Frank Miller's world: gritty, dark, bleak, and hostile.  It must have been a monumental task to film, judging from the featurettes included with the DVD.  The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.  For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.  Due to the computer backgrounds, there is perfect control over the lighting, black & white textures, etc.  Everything is controlled in this film (visually) right down to the smallest detail.  In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.  This is not a corny adaptation with little men running around in costumes.  Rather than force the comic book world into the theater, the audience is dropped into that world.  The effect is stunning.Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.  The acting is quite good.  The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.  In particular, Bruce Willis seems particularly suited to his role.  He belongs in this world.  But more so than any other actor, Mickey Rourke takes the cake.  He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.  I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.Even if you've never heard of Frank Miller or are not a fan of traditional action movies, SIN CITY will knock your socks off.  It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.  Of course, take my recommendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.

078886047X	Sin City	A2JLSHTST2SP1I	Danno	"I can't address ""Sin City""'s content because this is a polarizing film - either you adore it or you don't, and you already know which camp you belong to. Love it or hate it, ""Sin City"" is an amazing technical breakthrough. Roberto Rodriguez has always stretched his low budgets to the limit, but with ""Sin City,"" he proved that greenscreens and computer technology need not be limited solely to science fiction. The digitally-inserted backgrounds and compositing of different actors are totally convincing. Furthermore, unlike previous attempts at the technique (which look like Photoshop on acid), there's a realism present here that leads me to believe that smart producers in the future will rely more and more on greenscreens and less and less on location shooting. This is a rare example of special effects that are totally in service of the story. I think it's worth a look for that reason, especially if you're a budding computer-savvy filmmaker.How strange and cruel, then, that only a skimpy mini-documentary is included as a behind-the-scenes extra. They could bring us multiple ""collectable"" DVD cases, but they couldn't give us real insight into the making of this movie? This is nearly as bad as the very earliest DVD releases (such as ""2001"" and ""Blade Runner"") in which there were absolutely no extras to speak of. Why? Just a year ago a movie like ""Sin City"" would be a two-disc affair with extras that did everything short of telling us whether Rodriguez and Miller prefered ham sandwiches to cole slaw and now we get a bare bones package! It shows real contempt for the fans of this movie.If you absolutely must own this DVD right now, there's nothing I can say to persuade you otherwise. As for me, I'm riding this one out and waiting either for the inevitable upgraded version in a few months or a substantially cheaper used copy. Frankly, it's insulting that they can't give us extras but can give us our choice of four different DVD covers. It's a gimmick worthy of 1990s comic book companies, but totally unacceptable for a major Hollywood release."	3.0	So where are the extras?	2005-09-04	5	3	2

I really enjoyed this movie becasue it was gritty and very true to it's graphic novel beginning. Also, I have to add that the sequence with Micky Rourke as Marv is probably the best 40 minutes of the movie. Definately worth purchasing.	5.0	A Hell of a Movie	2005-06-21	5	3	2
078886047X	Sin City	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	Part pulp fiction, part film noir, part graphic novel, wholly original.  This film delivers on the promise that director Robert Rodriguez suggested in previous endeavors.  Though assisted by Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino I was trying to spot the efforts from these contributors, particularly Tarantino, but was hard pressed.  If this was a case where the stunning visuals surpassed the story then this film would be easy to dismiss but that's not the case here.  The story here is primary and the three connecting vignettes flow smoothly.  The acting here is also not overwhelmed by the visuals.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke both give their best performances in years and Clive Owen's star continues to rise.  The women here  offer strong performances here in particularly Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino.  The real find here is newcomer Devon Aoki as the lethal Meho.  This film may not be to everybody's taste but it cannot be faulted for lack of originality.	5.0	Bring Me the Head of Benecio Del Toro	2005-08-19	2	2	0

If someone was going to this movie expecting the care bears... well that's their own fault.And really, violent? Fist fights, guns, and the idea (without the actual view of the act)of torture. What action movie does not have these elements?Let's see, Braveheart: Fist fights, sword fights, graphic deaths, and torture.Passion of the Christ: Graphic torture and death.Hostage: Guns, knives, and burning bodies.Face it, violence in american cinema is as normal as sex in french cinema, get over it. Sin City is a wonderful noir story (stories) with fantastic acting (it's based on a graphic novel with very one-dimensional characters, they played the part well). The direction is great with beautiful style. I would reccomend this to anyone who didn't have a problem with violence.If you DO have a problem, then don't watch it. Instead, lock yourself indoors, switch on your parental controls to your tivo, and stick to family programing and romantic comedys."	5.0	not for the politically correct	2005-08-13	6	4	2

And the dialog was often funny, in a Mickey Spillane kind of way. Mickey Rourke is the standout among the cast.  And I really loved the music. Great, moody jazz!  But the storylines were muddled and the characters were beyond stereotypes. And it didn't really need to be two hours long. So overall, I'll give it a rating of 4 stars."	4.0	interesting and innovative	2006-08-07	4	2	2
078886047X	Sin City	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"While the new Robert Rodriguez film, Frank Miller's Sin City, is not a horror movie, it isn't not a horror movie. (Yep, I got A's in English.) One of the coolest things about this tres cool movie is, you can't pigeonhole it. Punching, kicking and slashing its way through every genre imaginable - chiefly film noir, comic, mystery, action, drama, romance, and thriller - Sin City has more severed heads, dismemberments and cannibalism themes than The Silence of the Lambs and Freddy Vs. Jason put together. I loved it!It is based on author/illustrator Miller's series of graphic novels of the same name. The plotlines include elements from the stories The Babe Wore Red, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and more. Like the phantasmagoric storybooks, the lush yet stark look of the movie is achieved by using satiny black and white enhanced with splashes of color. Early buzz has Miller's fans thinking that only Miller fans will glom onto the cinematic Sin City. Not so - I'd never read or even saw one of his books in my life before viewing this dark delight, yet I was on board from start to finish. It's only April 1, but I can easily say that Sin City is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.A metropolis bled morally dry, Basin City is the site of three torrid tales that follow several larger than life characters through their lives and, for some of them, their deaths. Each one is a man on a mission that takes him down a rabbit hole to an urban nightmare of seedy alleys, strip clubs, into cheap motel rooms, and around winding back roads to rescue, defend, or avenge a woman.Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a no-nonsense cop who, after saving a little girl (Makenzie Vega) from a brutal child-rapist named Junior (Nick Stahl), is punished for his good deed and spends the next ten years in a solitary prison cell. Once released, Hartigan has cause to thank heaven for the little girl who's grown up in the most delightful way: Nancy (Jessica Alba) is now a lasso-swinging exotic dancer who's fallen deeply in love with him. But Hartigan and Nancy's troubles start all over again when Junior reemerges (now as a Max Schreck/Nosferatu styled creep called Yellow Bastard).Marv (Mickey Rourke) has a churlish countenance, but at his center is a heart of Goldie - Goldie (Jaime King) being the pulchritudinous prostitute who was murdered after their one glorious night together. Marv makes it his quest to hunt down and kill her killer. This is the flagship story, and it's wonderfully infused with Rourke's pervading presence (though they might should have lightened up on the prosthetics a tad; he doesn't look like a real person).Another story in the anthology follows Dwight (Clive Owen), a red Converse-wearing, trench-coated Weegee'esque newspaper photographer who has a hand in committing a most unfortunate murder and then must go to great lengths (and depths!) to cover it up.While the anthology ostensibly follows its male residents, Sin City would be dull indeed without its firecracker female characters. Following film noir and classic detective novel convention, the women are kicked as often as they're kissed - but they give as good as they get. Dangerous dames line the city's highrise rooftops like beautiful but deadly gargoyles, protecting their turf from all comers. Tough cookies, hookers, strippers, and cocktail waitresses abound, as do Kill Bill styled assassins (Devon Aoki's ""Miho"" would give Chiaki Kuriyama's ""Gogo"" a real run for her blood money), barely-clad lesbians, and the female trophies of a literal head-hunter. Miho's pimp is played with fishnet panache by Rosario Dawson.The Big Sleep wakes up in a hi-def, CGI world with glorious results, akin to film noir on acid. Rodriguez famously chronicled bootstrap moviemaking methodology in his book, Rebel Without A Crew; while he certainly had a lot of help with Sin City (Miller co-directs and cameos as a priest, while Quentin Tarantino also helms a short, gruesomely comic passage), you can definitely see his stamp here. You can hear it, too - as per usual, he composed most of the score himself. Even with his cinematography, Rodriguez faithfully reproduces the chiaroscuro palette of Miller's novels. The screenplay (also credited to Mr. R... does this guy do the catering, too?) tempers the characters' cynicism with believable flashes of hope and sentiment.Dialogue and 40s pulp noir voiceovers are punctuated with clich&eacute;s and gallows humor even as explosive, stylized violence unfolds onscreen. The cast of dozens all nosh the scenery, even when they don't have a word to say - the mute, lethal and utterly vile villain, Kevin (Elijah Wood), is a character you won't soon forget. Smaller roles with Rutger Hauer, Carla Gugino, and Powers Boothe are also sure to resonate with audiences.A famous line from a classic noir film matter-of-factly says, ""There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them."" Sin City has at least three, but here's hoping for more in the future."	4.0	Interesting Action...	2005-11-20	6	1	5
078886047X	Sin City	A36SOSKL6B13SX	David	"With it's pioneering visuals, there is no doubt this movie is quite simply gorgeous to look at. It's plot isn't terrible, with three basic story lines that draw you in as much as the character's narrations of their situations. A bonus to this orginal film is the easy-on-the-ears dialogue; there's a relatively small amount of profanity for an R-rated film.But, it seems all good things have their downsides. As word truthfully has it, ""Sin City"" is a very graphically violent movie, reminescent of guest director Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" volumes. The film is riddled with nudity, pedophilia, strippers and creepy prositutes, and let us not forget cannibalism. Mixed messages also plague the screen (tinted with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor), telling us (once again) that personal revenge is sweet, and it's okay to get it by whatever means, especially by grotesquely killing like no tomorrow.This film has only a couple of positives (not benefits, mind you), which can never be worth that sinking feeling you have after watching it, if you have any moral conscience at all.(pluggedinonline.org used as additional reference)"	3.0	"It may be a ""Sin"" to see it..."	2005-08-19	4	2	2

078886047X	Sin City	A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q	David Roy	"Ah, the joys of having a theater right across the street.  Tonight, after work, we decided to check out Sin City, as we've been wanting to see it for quite a while.  So, on opening night of the new theater, we tromped on over, gave them our pre-paid passes and sat down in the theater.  After numerous commercials and numerous trailers (boo to the commercials!), the first scene came on.  A little over two hours later, we came out of the theater entertained, though slightly disappointed by the whole thing.Sin City is based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, and it looks like it.  As numerous articles have stated, the movie looks like it took panels straight out of the comics.  Three storylines are used, beginning with Bruce Willis trying to track down a child molester on his last day on the job.  We then get Mickey Rourke playing Marv, a disfigured man who finally finds a woman who is nice to him, getting framed for the murder of a prostitute.  Finally, Clive Owen gets involved with the wrong woman, which could bring the end of the truce between the prostitutes that run Old Town and the police.  We then go back to Willis' story to finish the film, as the girl he saved is all grown up and carrying a torch for him, even as others are after her.Sin City is told in a noir style, with voice-overs throughout the entire movie.  It became slightly weird when some of Owen's voice-overs actually came directly out of his mouth, but then again this is in a scene where he's talking to a dead guy (and the dead guy is talking back), so perhaps it's excusable.  Some of the dialogue in these voice-overs (as well as dialogue between the characters) is overdone, sounding wooden and relying on the actors to make it even remotely believable.  A lot of Mickey Rourke's dialogue is like this, and he's not as successful in making it palatable as Owen is.  Other dialogue, however, fits the style perfectly, and while it's not Shakespeare, it's not meant to be.  The successful lines are those that the actors take just this side of serious, but still have some fun with it.Sadly, Brittany Murphy is not one who can do that.  Her acting is horrible in this movie, her breathy delivery of the noir dialogue reinforcing how corny it really is.  She tries really hard to be the femme fatale, but she fails miserably.  She has one long scene with Owen and Benicio Del Toro, and they both run her over with their talent.  When she finally leaves the screen, I breathed a sigh of relief.  It helps that Owen's segment was the best of the three and he gets to interact with Rosario Dawson and the rest of the prostitutes.  I was quickly able to forget Murphy and move on.  Jessica Alba as Nancy, the grown-up version of the girl Willis rescues, is ok but not wonderful.  Thankfully, that applies to most of the rest, too.Standouts do include Owen and Del Toro (who has some hilarious scenes after a certain event happens), Willis doing a good job of playing the ""hard as nails with a heart of gold"" role that he often plays, and Michael Madsen as Willis' partner.  Madsen has one of the toughest jobs, as his dialogue is some of the worst, but he does a good job overcoming it.  Maybe he's used to bad dialogue by now, given the movies he's been in.  Rosario Dawson also does a good job with what she has, though her final scene is a bit overplayed.The violence is quite graphic, with red blood being enhanced by the black and white photography.  Even when you don't see the bullet enter the head, you often see the blood splatter on the person doing the killing.  If violence makes you squeamish, this is not the movie for you.  For some reason, the movie seems to have a crotch fetish, as quite a few characters are shot or otherwise stabbed in the nether regions.  This all was quite shocking at first (and I was *ready* for the violence, so it's not like it was a surprise), but I quickly got used to it.  Mickey Rourke's story is probably the most violent, as there are close gunshots, blood flying from punches, beheadings, cannibalism, and an axe being applied to almost every part of the human body.  Once that story is over, it's toned down a bit.  Of course, that's like saying a category 4 hurricane is toned down from a category 5, so don't get the wrong impression.Is the movie good?  Is it worth seeing?  I can tell you that I enjoyed it.  The violence is very stylized and well-choreographed.  The stories are interesting and the characters, while often over the top, are still engaging.  The acting fits the story for the most part, with the exception of Murphy.  Some of the characters weave through the various storylines, making cameos in the ones that don't directly involve them and giving the movie something to tie all of the stories together.  I liked how Willis' story framed the other two, giving us both the beginning and end of the movie.Finally, I didn't mind the grimness.  And this movie *is* grim.  Not only is it violent, but don't expect the usual ending to any of the stories.  A lot of people who like violent movies go to enjoy the mindless action, thinking ""ooooooo cool explosions"" and letting it wash over them.  It can be a fun way to watch some brainless eye candy.  Don't go to this film expecting the same.  It is not fun.  There are a few funny moments, some witticisms by some of the characters, but this isn't your normal action movie.  It can bring you down if you're not careful.  Still, if you like this sort of thing, Sin City is a wonderful example of the genre."	4.0	black and white with a splash of bloody colour	2005-04-29	6	2	4

078886047X	Sin City	ANPAEX55YFH18	dcfc1653	Sin City is a series of graphic novels created by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by director Robert Rodriguez. The film focuses on 3 graphic novels in the series: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill. The best one being The Hard Goodbye, which is about a big guy named Marv who searches for the guy who set him up for murdering a hooker named Goldie. Now, aside from all the great actors, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis and so on, and aside from the great cinematography (shot entirely on green screen), this 2 disc recut and extended dvd has it all. On one disc you have the original theatrical cut with 2 different commentaries plus loads of really cool extras like how Rodriguez conviced Frank Miller to make the film. And then on the second disc you have the film seperated into 4 different stories with over 20 added minutes plus a lot more special features such as the all green screen high speed version of the film. And even aside from that you get the first graphic novel in the series also. I would deffinately recommend this dvd even if you already own the original dvd. Becuase of all the extras and the being able to view the movie into four different stories this dvd is worth all the money. If you don't already own it buy it, and if you do already own the original dvd buy it. This dvd is hands down the best dvd of 2005.	5.0	Worth The Money	2006-01-02	4	3	1

There are three major stories 'The Hard Goodbye','The Big Fat Kill' & [...]The Hard Goodbye : This part focuses on the retribution of man for the untimely murder of his one night lover.The Big Fat Kill : Portrays the war between a group of Prostitutes trying to hold their city from Corrupt Police, Mercenaries and the Mob.The Yellow : Focuses on the old Police Officer who tries to protect a young woman from being raped and murdered by a psychopathic sadistic killer from an influential political family.Sin City provides a huge cast starring Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood and many more. What makes this movie so unique is that it is made in High quality Black and White with some colorization on certain portion of the scene giving it a polished look. This new approach has really made this movie very special; though the movie consists of enough blood and gore, the presentation has made it some what lighter.This movie carries with itself a likable story, if you like movies based on graphical novel, then you can give it a shot.	5.0	Amazing......	2009-10-29	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"Frank Miller's ""SIN CITY"" graphic novels released back in 1991 and 1992 wowed readers when it first was released from Dark Horse Comics.  The stories were collected in trade paperbacks with seven graphic novel that revolve around the people of Basin City aka ""Sin City"".  Known for it's use of primary colors of black, white and red, the graphic novel would win many fans over for its dark and violent tone but storytelling crafted by Frank Miller known for his awesome work on the ""Batman"" and ""Daredevil: The Man Without Fear"" comic books.In 2005, Robert Rodriguez, a fan of the graphic novels wanted to make a film based on ""SIN CITY"" but if only Frank Miller jumped on aboard.  After seeing test footage by Frank Miller, it was enough to entice the creator to become co-director of the film and in the end, earned over $158 million worldwide in theater receipts.In 2005, two DVD versions were released and now, a special 2-disc Blu-ray version which includes the original theatrical and the ""recut, extended, unrated"" version is set for an April 21, 2009 and all I can say is that this release blows away the DVD versions and easily among the top 10, if not, the top 5 Blu-ray's produced thus far.So, does ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" achieve perfection on Blu-ray?  Read on.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is a film that is shot entirely digital via green screen.  The digital recreations of Sin City just look dark, grimy but in a technical sense, quite magnificent in capturing Frank Miller's dark and corrupted city with its blacks, whites and reds.The video which is presented in 1080p (with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1) is just absolutely beautiful as you can see skin pores to absolute detail on the talent but what is more impressive is how digital and realism comes together in harmony.  What was more shocking (which you learn from the special features), in certain scenes which you thought talent were acting with other talent, they weren't.  Footage of an actor may have been shot eight months ago and then the character that is interacting with another character is shot much later and all work done in post-production.A perfect example is in ""That Yellow Bastard (Part 2)"" in which Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) are interacting but in reality, the two individual scenes were shot months from each other.  It's just amazing how everything seems so fluid.The picture quality is just magnificent.  It's one thing to watch this on DVD and say how beautiful the film looks but when you watch it and see it on High Definition, it just blows away the picture quality of the DVD.  Granted, this film doesn't have as many colors as top tier Blu-ray films such as ""Transformers"" or even ""Quantum of Solace"" but using the dark grays and blacks with the whites and reds, this film looks great.As for audio, again this Blu-ray release meets perfection.  The English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) is just incredible.  From the action scenes to the engines of the cars, you literally feel the noise around you.  And at the end with Alba and Willis's character, nice touch of the low level bass as your subwoofer just beats.  The audio is just great to listen to and the clarity of the dialogue, music and special effects were well done.If you think the theatrical and even the unrated, recut edition sound good, there is also an audio track to listen to a live recording of the audience at the Texas premiere which sounds great too (I can only hope more Blu-ray releases include that feature).Overall, ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" achieves perfection for picture and audio quality.  Just magnificent!SPECIAL FEATURES:With Audio and Video reaching perfection, this Blu-ray release does not slouch in special features at all.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with so many features included.  Features such as:DISC 1: Disc One (Theatrical Cut) Features: This disc gives you five different reasons to re-watch the original theatrical version of the film and all are worth it!* All new Cine-Explore - Innovative Blu-ray technology allows viewers to experience a uniquely interactive visual commentary that pushes the envelope. When selected, see picture-in-picture green screen footage and original art synced with the filmmakers' commentary.  This is optional and a nice touch.* 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller - The commentary between Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is pretty cool. Miller has lived ""SIN CITY"", he knows the ins and outs to the city and its characters, so it was great to have this commentary with both men.  But mostly for Miller's perspective and knowledge.  Very cool commentary.* 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino - Tarentino shot the burial/driving scene for ""The BIG FAT KILL"", so he's pretty much in and out for the commentary.  Most of the commentary is Robert Rodriguez.  Where the first commentary, it was Miller driven, this one is Rodriguez driven and when the the time comes, you hear Tarentino chime in.  But it's an interesting commentary as Tarantino doesn't like shooting in digital but because it's a Frank Miller film based on a popular Frank Miller story, he gave it a chance and enjoyed the experience.* 5.1 Audio Track Featuring a Recording of the Austin Audience Reaction - Definitely a fun addition as you watch the film with the actual audience track with people cheering, laughing and just reactions during the entire film.  Sounds great and really gave me another reason to watch the film again and enjoy it.  Great addition to this release!DISC TWO:  This disc includes the ""Unrated, Recut Extended Version"" which has 23 extra minutes and the bulk of the special features.* All new ""Kill `em Good"" Interactive Comic Book - Dive into a visually stunning interactive game that puts you in the driver's seat. Exploiting the Blu-ray format in ways never before seen, you finish the story - with guns blazing!  For a game, I was quite impressed by the audio quality.  Very well done game and using the graphic novels and artwork for an interactive comic book.  Very nice addition to this Blu-ray release!* Four Chapters: The unrated, recut version are viewed as separate films.  There are no chapter stops, so you can watch these separate chapters with new, additional footage.o Chapter One- That Yellow Bastardo Chapter Two- The Customer Is Always Righto Chapter Three- The Hard Goodbyeo Chapter Four- The Big Fat Kill* Rodriguez Special Features:o 15-Minute Film School - (15 min.) Robert Rodriguez is known for his past DVD releases of teaching the filmmaker of tips of how he accomplished scenes on a budget.  This time around, Rodriguez uses ""SIN CITY"" to show how things are done via green screen but how he did certain things to stay within budget of the film.o All Green Screen Version - (12:33) This is the entire film sped up in 800% but a good way to see how everything was shot via green screen.o The Long Take - (14:42) This scene shows how Quentin Tarentino shot the driving scene between Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy (Benicio del Toro).  Very interesting how this take is long and these guys are just sitting in the car for long periods of time. Interesting perspective on filmmaking with these two talented individuals.o Sin City: Live in Concert- (7:15) During a break in Texas, Bruce Willis & The Accelerators perform for charity and cast of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" and ""Scanner Darkly"" hook up and enjoy the performance.o 10-Minute Cooking School - (6:21) Director Robert Rodriguez is often working late in the early morning and when he gets the munchies, he loves his breakfast tacos.  So, he shows you how to make them.* How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller To Make The Film - (5:40) What it took for Robert Rodriguez to convince Frank Miller to make ""SIN CITY"" to a movie.  Interviews with both men.* Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino - (7:19) Interviews with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.  How Rodriguez was able to convince Tarantino to direct a spot.* A Hard Top With A Decent Engine: The Cars of Sin City - (7:34) Interviews with Cecil D. Evans (Transportation Coordinator) of finding the vehicles from the graphic novels for the film.  Miller owns hundreds of die cast vehicles and used those as reference for his graphic novels.  Thus, Evans would go throughout Texas and asking owners to borrow cars for a few days or weeks such as Nancy's 57 Chevy Nomad, Wendy's `55 Porsche Spyder, Dwight's `55 Cadillac and more.* Booze, Broads, and Guns: The Props of Sin City - (10:57) Interviews with Steve Joyner (Prop Master) and how he followed the ""Booze, Broads and Guns"" mentality of the film.  How certain props looked as real as the original to finding the right bow from the graphic novel in real life and obtaining it and using it for the film.* Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make-up - (9:04) Interviews with Grig Nicotero (Special Motion Video Effects Supervisor) and creating the makeup for characters such as Marv, Jackie Boy and Yellow Bastard.* Trench Coats & Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City - (7:34) Interview with Mona Proctor (Costume Supervisor) going through the various costumes especially for the women like Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wore next to nothing.  Very informative.* Teaser & Theatrical Trailer - The Teaser trailer is 2:07 minutes and the official trailer is at 1:49.I've owned the previous two DVD version of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" but watching this on Blu-ray, I'm just amazed how much  of a difference High Definition really makes this film look and sound so incredible.The picture quality and the vibrancy of the reds and golds, the audio quality of weapons, cars and violence with wonderful DTS-HD audio going all around you.  This film is just right up there for one of the best releases on Blu-ray thus far.Again, I understand that other films such as ""TRANSFORMERS"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" which were shot outdoors looked incredible while ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is digital throughout in terms of the cityscape and the overall atmosphere of the city.And suffice to say, both Blu-ray discs are just packed full of special features and enough to keep fans busy.  The first disc alone gives you five ways to watch the film and each reason is just fantastic (especially if you are a big fan of the film and the graphic novels).  The second disc was a great touch to add an unrated, recut version.It would have been nice to have the full theatrical film with the newer footage added to it but overall, the second disc gives you individual chapters and yet again, another way to enjoy this film.As for parents who wonder if this film based on a comic book is family friendly, despite the fact that blood is seen in various colors, the film is excessively violent and has its share of nudity.  So, despite Miller's work with the ""Batman"" and ""Daredevil"" comic books, ""SIN CITY"" is not a film you want to have your kids watching.In the end, I really enjoyed the film and the Blu-ray release.  Sure, it's over-the-top and both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have had their share of over-the-top films.  But there are few graphic novels that I have wanted to see in film and so, seeing ""SIN CITY"" as a film and with Miller involved and thus making sure the film is faithful to the graphic novels was awesome.  And just kudos to Robert Rodriguez who allowed Frank Miller to fully be in control of the film and working together with him and coming up with this unique and stylish film, the two work great together and I just hope to see a future collaboration with both men again.Finding a Blu-ray release that is just perfect in all four categories of film, video, audio and special features is quite rare.  Typically you get two out of four but in the case of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"", this release is just perfect.Videophiles and audiophiles are just going to love this release while fans of the film are just going to go nuts over the amount of content included on both Blu-ray discs.""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is perfect and highly, highly recommended!

078886047X	Sin City	A8KISUT7RB2OX	Derek S. Bland	"The negative review below that gripes about it being a ""comic book style"" movie is indicitive of the typical ignorance of the naysayers of this film.  Of course it's a comic book style, it's a comic book movie.  Comic book and film noir, two of the cheesiest styles ever.  And no story?  I can only assume that the people that say this are too busy playing games on their cell phones instead of paying attention to the film.  There are 3 very distinct stories, all of them told in a spectacular fashion with stellar acting.This film is a beautiful transfer from Frank Miller's graphic novels.  You can look at the panels of the graphic novels and see the exact scenes from the movie.  As mentioned in the editorial review, the only real change is the lessening of nudity in the film.  No big loss, although every red-blooded male wishes that Jessica Alba had done the topless scene.Buy this movie and, while you're at it, get the 3 graphic novels it's based on:  Sin City: The Hard Goodbye, Sin City: The Big Fat Kill, and Sin City: That Yellow Bastard.  While you're at it, pick up Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and get the backstory on Dwight and the girls of Old Town."	5.0	One of the best comic book movies ever	2005-07-15	11	9	2

I'm gonna be honest, this movie has fight scenes that are even more exaggerated than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a movie which this one reminded me off cause the karate chick in old town can fly. Basically all of the 'good' characters can withstand enough punishment to kill an entire infantry division worth of troops. But if you shut down the logic based part of your mind you'll dig it for it's awesome visuals and dark wit.And honestly I just can't dislike a movie with so many boobies in it.	4.0	Over the top and off the wall blood and guts good fun	2005-05-15	6	1	5
078886047X	Sin City	A1QH68RK79BDL0	"Diana ""prodigy"""	I have to say that I wasn't blown away by this movie due to the fact that I knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to happen. Not that that's really a bad thing, the sin city comics were great and this movie was perfect. It's obvious that Robert Rodriguez didn't make an adaptation of Frank Miller's comics, he basically put the books onscreen. And I mean he made the movie exactly like the books right down to the teeth. The look of this movie is so great I consider it eye candy. I love how the movie was shot in front of the green screen (even though that's totally unethical movie making) to make the picture look just like the black and white world of Frank Miller. The action was also very good, especially the fight between Kevin (Elijah) and Marv (Mickey). My complaints we're that a couple of the main character's acting was pretty stiff. It's obvious that no matter who she plays and how beautiful she is that Jessica Alba isn't a very good actress. Also suprisingly Clive Owen was probably the worst actor on the screen. He could have added so much more depth and realizm to Dwight but he screwed that up. I don't mean to be picky but Nick Stahl is a good actor but it was something about him that made him not capture the creepyness and bad guy feel of yellow bastard. My only complaints were some of the acting. Although Brittany Murphy, Benecio del Turro, Bruce Willis, and Mickey Rourke were very good at there parts. If your a fan of the movie you'll love it, if your not you will still love it. And by the way let's talk about the violence. I can't make up my mind on whether or not it was normal for an R rated movie or if it was too overdone. Because a lot of the blood is computerized to look white. When Jackie Boy got his hand cut off it looked like bird crap was coming out of his wrist. Most of the blood though is red or black, and it seems to flow from the characters like water a lot of the time and is all over the place. Plus there is some nudity. So not appropriate for some viewers, not to mention the castrating.	4.0	THE PERFECT COMIC TO SCREEN MOVIE	2005-08-16	7	6	1

There is enough crappy movies out there, that it's not worth your 8-10 dollars a person to see.Everything Quintin touches, seems to be worth seeing. This movie is unlike anything you've seen so far. It's pretty wild how it really looks like a black and white comic book, but yet the characters are real.

I actually found the Sin City comics passable, but inferior to Miller's previous works. The film however is nothing more than pointless frames filling the gap between literal translations of panels from the books.there is no creativity or vision at work, just 126 mins of static images in motion for no reason. I see people pointing out instances of allegory and symbolism in defense of this embarassment, but these translate to little more than a desperate attempt to put tinsel on a turd. I could go on but this film has cost me $8 and two hours of my life. Learn from my poor judgement and don't bother.	1.0	Oh, please.....	2005-04-20	36	18	18

The movie story-boards consisted of the.... graphic novels... the dialogue was written by... Frank Miller's words directly out of the graphic novels. Artistically, this movie felt like a graphic novel. Filmed in Black and White with a splash of color here or there to accent specific elements.Movies like Spider Man and X-Men are very good movies... but do not hold true the comic world.

078886047X	Sin City	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	"This is easily the most stylish film to come out since ""The Matrix.""  The look of the movie uses the same experimental technique I first saw in a Francis Ford Coppola film called ""Rumble Fish"" where the entire movie is shot in black and white with certain parts of each scene colorized for stark contrast.  This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film ""Pleasantville.""  Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.  As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances; the most notable being those of Mickey Rourke and a remarkable cameleon-like transformation from Benicio Del Toro.  The female characters are primarily two-dimensional buxom babes with little depth of emotion, but this film is based on a comic book for young men, after all.  There are a couple of forgettable performances given by Clive Owen and Michael Madsen.  Clive Owen's work here is wooden, and Michael Madsen is plain petrified and uninspired.  I kept having the feeling that Michael Madsen joined the project in the hopes of snaring Mickey Rourke's role, and when he didn't get it, severe apathy set in.  He was great in ""Resevoir Dogs,"" but this is by far and away the worst performance in any of his films that I've seen.  The storyline is another ""Pulp Fiction""-like yarn with disjointed narrative that jumps back and forth between three violent and seemingly separate stories that cross paths at the end of the film.  The almost constant voice-over narration can be a burden on the generic movie-goer who wants more traditional film-fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.  There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.  This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store."	4.0	A captivating Film Noir comic book movie.	2005-08-16	1	1	0

I am only giving this DVD set 4 stars however, only because there is no option to watch all the uncut parts together in full length.  I kind of understand why the DVD was put together like this but it would have been nice to see the whole thing cut together so we can watch it beginning to end with all the added scenes integrated.  Obviously it's good to have the full disc with the original cut, and this is the one I generally watch but it was great to see the uncut scenes as well.

078886047X	Sin City	AJ3BXAIYXZ4TU	Doug Wray	"This is one of the few stories adapted from print that comes off better on the screen than on the page. The only other one that comes to mind offhand is ""The Beach,"" an uninteresting, shallow book turned into a charmingly trashy film about thoroughly unlikable characters.""Sin City"" (the film) stands in a more complicated relationship to its source material, however. Miller's original comics are breezy reads that function more or less as summaries of Dashell Hammett (and hence have their parallels not in Hammett, but in flatter exploitations of Hammett's innovations such as the Mike Hammer novels). Graphically, Miller's books look more or less like a series of stills from cheap old Warner Brothers movies.""Sin City"" (the film) hence is several steps removed from its noir spring, an imitation of an imitation of an imitation; without having read the original comics, viewers will find little of interest here: there are no plots as such (only set pieces), no motivation, no background, nothing but ritual evocations of noir archetypes. Hence, there is nothing to invite casual, uninitiated viewers into the evocations. Viewing this film without context would be like listening to prayers in a religion one has no background in: there wouldn't seem to be any purpose or grounding to any of it.Viewers, however, who have either familiarity with noir stuff or, specifically, Miller's comics, will find the film enjoyable and satisfying. The moving images (many of which touch in passing on compositions identical to those of the comics) are more appealing than the comics' images, inasmuch as the movie's pass too quickly to allow the staleness prolonged viewing of any given image (as happens when viewing a comic) that's simply an imitation of earlier moving images to develop. (This implies, of course, that watching ""Sin City"" in theater is probably more satisfying than watching it in a form in which the view can control the image delivery rate).The performances of the players, for what it's worth, are sometimes fairly good, sometimes excellent, and sometimes bad, though for me ""good"" means that I'm not constantly aware that ""oh, that's Actor Y."" Hence, here, Mickey Rourke is excellent and Bruce Willis poor.The film is striking visually, and use of color is better than with the heavy-handed print version of the same stories. This difference is, I suppose, one imposed by medium. Likewise, the other differences in treatment may be largely to do with medium as well.Now that I think of it, I'm happy for Frank Miller with this work: he does a better job the second time around with the ""Sin City"" stories and milieu. In summary: a decent way to pass a couple of hours. Trade your ""Sin City"" comics to someone for the DVD, watch it, be happy, and then trade the DVD for something else."	3.0	Better than the comic; bad without the comic	2007-02-27	3	2	1

Maybe I can't really review this film.I have sat through a lot of bad films and I usually make a point of not walking out but this is the first film I ever walked out on.  I do not object to the violence.  What bothered me about this film is that when characters basically cannot be injured by weapons, I don't care what happens anymore.  I like films where the appearance of a weapon makes me tense.  In this film characters can get shot repeatedly without being killed, so the appearance of a gun no longer becomes thrilling.My point is that, ironically, the excessive violence of this film made it one of the most boring films that I've ever watched.	1.0	The first film I ever walked out of	2005-12-20	53	17	36

Marv is someones idea of what a hero is supposed to be I guess. But he is clearly not mine. Bruce willis has a strong role here but its not enough to save this movie.

The film was directed by Miller himself as well as Robert Rodriguez, along with Quentin Tarantino, who directed a small segment of the final cut.The ensemble cast is tremendous and includes (among others): Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer.The stories of the various different characters and the consequences their actions have on their counterparts are ingeniously interweaved to form a narrative that is constantly moving at break neck speed.The story begins with Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a detective of Sin City with one day left from retirement, in pursuit of a sick child killer. The ensuing events are violent, unexpected and exhilerating. After Hartigan's story has been told, Rodriguez and Miller move the action along to Marv, a man determined to find out who killed the girl of his dreams. This leads him to the girls of Old Town, the hookers who work the streets there, enforcing their own laws and looking after themselves. After a series of events leads to a possible war between the police and the prostitutes, action has to be taken by all of the characters to prevent it before it is too late. It is during the second half of the film that all of the characters' connections to one another become clear and the story trundles on towards its shocking conclusion.Usually a film featuring strippers, prostitutes, extreme violence and explosions would be considered ""bad taste"" cinema, but Sin City is so beautifully acted, shot and directed that it is an astounding masterpiece. The cast are all on top form and the production values are tremendous. Sin City is a must-see!The DVD extras are excellent, with the second disc featuring the extended director's cut of the film which only adds to the experience, and offer an insight into the creative process behind the film."	5.0	Original, exciting and unbelievably entertaining	2008-02-18	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	A18LDSB4HZLE2G	DrSpecter	"As a lover of film noir, I was almost reluctant to see this film. It seems like the preoccupations of noir are outdated as far as the modern world is concerned. Well, I guess Sin City ain't the modern world.It gets both the style and the substance of noir, and tells real stories with the iconography. Sexual obsession as ""love"" and the idea of a man trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a woman who may or may not deserve it. And the dames themselves-- tough, smart and above all pragmatic. The movie is also a genuinely cynical, ambivalent meditation on the subject of corruption-- both personal and political. AND it's a green screen version of an old studio movie! --Actors walk on treadmills while the crew move things in front of the key light to get an interplay of light and shadow.

078886047X	Sin City	A1RHBDGMYEH2Z0	D. Smith	"Sin City is a interesting failure in that it portrays a stunning grim and grimey metropolis, but populates it with supermen and women who are as out of place there as Clark Kent is in Batman's suit.  Even Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the most vulnerable character whose heart condition that acts up at the most inopportune times, can survive a myriad of bullets and still live to tell the tale.  I even might have looked away from these points if the stories made up for them.  Well, they don't.  There is no mystery in them; they just blame some sort of authority power whether it's government, police, religion, etc, for all the problems the characters are having at the time.Okey dokey, how about the characters; they have to be sympathetic and interesting, don't they?  Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan are the best and deserve better stories.  Dwight (Clive Owen) is a typical tough guy character who isn't given as much to chew on as the other two except for perhaps Rosario Dawson's lips.  Why, though, is he given the power to jump pretty high off the side of a building to chase after Jack (Benicio Del Toro)?  Because if he didn't, he wouldn't have missed the key bit of information that Shellie (Brittany Murphy) was going to tell him about Jack.  Did she say ""stop"" or something important I needed to know?  Oh well, off to whoretown!  That's just lazy storytelling and gives off the clue that there really isn't a very good story being told in the first place.The visuals though are completely brilliant, and it's probably worth the price of admission just to see them.  Even though I've only seen samples of his work online, I can see Miller is a wonderful artist, and his visual work translates wonderfully on the big screen.  There's tribute here to all the great film noirs of the 30's, 40's, and early 50's, and I'm sure Rodriguez and Miller screened several of them to the crew for inspiration.  It's a pity though that this one isn't that good.2.5/5"	2.0	The Sins are in the details	2005-04-02	19	8	11

This is, without a doubt, the lowest form of entertainment I have ever been subjected to.  I only regret that I didn't walk out of the theater sooner.

078886047X	Sin City	A2MK0CM0GEBFFO	"D. Wells ""the Black Tortoise"""	I am a big fan of Frank Miller's work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from. When I saw this film I was blown away by the visuals. It had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything I had seen in a movie before.Having mentioned it's good points I have to say I was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen. It seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen. For the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through. I had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet.Each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like I was being mugged. What works in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you'll see here. All the characters were severely and tragically 2-dimensional with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience. Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here.Purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film. However, my bottom line opinion is it's a good film to watch for the visual look only, but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute' button on. This film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark.	2.0	Great visuals but couldn't stomach the horrible dialogue	2006-11-08	22	7	15

It was this largely bare bones release, followed some months later by an unrated two disk set.  Now right away, that was bad and cheap DVD work.  Done largely by studio greed to make more money and that's all.Ignoring that however and the violent nature of this movie, coming down to film content itself.  There is no story.  There is nothing here at all that counts as story.  No acting, no script, lots of MTV style work here, but no story at all.

078886047X	Sin City	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. ""Sin City"" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.""Sin City"" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.""Sin City"" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.The contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.""Sin City"" is not quite a ""Kill Bill"" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. ""Sin City"" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.""Sin City"" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. An outstanding piece of work."	5.0	Sin-ful city	2009-01-21	1	0	1

Mickey Roarke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owens turns in stunning performances.  I love the old cars, and how you never show exactly how they made the grapics.  Rosario Dawson in black leather looks truly a marvelous creature to feast your eyes on.  The Blonde chicks who plays the silent killer is awesome.  The preformance by Michael Clark Duncan, Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, and Bernicio Del Torro are good, but are quickly forgotten.  I've seen this three times and do plan to buy it.  ""Yes""  it is pretty gory, is aimed at adults, ""Yes"", it does have hyper violent moments,  and ""Yes"" even the good guys with questionable morals become good guys, but none of this detracts from it."	5.0	What a Power Punch	2005-07-31	9	4	5
078886047X	Sin City	AWBS5D7SI70S	"E. Day ""ENIGMA"""	One of the sad realizations i have come to in the recent years of movie production (and a possible reason ticket sales are at an all time low as of late) is found in Hollywood creativity and new ideas. Sadly, there just isn't any, and if you think Movies are lacking fresh ideas, turn on the TV set after reading this review, but i digress.In my years of movie watching i have enjoyed a variety of movies that set the standard in regards to their genre of story telling. For example as far as star sagas and wars are concerned nothing will likely come close to Star Wars, as far as horror in space, ALIEN might well have the title there, demon possession, one only need watch the Exorcist in the dark alone, where the battle of man against machine, i guess is a throw up between Terminator and The Matrix. Such movies have set the bar relatively high with the quality of their stories; thus leaving other movies with similar topics often to seem like cheap imitators. (Now to all you people who are saying get to the point, the movie review)For quite a while i would have easily said that Pulp Fiction set the bar pretty high in regards to the brand of producing that had multiple stories all tied together. However, it would appear that Sin City took a great idea and just made it better. This movie takes a style of talk and feel of the 30's, mixed colorization of the 60's, violence and sex of...... well pick a year I'm sure it will fit, and the special affects of the 90's and beyond, and rolls it all together into a visual masterpiece. In this movie you will see Mickey Rourke play one of his best roles ever as Marv. Sadly (although i love his work) Bruce Willis play his traditional role of the down and out cop who breaks the rules to save the day (he played it well in this movie but not really a stretch for him) and although his role was small, the most mesmerizing role might well be found in a Fine Young Cannibal named Kevin (Elijah Wood) (sorry for the spoiler).The one fine point i liked about Pulp Fiction was in the Karma to be found within the story, in that in the end everyone pretty much gets what they deserve and that sometimes the people we believe to be good really ain't so good at all, and it takes a unique, sometimes nasty form of justice to make things right. Such a point touched on in Pulp, is the center of SIN CITY in a nutshell.Is it the best movie ever?........no, but it may be one of the best of its kind. If you are the type that can't appreciate the story, just go into it for the sheer artistic and creative value this movie presents and i think you will be moderately pleased. Oh if you didn't already know this movie is not for the squeamish.The only disappointing aspect after watching this movie is knowing i might have to wait another 5 to 10 years for another fresh idea to come out of Hollywood to set a new standard and make me want to return to the theaters.P.S.

078886047X	Sin City	A3DMZKTBIJURE1	Eddy Campbell	Sin City is made up of three of Frank Miller's graphic novels, and one tiny short story at the beginning.But the short story makes for a nice start into the film.The visual effects are amazing, and when i went to see what the graphic novels were like, i found that the images and camera angles in the film were a spot-on duplicate of nearly every page of those novels - of course with little changes here and there.Also amazing is the fact that it is as if each of the actors in the film were bron for their roles. They look almost surreally like the characters in the novels. Clive Owen is uncanny, Benicio Del Toro - albeit with a bit of make-eup and prsotethic - looks like the character in the book, Mickey Rourke - in my opinion - needed very little make-up to play Marv, as he's done a fairly good job of messing up his own face all by himself. But he truly steals the show as the daring, revenge-fuelled Marv.All-in-all, the film is mesmerising. Three strange but brilliant stories based in a whore-run, crime-ridden city.

078886047X	Sin City	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"I am not usually a fan of comic books, but this movie was done so well that it didn't really matter.Very absorbing, fascinating, outrageously twisted over the top graphic violence---but not all that gruesome actually, since the camera usually pulls away from the actual carnage in progress.  It's the mental cruelty of various characters at various moments that lingers, not the physical actions so much.What's striking is just how utterly dark, no ""dark"" is too weak a word, utterly BLACK of a world this film pulls you into.  Totally amoral sadistic savage anarchy, there are of course good and bad guys but even the good guys are just a few shades less twisted.  And it's saavy, in the socioeconomic and sociopolitical sense---we see a world of vast corruption and cruelty underneath the everyday sucker's illusion of normalcy and respectability.The all-star cast shines, even cinematic lightweights like Jessica Alba are well-directed enough not to screw things up.  Like the ""Kill Bill"" movies, you have to approach this film as mainly an excercise in style and genre, it is not meant to be judged in any sort of larger real-world context and best of all doesn't try to be more than what it is...a supremely original and entertaining 2 hours!"	5.0	noir comic book COOLNESS!	2005-11-13	6	4	2
078886047X	Sin City	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller'sSin Citygraphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants. This 2005 film takes a visual cue from 2004'sSky Captain and the World of Tomorrowby green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and whiteSchindler's List). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as ""Special Guest Director"" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis'Death Becomes Her(which coincidentally starred Bruce Willis).The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's9 1/2 Weeks, Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character.The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career beforeTraffic. Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch. Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer.All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride. The incremental value of the two-disc Collector's Edition DVD set over the standardsingle discwill depend on whether you have become obsessed with this cult film since there is only a behind-the-scenes featurette on the single disc.Disc One contains the 124-minute, theatrical-release version with an excessive three audio commentaries. The first is with Rodriguez and Miller, who focus mainly on the book-to-screen translation and benefits from the author's perspective. The second has Tarantino and Willis join Rodriguez, and the focus turns to the technical aspects of the production even though Tarantino's contribution to the film is marginal at best. The third commentary track is actually the recording of the audience reaction at the movie's Austin premi&egrave;re in order to replicate the experience one would have had at the theater. The remaining extras on Disc One may seem superfluous if you already sat through the first two commentary tracks. Six featurettes are offered - a five-minute short on how Miller and Rodriguez got together (""How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller to Make the Film""); seven minutes on Tarantino's contribution to ""The Big Fat Kill"" segment (""Special Guest Director, Quentin Tarantino"");  seven minutes on the vintage 1950's cars used in the film; en minutes focused mainly on the weaponry; nine minutes with special makeup effects supervisor Greg Nicotero on how the looks of the principal characters were achieved; and finally, nine minutes with costume supervisor Nina Proctor about the stylized clothing. There is an odd feature on Disc One, ""Sin-Chroni-City Interactive"", which allows you to pick characters and locations and get a timeline view of relevant events. Disc One ends with two theatrical trailers.Disc Two contains the 147-minute version of the film advertised as ""recut, extended, and unrated"". The additional 23 minutes amount to expanded cuts in each episode which allow them to be presented as separate short films. This gives you the option to watch the film as an integrated whole or separately. Each segment has its own menu of scene selections. From a story standpoint, the incremental value of the footage and flexibility is marginal at best. Five more featurettes fill up Disc Two - a twelve-minute short called ""15 Minute Flic School"" in which Rodriguez shares behind-the-scenes information and basic tricks of the trade; ten minutes where the entire film is shown in accelerated fashion to show how the actors had to improvise in front of green screens; a 17-minute piece on Tarantino's shooting of his scene; and most dispensable, nine minutes of a concert from Willis and his band the Accelerators at Antone's nightclub in Austin, and six minutes  of Rodriguez sharing his recipe for ""Sin City"" breakfast tacos (seriously!). Beyond the discs is the complete Sin City graphic novel in printed form,The Hard Goodbye (Sin City, Book 1: Second Edition)."	4.0	High POW Factor and Overloaded Extras in the Collector's Edition DVD Set Make for Audacious Thrill Ride Into Sin City	2008-04-02	3	3	0

However, they often fail to cite reasons why, or the reasons are inexplicable. Anyway, here is why I rated it a five:Visual-Amazing! The way that each frame of the movie is like the frame of a comic book simply draws you into the experience. The black and white nostalgic look with colors that blazed forth from the screen. Nothing short of excellent.Dialogue-While many criticize the dialogue as 'cheesy', you have to remember that this movie is based off of a comic book. It's supposed to be a little cheesy sounding, just like a comic book is.Characters-God how I hated Rourke. How I loved Hartigan. How you grow to love and hate the characters and become a part of their experience is amazing. I hated Rourke so much.....Plot-Taken from Sin City comic books, and those were just....amazing and original.Soundtrack-The music did what it should: provide the boost of emotion (suspense, happiness, etc.) without interfering with the movie.Themes- This is where many fall short. They criticize the movie as being ""for serial killers or psychopaths"" whithout looking at what the movie is really saying. Just because a movie contains cannibals doesn't mean it is endorsing cannibalism. So what themes are in this movie? I'll list a few: 1.Justice-What is justice? Is justice killing a murdurous cannibal, regardless of its legality? Is justice obeying corrupt officials? Is justice mudering a bishop who eats people? The movie points out that justice sometimes goes against traditional ideas of legality and personal morals. 2. The price paid for good- Every person who does good in the movie suffers for it. The movie seems to portray the idea that ""no good deed goes unpunished"". Upon further viewing and analysis, one can find even more themes. And no, I am not reading into it, people write movies-*gasp*-to portray ideas! Godforbid a deeper meaning...Those are my reasons for rating this movie so high. While many complain about violence, objectification of women, ask yourselves, ""Why did Rodriguez put that there?"" And no, the answer is not to be gratuitous.An old man dies. A little girl lives.

From what I've read here, this film does not appeal to old school feminazis (The 80s are over, honey. Shave your legs) and Canadians.  I guess our friends to the north just don't have the stomachs for the strong stuff.If you're still on the fence, just remember that this is a comic movie, the action and dialogue are going to be over-the-top, surreal and at times slapstick. But this is a comic movie for adults. If you're expecting Spiderman or The Fantastic Four, save your money.  But if you can appreciate the beauty and grandeur of The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings and Spiderman, but also get a chuckle from the over-the-top violence of Scarface, Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers, this movie is for you.Hell, I'll buy BOTH DVD versions."	5.0	BEST FILM OF THE YEAR!	2005-08-13	7	4	3

078886047X	Sin City	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	The title of this review, which is an excerpt from the John Hartigan story, embodies its essence; somebody is in need, and somebody else that cares will do whatever he can to help.There's little doubt that Bruce Willis owns Sin City. In his most memorable, most powerful and possibly best performance to date, Willis portrays the character of John Hartigan, a near retirement cop that has one final mission to accomplish. This is probably his most important mission that will define him for better or worse and would change his life forever.John Hartigan and Nancy Callahan's story is the most moving out of three sub-stories that incorporate Sin City. The other two, led by Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen respectively, are quite interesting and more graphic, though their violence is relatively easy to take thanks to the results of the CGI special effects that are used whenever blood is supposed to be present and thus giving the film a somewhat surreal feeling.All in all, it's a wild ride that passes too soon leaving  the viewer anticipating the upcoming sequels.	4.0	"""Get over it, she needs you"""	2005-09-24	3	3	0

Go Figure. >>>Frank Miller is a favourite of mine, so I am pretty biased. The books the film is based upon cannot in the strictest term be called 'comics'. But this is heaped into the category of 'comic book film'. And you know what, for some reason that doesn't bother me.Miller, who has always been known for shaking up our perceptions on the definitions of what can be expected in the comic book medium, stuck gold with this solid serialized title. With this film, director Robert Rodriguez redefined what a comic movie could be. And with this version of the BD, they both have redefined the comic book home experience.Packed with featurettes, a sharp 5.1 soundtrack, snarky and witty commentary, and some 20 minutes of additional movie, there's not much to not like about Sin City at all. Hell, Rodriguez even puts a favourite recipe (apparently one that helped him get through the filming process) in the mix, a simple breakfast taco with homemade attentions- and I tried it; it is a simply divine way to spice up an early morning. How many other BDs, let alone DVDs, give you THAT kind of bonus features?We know the count. Sin City was a highly regarded ""neo-noir"" TPB series and a highly praised film. Awards, all-star ensemble cast, lots of action, strong and sexy women, lots of action, gore, and lots of action. Frankly, if you are a fan of gritty comics at all and have no knowledge of Sin City and do not own a BD player... well, there's a good suggestion for your first two purchases.It's dark, twisted, violent, and quite possibly one of my favourite films of all time."	5.0	Everything the Books Were and More	2012-10-06	2	2	0

Ok, I had to get that off my chest.I'll first say that I have never read a ""Sin City"" book. I've certainly heard of it, but it has never appealed to me (no disrespect to any long-time fans). But I heard enough about this movie to become interested, especially because of the visuals. After seeing it yesterday, I can safely say that one does NOT have to be familiar with the books in order to like this film. I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie by the excellent visuals, as I was when watching ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" although it has to be said that ""Sky Captain"" was mainly for the kiddies in terms of the level of violence, whereas ""Sin City"" is a far cry from being kid-friendly.Which brings me to the violence in this film. Yes, it is brutal and graphic. However, there are two things which keep the violence level below the in-your-face, sick-to-your-stomach level that it was in movies like ""Kill Bill."" For one, virtually all of ""Sin City"" is in black & white. So the blood isn't realistic-looking. In fact it looks like white CGI in most scenes. Even the most graphically violent scenes such as the quadruple amputation and the beheadings have a certain ""cartoonish"" look to them, which of course is the entire point of this movie. And the second reason why the violence isn't so shocking is because a lot of it is pure tongue-in-cheek. When you have people basically act as if nothing has happened after their hand gets sliced off or after an arrow goes through their torso, you know it isn't supposed to be taken seriously. But again, that's all part of the fun of ""Sin City.""In terms of acting, I have no complaints. And I certainly have no complaints about the female eye-candy either, especially Rosario Dawson and (you guessed it) Jessica Alba. Although all women are either hookers and/or strippers, they're capable of kicking serious a$$ and using their blades to the serious misfortune of anyone who crosses them.I had a lot of fun with this movie and would recommend it with no reservations. In terms of visuals alone, it is pure brilliance. It is stylish, well-paced, well-directed, and as cliche as it sounds, just plain *cool*.

The ""cool"" visuals and over-the-top action sequences are complemented by classic noir themes and (especially during the ""That Yellow Bastard"" segment) subtle and intelligent symbolism. The characters are processed and amped-up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly. Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise. The DVD is lacking in aspects such as special features, and I had trouble playing it in a certain DVD player of mine, but that might have been the fault of the (rather old) player. It worked fine in all other players I've tried, so this shouldn't be a deterrent from buying it. This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings.

For the simple fact that it is based on a ""comic"", many will love it regardless of the content.For those that aren't fans of comics I'd wager that there will be a greater chance of not not liking this at all for the simple fact that it is based on a comic and it is shown with a constant meld of animation and live action which may turn many off.My initial feelings of this movie are like those of Pulp Fiction. . .a linking of short stories that left the viewers torn between one camp who loved it and one who hated it.As with Pulp Fiction I'm one of the few who is in the middle ground.1) The movie is beautiful and creative. The black & white animation melded with live action and the single splashes of color were eye catching2) WARNING: If you are offended by EXTREME graphic violence and some nudity then this movie is not for you and some parents may consider watching it before letting their teenagers view it due the trademark Tarantino adult content. Unlike Kill Bill where the violence was just a joke that it moved from gross to ignoring it, this was plain violent for shock value I thought.3) The best part of the movie is Marv! Nuff said.4) If you favor one contiguous story with one main protagonist and one main antagonist then you might not like this. Like I said, this is a handful of short stories that are linked by Sin City as the setting5) If you like ""happy"" endings then you might not appreciate on some levels the story resolutions that take place. This is not a happy movie but one where courage and purpose in life can show up even in the most desperate and dark places.Overall, it was an intriguing movie to watch though I felt dirty afterwards on different levels. In Tarantino's fashion he always exploits the dark side of people with a glimmer of heroism thrown in. Simply because it is ""new"" is not a good reason to watch something. . .this is one I'd lean more in the end to wishing I had not exposed myself to."	2.0	you'll either love it or hate it	2005-08-20	8	6	2

078886047X	Sin City	A1PQLR0EN31PE8	E. Smith	For me, I like the intercut scenes from one story to the other.  I thought that was clever, but the new DVD have a version that seperates the story and it doesn't work for me.  Plus the additional minutes are miniscule at best.  They don't really add anything to the story and that is the biggest disappointment.  The cool thing about this DVD is all the extras and this is where this version far outshines the previous release one.  I think it's cool, compelling, especially the interviews with the filmmakers and the cast.The reason why I like the theater version over the re-edited version is that the theater version confuses you.  You never know whats is going to happen next and the filmmaker leaves it up to you to related all the stories together and in what time line they happened.  Luckily for us, the theater version is included on this DVD so if you do not own the movie (which most of us do), its a great buy.  If you do own the DVD then you have to ask yourself, do you want to get into the great extra features?  If you don't get into things like that, then don't buy it for the additional minute or so that each story gets.  Personally it's worth the price for the extras.	5.0	Not what I expected	2006-03-20	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A1N7YA81ZI4KAF	"E. Valero ""Eterno"""	"Frank Miller's graphic comic-books come to breathtaking life in Robert Rodriguez's dazzling and extraordinarily violent film. ""Sin City"" centers around 3 engaging stories. The first involves Marv (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a messed up, ill-faced tough-guy on a quest to bring his lover's killer to justice. The other deals with the slick, Dwight (Clive Owen), an imposing, trench-coated charmer who unwittingly sets off a chain of unfortunate events by defending his smart-mouthed, physically abused girl-friend (Brittany Murphy). The final entry involves the tormented Willis and his love for a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) who he once rescued as a young girl from a heinous kidnapper and has to do so again when the monstrous villain returns with vengeance on his mind.This film looks splendid. The sets, costume design, cinematography and art direction are top-notch and I don't understand how this motion picture was not nominated for any ""Oscars"". The film is so visually breathtaking that the images and characters depicted will stay in your mind long after the closing credits. The entire film is shot in awesome black and white and every once and a while a dash of color is added enhancing the visual impact. There really isn't an action movie in recent memory that was this visually stimulating and artistically creative. Rodriguez successfully captures the essence of the comic-book characters without making them appear one-dimensional (It should be noted that Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are also given directing credits).""Sin City"" the comic books are not child's play so it's useless to expect the same from the film. The characters are all violent, impulsive and amoral individuals who kill without an ounce of remorse. The violence is graphic but the grisly gore scenes are executed so brilliantly that there really isn't that many moments in this film where the squeamish will be turning away or covering their eyes. They'll be too busy admiring the awesome beauty of the cast, the eye-catching visuals and the skill-fully choreographed fight scenes.Spectacle aside, the star-studded cast also deserves mention because they all give exceptional performances. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke are the stand-outs. Both actors are compelling to watch especially Rourke who commands our attention and makes the most out of his vicious but sympathetic character. And a review cannot be complete without mentioning the luminous Alba. That platinum hair, gorgeous figure and other-worldly presence makes a delightful Nancy Callahan. Other's in the impressive cast include Powers Booth, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen and Elijah Wood.""Sin City"" is a work of art. The luscious visuals, Miller's colorful characters, the film's bleak, desperate setting and Rodriguez's/Miller's/Tarantino's masterful direction all contribute into making this one of the best feature films of 2005. Set aside 2-plus hours and go along on this joy-ride. Chances are in your favor that you won't be disappointed.Highly recommended."	5.0	Breathtaking!

What a relentlessly gruesome, amoral, soul-deadening slice of grindhouse pulp.And yet, what fun it is to look at, and how entertaining and involving it becomes.""Sin City"" is a perfect example of the kind of film where the talents at work totally overwhelm the subject matter, resulting in a work of art that is much better than it needs to be but is ultimately chained down by the nature of its content. Director Robert Rodriguez, guest director Quentin Tarantino, and a splendid cast of not simply big names but iconic ones squeeze every inch of mileage they can get out of what amount to three stories that really only exist to string along scenes of ever-mounting, sadistic violence that is so shocking that I can't believe it can pass for mainstream entertainment. Simply put, the R-rating for this film is a joke-- even Takashi Miike's ""Audition,"" Gasper Noe's ""Irreversible,"" Scorcese's ""Casino,"" and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" don't match ""Sin City"" for sheer brutality. Forget about ""Kill Bill""; it's not even in the same category.And yet, somehow, the sheer momentum and energy carries the viewer through. Every image oozes style and cool, and the atmosphere is so thoroughly badass that you end up getting swept away despite yourself. Never mind that (SPOILER) the only characters with any moral fiber whatsoever end up dead (END SPOILER). Never mind that the women are either sluts or hookers and the men are murderers and villains. Never mind that there's not an ounce of value that emerges from ""Sin City""'s barrage of ugly cynicism. If you watch this film, you will be unable to take your eyes from it. That's some achievement, given what actually happens on screen. Heck, this movie even survives relentlessly bad performances by its two key female leads; the beautiful, talented Rosario Dawson dons a sexy outfit, but hams it up a little too much; and the significantly less beautiful, less talented actress whom I know only as ""that irritating bitch from the ""Gilmore Girls"" and who singlehandedly undermines the movie's credibility whenever she steps on screen.Also, I've got to admit that I've got a certain amount of love for any action movie that earns its R rating in this era of neutered, PG-13 rated flicks where the trailers are more sexy and violent than the actual films. I'll take ""Sin City"" and ""Bad Boys II,"" flawed though they may be, over ""The Bourne Supremecy"" any day of the week.Still, in spite of what's been accomplished here as far as pure filmmaking goes, you can't help but wonder what the people involved in this project could have done with a more imaginative, if equally pulpy, set of stories."	4.0	Great filmmaking, but not a great film	2005-08-16	3	1	2

078886047X	Sin City	A3JD8FDS3CO3GH	FairiesWearBoots8272	Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City is film noir for the 21st century. The type of film noir that movie audiences have never seen. It's Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler for a new generation. Unlike the writings of Spillane and Chandler, Miller's world features no heroes. Everyone is a villain in Sin City. As we know, however, villains can be good and heroes can be bad. The thin line between the two is at the heart of Sin City.Brilliantly written by Frank Miller and brilliantly directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City is simply one of the most exciting, invigorating films I've ever had the pleasure to see. Movies like this are exactly why I love movies. Sin City is the cinematic art form at its peak. It's bold, passionate, imaginative, striking and uncompromising; things that 90 percent of movies today are not.Squeamish audiences will not be amused, however and that is to be expected. Sin City is quite an extreme film that features tons of extreme violence the likes of which is rarely seen in a Hollywood movie. Because of that, it is sure to be the subject of controversy. However if you can stomach the violence, Sin City will be a unforgettable movie going experience. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have created a world never before seen in the movies. A world that exists nowhere in reality except on the page and on the movie screen. The film must be separated from reality.  Sin City is at no time and in no way realistic, nor is it supposed to be. It's a world where the writer's imagination is the only limit. Fans of film in general and film noir in particular, fans of comics, and fans of pulp crime stories will find much to love in Sin City. I, for one, already consider this gruesome little film among my all-time favorites.I will not talk about the stories or the actors, save that Mickey Rourke delivers an awesome, Oscar-worthy performance.

078886047X	Sin City	A3PBXGRBO4POFS	"Film Buff ""rob"""	"First, I'll start by responding to the review below referring to this film as a debasement of modern society. The film's obvious lack of realism hardly constitutes a true ""snuff"" film. Albeit there's lots of death, mayhem, cannibalism, scrotum-snatching, people-perforating and so forth, it's nowhere nearly as horrific as the less frequent but far more chilling death sequences of say ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the like. This movie laughs at death, as it should. The characters are surrounded by constant danger, live in a dark gritty, sans technicolor universe that's both horribly unforgiving, vengeful, sadistic, and just plain hell bent on their bullet/sword-induced demise. Despite all that death, they manage to smirk and make snide comments. I for one just love that. One can moan and complain about the sequences of death in this film, yet never mention once the countless CGI lives that were lost in the medievil battle on the fields of Pelenor. Both men and horses were impaled stomped on tossed and kicked about by the hulking feet of the Heradrim/Oliphant hoards. A man was slowly engulfed by gigantic bloodworms in the valley of Skull Island. Maximus Desmus Meridius killed many gladiators to survive servitude in the name of entertainment. The list goes on and on and on. The point is that without death, without mayhem, without the horrid underbelly of man's gruesome intent upon his fellow man, the element of danger is gone, and the audience ceases to care. In ""Sin City"", the characters were obviously in grave danger, every sequence was a tick closer to someone's death, creating a hellish gray-scale world of tortuous villains, a cannibalistic sociopath, Amazon Hookers, crooked cops and other assorted ubersadists we would only meet in a dark alley in our worst nightmares. The film was so visually astounding that the look alone was entertaining. The narrative was just as dark and haunting as the high contrast shadows and ominous unseen light sources. Robert Rodriguez's possible cult classic spews violent eye candy, and at the same time  throws in some of the most demented comic-noir ever to be seen on film. I wasn't shocked by the violence, as years of video games and other violent movies slowly developed a thick callous, but I was immensely entertained by this story set in the Urban equivalent of Dante's grim account. The movie's moral anchorage is as grey-scaled as its backdrop. The protagonists use brutish violence to exact vengeance, but are also murderers themselves. This obvious ambiguity of the film is also what makes it so alluring. The good guys act like bad guys, and the bad guys act like pure unadulterated evil incarnate. Everything about this movie works, even the things you'd normally think cannot. Its purified escapist charm spills out all over the screen with beautifully placed yellows reds and pale cool colors set against a sea of cold steely greys blacks and whites. Never have I ever seen a film that looks so awesome, and with the exception of the impending sequel, I don't suppose I will for quite some time."	4.0	In defense of Ultra-noir	2006-05-26	2	2	0

I never read ""Sin City"" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is.  It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.  The film reminded me a lot of another great filmPulp Fictionand I guess with the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino as ""guest director"" this shouldn't surprise me but using the same tactic of merging apparently different storylines really works here unlike elsewhere like inChungking Expresswhere it really didn't work as well.  Although some have tried and doubtless many more will try in the future this almost new genre of graphic novel films has a new standard upon which others will be measured and this film is it.  Great storytelling, great acting and as far as this dvd goes excellent picture and DTS 5.1 surround sound quality makes this just a great film to watch over and over again like any classic film should be.My great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"".  ""Sin City"" for now though is one of the best films that I've watched in many many years and this dvd is also among the best both picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on a non-Blu-ray format.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Pulp Fiction Influenced Excellent Frank Miller Adaptation Makes For the Best Film I've Seen In Years!	2011-07-08	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	ANMFFCVZ3KM81	"F. Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook"""	"Based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate immediately. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself, this film is ultra violence and ultra risqu&eacute;. Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite. It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.The film is a culmination of several short stories, all intermingled. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained. The black and white is grand and enveloping; which tones down the blood splatter being spewed across the screen. This effect turns a would-be mad-slasher movie into cinematic genius.This film has everything, from the A-List of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh-eating psycho that's just too cool for words and a far cry from his Frodo character of the last five years; to over the top storylines with ninja hookers, dirty cops, unstoppable vengeful superhuman hit-men, carnivorous were-boys, IRA mercenary militia and corrupt politicians. It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more.To try to explain the movie in words, would take to long, and would end up incoherent; let's just suffice it to say, ""You'll have to see it to believe it,"" and leave it at that. I must also reiterate that this film is very adult oriented; if you're easily offended or overly sensitive to adult content and graphic subject matter, then I would think twice before viewing. However, since I am neither of these, I enjoyed this film thoroughly.[...]"	5.0	Go see this Film NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-04-20	3	1	2

Micky Rourke,and Bruce Willis are two of the most underated actors in America. Micky Rourke could have been one of the great American actors and here he shows what he could been.Bruce Willis has grown as an actor and is maybe at a point where he no longer needs to be an action hero. Jessia Alba has the present and the beauty of Gene Tierney. But for a film to be great it must make you as the viewer believe that it's real. It doesn't matter if it's the Wizard of Oz or Raging Bull. I never felt that what I was seening was real mainly because the dialoguewas not real, the violence wasn't real.	3.0	something missing	2005-09-20	5	2	3

The entire movie was done in a comic book style, meaning that it was in black and white with only certain aspects colorized, such as a red dress, etc. Also, the movie was a bit disappointing because there wasn't a clearly defined end and it is far from certain whether the good guys or the bad guys won in the end. Actually, it was sometimes hard to tell who was the good guys. With the exception of a few notably good characters, it was the bad guys and the really bad guys.	3.0	What exactly happened?	2013-11-29	3	0	3
078886047X	Sin City	A3OUF25K7TOYIV	"General Darkside ""General Darkside"""	Review form the DarksideWhat I liked, plenty of violence. Chopped off heads, tons of gunshots, blown off hands, blown off heads, mucho sadistic torture, no mercy in the violence department. Stretched the R rating to the limit here.Hot women. I don't fricken know how but this little flick got away with totally turning women into horny sex slaves. Refreshing and very nice. I don't find empowered self-righteous chicks entertaining. All the babes looked totally wacka doo hot. You don't get any full frontal but you get a couple very perfect (almost too perfect) juicy melons. And fellas WOW some insanely perfect rear ends. I can't explain or put into words how flawless these buttocks where. But you'll know when you see the movie.The story was brutal, basically it's about well...sin. Bad people doing bad things. Mix in a couple cool dudes with consciences and a death wish for your two protagonists and you got the story.You get an all-star cast so the acting is all top notch. Even Brittney Murfy who I find creepy and freaky is very cool in Sin City. The dialog is clearly straight form the graphic novel so it seems unnatural at times but you get use to it and dig it after a while.The special effect and CGI are everywhere I love that shiz so I dug it and reveled in the lush artwork and city scrapes.The best character in this black and white fistfight of a movie was Marv played by Mickey Rourke. He was totally tough and likeable for a drunk, twisted, thug, loser, horny, smoke pipe, sadistic murderer. Kind of like John Travolta and Sam Jackson in pulp fiction when you first saw the movie, before they became played out and old.Sin City is very comic bookish, violent, sexy, and will have you glued to the screen for 2+hours and wishing it wouldn't end.I recommend it check it out.	5.0	Darkside review of SIN CITY	2005-10-17	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	Even moreso than usual, I have nothing to tell you about this movie that hasn't been said a million times before.  Still, some things are cool enough that you've gotta take the time to recommend them no matter what.  As I said in my title, this film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.  It virtually never lets up, and has the visual innovation, technical brilliance and sheer oddness to make feel like it could've gone on for a whole lot longer without getting old.As others have said, this is perhaps the ultimate 'guy film', and it's delightfully violent and perverse without either becoming to grim or seeming like it is solely meant to shock.  Plenty of people are offended by the violence, though it's tough to imagine why considering how over the top most of it is.  Also, others have accused it of being sexist as the majority of the women are in the film are prostitutes and scantily clad. (You'd think the fact that all the men in the movie are killers and criminals and slimebags would offset this and make it merely misanthropic, or perhas *gasp* a sheer piece of absurd fantasy with no real connection to reality, but apparently not)  I find both these causes for offense to be utterly ridiculous, but it is relevant to the certain groups.  So prudes and humorless feminists: Beware! You won't wanna see this movie.  Or, maybe you will, as getting offended seems to be the primary pleasure of those two groups.  But whatever, the people who do wanna see this movie know who they are, and they'll like it.As everyone knows, this movie is divided into 3 major sections.  I like this pattern, as only having a couple relatively brief segments means that things have to get going fast, and that the film has numerous peaks.  Everyone loves to compare this to `Pulp Fiction' though this isn't totally relevant, as though the segments cross over and reference each other, they all stand alone and don't really illuminate each other all that much.  The internal references are just kinda... cool, but they aren't really all that important.  Though there is a slight concern: The segments proceed in decreasing order of quality, so the best parts of the movie are at the beginning.  Still, it's all good enough that this doesn't matter all that much.Most people love to talk about the black and white with occasionally bits of color as the major trait of the film, but I think some of the other stylistic quirks are more unusual and intriguing.  The dialogue and acting are deliberately over the top, a slight caricature of you're stereotypical noir dialogue and mannerisms, which combines with some nearly perpetual voice overs from the primary characters, and lots of sleazy music to complete the noir feel.  The overblown noir stylization is combined with some really bizarre and of the wall characters, such as the scrawny-mute-superhuman-cannibal-serial-killer-farmboy, the misshapen-yellow-pedophile-mancreature and the deadly-asian-ninja-prostitute.  This is all pretty weird, naturally, but it never gets so unusal that it can't be taken seriously.The film also really illustrates the potential of digital filming, as the backgrounds and scenery are combined with the actors seamlessly.  The world doesn't look real, exactly, but, of course, it's not really meant to, and there's never any doubt that the actors are there.Despite the emphasis on style, and over the top violence and action, the film has a certain emotional resonance.  It may all be absurd, but Marv and Hartigan are still genuinely likable, sympathetic characters.  Dwight is less compelling, but he's still pretty, well, cool, and that's pretty good too.Yeah, that's it.  The core-audience for this film will almost certainly like it, and have doubtless already seen it.  Everyone else... I dunno.  But I sure like it.	5.0	Pure Entertainment	2005-04-12	3	2	1

While not perfect in any sense of the word, ""Sin City"" is a truly visually engaging experience, and a wonderful adaptation of Frank Miller's namesake novel series.Prior to the release of the movie, I read the books, and what I later saw on the screen was practically a carbon copy. Sure, that means I wasn't truly surprised by the end, but really, it's rare that you get to see sure a great adaptation from the page to the screen. Atop that, I honestly think that ""Sin City"" is a fabulously shot film, almost every shot and angle is perfect, no flaws. Sure, I think there are some roles that could be better cast, but the people in the film, they did their best, and it paid off - creating what will probably be one of the best films of 2005."	5.0	Well, you either love it or hate it...	2005-09-16	0	0	0

Dont bother with the back story just sit down and watch. You can't help but be glued to the screen, all the characters are amazing. Marv is easy the tour de force of the movie, but there are also nice little surprises, for example the two thugs that speak to each other using elegant prose. I cannot recommend this movie enough.

078886047X	Sin City	AITKXU3ZGAA0I	Georgios A. Katsaros	"Frank Miller Sin City finally gets made into a faithful comic book adaptation into a film.Frank Miller after having bad experience with Hollywood he had given up the idea of making Sin City into a film.But the only person that could convince him and get his trust was the talented Robert Rodriguez.All he had to was a little audition tape like a short film for Frank Miller and that's all he needed.He was impressed and so are we with one of best comic book films there is.Robert Rodriguez does beautiful job of transferring it into a film.Giving a Frank Miller a chance to co-direct a film resulting Rodriguez leaving the Directors Guild Of America.Because the guild has some weird rules on co directors they didnt allow this.So thats whay he left the Guild.Only in circumstances that the two directors are brothers could they co directa film.Sin City compromising from three stories.""The Hard Good-Bye"",""The Big Fat Kill"",""That Yellow Bastard"" and also a short story ""The Customer Is Always Right"" that we see in the beginning.""The Hard Good-Bye"" tells the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke) and his search for the killer of Goldie (Jamie King) threw his search he goes deeper threw the corruption of Basin City and finding the one responsible.In this story we have a unforgettable performance by Mickey Rouke as Marv.He is really the definition of a antihero.Also a surprising performance by Elijah Wood as Kevin.I mean from a good old Hobbit to a crazy killer he gives very good performance.Also playing is Carla Gugino as Lucile Marv's parole officer.We all remember her from Rodriguez Spy Kids.Then we have ""The Big Fat Kill""  that revolves around Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy and the balance of Old Town,the Police and the Mob and the deal between them.Rosario Dawson plays Gail the leader of Old Town.In this one we have Clive Owen having a American accent and doing very well and being cool in this story.Also we get a special guest director in one of the scenes the one and only Quentin Tarantino he did it as repaying the favor of Rodriguez scoring Kill Bill Volume 2.In the third and last story ""That Yellow Bastard.We have Hartigan (Bruce Willis) trying to protect little old Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from the crazy son of Senator Rourke Junior (Nick Stahl).He has to protect Nancy keep his code of honesty and not come to corruption.This film has one of the best ensemble casts I have seen.From all the actors I have mentioned there are still so many to mention as well.From Michael Madesen,Alexis Bidel,Devon Aeoki,Rosario Dawson,Powers Boothe,Rughter Hauer,Josh Harnett and lots of others.They play there characters perfectly were casted very well.The film is identical in so many ways to the comic.From shot to shot analyses to dialogue to characters.Rodriguez is really putting Miller's vision to the screen and not really his.The effects are amazing for being all on green screen and seeming so real.The only real set built was the bar in the film.The look is very film noir.And really the thing that brings this film together a lot is the music.By Rodriguez,John Debney and Graham Revell.The music suits the film in so many ways.It adds to the suspense the noir feeling of the film woth some nice jazz stuff in the theme in the start.The score is one of the best ive heard.Also Rodriguez directs,edits,scores and photographs the film.He is really a talented guy.Doing all of that at the same time cooperating with another directors and scoring the music as well.This film I have to mention kind of violent.To tell you truth it has to be.If it wasn't violent in that way we wouldn't believe we were in the world of Sin City.What also great about this film is the use of voiceover.I think that my favorite part of film hearing what characters are thinking about and what they feel and how to face their troubles.You don't find very good voiceover often that immerses you into the film.This DVD is jam packed with extras.The set will include both the 124 minute theatrical release, along with the 147 minute extended cut. Both will be presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with English DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround tracks. Extras will include a commentary with director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, a second commentary with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and a third commentary containing Austin Premiere crowd reaction! Also included will be a 15 minute film school with the director, a Movie in High-Speed Green Screen feature, 17 uninterrupted minutes of Tarantino's segment, footage of a Sin City cast/crew party, and a 10 minute cooking school with Robert Rodriquez. Completing the package will be four featurettes on the cars, special effects make-up, costumes and props, a featurette on how they convinced Miller to assist with the film, another featurette on casting, a featurette on Tarantino the guest director, trailers, bloopers, and an interactive game. Topping it all off will be a complete Sin City graphic novel (The Hard Goodbye).I think this one of the best films of the year.And all fans will be waiting for the arrival of the next film.A interview that Robert Rodriguez  gave he said that the next one will be ""A Dame To Kill For"".That features Marv,Dwight,Gail and everybody else in the world of Sin City."	5.0	Walk Down The Right Back Alley In Sin City And You Can Find Anything	2005-10-10	2	2	0

There are no other films of which I'm aware that have taken the comic book (or graphic novel) format to the screen with such ingenuity and aplomb as Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City.The acting is superb and the action gripping, flowing and beautiful.The story surrounds three different groups of inhabitants of ""Sin City"". We follow a police man (Bruce Willis) in his quest to catch a child molester/killer (Nich Stahl); a parolee (Mickey Rourke) who is set up for having killed a prostitute(Jame King); a group of prostitutes who run a section of Sin City and are headed by Rosario Dawson. The stories all come together, but not in tight neat little bundles as you many be used to. The outcome of this film noir is not necessarily a happy one.The graphic novel was drawn in black and white with limited usage of color. Rodriguez does the same here. It is absolutely one of the things that makes this film not only unique but gripping.This is an action film that warrants several viewings simply because you are going to be so caught up in how cool the film looks that you'll lose track of the plot.Check this one out."	3.0	Well crafted, well acted, and ultimately entertaining film	2005-08-25	1	1	0

The cinematic part, or perhaps more precisely, the post-processing here is outstanding. It deserves ten stars: the film looks like a moving comics book. It is a fully acted, ""normal"" movie that nevertheles looks stark and painterly and drawn and extremely expressive, as if it were complete animation. It's black-and-white with very rare splashes of colour (which therefore comes across very accented). It's truly nicely done -- in that respect. I loved the visual aspects of this movie.But otoh, as to the story, it's typical comics-book twaddle: predictable, cheesy, maudlin -- truly uninteresting, stereotypical and stupid. Of course some may say, well, it's precisely what it's trying to be, its story is stylised just as much as its visuals. I'll accept that, but then I guess, I simply didn't like it. Stylised visuals, yes; the story (stylised or not), no, not really. I don't care for these conventions; comics books were not a significant part of my upbringing; and in fact, a lot of these stereotypes irritate me -- like for example that pretty, young women are always hookers. I guess it's the only kind that the dorks who put it all together ever knew or could think of, but it's annoying. Many things like that.I see some reviewers complain about violence in this flick: there's for sure a lot of it, but it's so cartoonish that it just doesn't come across as anything disturbing. I mean, a dude hits someone tied to a chair, and the whole thing (both victim and chair, LOL) just fly away. This sort of violence: is it gonna produce psychological disturbances in any one? I think not.Bottom line: I would recommend you check it out for the sakes of the visuals -- definitely if you're into movies (as in ""making them"", not just as a viewer). But as a complete piece of art, this is crudely conventionalized, vulgar imbecility that, I feel, only muttonheads will enjoy. Well, naturally the whole genre (comics) is somewhat muttonheaded to begin with, but still, I love good drawings (they can be far more espressive than traditional film), but there's nothing in the idea of a picture book that prevents a good story. What you got here is a parody, mockery of the ""noir"" genre. It's style over substance, and overall it's noisome and hard to last through."	3.0	Hard to rate: some great, some wretched	2014-04-06	1	0	1

078886047X	Sin City	A19XVT1A1BLPRH	"Girl Geek ""S. Smylz"""	"Traditional Film Noir meets Robert Rodriguez in this epic dramatization of Frank Miller's Graphic Serial, ""Sin City"".  The resulting picture is visually astounding and hauntingly dramatic.Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller take us on journey through three separate stories that ultimatley intersect through out the movie. The stories include a man-hunt for the killer of a ""Perfect Woman"", an aging cop about to retire who has to complete that one last bust, and a group of women who rule the area of Basin City called ""Old Town"".The direction and editing of this movie are no less than we would expect from Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez reminds us that he is extremly good at what he does. The whole film is shown in Black and White and seems to take place in the 1930's, preserving the feel of Noir.  To give it a modern twist, colors and cell phones were added in.  We see a woman in a red dress standing at the edge of a balcony, a man who's so evil his skin has turned a putrid yellow, and other more subtle touches, such as Alexis Bledsole's eyes and the flashlight as it shines on Clive Owen's face.The over-the-top acting deserves an A+. If it were any other cast, I'd think it was just bad acting.  However, the A-List stars have taken the film ""to the next level"" (Sorry, I had to throw a Spy Kids quote in). It adds a fantasy feel to what otherwise would just be another dramatic movie.  It is similar to the acting in Molholland Drive during the dream sequence. Probably the best perfomance is done by Mickey Rourke as Marv, I didn't even recognize him st first. Hopefully Marv can do for Mickey what Cap'n Jack Sparrow did for Johnny. Elijah Wood also shows us that he can be more than just a ""Hobbit from the Shire"".This movie contains strong violence. A man is beaten to death, and another is fed to a dog. There are suggestions of Child Molestation, Prostitution, and a couple of characters use Religion to justify cannibalism. Though there are some bloody sequences, most use a bright white goop to signify blood, looking more like a bird pooped on them. Like Kill Bill, body parts are sliced off non-chalantly, but unlike Kill Bill, it's kept below 100.  There is also some tongue-in-cheek comic relief. Watch for the bow and arrow scene.Viewers who enjoy this movie will also like both Kill Bill Movies and ""Pulp Fiction"", by ""Guest Director"" Quentin Tarantino and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" or ""Desperado"", Robert Rodriguez.  You may also want to check out some other Modern Noir Films like ""Molholland Drive"" (David Lynch) and ""Never Die Alone"", as well as Tradtional Film Noir flix, ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Notorious"", and ""The Maltese Falcon"".All in all this movie is a must see for Film Noir and Rodriguez/Taratino Fans alike."	4.0	Modern Film Noir At It's Finest	2005-04-01	12	11	1
078886047X	Sin City	AQSQLWD3NLMAS	Glenn A. Buttkus	"The concept for this film started in the Comics revolution of the late 60's with incredible artists like Frank Frazetta, Jim Steranko, Neal Adams, and Barry Smith. They knew anatomy, and they used photographs to compose their backgrounds. Pre-Anime, the characters began to ""almost"" move off the pages. Frank Miller came along in 1978. He helped to inaugurate the adult graphics novels-larger formats, better paper, brighter inks-coupled to nudity and R-rated dialogue. Some of this has been around since the late 50's, but the new format was gathering speed and Miller was in the vanguard.Miller's graphic novel's about SIN CITY contained art in panels that broke down like very detailed storyboards. When Robert Rodriguez decided to court Miller and sell him on the idea of converting the graphics to digital video-Miller loved it. Their partnership went so far as to have Rodriguez dropping out of the Director's Guild so that he might be permitted to put Frank Miller in the credits as co-director. Rodriguez created a B&W; world where color was used sparingly-and for great effect. Blood was white-or bright red. Some eyes were blue. Some hair was blond. Pale green and pale blue showed up on classic cars.Rodriguez assembled a powerhouse cast. Bruce Willis was first up, to boost the sales of the production and the star power. He was excellent in the film-beginning to appear very Noir-very Chandler and Hammett-a modern Bogart. Using CGI and live actors, Rodriguez was able to do most of the work in his homegrown studio in Texas. Miller created a world part pulp-novel, classic cars-and part hyper-violent martial arts and splatter film. Everybody smoked, many of them drove a ragtop-they could shoot guns with both hands simultaneously-and women, regardless of how far they had fallen-were still treated with respect. More than an adaptation of Millers comic book art-it is literally his artwork brought starkly to life. The effect is original, violent, sexy, existential-and very effective.The film worked off three Miller ""stories""-and the best of the three-THE BIG FAT KILL-starred Mickey Rourke. He can think of this film as his return to the big time. He is brilliant. His character, Marv, is perfectly fitted for this new genre-and his acting, and the action he precipitates-blows all the others in the film out of the water. This may be Rourke's finest performance. He has been a pro boxer, as well as actor-and he needed that physical prowess for this role.Everyone in the film was impressive-with the likes of Clive Owen, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Harnett, and Michael Clarke Duncan all making love, murdering, or slapping around women like Jessica Albo, Jamie King, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, and Brittany Murphy. One critic wrote,"" This is a Mickey Spillane fever dream!""There is a rumor that in the director's cut RR will include some deleted scenes that he shot to flush out all three of the Miller stories. It appears that a sequel is imminent-absolutely necessary. Most of us can't wait for the next installment-to cruise Old Town, prowl the Roark farm, beware of the warrior hookers, love the hot babes, dodge the bullets and swords and knives, and stare at those great cars."	5.0	Basin City Blues	2005-07-21	281	227	54

The entire mood of the picture, from cinematography, to dialogue, to acting, is a faithful and stunning conversion of the novel to the movie.  Each carefully composed scene, each piece of artfully stunted dialogue, the stylised yet substantial characters, all ring true to the directors vision of an artful and accurate translation from one media to the other.  Yes it's violent, yes it has stereotypes, get over it. That's what the movie is, and if you don't like it don't watch it.

This film was amazing. It was really dark, had alot of action and alot of blood. The movie is broken into three stories. My favorite is The hard goodbye. See theres this big guy named Marv. Not really a ladies man but he loved this hooker. She was murderd and Marv gets framed. But he won't go down easy and won't let the cops get him easy either. He beats people up or kills them or does both. The movie gets very graphic too. For example Marv tends to cut off a guys legs and arms. Or you'll see peoples heads get choped off. I'm gladd to own this 2 disc box set. You get the entire novel of The Hard Goodbye, trailers, behind the scenes including the cars of sin city, and of course the extended uncut version of the movie broken down into four stories.

078886047X	Sin City	A1VJ7HYM1EC94M	"G P Padillo ""paolo"""	"With any luck Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" will inspire a new genre of filmmaking - a literal union between filmmaking and the world of comic books/graphic novels.  I know, I know, there have been countless films inspired by the world of comic books which have attempted to recreate the chills and thrills.  Not one of them - even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.Rodriguez, Miller and company obviously put themselves (and the cast) through painstaking paces to assure every frame, every emotion emoted by an astonishing array of live talent is instilled with the gritty, graphic hyperrealism of the world of Frank Miller.  It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed and be underappreciated by many who don't ""get"" this world.The cast is nothing short of remarkable:  Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly - maybe ever.  Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than the retiring cop, Hartigan.  Everyone involved is obviously relishing having the time of their lives.  Outside of Shakespeare I can't imagine anything currently more theatrically over-the-top and satisfying than being associated with Sin City.For many the violence will be of too gory and graphic in nature (gorygraphic?).  Others will enjoy the rough ride but also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images.  The final tale in the trilogy of stories that make up the movie is shot with the cool and chill of winter bathed in a snow storm of such exquisite beauty that I don't find it difficult to say it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.

078886047X	Sin City	A1F1G7ZR6SHTKN	GreenEggsandHam	"A comic book, by whatever name you wish to call it, is low art. But it is a true art form. To take its elements -- such as voice-over; choppy corny dialog; unevenly rendered details; and gritty, realistic, but seemingly arbitrarily arranged compositions -- and apply them to motion pictures, should be a disaster. But SIN CITY really does work. The images are dramatic, the acting intense, the plots thoughtful. The presumed-crude elements lend a throwback sense to the movie, almost as if one is back in the early silent era and the director is experimenting with the medium and struggling and stumbling to get his story told. Yet it's probably mostly state-of-the-art special effects!And the DVD looks great on a bigscreen TV! Everything's vivd. The blacks and whites, the few colors, the details, the emotions, the heroism and villainy! Violence, nudity, very adult themes: it's very deserving of the ""R"" rating.

Entertainment value in this movie depends on how many times you can enjoy the same guy being killed over and over again.  Variety involves method of execution.  Atmospheric sets, and cinematic style are not enough to make a good movie. So what does that leave?  Ah yes, gorey special effects. It didn't offend, it just bored - like watching someone else play a video game.  The Mickey Rourke sequence was probably the best of the bunch, but even then, this movie's a time waster.  The difference between this pulp fiction and Tarantino's masterpiece (back when he still had an ounce of creativity) is that the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" had memorable characters and character development, interesting situations and dialogue, humour to round off the violence (and when the violence hit, it was scary!) and an intriguing and clever story all the way through.

But the whole thing judders to a dead stop when Clive Owen appears. I've no idea who he's sleeping with or who he's got the goods on, but it's obvious he hasn't got as far as he has on talent: the man simply cannot act to save his life. He looks bored, he sounds bored, and dammit, he IS bored throughout his section, dragging the movie down with his inertia and lack of talent.But definitely buy this DVD. Why? Well, it could be because Mickey Rourke gives the performance of a lifetime in his section. Or it could be because Bruce Willis shows how even only one gear away from autopilot star quality can carry noir to the heights. But mostly it's because you can skip through Clive Owen's dead weight scenes and get to the good stuff in a way you couldn't in the cinema, leaving you with a great 70 minute movie instead of a compromised 100 minute one.66/100% proof!	3.0	Well, two out of three ain't bad	2005-08-07	13	1	12

This is a movie, of four crime stories adapted from Frank Miller's popular comics. It focuses around a muscular brute (Marv played amazingly smooth by Micky Rourke) who's looking for the person responsible for the death of his beloved Goldie.  Marv's fed up with Sin City's corrupt law enforcement, so he takes the law into his own hands.  In his past he has made a horrible mistake killing a cop who risks his life to protect a girl from a deformed pedophile, and a hitman looking to make a little cash.But the story itself is just the icing on the cake and something to wrap around a the days garbage.  The real reason to watch this movie, besides all the great looking woman who some how manage to look just as tough as the men (while walking around naked) is the STYLE.  The constant flow from black and white to partial color (almost always red for blood) and the almost cartoonish mayhem, are what make this a GREAT movie.  Somehow the movie never seems too over the top (ok sometimes it's hanging on Occam's razor) or the acting to be too broad to be campy. It's just great fun to watch all these actors enjoying themselves and playing it staight for laughs.	4.0	Farewell my Ugly, terrible way to part and endship	2006-10-28	3	3	0

But it just reminded me of some critics who do not seem to understand that movies don't have to be the same old scene, and that maybe some movies can be adapted from a rather incredible source and honor that source by mimicking the style of the source so successfully that anyone who is familiar with said source material will be transfixed, amazed, and comforted that movies are not doomed (just Hollywood).  If this was to be adapted from a standard novel would the source material be used so literally?  Of course not - standard novels are not a series of pictures that are easily interpreted as storyboards.  This film was all style and substance, and to think otherwise indicates too much distraction in the critic's heart when considering how different this movie is from others.  It's not a Merchant Ivory film, it's not a Lion's Gate film, it's a pulp noir that looks about as perfect as the 2-D technology allows.  A Sin City story could not be appropriately told without the heavy contrast of black and white.  Great story, fascinating and memorable characters, and well-shot action.

I have long been a fan of the Sin City comics and so I'm delighted with the movie. No other film based on ANY comic has so accurately been brought to life. I was entranced. Yes, it's violent. And dark. And graphic. Well, duh. It's called ""SIN CITY"" for a reason. If you're a fan of the comics, you will love this movie. If not, you probably won't. It really is that simple. My only complaint about this film is shallow. Really shallow. Be warned.Jessica Alba plays a stripper in danger who is repeatedly saved by a cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis). This is my complaint: strippers take off their clothes. She doesn't. Told you I'm shallow. But, still. Given the incredibly faithful adaption of the rest of the comic to film, this one ommission was glaring. Actors and Actresses take note: if you have a ""no-nudity"" clause in your contract, you are probably not the correct person to portray a stripper.That aside, this was an extrordinary film and I'll definately watch it again."	5.0	An incredible translation of comic to film	2005-08-27	3	3	0

A cop resists and walks around this nasty marsh and does what the thinks he's right. But a dark complot awaits for him and after eight years in prison he will have to make justice by his own . The other mixed story collides with Nancy in the bar, where Marty tries desperately to seek the murder of Goldie the only woman who loved him although his ugliness (Mickey Rourke is in top form with this underground character who reminds to Johnny the handsome).The third story is about the last frontier, habited by women who live and survive from harassments, abuses, rapes and unthinkable touches of evil.The film is told, through voices in off, another honoured tribute to the Noir genre.

There is also plenty of eye-candy for boys and girls alike. It is intensely creative. It is also extremely violent and perverse--not for the very young or those unused to extreme violence. I recently saw The Spirit, another film by Frank Miller and it cannot compare to Sin City. It is the very best of the genre.	5.0	One of the best modern movies	2008-12-31	1	0	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1SAZB83QFR0W2	"JackOfMostTrades ""Jack"""	Taking the hard-boiled voice-over narrator and snappy dialogue of film noir, Rodriguez and co., join it with hard-edged high contrast black and white cartoon imagery (of course, you have to call it 'graphic novel' to give it some cache but it's still for 12 to 14 year old boys, and complete with  a cast of steroidal goons, broads, molls, and down and out raggedy cops.  A few interwoven tales of mob hits and ornery down and out or mean secondary characters thrown in for variety. It all results in a mix-up of styles that is puerile, stupid, and boring to boot.  Besides being a copy rather than a pastiche, there is no true originality here.  The MAJOR stylistic problem is that in the film noirs, the camera was an observer, so the snappy dialogue, gravely voices of the men and sweetheart tones of the femmes and broad gestures of each gender were prominent and provided 'space' to be savored and enjoyed. The failure here is that the visuals compete with the dialogue so one's attention is basically divided so neither can be appreciated.  There is just too much going on at once.  Also, adding a few kill bill rip-off tumbling acts to the mix does not help the noirish quality but rather dilutes it and renders it pointless, sort of like using the imagery of West Side Story and replacing the Bernstein/Sondheim score with gangsta rap.  Each 'art' form alone may have validity, but together it's a disaster.  So is this film	1.0	OK, 1 and 1/2 -but basically illiterate garbage	2005-12-02	68	14	54

078886047X	Sin City	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	This animated comic book is a marvellous gem that we should all see, watch and scrutinize several times a day to convince ourselves that the world has reached a no-return point. The black and white pictures are shockingly beautiful with subtle nuances in the greys and in the playing on light, or absence of light. The use of colors in that dark environment fascinates our eyes and mesmerizes our minds. The symbolic values of these colors are kind of simple though. Red as the color of blood or prostituted love is quite banal. Babylon is never very far away when red jumps into the picture. Yellow is funnier since it is the color of the arch-criminal, the senator's son. But yellow is also the color of fearful jaundice and of the cavalry, though the cavalry is not supposed to be afraid of anything and this barbaric torturer of a senator's son is not bouncing onto us to protect women and children, but rather to cut children into slices and transform women's heads into hunting trophies. The plot itself is sort of entangled : one plot in another and one crime in still another like so many russian dolls. Ir is fascinating to see all those super-heroes die and revive periodically. But the film is quite more pessimistic than Spiderman because there is no hope of an escape, no hope of a regeneration, no hope of an end to a neverending cycle of rotting and decaying because crime comes with power and power brings crime, since power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as is well-known. So do not forget to see that film if you do not want to die in ignorance.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	4.0	No Sim City indeed	2005-06-23	4	3	1
078886047X	Sin City	A313H6238N589	"Jaewoo Kim ""OB-Wan"""	I hardly ever watch the same movie twice in a row. But with this one I did. I had to. It was that mesmerizing.This movie could easily have grossed over $200M if it wasn't so bold in attacking the religious right and those in power.Sin City is where people regularly suffer oppression and injustice from those in power (priests, senators, and police). It is a story of those who choose to fight against their brutal oppressors.The protagaonists, although far from perfect and ideal, genuinely want to do good and right in a world where virtue is rare. Fighting back often means making the powerful suffer. It becomes a game of who can inflict the most pain on the other. Is such a world so far from the reality?The movie is bold in its search for the truth of the human heart. Will a man do anything for a woman who has given him her body and kindness when no one else has? Can a good cop overcome his irresistible attraction to a voluptuous 19 year old whom he has saved from rape only 8 years earlier?The protagonists and villians are highly unique. Mickey Rourke was extraordinary as Marv and deserves an Oscar nomination.I believe the footage of Jessica Alba doing a cowboy dance on stage will be studied as a cinematography masterpiece.This movie hits on all cylinders in its bold attempt to provoke thought and passion in its viewers.	5.0	Stunningly great	2006-02-08	1	0	1

078886047X	Sin City	A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	"Jake Z ""holden84"""	SIN CITY could be one of the best movies I've seen in 2005. Adapted from Frank Miller's comic books, we are invited into the world of Sin City. We follow three storylines. My favorite was the one starring Mickey Rourke as Marv. He was brilliant in this movie and handed in one of his best performances. Lots of big names in this movie including Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Harnett, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jessica Alba, Jamie King, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, and Brittany Murphy. The performances were all excellent. I also love the comic book feel of the movie, the direction and the overall darkness of it all.	5.0	Excellent	2005-08-31	3	3	0

Ferguson ""Critical Critic"""	When you find yourself contemplating that there is nothing else to make movies about, along comes Sin City.I have actually found others who won't even watch this movie because it's in black and white.  I was leaning that direction, but had to give it a try.  And very delighted I did!Sin City, that although black and white, visually appears like a 3D comic book.  What color is shown, at random moments throughout the movie is ingeniously crafted to the storyline.  While spawning off into several stories, the plotline was great, and kept me hating that the movie was going to end.Would definately want to see a sequel to this one.  Sin City is awardworthy.	5.0	Standing Ovation!	2005-09-12	1	1	0
078886047X	Sin City	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	You have to give Robert Rodriguez credit for remaining faithful to Frank Miller's vision, but the graphic novels do not translate very well to the screen.  It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie.  Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.  It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.  Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.  But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up.  It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil.  This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days.	3.0	A city drenched in violence	2005-10-27	5	3	2

078886047X	Sin City	A2PXHT4JQXYH61	James	I will confess, I have never read Sin City comic strips, but I think the movie industry should have chosen a different comic strip to make a movie about.  I decided to watch this movie because the credicts raved about this movie, to me after watching it--a very big disappointment.  Here are things that I did not like about the movie.  First, Bruce Willis acts exactly same no matter which movie he is in.  He has one facial expression for everything. When I thought he was killed of very early in the movie, I became very happy thinking that I don't have to put up with him anymore, but he came back towards end of the movie. I generally don't watch any movies with him in it.  Second, I heard some professional movie credict say that the running scene in which Bruce runs through the forest was a great scene, because it was done with a forest back drop and that he was not actually running throught the woods.  Well, after watching this scence, my friends and I thought it was not a big deal.  In fact, the whole scene looked very fake to us.  It actually look like a fake back drop was moving while he was just running in one place.  I think it would have looked better if he was really running in the woods.  Third, the white brightness of the movie really bothered my eyes.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the movie,  Fourth, The dialog was just oful, more of one liners throughout the whole movie.  Fifth, When a crook throws a garnade, some people got killed and others who were blown clear away had not even one scratches on them and they were perfectly fine.  Some people got shot many times in the chest and got killed, while others got the same thing but just walked away.  Sixth, Why does all the girls including the female pro officer walked around wearing skanky clothes.  Almost all the females in the movie were prostutes.  No wonder the females in the real life have a tough time being taken seriously.  This movie was nothing but violence, nudity, bad dialog, bad acting, bad lighting, and confusion.  I would not recommend this trash to anyone.	1.0	Entertaining for those who likes violence and nothing more!	2005-08-27	25	6	19

As with the filmsRumble Fish (Special Edition)(1983),Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)(1993) andPleasantville (New Line Platinum Series)(1998), their is a a splash of color from time to time, mostly blood red in this one.This film is based on Frank Miller's adult graphic novels so this film is not for children to see.  Contains violence and nudity.Bruce Willis begins the film as ""Hartigan"".Mickey Rourke returns to the silver screen.  In real-life, Micky Rourke's face was disfigured by his time of boxing after he quit acting.  His face has since been reconstructed and the muscles are really his.

078886047X	Sin City	A1FGG93X6HT374	James O'Blivion	"Despite the posted opinions of several reviewers that ""you'd have to be a(n) [insert derogatory remark here] to enjoy Sin City,"" it still has an overwhelmingly high rating here.  I guess that means the ""Ayes"" have it in this case...and I'm among them.  I guess those reviewers think that 90% of the people who've rated the film here are stupid, depraved, sexist, or all of the above.Let's take a look at the detractors for a moment, shall we?First, there are those who are appalled at the level of violence, despite a great deal of it taking place off-screen (in the comics, it should be pointed out, they would not have had this luxury).  But these are the same people who complain about violent films across the board (though they generally ignore the violence in certain movies because they LIKE them, regardless).  There have been FAR more violent films than Sin City (including The Passion of the Christ, a movie generally hailed by those who hate Sin City)...but these folks like to talk about this movie as if it's the ne plus ultra of gore.  This is ludicrous, and these people aren't worth discussing, really...so we'll move on.""This movie was so sexist, I can't believe it!  This is NOT a female-friendly film!!!""  Interesting.  My girlfriend, who is simultaneously a strong, independent woman and an unashamed ""girly girl,"" really loved this movie.  Then I gave her the comics to read, and she loved them as well...so we went to see the movie again.  Of course, she doesn't look at things from such a narrow point of view.  She recognizes that EVERY character in Sin City is an archetype...the men are portrayed just as badly as the women, if not worse.  Despite all of the talk about women being degraded and brutalized in Sin City, most of the bruality is aimed at the male characters, and the most empowered characters in the film are women.  Go figure.""This isn't really film noir...what a rip-off.""  I've heard every conceivable argument here, and don't agree one bit.  ""Film noir has lead characters with fatal flaws...Sin City doesn't.""  Were we watching the SAME Sin City?  The Sin City in which EVERY lead character has at least ONE fatal flaw?  To say that Hartigan, Dwight, and (come on, people) Marv have no fatal flaws is like saying that James Dean had no style.  Next.  ""Film noir has characters double-crossing each other...Sin City doesn't.""  You mean like Bob shooting his partner in the back?  Like Becky selling out her friends for mob money?  These don't constitute double-crosses?  Again, were we watching the same movie?  Next.  ""Film noir has plot twists...Sin City doesn't.""  Oh, come on!  Let's not be stupid here, people.  Sin City has everything that film noir requires...flawed characters, double-crosses, bleak worldview, complex character relationships, high-level corruption...you name it.  Sin City is film noir, and the people who point out what film noir is supposed to be are simply proving my point.""This movie is SOOOOOOO derivative of Tarantino's movies (or any other popular director)!!!!!!!""  Is it?  Despite the fact that the original Sin City comics were released in 1991, when QT was still relatively unknown?  I've heard people say that Sin City is a Pulp Fiction rip-off, despite the fact that much of the material in Sin City was written and drawn before Pulp Fiction, and the film is essentially a carbon copy of Miller's comics.  That's strange...perhaps Mr. Miller has a time machine?Among those who are fans of the comics, there have been very few complaints...the only one I've heard was from a chap who complained that the film was TOO MUCH like the comics (which I didn't understand in the first place), but then went on to point out things that were left out of the movie, and how that bothered him.  Seems he was so confused that he couldn't decide whether he hated the movie for being too faithful to the comics, or not faithful enough.  But apart from him, it seems that every fan of Miller's comics is hailing Sin City as the ultimate comic book adaptation...and with good reason.  It is a PERFECT translation from page to screen, unlike anything I have ever seen.  Finally, comic book fans have a film that doesn't pointlessly alter the storyline, doesn't change the style, doesn't ruin the dialogue of the books, doesn't kill the mood of the source material.In my opinion, Sin City is the perfect comic book movie, painstakingly adapted from one of the most powerful comic book series in the history of the medium.  And it seems that the majority agree with me.  That doesn't necessarily mean that we're right...maybe we ARE all stupid, depraved, sexist buffoons, however unlikely that may be...but hopefully, I've done a sufficient job of explaining why I think this is a great movie, why I will always have a place in my heart for it, and why I'm eagerly awaiting the next Sin City film.This review was written by a well-studied film buff...who is in no way a sexist, an idiot, or a psychopath."	5.0	"The ""Ayes"" Have It..."	2005-05-31	8	5	3

Now, You know the plot, so I'll just tell you about the expierence. When I first started watching this film, it was breathtaking. I got really giddy, knowing/not-knowing what is to come. The movie is so amazing, I could barley contain it all. I couldn't talk for 30 minutes after the film had ended, because i could not believe what i had seen. Some say this is violent, but it isn't. The violence is stylized and cartoony, not graphic. And, whats more shocking than the ""graphic violence"" is its moments of heavenly grace and beauty. Seeing such a desolete city, and then seeing a gorgeous angel, it is very stimulationg.

078886047X	Sin City	A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ	Jason	"Sin City is a collection of semi-connected scenes for various people in a wild city.  Prostitution, pedophilia, murder, and corruption, it's just like Detroit.  Aside from the plot, the cinematography is stunning.  It's trendy, mostly black-and-white, with emphasis on specific colors to draw attention to ideas or concepts that enhance or benefit the movie.  Whether it's the blue eyes of an ""innocent"" prostitute, the yellow deformities of a killer, or the kaliedescope of colors indicating confusion and tension, the vivid colors are the tip of an amazingly represented film.The movie starts with the murder of a young woman.  At first it seems pointless, but it's simply a buildup for the chaos to come.Bruce Willis plays a detective trying to save a young girl from the grips of an evil pedophiliac.  Unfortunately for Willis, the villain has family connections and an appetite for murder.  It's up to Willis to stop the crime, and save a young child, and evidently, satisfy his urge for genital mutilation.The obvious star of the film is, Merv, the character played by Mickey Roarke.  He's a beast that has hideous facial scars.  He gets his dream woman, his Goldie, who ""smells like angles ought'ta smell"".  Goldie gets insidiously murdered, and it soon becomes time for Merv to start his streak of revenge.  What follows is a collection humorous, albeit unbelievable, scenes that lead to the true murderer.  Heads in the toilet, torsos used as emergency brakes, faces sent several feet deep into concrete, and axes to the groin, it's only the beginning of the carnage.  Once the cannibalization and nudity starts, the movie really gets into the ""plot"".Hot women!  Tons of murder and blood!  Religion!  More nut-sack mutilation!Eventually the movie leads to ""Old Town"", a place where prostitution is rampant - replete with the gratuitous semi-nudity - and the girls dish out their own version of justice.  It's where the entire movie ties in together, and all the scenes slightly relate.  A distorted sense of good's triumph over evil serves as a conclusion to the movie, as an absolute slaughter takes place and ""order"" is preserved."	5.0	Incredibly cinematography, and Jessica Alba at her hottest	2006-06-25	7	2	5

078886047X	Sin City	A13BLSXL78EMRX	Jason Troy	From the fertile, creative mind of fiction writer Frank Miller, arrives this powerful new comic-book turned movie entitled Sin City. The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic. What the viewer discovers is a crimson colored, black and white film jam packed with live action, special effect and and electrically charged 1950's comic drama from beginning to end. The extraordinary and exciting talents of Bruce Willis, Powers Booth, Michael C. Duncan and Rutger Hauer are further enhanced with the surprising, psychotic appearance of Elijah Wood as an super powered nearly unstoppable maniac. If this combination is not enough, there is yet, one other surprising feature in Sin City which nearly steals the show from all the other actors. This is the superb acting, extraordinary ability and super makeup of the multi-talented Mickey Rourke. Directing this fantastic assemblage of fine actors is multi-talented Robert Rodriguez, who has created in the words of this reviewer, a Cult Classic which will endure far into the future of films.	5.0	The Dark Side of Comics	2005-10-31	2	1	1

078886047X	Sin City	A3JXVV1QJ68PAX	Jason Wilkerson	"The is a freakin' awesome movie. Before you go into this movie a few things need to be said. First off, this isn't a date movie (unless you have a really kewl girlfriend like I do) and this isn't a movie for kids. (I wouldn't recommend parents of kids under the age of 17 taking their kids to see this movie.) This is not your typical comic book, this is a graphic novel. It is filled with gratuitous violence and nudity. At the same time this is the most faithful comic book/graphic novel adaptation ever put to the big screen and it's made only better by that fact.Let me tell you, I didn't go into this movie as a fanboy of the Sin City comic book. I went into this as a fan of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. (I'm one of those people who is more of a fan of the film makers than the stars who act in their films.) Two days before I picked up the first book in the series, The Hard Goodbye, and started reading it. I must say I enjoyed what I had read thoroughly before seeing the movie as I followed Marv through his search for the b@st@rds who killed the only woman who ever loved him. I went to the theater on opening day, and was just blown away as I watched the exact same thing, frame for frame as I had just read in the graphic novel.Style is the first thing everyone talks about when dealing with this movie. Sure, it's in black and white, but the splashes of color mixed with the black and white give you a new way to look at the dingy world of Basin City. (This movie is after all Frank Miller's depiction of Hollywood.) Also the lack of color does also dim the violence a tad bit, but the style is stunning none the less.I have seen too many reviews downing the acting and dialogue of this movie. According to one reviewer, ""The acting was horrendous."" But then again that actor was a 15 year old, who I'm sure knows nothing of where this style of acting comes from. Most of the people who give this movie bad reviews know nothing of true cinema, only the popcorn crap that we call movies nowadays. Crap like The Day After Tomorrow, or Freddy Vs. Jason and crap like that. The style of acting that is used in this movie was originated in the film noir movies of the 30's 40's and 50's. It's supposed to be slightly overacted and cheesy. Among the best in this movie are Mickey Rourke as the aforementioned Marv, and a brilliant Benicio Del Toro as a crooked cop who seems to somewhat enjoy a very interesting car ride with Clive Owen in the one scene directed by Quentin Tarantino.This movie does not have a linear plot by the way. And the characters are only brought together by a mutual friend/enemy/relative. The movie is based off of 3 of the first four novels, and are tied together quite well despite not having a major character running between each segment.All in all, anyone who is a fan of Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Kill Bill 1 and 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Pulp Fiction, and/or Reservoir Dogs should see this movie. Not only should you see this movie, you should see it while it's on the big screen, it's only going to loose some of it's luster on the small scree. Not much, but the image won't quite be the same."	5.0	For all the bad reviews	2005-04-10	5	3	2
078886047X	Sin City	A2PIX2K56IZZYX	Jason W. Kaiser	"2005 has not been a banner year for movies, if I have to sit through one more super-hero movie I think I'm gonna puke. Between big Hollywood bombs and remake after remake, you can imagine the joy I received from watching this incredible movie. About as flawless as a movie can be this is film-making at it's best. I am not very familiar with Frank Miller and his 'graphic' novels, but I am very tempted to do some serious catching up with the man!!Have you ever seen a movie with so many a-list actors in your life? and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine  here, big time. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke get the most screen time and both excell mightily, I'm sure it won't happen but some oscar consideration for best actor should be considered for either if not both. Willis is at his best as a cop with a bad heart feeling his age trying to do good by his one true love, Jessica Alba, who plays a stripper with a big heart. She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why? Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it. I have now seen this three times and his portrayal of a man fighting all kinds of inner demons, not to mention a serial killer and a corrupt priest  (played very well and very creepy by Rutger Hauer) is something I'll never forget.Clive Owen is 3rd in the depth chart, but what a job he does, and I think he needed this, it makes people forget he did the awful 'King Arthur' he plays a cop trying to save his lady from a real low-life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro. I mean this man is such a total sleaze-bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role. Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend. This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.Moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best. Now this may seem strange to most, but I think Elijah Wood (yes, Frodo) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He does not say a word, but his performance as the serial killer is down right scary. The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he ""meets his maker"" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!! Devon  Aki is Meho, another who does not say a word, but is enchanting, until she whips out of of her many weapons and does some really not so nice things to alot of bad men. This was followed by D.E.B.S. Devon.......again, why?Rosario Dawson is sexy as hell as Gail, one of Clive Owen's former flings, she too is a bad-ass and Nick Stahl is the son of senator Power's Boothe, both are scum-bags, but Stahl is just nasty, nasty, nasty. His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least. Michael Madsen, Alexis Bledel, and Carla Gugino also co-star, and like I said earlier, all contribute in one way or another.My only tiny, and I mean very tiny, complaint is Michael Clarke Duncan, he is very unbelievable and his role lacked the edge and depth of every other character, so this is two poor showings in a row from him, as he was really bad in 'Daredevil' but no big deal as most of that movie was atrocious.Robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.'Desperado' is one of my all time favorites and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of the better horror vampire movies ever made. Although I have not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done. So it's a real shame that I recently heard that his latest kids fare, 'Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl' was such a flop.I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season. This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best-looking movie's I can remember. I hear there is a new version coming out, with extended scenes and the infamous ""not rated"" tag. So you can bet I'll be first in-line when the date is announced.acting.............5 stars, Rourke and Willis amaze, so does the restdirecting..........5 stars, Rodriguez is so giftedspecial effects....5 stars, Not over-done, perfectly timed.action rating......5 stars, Amazing gun-fights, great chase scenes, suspense and a few one-liners thown in as wellquality............5 stars, If I could give higher I would, incredible looking movie, no grain, no gliches, flawless!!!"	5.0	Easily the best of 2005.................	2005-12-11	16	10	6

The thing is 1. maybe if people took the time to do research before buying a movie they wouldn't complain about it. It was all over the net prior to this version being released that there would be another edition coming out in the near future for the ""true collector"". 2. Maybe some people just want to see the movie as it was in the theater and really don't care about the extra stuff.

078886047X	Sin City	A106016KSI0YQ	Jay Dickson	"Robert Rodriguez is very clear in the helpful ""making of"" featurette that accompanies this DVD that he didn't want to bring his own vision of Frank Miller's famous 1990s graphic novels to the screen, but rather reproduce Miller's  vision as exactly as possible. Rodriguez formulates his cinematographic vision so carefully to the stunning black-and-white designs of Miller's stories that the live-action shots at times suggest exceptional animation, particularly in the film's early visual highpoints, a series of physical hand-to-hand battles between the hulking avenger Marv (Mickey Rourke) and the preppy ninja/serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) in a rainy midnight farmscape. Miller even advised the actors on their parts and took such a hand in the filming that Rodriguez wanted to give Miller sole directing credit when the Directors' Guild of America refused to list their names together; when Miller refused to take sole credit, Rodriguez resigned from the Directors' Guild so both their names could appear together.Like Zack Snyder's recent popular film version of Miller's THE 300, this is about as faithful a translation of Miller's graphic-novel vision to the screen as could be imagined. Miller's own layouts and storytelling is so cinematic that it translates gorgeously onto the screen. And, as with THE 300, the violence is so over-the-top and cartoonish its almost impossible to be offended by it. The great gushing fluids that come out of the characters here is not only ridiculously copious but at likely to be white or black (or, with one character, yellow) as it is red. More than anything else, this is an extended and gorgeous exercise in style. It takes what was once held as an offshoot of realism -- the Mickey Spillane-style noir detective fiction -- and spins out all its most baroque excesses to show its theatricality and artifice. All the adult women are gorgeous prostitutes or strippers; all the villains want to prey on little girls or innocents (sometimes literally); the heroes' eventual Jacobean punishments for their foes are as imaginatively and grimly excessive as possible. As gorgeous and florid as this all is, though, it's hard at times to see its point. None of the characters are real at all: their two-dimensionality is of course an absolute given of the story's artistic premises. And while the grotesque tortures and killings initially shock, through extended repetition they begin to lose any sort of effect on your senses. After a while all you can do is react to the visual beauty of the compositions, and even that gets a bit dulled after a while. Probably this would have made an extremely effective (and equally gorgeous) short film."	3.0	Black and white, and red all over	2007-05-18	2	1	1

Well, it has a great cast, direction, plot, genre... it does not have any faults. But this alone is not what makes it a great movie. Most movies today are ideas done a thousand times over, and re-hashed with new actors, but Sin City stands apart.It's use of colour to create drama, the cinematography, the sheer style is a nice break from the usual run of big guns, big explosions and loads of special effects action genre, of course there is a healthy dose of that too, but it really takes a back seat to the story, and how it is delivered.To finish up, if you even REMOTELY like movies that have cool plot twists, violence and take you on a slick thrill ride, watch this movie. now.

078886047X	Sin City	AJ4CR2LM73UCK	"J. COSBY ""ZePequeno"""	"Marv could not describe this film any better.  Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have officially indocrinated 21st Century Film Noir with ""Sin City.""  Color blind, brutal, and simply brilliant.  The biggest, nastiest, and most faithful comic-book film brought to stark, gritty life might also happen to be one of this year's best films.The most soulful story goes to ""The Hard Goodbye"", with Mickey Rourke giving a career-defining performance as Marv.  One magical night with a goddess that ends in death sends him on a relentless quest for revenge on a nimble cannibal (Elijah Wood) and his puppet master (Rutger Hauer).  Every answer, every clue comes to Marv the hard way, and he behaves accordingly.  But even though an angel will run him down with her car three times and pistol-whip him into a near concussion, he still doesn't hurt girls.  The best noirs feature evil protagonists not afraid to die; but Marv will kill, die, AND go to Hell for Goldie on his warpath.  Amen.In ""Sin City"" men are animals, and women the fodder for them.  Benicio del Toro's malevolent turn as bad-cop Jackie Boy owns the story of Dwight (Clive Owen) and his rekindled romance with a merciless whore, when a truce between them and the cops gets violently broken.  The only way to keep the secret (Jackie Boy's severed head) is to invoke massacre upon Irish terrorists in love with explosives and a cyclops kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who wish to expose the betrayal to the whole city.  But The Girls of Old Town can't let that happen.""That Yellow Bastard"" is the bookending story: introducing the film and closing it.  An aging detective (Bruce Willis) with angina rescues a potential rape victim, gets double-crossed by his partner, then framed for the crime.  The culprit is the son of a Senator (Powers Boothe) with an unholy fondness for little girls put under duress.  As the framed cop sits in prison for years, the slimy sex-maniac gets treated with experimental regeneration medicine to replace the right hand, left ear, and package that was so violently taken from him.  The result is a pear-shaped, remorphed yellow monster hellbent on exacting revenge.  An inside-out physical likeness of the kid's twisted soul.  Jessica Alba (as Nancy Callahan) is delicious but not intense enough to respectfully enunciate the horror I myself had tasted upon first reading that scene in the comic.  Obviously, Bruce Willis takes the reigns in this tale.I've heard people say the film is too gratuitous, and I'm prone not to argue.  It is.  But the only reason it is, is because the graphic novels are, too.  ""Sin City"" is basically a madmen's cinematic experiment gone horribly right.  It's flat-out mean, sadistic, and misogynist -- just like all the best film noirs.  If you asked this film to apologize for being what it was, it would respond with a bullet.  However, it is beautifully realized.  Who knew that a premier artist and a superior technician could create a ""City"" that... breathes its own denizens.You can taste this film between your teeth."	5.0	"""Then it hit me like a kick in the nuts."""	2005-04-04	5	4	1

The whole environment isn't consistent to any particular era: for example, most of the cars are '50s vintage, but there's one modern Ferrari thrown into the mix.  Carla Gugino and Jaime King get the look of the average film noir femme fatale down, but Alexis Bledel looks like she would have been more at home at an Avril Lavigne concert.  It's never fully explained why the beat cops in this wear riot gear as the standard duty uniform in some bad echo of theRobocop Trilogy, or why the hookers of Old Town have a ninja assassin on their side.  None of the dialogue felt natural, with lines like ""I love you, [insert blonde girl's name here]"" and ""Show them you're worth a damn"" used repeatedly by multiple characters across all three different stories; in fact, the only good dialogue comes from a couple of goons who speak with an eloquence not seen from their segment of society outside ofWilliam Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.If you want good noir, stick to the originals likeThe Big Sleepor the neo-noir stuff likeBody Heat (Deluxe Edition)andBlade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)."	3.0	Nothing to write home about	2005-08-20	5	2	3

It was film noir at its finest. The movie consisted of several loosely connected vignettes. The heros were the following: an old, tough, but straight cop; an extremely ugly and extremely tough ex-con, with his own moral code; and a murderer on the lam, he had plastic surgery, but his sense of public duty led him into trouble. The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice.

All I knew about it that it was unique, due to all the hype. I have to admit that it was pretty good no lie. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. This trio made a gritty masterpiece of this underground comic book hit! They have perfected stylist zed violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up to some masculine heroic ideal.I mean if you've seen the trailers in the past you knew that something new and excitingly was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head. The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as ""Marv"", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as ""Dwight"", this is a man's movie. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.I'm naturally bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings. ""All women"", except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--, who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for ""political correctness"" outside the theater.

078886047X	Sin City	A2QVET1W9KUN5Z	Jeremy Crimson	When Sin City was originally released on DVD, I was quite critical of it. It was the first movie for me where a mix of Black and White and color were used in a movie in this manner. Due to the low quality of DVD picture, this caused a great dislike. The images were hard to see, and the dark parts were almost black screens.NOW: Enter Bluray! With Sin City being transferred over to the best quality format that it can, the movie has been revived. It can no longer be counted as a cult classic for Sin City is now a movie that you can use to show off every aspect of your home theater in beauty. The video is top-notch. VERY clear and no residual. I haven't tested the movie in my main setup but on my standard LCD it was beautiful.	5.0	Walk down the right back alley in Sin City, and you can find anything.	2011-05-07	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	A1IBSQQHGCDUAN	"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead"""	"If there's anything you knew in advance about ""Sin City"" (aside from who gets naked -- show a little class dammit) it's that director Robert Rodriquez went as far out of his way as humanly possible to make this film adhere as closely as possible to the visual feel of the comic book source material.  Well, I haven't read any of Frank Miller's legendary ""Sin City"" comics, but having seen the movie, I can't imagine it existing without them.Many people will see similarities between ""Sin City"" and the work of Quentin Tarantino, both because Robert Rodriquez will probably never break free from this stigma no matter how many kiddie flicks he makes, and more importantly -- gulp -- he actually inviteds QT on board to direct one of the segments, this after he'd torn up his DGA membership card in disgust after they wouldn't allow him to list Frank Miller as a co-director, so as far as integrity goes it's hard to one-up Sir Robert here.  I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to which segment QT was supposed to be directing ahead of viewing this flick, and it's to the film's credit that it all seems of a piece no matter how the chores were divvied up.Now, there are a couple of things that are immediately going to weed out a certain part of the older audience (hello Ma!), this being the ""artsy"" use of black-and-white splashed here and there with purposeful primary colors, and also the integrity of the action sequences.  I shouldn't diss the so-called ""older"" audience, being in my third decade of existence myself, but my parents and everyone else their age have certain prejudices toward a particular kind of modern film, this being the type that has ""far fetched"" action sequences.  Yes, in ""Sin City"" the characters are able to take a ridiculous amount of bullets and keep on ticking as well as jumping out of windows several stories to the ground without any apparent injuries, but to that I say that there is a reason this kind of thing works in a film like ""Sin City"" whereas it can easily wear thin in a movie like, say, ""The Matrix"".  Sin City is portrayed as a hopelessly fatalistic backdrop against which the best the characters can hope for is to die with a little bit of dignity.  It doesn't really matter that Marv doesn't croak after taking a bullet to the head because you know the dice are gonna roll cold for him sooner or later.Another comparison people may make to Tarantino is to point out that ""Sin City"" is also an anthology film.  I could mention the fact that this is based on three graphic novels featuring different protagonists and leave it at that, but -- at the risk of unduly diminishing the genius of Quentin Tarantino, whose ""Pulp Fiction"" is undeniably the most influential film of the 90s and a work of art in it's own right -- it should be noted that QT did not, in fact, actually INVENT the anthology film.  No, that would be George Romero and Stephen King with ""Creepshow"" (I'm kidding, of course, but you get my point...).Aside from the anthology aspect, there is one thing that actually does somewhat resemble ""Pulp Fiction"":  Bruce Willis' character makes an early exit only to return later in the film.  It's not the same chronological gimmick that QT utilized but I've said enough as it is.The one aspect that got so much press in the film's pre-release was the unprecedented decision to film the entire movie in front of a green screen.  This move not only doesn't come off as a gimmick but you'll find yourself forgetting that ""Sin City"" isn't absolutely real about five minutes into the movie.  Sure, there are numerous improbabilities, as detailed above, but it's the MOVEMENT of the characters, vehicles, weapons, etc. that seem a bit cartoonish;  nothing about the actual scenery really does.  In essence, ""Sin City"" sticks to the elements that continue to make noir so compelling:  great camerawork, gritty characterizations, and the theme of a hardened soul holding out some kind of remote hope for redemption.  Bruce Willis was an absolute no-brainer for this flick:  he's spent the last decade perfecting this world-weary gutter saint character, and ""Sin City"" is arguably his best portrait of this tortured soul archetype yet.  Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are the three main protagonists, and you'll find yourself rooting for them not through point-of-view bias alone, but because each of these guys completely earns the right to be called a bad ass.  In a way I'm glad they saved the fate of Willis' character for last as the whole movie seems to be building to such tragedy.So, yes, it's unfortunate that so many people will rent this movie sheerly on the recommendation of Mr. Skin, but hopefully ""Sin City"" will turn more than a few heads on to a new, hightened quality of experimental film-making in the same way that the aforementioned ""Pulp Fiction"" did a decade ago.  Word is that Rodriquez is planning two back-to-back sequels as we speak."	5.0	Noir reinvented	2005-08-18	3	1	2

078886047X	Sin City	AG6YGZXVVZTL0	Jet Cho	This was one of the best comic-to-screen adaptions I have ever seen. Miller and Rodriguez brought together a stellar cast and seamlessly tied together three different stories of the same city that perfectly captures the mood and noir of the comic. The other reviews here can sing it's praises far better than I can, so I'll just get down to the point.Rodriguez has stated in interviews that the first release of the movie will be bare-bones and will contain little special features and no additional footage (It'll just be what you saw in theaters). I'm the kind of person who would be upset to pay to buy this movie only to have a better version come out a few months later (which seems likely to happen). So if you're like me, I would hold off on this for awhile until the Special Edition comes out with extended footage and the full special features load. But this is a movie that is DEFINITELY worth having a place in every collection, so if stuff like additional movie footage and special features doesn't bother you, then by all means buy it. But don't say I didn't warn you.	3.0	Great movie, but should you buy it now?	2005-08-17	4	2	2

078886047X	Sin City	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	"I doubt there's any movie you will see this year that will be as good as Sin City. it's visually stunning, sexy, full of great lines, unforgettable characters and suspenseful action. The cast is great too. Micky Rourke shows why he should be in more movies as Marv. Marv is a kickass character  who's out for revenge against the people who killed his love Goldie. Micky Rourke is just simply awesome as him and should be even nominated for best supporting actor.The rest of cast are really good too but not as good. Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer) who I didn't even know existed until last year is also extremely cool as Dwight. He goes after  the dangerous Benicio Del Toro and winds up starting a war between hookers and cops. So he has to set to make things right. The heroes played by Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis all have  soft spots for women. Willis ""who's also the best he's been in awhile"" has to protect the sexy Jessica Alba from the Yellow Bastard.The Yellow Bastard is a sleazy pedifile who tried to kill  her when she was little but was stopped by Willis. The cops are crooked though and put Willis in prison because he wouldn't take blame for raping the girl. The Yellow Bastard's father is the mayor and owns the cops so he can get them to do anything he wants. When Willis gets out of prison he finds that he put Alba's life in danger by finding her and leading the Yellow Bastard straight to her. So he has to protect her one more time.This movie is just great and director Robert Rodriguez's crowning achievement. Since he gets some directing help from Quintin Tarantino and Frank Miller I don't know if he'll get the best director nomination he deserves. Anyway he does here what every director who adapts a book should do, get some insight from the writer to make sure it's done right. This movie isn't just right though...it's done perfect. After seeing this I think  Rodriguez is the only person that could bring Stephen King's Dark Tower books to life as well."	5.0	One of the best movies I've seen!	2005-04-01	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	AV0TYD34FQL0U	J. Li	I had gone to the movies that evening, honestly, with relatively high expectations. Sin City had looked quite promising (stylistically, at least). The opening credits was the first step towards the the wrong path. Tacky, unsuitable for the flavor of the film, the text roled across the screen. At the mention of Michael Madsen, I perked up, hoping to see much of him since he was introduced as if he were a central character. The rest of the cast, mostly flashing in cheap film glory, was nominically impressive, but lacking in substance.Marley Shelton slinked on a rooftop seductively as a dashing Josh Hartnett came up behind her, babbling trite, pulp nonsense. The dialogue, to use layman's terms, was corny and poorly executed.Confusingly, the plot shifts to a timeworn and sparse good-cop who is played dryly by Bruce Willis (the role on him is ridiculously overdone like a dead horse beat to post-mortal exhaustion). We meet Madsen's Bob briefly, and are disappointed. Random violence ensues, and we catch our eye-full of the first event of castration, which occurs at repeatedly at random intervals throughout the film.Again, the plot takes a drastic turn to a grotesque, yet terrifically portrayed (by Mickey Rourke) Marv, the epitomy of the city's grimy underbelly. Surprisingly, I recognize his angel-[...]girl from the teen movie, Slackers, in which she played a sweet, blond girl-next-door (she's put on pounds and years since). The story is played out rather absurdly. Yet, it is undeniable how chilling Elijah Wood's role as Kevin the cannibal is. The choreography is mediocre, but the gore is exceptional. Miller evidently relies on shock value to capture the audience.Clive Owen is the next victim to Miller's lunacy. An actor who falls short of praise for Arthur and Closer, is frankly horrible in his role as Dwight, a random murderer. This reminds me of how horrendous Brittany Murphy is as she never fails to be. Benicio del Toro, on the other hand, was amazing as Rafferty, and later the corpse's head.The scene shot by Quentin Tarantino stands out painfully from the rest of the film. There is more spark and whimsy in his fight sequences and character interactions. Move over, Rodriguez. You're the wrong man for the job. Tar pits, dinosaurs, Rosario Dawson in disgusting clothes. Shooting, shooting, shooting. And a brilliant Michael Clarke Duncan. Finally, the resolution.I am relieved when we return to Hartigan's (Willis) story. Madsen is back for the second and last time. Jessica Alba prances in leather pants. She is remarkably dumb and useless. Quite seriously, she is the character that stands out the least. The classic damsel in distress is too easy to play. Nick Stahl is refreshingly evil and rotten as (...)(if only he had won the fight..). Not to ruin the film (it does a fine job of that itself), but the old guy saves the girl, and yadda, yadda, yadda, he dies. Thank God it's over.Now, what I really appreciated about the movie was the innovative style that was used in cinematography. Honestly, I expected to be more dazzled, but the undertaking was still admirable. A fair fraction of the acting was solid: Mickey Rourke, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro, and Michael Clarke Duncan. The cyclical pattern of narrative that occur at the beginning and end also added a nice touch.My problems with this film were... numerous. First of all, Frank Miller should be Freud's patient. His obsession with castration is a little more than disturbing. Not to mention, all women were portrayed as hookers and strippers, with the exception of Shellie, the dumb waitress. Heroes were hard, jaded, imperfect characters. Now, after looking at Frank Miller, it is safe to say he is insecure in his masculinity which led him to create a world where the flawed man is noble and popular with ubiquitous sex-ham girls. Real women are topless, chaps-wearing [...]girls.Rodriguez was far from the ideal director for the film. Tarantino would have made a better choice. The whole atmosphere had a specious quality to it; though emulating pulp novels, it also seemed to unintentionally mock it. Mostly, the dialogue was horrible, if not laughable, because of the way it was approached: realistic and coldly serious. With the pop culture savy of Tarantino, the film would have been gracefully executed in a fashion that speaks to us of the dated aspects of the narrative, along with the modern spectacles, with a whimsical flare.In conclusion, Sin City was poorly organized, poorly executed, and poorly acted. But all in all it's a good show if you like demeaning women and mindless violence. The novelty of Tarantino's brand of honest brutality has been completely tarnished by the clumsy hands of Rodriguez.	2.0	Why Sin City was really messed up:	2005-04-15	41	19	22
078886047X	Sin City	AU2IUU2WBJRTQ	J. L. Mould	"To begin, do not let children see ""Sin City."" It's way too much for them. In fact, if this film was shot using traditional color schemes, there's no doubt it would be rated NC-17 because of the violence. That being said, ""Sin City"" is a great ride of a film. It's Chandler-on-steroids, pulpy and over-the-top. The characters say things that no one could ever get away saying, do things that no one could survive doing, and act like no one else would ever act. You can tell the actors involved (especially Rourke, Murphy, Dawson and Owen) are having a great time when they're up on the screen. This movie is every actor's dream, to go overboard, and many of these people are relishing their moment to do so. Also, the look of the film is completely compelling. It is a near perfect comic-to-screen translation, which brings me to the only real flaw of the film: the length. Because it is so faithful to the source material, it goes on for probably ten minutes too long. However, if you let yourself fall into the world that is being created in front of you, you can (and probably will) have a great time. Not for everyone, for sure, but great for the people it's aiming to please."	4.0	Great Film.	2005-08-15	2	1	1
078886047X	Sin City	AQD2LYCJIJOH5	Jman	"I can't believe I didn't even hear about this when it came out in 2005. I must have been living under a rock. I saw this in college about 4 years later in 2009 and was blown away. This movie is not only amazing visually speaking, but the story lines are incredible! This is a violent and disturbing movie to say the least, but the fact that it's almost somewhat cartoonish in the way it is filmed and edited probably makes up for that.Sin City is based off of the comic book series of the same name which I never read. In this movie we basically have 3 stories. The first story is cut in two parts. The second part of the first story is put at the very end of the movie (which I thought was a great way to do that). Our first story is called ""That Yellow Bastard"" and by far is the most disturbing of all the stories. It involves Bruce Willis as none other than a cop (who could've seen that one coming), and a good cop at that on the eve of his retirement. He knows that the spoiled, sadistic, and sociopathic pedophile son (Junior), of Senator Rourke is the one kidnapping Sin City's pre-teens and raping and killing them. Although even if he could prove it, he knows that the Senator being as all powerful as he is in the corrupt world of  Sin City would find a way to keep his only son from going to jail and would take revenge against Bruce Willis's character. I don't even want to tell you anymore since you really have to see it for yourself. Let's just say that That Yellow Bastard part 2 is the best part of the movie. And by the way, Junior is by far the most evil of all the villains in Sin City. I think most would agree. And perhaps even the most evil and unforgiving villain in all of cinema.Our second story which takes place 4 years after the events of That Yellow Bastard is called ""The Hard Goodbye"". Mickey Rourke plays a somewhat good guy thug named Marv who has an unforgettable encounter with a prostitute named Goldy. Marv falls in love but wakes up to find that Goldy has been killed, and the police are on their way up to his apartment. Obviously he has been framed. But by who? And why? This is sort of the detective story in the movie as Marv kills his way through the scum of Sin City to find the person or persons responsible for the death of his beloved Goldy. This was by far the creepiest story in the movie and kind of scared me a bit. Let's just say that Harry Potter's evil twin makes a cameo in this movie lol.Our last story which takes place sometime after ""The Hard Goodbye"" is called ""The Big Fat Kill"". This story is perhaps my least favorite in the movie, but in a movie like Sin City, ""least favorite"" doesn't mean much. I guess for me it was somewhat predictable and a little too cheesy and scripted. But it's still good and visually appealing as well. Basically there's a woman named Shellie (portrayed by the late Brittany Murphy) who is dating a man named Dwight (Clive Owen). At some point, Shellie's ex-boyfriend named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who happens to be rather abusive stops by her apartment with a few of his drunk punk friends. After slapping Shellie in the face, Jackie Boy gets a surprise visit in Shellie's bathroom from Dwight. Freaked out, Jackie Boy and his punk friends leave Shellie's apartment and make their way into Old Town (a section of Sin City completely controlled by some very sexy but violent prostitutes). I will not go any further with this story other than to say that it is still a good story although not as original or scary as ""That Yellow Bastard"" and ""The Hard Goodbye"".This is a must-see even if like me you've never read the comics and don't read comics at all. This movie has some of the most adult themes of any movie based off a comic series. I think most people would enjoy this. Now if you're a Bridget Jones's Diary type of movie-goer then perhaps not. But other than that I think you will like it."	5.0	Awesome Awesome movie!!!!	2013-12-17	2	2	0
078886047X	Sin City	AX8LSR4H6EBRJ	JMyers	"I really have to thank a friend of mine for getting me in on the Sin City scene, after loaning me the first installment of the comic series, 'The Hard Goodbye', I was hooked and immediately wanted to see the movie.  Fortunately, he had the DVD, borrowed it to me, and I sat down for the ride of a lifetime.  From the opening scene the film is arresting and hypnotic, the imagery used by Rodriguez in bringing Frank Miller's 2-dimensional comic into a 3-dimensional realm is absolutely perfect, especially crediting the select moments in which the film was translated into a streaming animated comic-like appearance.The opening scene already features two very accomplished actors, Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, and was shot even before the actual film was greenlit.  This scene was shot without Frank Miller's concent in order to persuade him into allowing a full-length feature to be made, and thankfully it was a success.  The finished product was something that I believe comic fans and movie-goers alike will find mind-bogglingly stunning for years to come.  But they won't have just this film to chew on, Sin City 2 has already moved into pre-production for a release date sometime in 2006, while yet a third installment is to follow in 2008.Sin City focuses on the tales of three separate people, dealing with their own problems on the filthy streets and back alleys of Basin City, where crime is the law, violence a sport, and murder a means of survival.  The first full story centering around Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking volatile Spawn-like figure goes on a murderous rampage to avenge the death of the only true friend and lover he ever had.  The violence is prominent, and the Kill Bill-stylishness of it all just makes you want to go back and watch it all again.  The second story follows a calm but insane and mysterious nightowl by the name of Dwight, as portrayed by Clive Owen.  Out of all the characters in this translation, he played the role with such ingenuity and twistedness.  This guy doesn't take crap from anybody, especially the two-timing infectious smug hot-headed cretens who get their kicks off of smacking women around and treating them like their own personal playthings.  The third and final tale (which begins before Marv's story and is continued after Dwight's) introduces us to Detective Hartigan, a good cop with a bad attitude and a real problem with authority, and on top of that, a heart condition.  But that doesn't stop him as he sets out to protect 19-year-old Nancy Callahan from the twisted clutches of Senator Roark's pedophile son, who has now become a disgusting, stinking yellow pervert.Be warned, parents.  Sin City is very violent, so this isn't a movie you should be taking your kids to.  While some of the content is implied rather than over the top and in your face, it still does go, well, over the top, which is why the adult audience will get more out of it.  Hollywood is becoming quite overrun with tame PG-13 action films all centering around some low-rent deadbeat who loses his family and has to quote un quote ""make them pay"".  I won't lie to you by telling you the concept of revenge isn't beneath the surface of this film, but what I will tell you is this isn't just high-flying martial arts kick-to-the-face action with little blood and no pain to teach a lesson.  This is raw, bloody and extremely violent.  The bad guys are always getting limbs severed, ears shot off, hatchets to the nuts, what have you.  This movie is far from tame and it's far from PG-13.  I will say that some of the action is somewhat exaggerated, but that's the entire point.  You have to let yourself go with the flow and enjoy the comic-to-screen dynamics which are put forth here.  The dialogue, action, angles, shots, even atmosphere are all captured exacting to Frank Miller's original comic series, which is what most film adaptations are missing these days.  It just isn't bound by the laws most action films are, it really lets go and takes you on one heck of a wild ride.As if the main characters weren't enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, there is an enormous all-star support cast featuring Jaime King as Marv's lover, the mysterious and hypnotic Goldie, Nick Stahl as the twisted Yellow B@st@rd, and let's not forget Elijah Wood as the cat-like cannibal martial-artist Kevin.  I'd just like to take a moment to point out that while Wood didn't exactly match the appearance of Kevin from the comic (i.e. in the comic he was taller, not as clean-shaven, etc.), he was still just damn cool to watch.  Now that I see him on screen and playing this character, it's hard to think anyone else could fill the spot, he did a flat-out awesome job in bringing the character to life, and this is a role that I will always know and respect him for.Other supporting actors feature Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, and Devon Aoki.  Even most of the smaller roles are portrayed by relatively known people.  I don't know if I've ever heard of another film that had as many accomplished actors as this one, and it just goes to show you how much of a fan base this kind of film really has, and how it continues to draw fans from around the world.  I know I'm one of them.  Fan of the comic or not, if you like murder, revenge, blood, violence, action, and dark humor, this is your kind of movie."	4.0	Two hours of my life well-spent!	2005-10-11	2	2	0

078886047X	Sin City	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"There comes a time when a review of the movie will have no impact on whether or not a person will see the movie in the theatre, or even buy a DVD of the movie. I think Sin City is one of these movies because in general, Sin City is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" movie for critics and fans alike. Strangely, I was in the middle when I saw Sin City in the theatre. I was impressed with the visual style, and I liked the look of the movie, the sound of the movie, the hard bitten over the top language and action of Sin City. I admired what the director, Robert Rodriguez did in bringing Frank Miller's graphic novels to life. But I didn't love the movie. Since that time I've read the graphic novels and I've now watched this special edition extended recut DVD of Sin City and I've changed my mind somewhat. I'm even more impressed and I like the movie a whole lot more.The question is why. I think the first and biggest reason is how this DVD is presented. It offers up the theatrical version of the film, which I feel is essential in any DVD edition which gives us an extended or director's cut. Let us compare. Robert Rodriguez does. The second disc of this set includes the extended and recut edition of the movie, but it's not like your typical extended edition. Since Sin City is based on several Frank Miller books and tells four different stories that slightly overlap, the recut version of the film is now four short films each with its own title card and each one has to be selected separately on the menu. I love it. This works far better for me because we get short films that are self contained and tell a complete story and I don't have to sit through two hours of film just to watch the 40 minute Marv segment ""A Hard Goodbye"". Even after watching the theatrical version, I'm not sure where the twenty minutes of extended footage came from. It's probably just 15 seconds here and 30 seconds there and not big new scenes. I can completely skip the short Josh Hartnett section if I want. This is the way I want to watch the film.Besides this recut version of the film, there are also some quality bonus features included on the DVD. First up is Robert Rodriguez's ""15 Minute Flic School"". In this featurette director Rodriguez talks about how he decided to make Sin City after looking through his graphic novels and saw that shooting the film would both be possible and a challenge. He talks about specific ways that he was able to save money in the making of the movie as well as how few of the major actors were actually on set at the same time, even if they have scenes together. This is a very interesting look in how this man makes his movies. Next up is the ""All Green Version"" of Sin City. This is the Green Screen version of the movie and Rodriguez introduces it, saying that he sped the film up 300 times or so in order that we can watch the entire movie in 10 to 15 minutes, but it gives us the chance to see how little the actors had to work with and how much work went into getting what we see on screen to actually be there. This is a neat feature and it is remarkable how good of a job the actors did with so little on set. We also get to see ""The Long Shot"" where we see an on set take with some background footage where Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino just let the cameras roll for 15 to 20 minutes and keep the scene going. We see some of what Tarantino says to the actors, what actually made it into the movie, and how the actors work and figure out how to play a scene. This is another great feature.Another feature is the Sin City concert.  This is actually just a one song clip from Bruce Willis and his band The Accelerators doing a performance for the cast and crew of Sin City as well as Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly which was filming nearby.  Surprisingly enough, Willis is quite good as is his band.  Good stuff here.  The last feature on disc two is a 10 minute cooking lesson from director Robert Rodriguez.  Here we see Rodriguez explain how to make his homemade breakfast tacos.  It looks good and I understand that he does this on his other DVDs as well.The first disc of this set is the theatrical version of the film with other special features.  Besides the commentary track, the other features are the obligatory ""the cars of Sin City"", ""the props of Sin City"" and other related informative but not nearly as interesting as the disc two features.  Two that are interesting are the story of how Rodriguez convinced Frank Miller to let him do the film and Quentin Tarantino as guest director for a scene in the movie.  The rest are fairly stock features.Overall this is an excellent set that really is worth owning if you are at all a fan of Sin City.  This set does the movie and the books proud.And...did I mention that this set includes a copy of Frank Miller's ""A Hard Goodbye"", the Marv story in Sin City?"	5.0	this is one stellar dvd set	2005-12-08	14	10	4

Tragically stupid dialogue throughout but just a flawless execution of filmmaking staying truthful to the source material.  Very outside of the box.

078886047X	Sin City	A9TG2NFA614S9	John F. Rooney	"""Sin City"" is a black and white film recreation of Frank Miller's b and w graphic novels with every so often a vivid swath of colored eyes, blood, or some villainous single color. Someone's blue eyes will appear in stark color and thrust themselves at the viewer. The stories are grim, gritty, morose, tough-minded. There's plenty of action, violence, and the scenes are set up to resemble the comic book world, a close approximation of what you would see in a graphic novel. Quentin Tarantino was involved as a guest director so you know what to expect. Computer enhancement was used. Many of the scenes are evocations of the graphic novel drawings--turning the static page into the kinetic world.There are really three stories melded together, each section with its own hero played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen. The first and third parts come together near the end.The movie will make you uncomfortable, queasy, squirrely at times with its gritty realism, humorlessness, and starkness. The flick doesn't let up and give you a chance to breathe but keeps on its violent inevitable avenging pace. It's a melodrama gone spastic and ballistic. The avalanche of fateful action goes rolling on and buries the viewer who just hopes to come up for an occasional breath of fresh air. It's a claustrophobic, insular, crushing atmosphere.We're lucky all movies aren't made at this breakneck pace and with this intensitry, grittiness, and sense of futile inevitability. It's crime and punishment, avenging forces, and anti-heroes fighting against incredible odds. A movie for people with specialized tastes, but a worthy experiment."	3.0	A Little Too Graphic	2009-02-11	2	0	2

As usual, he can't string two sentences together. He is irritating & boring. But this is not his movie. I am not as  familiar with Robert Rodriquez's style as Q.T.'s. The three loosely conected plot lines coming together is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction. Sin City was lifted frame by frame directly from the comic book & this is apparent but not really a bad thing. It is a bit different & limiting. The style does lessen the impact of the appalling violence, torture & general mayhem. In this setting it is not gratuitous. It is almost amusing, so gross that it stops being objectionable. Then you watch closely for the next atrocity. That compulsion makes it a good movie. There is little overt sexual activity but lots of sexy, half  dressed women, mostly hookers & strippers. Pre-emptively, Jessica Albas, who has a rather big part stated: ""I don't take off my clothes"", thereby furthering her good girl but very very hot image. Carla Gugina play Lucille the parole officer & was excellent in a small part. I hope we see more of her in the future. Mickey Rourke as Marv is easily the most compelling character in the movie.This movie is not to everyone's taste.

""That Yellow Bastard part 1"" tells us how hard-boiled officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) swore to protect a young girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from a child-killer/rapist named Roak Junior (Nick Stahl) but fails then next we have ""The Hard Good-Bye"" where a big-chinned powerhouse named Marv (Mickey Rouke) was having an affair with a sexy girl named Goldie (Jaime King) until he wakes up to find her dead. He has been set-up as he runs from the law as he interrogates some people including a priest (Frank Miller) for finds out a crazed swifted clawed maniac named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who has a taste to literally eat prostitutes and finds out the rotten cardinal (Rutger Hauer) is all behind this for justice must be served. Following after that ""The Big Fat Kill"" has Dwight (Clive Owen) taking care of an abusive man named Jackie-Boy (Benico Del Toro) but while he finds the sleaziest part of town run by protective prostitues lead by tough but sexy leader Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wage a war with some mercenaries like Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Then we have ""That Yellow Bastard part 2"" has Hartigan sentenced 9 years to prison then after that he is released to find the young girl Nancy (Jessica Alba) all grown up at 19, unfortunately a deformed yellow man named Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahls) kidnaps her as he must save the girl then finally we end with part 2 of ""The Customer is Always Right"" where i won't reveal to you the ending.A brilliant, cold-blooded and hard boiled adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel series from Dark Horse Comics. Robert Rodriguez who is one of the best action directors joins up with Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino to make a dazzling cocktail of a movie with stunning visual effects. I like how it accurately depicts 4 graphic novels in one movie page-by-page scene-by-scene shot in glorious black-and-white with some color tints in some areas for select objects. The violence is gory and graphic but mainly white colored at times to make it look like out of the comics which is a very nifty and creative idea i should say. The performances are very good as is the direction by 3 directors and i love the surreal nature of the design for the film. Co-starring Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Jason Duoglas and Brittney Murphy i gotta say the casting was spot on especially Mickey Rouke as Marv was absolutely perfect. I saw this movie 4 times in theaters as i knew they would not screw up this adaptation and satisfies action fans including fans of comics/graphic novels.This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set has absolutely flawless picture and sound quality like if it was like going to the theaters. Disc one has Cine-Explorer where you hear an audio commentary by the filmmakers plus shots from the graphic novels with green screen test footage along with the movie as you watch plus audience reaction track as well. Disc 2 has the unrated recut extended edition which is longer and violent with cool extras like ""Kill em good"" which is an interactive comic plus Rodgriguez extras like 16 minute film school, all green screen version, the long take, Sin City: Live in Concert and 10 minute cooking school. Additional extras are featurette on how they put the graphic novels on film, interview with Quentin Taranitno, 3 featurettes and trailers and teasers.A must have for cinema fans and even geeks of comic book/graphic novel films."	5.0	One of the greatest Comic based movies ever!	2005-08-19	0	0	0

This picture has so many gruesome characters and plots it is mind boggeling.  It starts with a character who kidnaps young girls, slices them with a straight razor, rapes and then kills them.  The next character kidnaps women, makes them watch as he eats their body parts, cuts off their heads and mounts them on a wall and then has his pet wolf eat the rest of the body.  This character segways into a bishop, who also enjoys eating the bodies of the women with his friend.  And this depraved plot goes on and on.What probably most amazed me was that it didn't appear that anyone else in the theatre was remotely upset with  what they were seeing.  I walked out of the movie after the bishop was murdered because I had had enough.  For the serial killers and sadomasachists out there; this is your kind of movie.

078886047X	Sin City	A36HBE2C5SQ2E6	"Jordan Appel ""thedudeman"""	"Sin City is based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who is also the co-director. The movie is split into three stories: Dwight's, Merv's, and Hartigan's. Quentin Taratino is also a guess director.The movie starts off with Hartigan, a ""60 year old cop with a bum ticker"" and he is trying to save a little girl from being raped. He  ends up sacrficing himself for the girl, ""a old man for a young girl"". We cut to Merv's story, when a hooker is dead in his bed, and he has the blame placed on his shoulders, he tries to find the man that killed her, and avenges her. We then cut to Dwight, who is then thrown into the war between the prostitutes and the city police, They are seriously teething on the brink of war, and He must find a way to stop what could be deadly. Then, We are thrown back into Hartigan's story, 8 years later, he is in the same situtation, but the people have changed. He has to stop the Yellow Bastard from raping Nancy again.This movie almost didn't happen because The Director's Guild of America didn't want Robert Rodreqiuz to make this film, so he quit the quild, and worked with Frank Miller on this film, creating a page by page movie that makes you feel that the book had come alive on the movie screen. The acting is at its best, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis do their best acting, since their last best acting, and help shape and mold the movie. This is a prime example of esteemed originality, and hard work.

078886047X	Sin City	A2B9WOSXCU7LDM	"Jordan ""brainofj72"""	"There has certainly been no shortage of comic book movies lately. From ""Spider-Man"" to ""X-Men"", for one reason or another, it just seems to be the current craze. Most of the films in this group are nothing but pointless Hollywood garbage full of drawn-out action sequences and cheesy dialogue. However, there are those select few that stand out. ""Sin City"" is one film does just about everything but get lost in the crowd.The film, based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, follows three stories. One is about Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a ""bum ticker"" on the verge of retirement who rescues a little girl from a rapist with political ties (Stahl); one is about Marv (Rourke), an odd-looking man searching for the killer of his ""true love"", Goldie (King), a prostitute who slept with him and ""was nice to him"" - something no other woman had ever done; and the other is about Dwight (Owen), a man who aids a group of prostitutes in the murder of several men, which sends Old Town (a city run by prostitutes) into a war. And this is all tied together by several elements, including a prostitute waitress (Murphy) and a cannibalistic serial killer (Wood).By now you've probably realized that ""Sin City"" isn't exactly a cookie-cutter PG-13 comic book movie, due to all the prostitutes, murder, and what-not. In fact, it's a violent pop-culture celebration, featuring one of the most remarkable casts in ages and being directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller himself.The film's visual element is undeniably fantastic, as it remains strikingly faithful to Miller's graphic novels. Using a gorgeous mix of black and white and strategically placed color, the film creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the classic noir films of the '30s and '40s while still maintaining a distinctly modern feel, and also moves at a deliberate pace, as it is loaded with snappy dialogue, clever editing, and over-the-top violence.The film's only real flaw is its hit-and-miss acting, but I guess this may have been done somewhat on purpose, perhaps to further enforce the comic book element? Maybe, but I doubt it.But that aside, ""Sin City"" is a truly great, original film that screams for numerous sequels, as it seems like it just has so much more to show us. It almost feels like this film is just an appetizer. Let's hope Rodriguez doesn't destroy the sequels to this wonderful instant classic, which is arguably the best comic book-to-film adaptation ever made.9/10"	5.0	A Spectacular Modern Noir	2005-10-16	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A75MSQQ3LN86Z	Josef Bush	NOTE:  Look at the Goya prints of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain.Style may not be everything in cinema or in anything else, but it does help to pass the time.  It can keep you glued to your seat, watching a spectacle and even make you glad you spent whatever you spent for it. In  this case its an opportunity to surrender oneself to what may well be the signature movie of the Bush Decade; which is to say, to experiene an essay in sadomasochistic violence, featureing cold, elaborate murders, prolonged and in a sense even ritualized torture and mutilation -- including male castration -- and all delivered in a matter of fact, self-jusifying tone indicative of psychotic depravity.SIN CITY is kept out of the realm of Pasolini's SADO only by the film's near-abstract visual style, for instead of photographing the performers of these rituals naturally, or realistically, the film utilizes the look of the 'adult' comic, by severely restricting color.  By so doing, the movie maintains an atmosphere of fantasy that keeps the enterprize at an acceptable distance from the loathsome; as aceptable a distance as the soft-core sadism of Miller's novels can hope for.Nevertheless, this film is entertaining as simply a series of vivid, masturbatory fantasies of a vividly and purposefully ghastly nature.  It makes for an astringent kind of pornography.The three stories that make up the scenario of this movie are vehicles for three male anti-heroes; these are played by Mickey Rourke, Bruce willis and Clive Owen.  There is nothing even remotely spontaneous about their performances, the controlled nature of the cinematography prevent it.  Nevertheless, their performances are hypnotic.And the stories?  The stories, such as they are, are pathetic fantasies of female brutalization, rape and torture, all slick with the slobber of slavish, narcotized love; or that fixation that passes for love among drunken, impotent men.  All the women -- except for one little girl -- are either prostitutes or dancing sexual exhibitonists like the peerless and endlessly agile Jessica Alba.  Many, oozing treachery, parade the streets and alleys in thrillingly fetishistic costumes.At first glance there's a familiarity to all this: it has somethng of the old American detective stories from Hammet to Spillane.  Rotten doins in back-alley L.A.  But, what's happened here is that the sensibility has shifted.  Thanks to the power and popularity of Japanese Samurai movies and Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, the genre has changed; its has become Asian.  It has become crueler, more intense and utterly fatalistic.  All the characters crouch under a low, jagged ceiling of hopelessness.SIN CITY could well be seen as the story of three rag-tag, out-at-the-elbow Samurai who frequent the same mid-town combo noodle joint, brothel, and tavern where they oggle and salivate over the same generic, interchangeable would-be geishas.  They have no Lord, and therefore, no honor or duty, and in their alcohol-soaked consciousnesses, they become the self-appointed protectors of the sluts they are powerless to satisfy physically or financially.  Depravity is not a result, it is a foregone conclusion.Everything is blood-soaked and takes place in the dark.In a land controlled by a hidden, unapproachable autocrat whose deadly agents are everywhere, whose will and methods are secret, devious and depraved, everything is reduced to a series of block-printed pictures printed cheaply on cheap paper; images of poverty, helplessness, empty commercial sexuality, filth and cold.Other people's pain is an amusement: Torture has become commonplace.SIN CITY.	3.0	Not Quite SNUFF But Worth Watching If You've The Taste	2009-01-30	2	0	2

This movie brings his world to life perfectly.  This movie is a collection of short stories which take place in Basin City, which has earned the nick name Sin City.  If you are not familiar with Frank Miller's works, this movie will be quite different than any movie you have seen before because this movie was done with the intent of perserving Frank's style and this was done beautifully!  Frank's style is basically the natural progression of film noir.  For those of you not familiar with noir, imagine the old detective movies where a down on his luck detective is visited by a hotter than hot dame who sets him up on a case that will most likely get him killed and you'll start to get the idea.  Dictionary.com defines noir as ""A genre of crime literature featuring tough, cynical characters and bleak settings.""

078886047X	Sin City	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	As a reformed comic book collector, I had never read any of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels but I had heard about them. And everything that I had heard had been positive. Then when I heard they were making a film based on a few of the novels and the it was being directed by Robert Rodriguez I was very interested in what would happed. But what really sold me on the film was hearing that Frank Miller himself would be co-director of the film. To think the man behind it all, the creator, would be involved in the film gave me very high hopes. Well after seeing the film I was not disappointed. This is one of the slickest pieces of film making I have seen in a long time. I love how the film is done all in black and white with color being used only when neccesary, mostly in the case of blood or the color of a character's eyes. The film reminds me very much of portions of the graphic novel that I have seen. In fact the whole film seems like the graphic novels come to life. The way each stories weaves in and out of each other reminds me of a comic book. This film has one of the most diverse casts I have seen. A unique blend of both old school actors (Rutger Hauer/Bruce Willis/Powers Boothe) and up an coming stars (Alexis Bledel/Jessica Alba/Rosario Dawson). But the stand out actor in this film has to be Mickey Rourke as Marv. At first you don't even recognize that it is Mickey ROurke but as the story proceeds you realize that it isn't Mickey Rourke, not anymore. Because he has truly become Marv and plays him well. It is as if Rourke identifies with the character which more than explains why he plays him so well. But I want to tell you this film is not for young children. It is a very violent film and contains nudity. In fact a friend of mine who is a die hard horror fan rented this film at my recommendation and did not finish it because she felt it was too violent. But do not let the violence scare you away from this film. It is all part of the plot and does not come across as unecessary. In fact it is integral in telling each story. I highly recommend this film and you will not be disappointed and I am looking forward to a sequel.	5.0	A gritty, violent, sexual, and powerful film! Excellent!	2005-09-08	3	2	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"This is a love-it or hate-it movie if ever there was one.  Most of the audience that I saw it with loved it, but my friend thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen.  Of course, he's not into comic books.  The real significance of this film is that (with the possible exception of the Hulk) this is the movie that most captures the feel of a comic book.  Not only does it feel like ""a comic book"" - it feels like THE comic book, Sin City.Sin City is a series of black and white graphic novels in the ""noir"" style by Frank Miller.  Miller shares directing credit on this film, along with Roberto Rodriguez.  Not only was Miller on set every day but the film IS ALMOST A SHOT-FOR-SHOT TRANSLATION OF THE GRAPHIC NOVELS.  I've only read the first in the series, but I don't really feel the need to read the other two that this film is based on because I believe they will be exactly the same.  Rodriguez has used the panels from the comics as storyboards and re-created them as faithfully as possible.The film of Sin City is also the first film to capture the modern conception of comic book violence.  Remember the good old days when the term ""comic book violence"" referred to superheroes like Captain America duking it out and never suffering greater injury than a black eye?  Not any more.  In the adult, gritty comics, the emphasis is on pain, torture, sadism, and especially dismemberment - I lost track of how many characters get dismembered.  This is possibly the most violent and goriest movie I have ever seen.  Because it is mostly in black and white, blood shows up white.  Characters take and dish out more punishment than could ever be possible in real life.Possibly, the people who do not like this film are put off by its gruesomeness.  I don't know if the audience is meant to take pleasure in the torturing of the bad guys simply because they are villains.  Certainly, there are no ""good guys"" in this movie - just anti-heroes (with the possible exception of the Bruce Willis character).Also, people who are not into comic books may have a hard time with the film.  Most of talking in the movie comes from voice-over narration because 1) it is a nod to film noir and 2) it is an almost direct transcription of the comic book.  However, I've never seen voice-over used this extensively, and - as the movie Adaptation tells us - voice-over is a cinematic no-no.  Some people may be put off by it.Regardless, I've never seen a movie ANYTHING like this before.  If you're into graphic novels, film noir, or over-the-top comic-book violence - or just movies with an original voice - check it out.SPECIAL NOTE: This is NOT a movie for little kids and I was horrified to see parents taking their toddlers into the theater."	4.0	One wild ride...	2005-04-02	14	11	3
078886047X	Sin City	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"Author Frank Miller and director Robert Rodriguez bring to the big screen one of the most explicit, violent and character-driven graphic novels of recent years.  Based on solid performances by a bunch of hot-shot actors (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, among others), and with author Frank Miller giving the proper assistance to Rodriguez, ""Sin City"" is a masterpiece of noir atmosphere, since the very first scene to the apocalyptic and self-destructing ending.Violence fills every scene. The monochromatic, grayish shots are almost claustrophobic, and the violence depicted is so effective that you expect a splat of blood or a loose bullet to strike you in the audience.There are three ""Sin City"" stories in this movie, that somewhat come togheter at the end. The first one is about Jim Hartigan (Bruce Willis) an aging, close-to-retirement cop that investigates a series of rape-murder-kills, only to discover that the murderer is a very influent person. The second story features an almost irrecognizeable Mickey Rourke - the best actor in the movie -, a sort of unstoppable super-hero-like character, trying to avenge the murder of the only woman that gave herself up to him without charging anything. And the third story is about how Dwight and Johnny-Boy have a curious meeting that may break up the ballance between the hookers, the Mob and the Police in Basin City dark alleys.The direction, the final computer art and the casting is so good that I almost expected to see the text baloons coming out of the character's mouths in the screen.

078886047X	Sin City	A2K4AJ2T14BWAK	"J. S. Sweeney ""Lit Prof"""	First of all... it's not a Tarantino movie.  He guest directed one scene... not to spoil anything, but the scene in the car with Del Toro and Clive Owen was the only part of this movie he touched.  The rest was all Rodriguez.  So don't see it based on your expectations for a Tarantino movie.  The feel of the movie is completely true to the source.  It might as well have been storyboarded right from Miller's classic.  Perfect touches of color in a film-noir black and white are both symbolic and appropriate; your attention will not be taken from what isn't important.The actors, too are used perfectly.  You see just enough of each megastar to understand their characters pefectly.  The director declined to overexpose them for the sake of A-List credibility.  If I wondered why a character left prematurely, sure enough, he reappeared and his part was played out.  No loose ends, no unfinished business.  Characters are avenged or killed, and no one dies without a purpose fulfilled.  Because the movie is based upon 3 separate graphic novels, it would make no sense to have all characters interacting all the time.  Only recurring characters appear in more than one story, and those characters serve the movie and the source faithfully.For those who are not familiar to the source, the characters are often portrayed as half-way superhuman.  It would be absolutely tragic for Marv to not be able to cleave through a dozen cops, or for Hartigan to not take bullets and keep smiling.  The most gruesome characters meet the most gruesome fates.  This is Sin City at its finest, and not one thing could have been better.	5.0	The First Dead-On Translation of a Comic Source	2005-10-01	2	2	0

The raw violence and the thick plotlines. Sin City is an amazing piece of work. Rodriguez brings the comic book to life beautifully and Frank Millers writing of the books is just out of this world. I strongly recommend you see this film. Not recommended for children or persons with weak stomachs though. Cannot wait for Sin City 2. Hope it comes out soon as has the same deliverance as the first one. This new recut edition just had to be made. I don't think I could live with the vanilla edition which I bought in August 2005. Once i saw this edition being released i sold the other one and bought this one. The special features are amazing however the new scenes hardly add anything to the movie. They certianly don't take anything away from the theatrical release. Also, the whole Tarantino as a special guest director is a little ridiculous, although i love all of his other movies. Its clear to figure out the one scene he directed.Bottom line, this is a fantastic movie. Get out and see it now!!!!!!!!!!!!	5.0	ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN!	2006-01-22	2	1	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1VYD8OKS7VICD	"Juha Ylinen ""Heinijoki"""	The name tells the truth of this movie! This is a real (Ba)Sin City. Lot of violence, blood, almost naked women, immorality, suffer, revenge and sex(not so much what I waited for).  The law of Hammurab rules people on the Sin City. Eye to eye, teeth to teeth. You can't be never sure who is your fried and who is your fried. It's better to watch your back!The Main reason why liked this movie wasn't violence, good stories, music and naked woman. They also suited this movie very well but without great actors and actress, I had ever enjoyed this film so much.Especially, Mickey Rourke(Marv), Bruce Willis(Hartigan) and Elijah Wood (Kevin)Rourke made a great comeback first class. He was very famous in the 80s(for exemple 9 weeks) but lost his status in the 90s(there were many bad movies). Without his character Marv this movie has get me only 3 stars. Marv is very rude, angry, powerful die-hard, ungly and interesting person. Rourke really plays his role with unbelieveable emotion and  skill.In my mind, Willis has always been a good action actor.  In this movie he has even better survivor than Die Hard films. So many gun shots, hits and even gallows pole won't stop him. Willis has come better actor and can express his feelings better than before.Everyone remembers Elijah Wood on the Lord of the Ring movies.He can't escape it but luckily they were amazing films.Sin City shows that Wood can also play a wicked man role well.Kevin is the most sickest character on this movie(cannibal, soul eater, the collector od dead people's faces). Unfortunately, his role small but remarkable. He don't speak at all but facial expressions, fast movements, sharp nails, dark personality and his animal fried makes his role unique.I liked also woman characters. Devon Aoki(Miho) was taken on Kill Bill movies because she was so deathly and cold minded than anu woman character on these movies.  Jessica Alba ( Nancy Callahan) danced beautifully and looked captivating.Finally, this movie was worth of watching and I am going to see it again same day.	4.0	The Law of Hammurab	2005-08-17	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	AIY21TLS7265P	Justanothercrow123	Ok, first off, the 5 stars are for the movie. The DVD on the other hand, gets a 0 in my book. I loved this movie. Every second of this movie bled style. From its cool charicters, neat presentaion, super acting, even to corny nior-film like voice overs ad a lot of depth to the people and you know what they are thinking when stuff is happening to them. Its an awsome way of story telling. This is strictly a Guy-movie, the very,very,very bloody action will make some people sick (ex. they show a guy getting a hatchet to the head...yeesh). So, yeah great movie and if all you care about is the movie, get this DVD, but...This DVD has almost 0 special features to speak of. No commentary, no actor bios, no good featurettes (except for a lame 8 min. short.). This DVD is seriously lacking speicial features. It doesn't even have a Specila features menu, the short is on the main menu. LAME. This movie could have had some cool documentaries on the source material.

078886047X	Sin City	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"I have to admit I have never read a Sin City comic, I am a comic book fan but that is one series I've never been all that interested in reading.  When I heard about the movie being made I figured I'd see the movie and if I liked it enough then I would read the comics.  Well, let me say this if the movie is any indication of the comics, then as far as the comics go, no thanks I'll pass.""Sin City"" follows three different storylines that really don't have much to do with each other.  One storyline focuses on an old near-retirement cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is trying to save a young woman named Nancy (Jessica Alba), who as an 11 year old he saved from the same man that is trying to rape and kill her now.  The second storyline focuses on Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke) who after spending the night with a girl who winds up dead the next morning, goes on a rampage to find out who killed her and why.  Third, is the story of Dwight (a very wooden Clive Owen), a shady man with a mysterious past who now spends his time trying to save his new girlfriend from a crooked cop/ex-boyfriend.All of the storylines work decently on their own, but really don't belong in the same movie together.  Other films have used the format of having separate storylines that intertwine with one another with great success, ""Traffic"" would be a prime example, but ""Sin City"" is not one of these films.  Supposedly each of the three storylines had much more footage that was filmed and edited down for time constraints.  Now if a director's cut appears and the storylines get fleshed out then maybe this would be a somewhat better movie.  Even if that happens there are still several things wrong with this movie, the script is very clunky and sounds as if it came right off the pages of a comic book.  Some things just sound better when you're reading them in a comic and not using them to tell a story within a movie.  Another problem would be the acting, it was way too wooden from almost every actor.  I presume this is how director's Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wanted it, though the reason eludes me.On to some positive notes, there was some humor in the movie that helped lift certain moments in the film.  Another positive for the movie is the special effects, since the movie was filmed entirely in front of a green screen the CGI backgrounds were flawlessly mixed with the actors, unlike the terrible ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" that attempted the same trick.All gripes aside, ""Sin City"" is an alright movie, and I'm sure it stays incredibly faithful to the source material and for that I respect what has been created, but the movie as a whole, just didn't light my fire.  If you are a fan of the Sin City comics then I'm sure you will love this movie, but you will probably be left wanting to see the separate storylines fleshed out a bit more.""Sin City"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality."	2.0	This Movie Is Sinfully Twisted & Pointless...	2005-07-08	29	4	25

As one of the 3 people on the planet who hasn't read the graphic novels (at least thats the way it feels), this was my first trip into Sin City.  From the theme song (Cells by The Servent) to the use of color (the intro will show you what I mean), this movie was excellent.  The writing/dialog is fantastic, and the acting is perfect.  Some complained about Jessica Alba seeming lost, but I thought she fit her role just fine.  I actually thought Clive Owens voice seemed too monotone, but I'm sure thats exactly what Frank Miller was going for, so I am happy.  Now, here comes the REAL good stuff.  In an interview over at IGN, Frank Miller talks about sequels (""You ask if there will be a second, I ask if there will be a fifth.""), and the special edition they were putting together at the time of the interview.  This special edition really will be one, with TONS of extras, and interviews, not just a ""making of"" and a cast bio.  I can't wait for it to come out, but since I can't find any release dates for it, get the movie now (or rent it) if you really need your Sin City fix.Can't wait for the special edition, and will meanwhile rent this a few more times.

Its all about being a spectacular film. It has the most originality since Citizen Kane. The color scheme, the direction, the stylized violence, the truly well thought out characters all combines to make this one helluva film. And dare I say it, but maybe the return of sensless nudity? Sin City had a definate Noir influence, and the dialogue is right out of the time when Noir was king. Also the monologue of the characters was very helpful, and lent the movie even more of that comic book feel. The characters were able to tell us, in their own words what was going through their minds.To tell you the truth I was starting to wonder about Rodriguez, after Desperado and Once Upon A Time. But that is all behind us now Robert, if you ask me he has made the best film in the 20 years. Like Kurosawa you have once again risen above the ashes, to bring about a cinematic masterpiece.3 stories from Frank Miller's Sin City were chosen to make their theatrical debut. Though I never read them I did pick up Yellow Bastard and read it at the local book store to see what all the fuss was about. Mickey Rourke as Marv, Bruce Willis as Garrety and Clive Owen as Dwight all do one stellar job in bringing their penciled characters to cinematic life. Though if you ask me Mickey stole the show, he was, as far as I'm concerned Marv.There was a blatant de-masculinization aspect to the film, I mean I can't count the number of times that someone got shot, stabbed, mutilated or hit in the man's bathing suit area. Furthermore this trend or theme was cemented by having prostitutes who run their own part of town (Old Town) without the help of male pimps. But in the end their livleyhood hinges on a man.The only complaint I have is, is that I need to see this one again, my attention was too torn between watching style and the story line.	5.0	-Film Noir For The New Millennium-	2005-04-05	4	2	2

The visuals are incrediable followed by an amazing cast.  The 3 stories presented definately flow smoothly together, I couldn't even guess the story that Tarintino directed.  The movie runs just over 2 hours and I never once felt the need to catch a glance at my watch.  Robert Rodriguez did an amazing job with bringing this one completely together.  The only downside to the movie was the cleche 50's dialogue.  But it fits the piece well and you become accustom to the language in no time.  This work of art is definately worth seeing.  But be warned!  The violence is intense even in its cinematic glory.  If you were a fan of kill bill volume 1, you'll truly enjoy this movie in its noir setting.

078886047X	Sin City	AKB75HRACZIOP	Karl Morkunas	"Personally supervised by Quentin Tarantino, Sin City is a masterpiece of cinematography with a perfect cast and action that will put you on the edge of your seat. The movie is primarily in black and white, but only utilizes color for special emphasis (i.e. lips, blood, and the dress a woman is wearing). This original unique style of filming accompanied with a narrative voice allows the viewer to willingly suspend their suspense of disbelief and enter into the world of Sin City. Bruce Willis, who plays Hartigan, is a burnt-out cop that is pushing 60 that saves a 12 year old girl (Jessica Alba) from being raped and killed.  Mickey Rourke, who plays the character of Marv, is a near unstoppable juggernaut man with a vendetta with anyone related to his one-night stand love ""Blondie"". Elijah Wood plays a freakishly fast cannibal psychopath that slashes people with his elongated finger nails -- what an extreme character compared to Wood's Frodo from Lord of the Rings, but he pulls it off perfectly! This was perhaps the best action movie I have seen all year. It's definitely worth paying the hefty price of $8.75 too see Sin City in your local theatre. If you like badass nonstop action, great acting with an engaging plot, and a movie that sets new standards in cinematography, then Sin City is a movie that you will definitely not want to miss!"	5.0	Brilliant Cinematography, Superb Cast, Top Notch Action	2005-04-08	2	1	1

I have never read the comic books on which this movie is based on, so I was confused out of my mind. The movie went from one story to another, without any real connection between stories. The characters are shot time and time again, and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering. This movie is pretty much just violence and hookers. No real story or plot. Just violence and hookers.

078886047X	Sin City	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: In an interview, Robert Rodriguez stated that instead of bringing the world of graphic novels to film, he wanted to bring film to the world of graphic novels. Boy, did he hit the nail on the head. Rodriguez has all the respect I can give to him because he is a conservative filmmaker who churns out epic products. His first film was made for $7K, and ever since he really tries to make movies for less. Rodriguez recently entered the world of digital filmmaking, his last film, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, was shot entirely in HD using digital cameras, no film. He raves about how easy it is to edit, just plug it into the computer and badabing! Sin City was shot all digital and it aided Rodriguez in accurately capturing Miller's vision.  The movie uses three story lines from three seperate novels by Frank Miller. One is called ""The Hard Goodbye"", which follows a man's journey for revenge after a cannibal rapist who killed his one true love. The interesting part is that this one true love was a hooker that he spent the night with for the first time.  Marv is played to perfection by Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood is absolutely menacing as the cannibalistic killer. The second story is called ""The Big Fat Kill"", in where Dwight (Clive Owen) tries to protect the prostitutes of Basin City from a menacing sex starved guy but ends up sparking a war between the cops and the hookers who previously held a truce.  Finally comes my favorite plot, ""That Yellow Bastard"". This is what noir is all about, the story of a cop coming to the end of his run trying to protect an innocent girl from a pedophile madman, he ends up framed for the crime and after 8 years in prison he sets out to protect the same girl only she's 19 now rather than 11.  Everything was done entirely with chroma key (Green Screen), and since it was in black/white it didn't feel cartoonish like Star Wars did.  Rodriguez uses light to highlight faces and shadows that make an incredible effect.  The only colors in the movie are red, blue, and yellow, which are the primary colors.  Green is used twice, and I'm trying to remember if they incorporated the fact that blue and yellow make green, but I can't remember, so maybe I'm just over analyzing with the green.  The movie has a lot of personal narration from the characters, and it's not narration of what is going on plot-wise but rather their personal thoughts to the action that is happening.  One great line from Bruce Willis is after punching his partner in the face he says to himself, ""Hell of a way to end a partnership"".  Although the lines are sleazy and obvious at times you have to realize that the kind of dialogue used here is a trademark of the noir style. ""That Yellow Bastard"" was definately the best story of them all because it had emotion to it, ""The Hard Goodbye"" was great too mainly because of the character of Marv, and ""The Big Fat Kill"" had some shining moments too but trailed off the radar a few times.  The only problem I had was that the narration in Marv's storyline dragged a bit, but overall Robert Rodriguez's talent in film combined with Frank Miller's talent in graphic novels makes one hell of a tribute to film noir.  This is pure entertaining filmmaking at its best, it's all style and one hell of an experience.ACTING/DIRECTING: Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke shine in full glory. They couldn't have gotten any better actors for these roles. All the characters in a film noir are hard-boiled and cynical, and these two played it to perfection.  The ensamble cast is endless and everyone was top notch except for Jaime King as Goldie/Wendy, she just can't act. As it goes for the artistic vision, well, does it really need explaining? I mean, brilliant use of shadows and light, using the primary colors only when something needs to be emphasized, and capturing emotion through the setting. One of my favorite scenes was when Bruce Willis' character was framed and in jail for 8 years, he first says that he is alone. The jail cell seems to be floating in an endless darkness, it's all black around the cell.  Then comes Quentin Tarantino, who is really only being used as a marketing technique, but you can sense that disturbing Tarantino style and wit during the movie.  Rodriguez and Tarantino are best buddies, and really I admire their admiration for classic films and film styles. Tarantino's Kill Bill films were tributes to Kurosawa and Leone, while Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" trilogy is a tribute to Leone's ""Man with no name"" trilogy.  Anyway, Tarantino stopped on the set one day and Rodriguez wanted to show him the digital HD way of film, and let him direct this one scene where Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro are in a car and Owen starts imagining things in his head.BOTTOM LINE: Robert Rodriguez is the man.  He gave up his DGA (Director's Guild of America) membership just so that he could have Frank Miller as a co-director, he really wanted Frank with him at all times so that they could get this one done perfect to Miller's standards.  In his recent films if you pay attention to the credits you'll see Robert Rodriguez's name pop up several times.  He does his own music, his editing, cinematography, writing, and directing. With Sin City he directed, did the music along with John Debney, and did the visual effects. He takes the workload to make it good, and he knows how to make it good, so I'm not gonna argue"	5.0	Rodriguez's Vision Is Stunning, An Incredible Film Noir	2005-04-04	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3	"K. Corn ""reviewer"""	"Miller was more than reluctant to see his novels (in comic book form) get made for the screen. After all, he'd worked long and hard to get his own series so why hand over the reins to someone else? Word is, he resisted tons of offers until finally he was convinced by a very persistent director, who went so far as to film a trial scene, complete with the ACTUAL ACTORS to be used in the movie. That did the trick.Okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself? Does it live up to expectations?Yes, and more so...just don't be surprised by the graphic nature of the film. Those familiar with Miller's work won't be - it is those who aren't who may have to make a few adjustments in their expectations, although I think they'll be entranced from the opening scenes.The plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book. Murder, revenge, love, lust and corrumption everywhere. The world so gritty that you feel like showering after you leave the theatre, convinced the dust and grime are so thick that they HAVE to had escaped the screen. The film noir atmosphere is so thick that it makes for a heady experience, especially if, like me, you are a huge fan of film noir.If it sounds like I""m holding back on the plot details, I am..because viewers really need to come to this movie with fresh eyes, open to a new experience. You won't be disappointed but this movie won't be for everyone. Check out the word of mouth first, especially from people whose opinions you trust.

Like some people I wanted to see this movie but got a little turned off because it was in black and white. Even though the picture is in black and white It's a nicely done picture. It's extremely smooth and crisp and it becomes beautiful when some color is added to make certain things stick out.After seeing how well done it is you can't stop watching. It needed to be in black and white to show the ruggedness of the film and it really couldn't have been done any other way. Like instead of blood being red it was white and for some reason it looked cooler. The story is self-explanatory the name says it all but the twists in it are exciting and take the movie from good to great to amazing. It's a very violent and raw movie and you come to love it for that. Basically if you're looking for a movie that has a deep story and is in every way different than any other movie out then you need to see Sin City	5.0	Never seen anything like it	2006-01-19	4	3	1
078886047X	Sin City	AY9OL9YXFA2QS	"Keith A. Morris ""filmmaker of GUTTER KING"""	"The DVD extras of Rodriguez and Tarantino directing are better than the whole film.  Still, don't buy this.  Why?  You're encouraging him.  Don't encourage him.  Let him move on to make something with a modicum of depth!  (Both in look and story.)I saw Sin City at a sneak preview for film critics and fanboys before it even came out.  My friend got tickets from a comic store.  I am probably the biggest fan of Rodriguez out there.  I really wanted the film to be good.  I was so amped on the trailers, I showed my students them for two months.  I show his 10 minute Flick School on breaks, his home studio tour during class, etc.  I am his biggest fan.BUT:If you like bad British TV shows and bad off off off Broadway theater, you will love Sin City.  The makeup on that Yellow B*st*rd was worth the price of admission to a true fanboy--it was phenomenal; but everything else just blew blew blew.  From shot selection to story to dialogue to bad green screen work to pace to character development, it just was a major disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted it to be good, but it was so bad people were laughing at it and some even booed it afterward.Shot selection: I foamed at the mouth that he was going to try to shoot it as close to the panels as possible.  It didn't work.  I was constantly going, ok, who is talking to whom?  Its called establishing shots, Robert.  It took me out of it.  The setups were HORRIBLE.  The poor environments are partly to blame, but it mostly felt like everything was shot on a green screen the width of a car, and with the height of about 7 feet.  Everything seemed to be in medium shots and close-ups!!  You'd think storyboarding would be simple for something emulating the great Sin City, but it just didn't transfer well onto the big screen.story: vignette style, which I didn't mind, but I couldn't get into the characters at all.  With no character development, the story seemed all sizzle, no steak. 20 minutes into it, no lie, I thought it was going to be over bc i thought I had sat through an hour and a half, but it kept going on and on.  I was expecting it to end, and it didn't.  The vignette style at least let you know that the next chapter would be coming soon, which meant it was closer to ending.Dialogue: it was so uneven!  I love film noir dialogue, but no time was spent getting it right with these modern actors (half were miscast--that chick from Gilmore Girls stuck out like a sore thumb!  Shame on her for sucking so bad!)  People were laughing at the dialogue.  Literally, three times I thought they were joking but they were being serious.  There is one good part: one guy gets shot with an arrow and it's the best part of the movie. Dialogue was tough too buy bc I didn't buy the environments, and when you don't buy that something is REAL, then everything else seems fake too.My biggest thing: If you're going to build an all digital city, make it look like its more than one block.  And the 3d environments were ""gorpy"" like some shots in Star Wars 1.  Sin City had no depth, it had half depth.  The clean 2d style of the comic books was there in ending panels, and they looked hot.  You have to go for it all the way if you're going to move away from the 2d, and they went halfway.HD doesn't look good with high key lighting.  Sin City is all about high key lighting.  I'm a huge fan of HD, but HD needs low lighting (Collateral, etc) to look like film.  The whole film seemed 3 layers away from believability.  Hence, the British TV slam. (I'm sorry, Robert!)Ok, now the big one.  The reason why this movie didn't work, ultimately, was the script.  IT WAS ONE LONG MONOLOGUE. Film is showing, not telling, and you learn every little thing that's going on in the minds of every protagonist.  For example, Bruce Willis is hanging out of a car trying to shoot someone.  Instead of just rockin' action, he has an inner dialogue! explaining why the other guy is missing hitting him--and then he tells you why his own shot will be on target, and gives you extra info about that even, and then he finally friggin' shoots the guy.  I was like, ""Shoot him, Yellow B*st*rd!  Wait, no, shoot me!""  the whole thing felt so slow bc of this.When you finally get to action scenes, they narrate all the way through them!  Ack!My friend liked it, so this is just one person's opinion.  If you haven't seen it, maybe you should get your hopes way down, so when you see it, it wont be such a colossal disappointment.  I would advise people to only borrow the DVD from a friend.  Watch it on a small TV.  I was in the 4th row.After seeing the film, I think he gave Frank Miller co-credit (and Tarantino too) not to be nice, but to shoulder the blame.  Rodriguez is a genius marketer.  But a turd is still a turd, no matter how much you polish it.I challenge you Robert to not suck.  You have enough money now to make movies AWAY from green screens.  They will be horribly dated and laughed at in the future.  Take all that money and make something like Indiana Jones, not this."	1.0	HORRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT	2006-08-10	42	12	30

078886047X	Sin City	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	Maybe I missed something by not seeing this in the theater; maybe the living comic book visual style of SIN CITY was so dazzling on a big screen that it obliterated any reservations about the sheer banality of its storylines. But I finally got a chance to see this film, a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez, and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour (and I think I'm being generous there!). All the storylines---Bruce Willis' attempt to protect a young stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke's attempt to avenge a prostitute's (Jaime King) death, Clive Owen's attempt to put down a thug (Benicio del Toro) and his misogynistic ways---are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style. There's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations (BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example); it's all just a soulless geek show. A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless. If appearances are all that matter to you, than SIN CITY will probably be a ball (and the visuals are the only reasons I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1). But for those looking for something other than just fancy-pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation, look elsewhere.	2.0	Visually stunning, but that's it	2005-12-23	25	14	11
078886047X	Sin City	A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM	Kenneth V. Cockrel	"Watching ""Sin City"" is kind of like dating a particularly bubble-headed supermodel.Sure she's great to look and the sex may even be fantastic. But sooner or later she's got to do other things besides look great in clothes(or out of them) like, y'know, talk to you.  And if she has nothing to say that's a problem.The problem with ""Sin City"" is that it has absolutely nothing to say though it admittedly looks great doing it.  Upon its theatrical release the film was lauded for it's visually stunning look and on that score at least you can believe the hype.On looks alone, no film since the ""The Matrix"" has carried with it since an incredible ""Wow"" factor.  But ""The Matrix"" also had an engaging, thought-provoking storyline and well developed characters to move that story forward.  It is in these areas that ""Sin City"" falls short.Part of the problem is that the film simply tries to cram too much into two hours.  The movie condenses three separate storylines from Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels into one movie.  Big Mistake.Any one of these stories alone would have made for a solid, gripping film.  By trying to tell all three stories in one movie, the film ends up giving these stories and their characters the short shrift.Virtually all the characters, with the possible exception of Mickey Rourke's performance as the hapless boxer Marv, come off as underdeveloped.  Just because a movie's source material is comic books doesn't mean your heroes and heroines should be one dimensional.Robert Rodriguez(""Desperado"" ""Spy Kids"") is reportedly such a huge fan of Frank Miller's work that he offered him a co-directing gig on the movie. But in my opinion, the pair should have picked just one of Miller's storylines to focus on.  In fact, its astounding that the notoriously sequel-prone Rodriguez didn't realize that by not doing so he was squandering an opportunity to do two follow-up movies.In closing, I'm left wondering why half the actors in the free world were salivating at the chance to star in this movie.  Perhaps the massive cast saw it as a chance to star in the next groundbreaking genre film, the next ""Blade Runner,"" ""Brazil,"" or ""The Matrix.""If so they lost sight of one key fact.  What makes those movies classics is that they didn't just have style. They also had substance."	2.0	A Whole Lot of Style, Very Little Substance	2005-08-10	16	8	8

078886047X	Sin City	A37JKM7EFD0DIQ	K.H.	"Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, based directly, or as directly an adaptation can possibly be transferred from one medium to another, from Frank Miller's comic series of they same name is disturbing, cruel, unrelentless, and possibly sinful (note: Miller is listed as co-director, but this is at the insistence of Rodriguez).As stated previously, it tells the stories from three Sin Cilty graphic novels.  The two most powerful stories are adaptations from ""That Yellow Bastard"" and ""The Hard Goodbye.""  That Yellow Bastard is seperated into two seperate sections, the begining and the end (well sort of) starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba.  Bruce Willis is great, but his voice over narration is a technical mis-step and is the only flaw in the story.  The pitcure is so powerful, the voice over overly impacts the visuals.  Willis is believable as Hartigan and he is the last  good cop in a corrupt city - Sin City.  Alba is perfect as Nancy, the little girl who becomes a stripper (the only role I have appreciated Alba as an actress).  The little girl who plays the young Nancy is splendid.  The plot deals with evil at its wose, taking it to its very extremes.  Good finally previals, but with a price.Mickey Rourke gives the best performance since ""Angel Heart.""  He is perfect for the part and  plays it well. This time, the voice over narration adds to the visuals and technically works - enhancing the story and its visuals.  The villians, played by Rutger Haur and Elijah Wood is devilish and scary.  They also show extreme evil, as a man of the cloth perverts what is good for the pleasure of evil transcendence.  The supporting characyters are great, and Rodriguez provides moments to lighten things aup a bit - although quick, it is needed.The story involving Clive Owen should have been left out of this pitcure and maybe added for a sequal, if shown at all. It fails to impact the way the other stories do.  I did not find much wrong with it, it just seemed long and unnecessary.This movie deals with sin, in the extreme fashions, but that may be what is needed to shoke a world out of its slumber.  There is no relativism here - evil is evil - the pitcures tell the story.  And in a world of evil, glimpes of love and hope do survive.  The one good cop and little girl who keeps her promise.  His death is not a suicide but a sacrifice.  A monster showed attention by a beautiful women, and after avenging her, is shown love by the sister.  Redemption is there for the seeking."	4.0	Sin City Indeed	2006-02-11	2	0	2
078886047X	Sin City	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Sin City takes place within a corrupt and criminal environment where evil and suspicious characters seem to rule the city.  Daylight never seems to reach this place where human transgressions seem to be the norm, as shadows and darkness enhance the gloomy milieu in which the characters exist.  This film is the very archetype of film noir as no one can trust anyone and death lurks around every corner.  The film's heroes are less than perfect with either a dark past or they suffer from some terminal condition.  Everything is perfect in regards to film noir, yet the world is as far as possible from an utopia as life is easily expendable and everyone is guilty of something.In three of Frank Miller's graphic novels Sin City has generated the foundation for the films, as the audience get the opportunity to follow three disconnected adventures.  These three adventures lead the audience into a dark place, an unwanted domain if it was real, but the black and white cinematography make it look and feel like the graphic novel that Miller created.  This makes the film tolerable, as the violence is extreme, detailed, and intense.  If Sin City was shot in the spirit of Spider-Man (2002) the film would be extremely gory, grotesque, and probably would not be allowed in theater throughout the United States.  Thus, as mentioned, the black and white cinematography makes the film tolerable and viewable, but it also surpasses the cinematography from other graphic novels by light-years, as it displays brilliance.The adventures are all divided up by the women in the story, which are an essential part of the atmosphere of the film.  None of the women seem to be over the age of 25 while they all are prostitutes with daring clothing revealing more than covering.  The prostitution and the sexually suggestive environment intensifies the sleaziness of the criminal milieu, which enhances the distrusting atmosphere.  However, the women in Sin City are no feeble women.  These women do not mind pulling the trigger when it counts, or swinging a blade if necessary.  Nonetheless, these women also bring out the little good and human compassion, if one can call it that, which is a rare commodity in Basin City where the stories take place.After the film's opening the audience is introduced to the cop Harrigan (Bruce Willis) who is about to make his final arrest before retirement.  This arrest attempt leads Harrigan to reveal the location where he can find a psychopathic killer that sexually lusts for torturing young girls.  He is also aware that the pedophile has recently kidnapped a young girl named Nancy.  However, this psycho-killer is not unknown to him, as he has slipped his grasp many times before.  The psychopath is the son of the mayor, and this could lead to some major difficulty for Harrigan through the mayor's influential powers.Following Harrigan's case, the audience gets to follow Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-convict with delusional tendencies and a beautiful parole officer.  Marv has just met and had his best intimate moment with Goldie.  When Marv awakens from his sexually exhausted slumber he discovers that Goldie is dead and the cops have already been tipped.  Angry and vengeful Marv escapes the trap in order to find the true identity behind Goldie's killer, which leads the audience into a blood splattered river that flows from Marv's path.Shellie's (Brittany Murphy) ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) instigates the third adventure where the freedom of the girls in the Old Time comes in jeopardy, as the truce between the cops, the mob, and the prostitutes is crumbling.  The hero in this tale is Dwight (Clive Owen), a criminal with a recent face job, who turns into the knight in shining armor, but much better than in King Arthur (2004).  This sequence displays the strength that the women possess when they decide enough is enough, which of course turns very bloody.There are several elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.  The cast consists of actors such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Jessica Alba and many others.  A couple of the highlights are Rourke's performance as Marv, as he brings out the dirty and nasty in a delusional criminal who is on a murderous destructive path while Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy is simply excellent.Robert Rodriguez who has directed several action films is a perfect choice to lead this project, as he also had help from Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino.  The scenes are full of speed, action, and nitty-gritty violence, which intentionally goes over the top with high frequency.  This exaggerated violence often seems humorous and will occasionally force the audience into laughter.  However, laughing at mutilation is hardly acceptable, which suggests that the audience is as guilty to the crime as the perpetrator.  This is a cleverly incorporation of the visual theme that no one is innocent, as all are guilty, even the audience members.  Furthermore, the heavy use of cerebral character monologues enhances the audience's cerebral participation in the film, as little is left for the imagination, yet it leaves the audience contemplating moral values.	5.0	Wicked, Dark, and Ominously Intriguing - Brilliant Film Noir	2005-04-03	8	4	4

That's except if you love guns, bar fights, hookers, swords, drugs, horror, dead people and every possible combination of these. I guess lot of folks do like to see this sort of stuff, hence the amazing 8.4 average rating on IMDB, amazing to me that is.Anyway, the one thing I liked about the movie is Mickey Rourke's acting, he just outcooled everybody. Benicio Del Toro was pretty good too. Token appearances by Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer and others. Can't say anything about Jessica Alba, she didn't really have a part in the movie until the end, and by that I just wanted it to be over.	2.0	Interesting concept used for mindless violence	2005-08-02	32	9	23

This is the first time that a director has accepted the brilliance of a comic (graphic novel) at face value and attempted to bring it to a larger audience by adapting it for the big screen. Hopefully the success of this film will be a cue to movie makers everywhere that making comic book adoptions goes way beyond using licensed character names and state of the art CGI. Sin City the film is brilliant because Sin City the graphic novel series is brilliant (Not to take anything away from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarintino's direction). The movie does an excellent job capturing the characters, setting, plot and overall mood and style of the novels. Like the novels, this movie is not for those who are easily offended by scenes of graphic violence. But like so many other Tarintino and Rodriguez movies Sin City is a world all its own and should not be viewed through a realistic lens. For those looking for a true adoption of a dark comic Sin City is for you, for those looking for Spiderman 3 might want to skip this one. It's just not that kind of movie.	5.0	First True Comic Adaption	2005-04-06	3	2	1
078886047X	Sin City	A2460ZRFVC2YGV	Kristopher Haines	"I knew from the preview that ""Sin City"" was worth looking into, as I am a huge fan of noir. Yet, there was something about the preview that suggested that the noirish atmosphere might be gimmickery. Maybe just the preview was noirish. Heck, parts of it suggested that it might be an animated feature. There's nothing wrong with that, I would just feel as though my expectations were messed with. My fears grew larger when the television preview made the ""Frank Miller"" at the top more obvious. ""Who's he?"" I asked myself. ""Oh no! could this guy be the director, are they trying to fool us into believing this is a Robert Rodriguez film when he's actually just producing?"" I'd almost fallen for that publicity trick before, and if that was what ""they"" were doing I wasn't going to be happy. If any of you had those doubts as well you can relax. It IS a Rodriguez film along with several ""guest directors"" including Quentin Tarantino. I wasn't able to ascertain who did what as the interlocking stories are not clearly deleneated ""episodes"". The atmosphere is wonderful, and I am a harsh judge when it comes to neo-noir. It was MUCH more violent than I was initially prepared for but that's my own fault. I QUICKLY got into Rodriguez/Tarantino mode. It just caught me off guard. Go see it NOW. I've never seen anything like it. The use of color is spare, expressive and stylish. I'm glad I went with my gut reaction and gave it the chance I knew it deserved."	5.0	Unadulterated Brilliance	2005-04-01	5	4	1
078886047X	Sin City	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"Of all the comic-book movies that have been made, from Flash Gordon to The Fantastic Four in 2005, this is liable to score a premier spot in the `fan satisfaction' division. No niggling here along the lines of ""Spider-Man shouldn't have organic web-shooters"" or ""Batman's parents shouldn't be shot by the Joker"". This collaboration between two one-man bands, comic-book writer-artist Frank Miller and director-writer producer Robert Rodriguez, is as authentic to the source material as those cheapo '60s Marvel cartoons that panned over panels from the caricatures while narrative artists read out the word balloons.Like most flourishing comics, Sin City created a decipherable concrete-but-unreal humanity. Miller mixed a stew of thugs in trench coats out of Chandler or Spillane, a spice of the `bad girl art' that made paperback covers of the 1950s stand out from newsracks and a splatter of the manga-ish stylized goriness which encouraged movies buffs like Quentin Tarantino (who guest-directs one scene) have only recently discovered. The movie candidly matches the look of the comic: stark black-and-white images, with the occasional shocking or beautiful splash of rich color. Most modern noirs incline to the blacker side of monochrome, but Miller's scratchboard techniques, custom-made superbly by Rodriguez, often get the most impact out of white - the blank round reflections of a killer's sunglasses, crosses of sticking-plaster on a much-wounded face, arterial gushes of opaque blood.The movie script also matches the original stories virtually word for word. The original mini-series was about Marv (perfectly incarnated here by comeback kid Mickey Rourke) a relentless but sympathetic freak who avenges the murder of his love by taking on a grisly cannibal (a blank-faced, far-from-Frodo Elijah Wood). The film adapts this (later retitled The Hard Goodbye) and two of its follow-ups including The Big Fat Kill, seemingly blas&eacute; about the similarities among the plots and characters, convinced that the seductive imagery and picturesque citizens would grasp the attention.Be warned, though - this is not a movie for the faint of heart. The extreme violence does get a bit obtrusive, but you can say the same for Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO and others. But to point out its graphic nature is a moot point. It is classic cinema that should be seen and appreciated for what it is-pure entertainment."	5.0	Fantastic comic book movie	2005-07-12	7	6	1
078886047X	Sin City	AVMZJ18CAGBZ8	Krystal Potter	"Yes, it's graphic violence, something I don't ordinarily watch, however the artistry in which it was done can only be paralelled to perhaps, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Cell"", yet also like stepping into the pages of a comic book.Correctly done in black and white, for the most part, this movie gives prime examples of hypothetical situations where one might decide to take justice into their own hands.The casting is outstanding, the women exotically beautiful, unlike the typical barbie dolls who are usually cast into rolls of this type.This movie is a winning example of retro mingling with modern and doing it very successfully. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can't stand graphic violence. I myself may never watch it again, although it is a most brilliant piece of work. I'd dub it a cult classic upon release."	5.0	Not my kinda flick BUT...	2005-11-02	6	2	4

078886047X	Sin City	A3HTOT6UUIKNGI	Kyle K	"Sin City, quite frankly, is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. This film is almost impossibly violent, with cannibalism, decapitation, dismemberment, castration, and torture occuring throughout the three major segments. However, anyone who has ever actually read the source material would not complain. The action is frequently over-the-top and unrealistic, but it makes sense when one considers that this is a ""translation"" of Frank Miller's graphic novels. Most of Sin City's dialogue and voiceovers are lifted right out of the comics, as are many individual shots. Three loosely-connected storylines make up the bulk of the film, beginning with ""The Hard Goodbye,"" continuing with ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ending with ""That Yellow Bastard.""The cast is simply excellent: Mickey Rourke brings the thuggish Marv to brutal, excessively-bandaged life; Benicio Del Toro's Jackie Boy exudes half-crazed menace; Nick Stahl's performance as Junior perfectly conveys the character's bratty psychosis. Even non-speaking characters are well-played (Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the murderous Kevin).I really don't understand the accusations of misogyny. Most of the women are strong-willed and powerful, like Gail, Wendy, and Miho. The men of Sin City are almost always portrayed as callous, amoral killers. Well, technically, everyone in Sin City is somewhat lacking in morality. Anyone easily offended by immoral behavior should rent or buy a different movie."	5.0	"""Everything up to the killing will be a gas . . ."""	2005-08-27	2	1	1

Easily the best DVD release in my collection. There's just so much on there to like: Rodriguez prefaces each DVD w/an intro and there's quirky comic book menus that pop in and out which are a joy for us comic book geeks. So do you want the blu-ray of this?I've done a quick taste test and I won't be selling my regular DVD release anytime soon. The colors do pop a little bit more on the blu-ray, but damn they are sharp as hell on the regular release, so you are really getting this for the Kill `Em Good: Interactive Comic Book and the CinExplore Feature. Worth it, but ehhhhhh, as a fan of the blu-ray format they really do need to be making these the ""must have"" definitive versions of the release and not an afterthought of what came before.To be fair, most of these ship w/a $10 redeemable coupon, if you own the standard DVD release, so thank you, thank you. This is a worthwhile purchase, all things considered, but blu-ray releases need to start standing out as ""must haves"" or only 10% of the movie buying population is ever going to care."	4.0	blu-ray review	2009-04-30	2	1	1
078886047X	Sin City	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"""Frank Miller's Sin City"" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be angels or goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well without anyone's help.  Still, this is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go straight to there. This movie is rated R for ""sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue,"" but that is most assuredly an R that is a whole lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.I am not particularly happy that when I bought ""Frank Miller's Sin City"" on DVD as soon as it came out that it was the stripped down version and that a few months later, in time for Christmas no less, we finally get the ""Recut, Extended, Unrated"" DVD set.  But studios are making money off of this double-dipping and if I could hold off for years on ""Titanic"" I should have been able to do the same thing with this one, so shame on me.  But the good news is that (a) I did not have to pay for the upgrade and (b) the difference between the two DVDs, without the discount, is only ten bucks and you will more than get your money's worth here because to ease our collective pain Robert Rodriguez made sure that this 2-disc set goes the extra mile.  That is clear as soon as you open up the box and discover it includes a mini-version of Frank Miller's ""The Hard Goodbye"" (my ""mini"" I mean the book is slightly larger than the size of a paperback novel).  This is a good choice not only because it is the first ""Sin City"" graphic novel, but also because it is about Marv and as Marv Mickey Rourke steals this movie from Bruce Willis and the rest.  So already you have account for a good chuck of the extra ten dollars you are spending and then we get to the super-loaded two DVDs.Disc 1 contains the original theatrical release (uncut, unextended, rated).  Your other ""Sin City"" DVD is made superfluous because this has three commentary tracks: co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller talking primarily about working with the actors; Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino (eventually) talking more about the technical aspects of the film; and an audio track of the reaction of an audience in Austin to a screening of the film.  The featurettes cover how Frank Miller was convinced to make the film, getting Tarantino to play with shooting a film digitally, and then separate looks at the cars, props, special effects and costumes of the film.  There is then a ""Sin-Chroni-City"" interactive game that looks at how the three novels that make up the first ""Sin City"" movie cross each other, and the teaser and theatrical trailers.  The two directors having a conversation while screening the film is the best of the extras on this disc, simply because I like the stories of the production a bit more than the details on how the film was made, but both are excellent commentary tracks.Disc 2 offers the recut and extended theatrical release and it is not the deleted scenes being worked back in for the ""extended"" part that matters here but rather the ""recut"" part.  That is because Rodriguez has recut the movie into the three graphic novels, ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard,"" along with the short story ""The Customer Is Always Right"" from ""Babe Wore Red"" and the epilogue Rodriguez and Miller came up with for the end of the film.  With the movie broken up this way it is even easier for you to watch a ""chapter"" with Miller's graphic novel in front of you to see the extent to which they actually did shoot the book on this film.  Of course the special features on this disc include new installments of Rodriguez's 15-Minute Film School and 10-Minute Cooking School (breakfast tacos).  There is also a performance by Bruce Willis with a band at the ""'Sin City' Live"" cast and crew party at Antones filmed by Rodriguez with the digital camera.  For cinema buffs the two treats are the movie in high-speed green screen, so you can see how they actually shot everything (tip of the hat to Rodriguez for protecting his cast on the brief nudity in this version), and a 14-minute uninterrupted take from Tarantino's segment (Dwight and Jackie Boy in the car on the way to the tar pits) that allows a great look at how actors and directors work when shooting digitally.I already thought ""Frank Miller's Sin City"" was a five-star movie that not only sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century but also advances the cause of digital filmmaker.  That it brings Miller's characters and story to life while remaining faithful to his artistic style is a bonus for those whose introduction to ""Sin City"" was the graphic novels, but that was what Miller and wanted and what Rodriguez delivered with his little test run.  If you held out on getting this movie on DVD until the special features version was available it was well worth your wait, and if you have been duped into giving the studio even more of your money for this upgrade you will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that Rodriguez delivered for you as well."	5.0	"""Frank Miller's Sin City"" (Recut, Extended, Unrated)"	2005-04-01	1	1	0

078886047X	Sin City	A1W0ODR0SK9H4R	LeftManOut	"I only expected good things when I heard that there would be a film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels, and after seeing this movie I can safely say that it was above and beyond even what I thought it could be. Robert Rodriguez really brings Miller's frantic and colorful (although not necessarily in the film, no pun intended) world to life, and makes the lines between comic and movie blur. Everything from the story to the cast of characters is nothing short of stellar as far as ""Sin City"" is concerned. Add in some outrageous (and sometimes gruesome) special effects, and a guest directing spot by the heralded Quentin Tarantino, and you have the formula for one of the best and most original movies to hit the silver screen in years. Short of nothing, this is a must see for fan's of Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino, and the Sin City series.The story may be somewhat confusing to some as it does jump around a bit (thanks to guest man Tarantino's patented directing style), but most should be able to piece everything together because it all relates to one giant overview in the end. The cast is perfect for the movie. There is really not one person from this film that I would take out, or anyone else I would add. You have the obvious eye candy of starlets like Jessica Alba (Nancy), Britanny Murphy (Shellie) and Rosario Dawson (Gail) to hold over the audience, while, well known actors like Bruce Willis (Hartigan), Mickey Rourke (Marv) and Clive Owen (Dwight) give the film plenty of credibility. The characters are developed wonderfully, and each has their own agenda/means for being in the film (like many I will never look at Elijah Wood the same way again). The story flows well actually for jumping around a bit, but that is what gives the film its special feel, and one that makes the viewer know this is a worthwhile experience. Without revealing too much of the plot line of the movie (which trust me you will want to find out for yourself as it is so good) the film basically takes from three of Miller's graphic novels, ""The Big Fat Kill"", ""That Yellow Bastard"" and ""The Hard Goodbye"", which if you have read any of the comics or novels you will probably be familiar with. Marv (Rourke) spent the night with the woman of his dreams, a hooker named Goldie, only to awake and find her dead of the bed next to him. Being framed for the murder, Marv escapes and vows to find out who indeed killed Goldie. Along with that Hartigan (Willis) has just awakened from his injuries he suffered while saving Nancy (Alba) when she was a child, only to meet back up with Nancy, who is now stripping at a popular night club. And all the while Dwight is trying to protect the city's prostitution brigade, after they mistakenly kill an officer. The way that the story fits together works almost perfectly considering that going from one frame to the other is not exactly the easiest thing to do.About those who have complained about the movie. I've noticed that most people who have given this movie bad reviews or trashed it have concentrated on two major points : the violence and the unrealistic events. As far as the violence goes, yes Sin City is extremely, extremely graphic. However if you were to take any of this away from the movie, everything ""Sin City"" was centered around would falls to pieces. Not to say the movie is dependent on its violent content, but in reality these stories come from comics which are most of the time graphic in nature (don't even ask about graphics novels). The violence though is very cartoon-like, so I can't really imagine anyone being genuinely offended for seeing a bloody character appear on the screen. As for the unrealistic qualities the movie has, like I said it comes from a comic book series. I'm guessing a lot of people who have complained this movie either don't know this, or haven't read comics/graphics novels. Basically the movie portrays what happens in the novels to a T, and complaining or trashing the movie for being unrealistic or violent shows not only close-mindedness, but an unwillingness to accept that there are other ways to create authentic ideas. At some point people have to learn how to suspend their disbelief.""Sin City"" was and still is easily one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences to come along in quite some time. If you are a fan of the Sin City series, or any other movies which Rodriguez and Tarantino have been involved in, you are in for a spectacular treat, because this is definitely among the best films that either has been a part of. If you have no idea about any of what I have said or you haven't seen or even heard about anything related to the two directors, this is still a worthwhile movie to see, if only for it's uniqueness. There's plenty of interesting plot developments, likeable/ hate-worthy characters, and stunning effects to hold almost any viewer over. There's not much more I can say, except that you should really see this movie. Do so right away."	5.0	Simply, A Must See	2005-12-23	6	4	2

078886047X	Sin City	A13W4PVLAQMWH3	Lesley Freitas	"I've surprised several people by telling them that I believe ""Sin City"" is one of the best movies of the year. Such a claim is surprising both because ""Sin City"" is not generally the kind of movie I like (or so it would appear) and because it doesn't seem to be the type of movie that could be thought of as great. Entertaining, yes. Great, no.But this movie is indeed great. It is obviously visually innovative and pleasing, taking film noir to the next level. But the subjects the movie delves into--and the way it deals with them--make ""Sin City"" stand out. Because, underneath all the flash, ""Sin City"" is actually (and don't laugh!) a sophisticated examination of the nature of morality.The world of ""Sin City"" is a world where those institutions and people who are generally seen as bastions of morality turn out to be highly immoral--most notably the church and the police. This could easily lead to the conclusion that Sin City is a place devoid of moral values, and with the amount of deviant behavior in this film, that's an easy judgment to reach.""Sin City"" is a three-part story, with each part revolving around one of three men: Marv (Mickey Rourke), Dwight (Clive Owen), and John Hartigan (Bruce Willis). Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan each devote themselves fully to protecting a woman, to the point that killing--and possibly dying--for her sake become necessary actions.What makes ""Sin City"" compelling is that although Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan would certainly fail to live up to most moral standards--not only do they kill for their women, they do so without remorse or hesitation--you end up seeing these men as heroes. You want them to succeed; you begin to understand their choices, and you start to believe that not to kill in defense of these women actually might be offensive.In other words, Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan are most certainly ""good"" characters in the eyes of the audience. Does this mean that they are simply the least immoral in a world filled only with immoral people? Perhaps. But ""Sin City"" is world of extraordinary situations, and these men are able to fight against those situations in the defense of an ideal--namely, the safety and redemption of a worthy woman. In this light, ""Sin City"" caused me to reflect on my own potential actions in certain situations. There are things every person would be willing to kill or die for, whether it be one's child or one's country. How do you determine what is worth killing for? Is such a killing moral, immoral, or outside of morality? Does your attitude towards such killing make it moral: in other words, must you be regretful and remorseful for it to be moral? I think that it is clear that when we are pushed to our limits, the laws of conventional morality bend. ""Sin City"" does a remarkably good job of presenting three men who are each pushed far beyond their limits, and the filmmakers leave it for the audience to decide whether these men are moral defenders or just as immoral as the people they come up against.In light of this, I highly recommend this film, both to those who are looking for an entertaining movie and to those who are in search of a thought-provoking one. That ""Sin City"" can appeal to both types of people demonstrates just how great this film is."	5.0	A surprisingly sophisticated movie!	2005-06-26	6	3	3
078886047X	Sin City	A3MLO4GAD2O9DL	"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy"""	"This is s perfect, and I mean absolutely perfect translation of the Frank Miller books of Sin City, a bunch of them, into movement. Rather than trying to create a continuous feature-length film, the filmmakers--Robert Rodriguez, QT, and Miller himself--have forged separate stories, just as Miller's books are, so that characters live and die in the space of five, ten, 20 minutes. But that's cool.What makes this so different is the amazing visual look and feel. Miller creates his graphic novel stuff in stark black and white with splashes of red--for blood, lipstick, passion (in the form of a red dress), and the thrill of action. Red bursts through here in the film too, right from the get go. Becky wears a bright red dress, has bright red lips...Speed (as in velocity) is here too, as is brute strength and eruptions of violence. The sere wizened face of corruption turns up, time and again. The hardened look of the men and women who've seen too much bad stuff--bad as in what people do to each other--to look happy ever again. They move from one frame to another, giving life to these emotions in a way that you just can't do on the printed page, even if it's illustrated.Cops and hitmen, hookers and psychos are all here. So what's the message? It's that we don't do what we should, do we? We treat each other badly and that's true even if we have a badge or a title that says we're not supposed to. Has that message been thrown out to us before? Sure. But the way this film does it makes it totally fresh and unique. This is an original piece of work like nothing else out there--sure as hell like no other ""comic book adaptation"" we've seen before.A completely different take on how to move a ""comic book"" into cinematic form, a whole lot of filmmaker folks should take a lesson from this. Let's see what Sin City 2 does, due out later this year. I'll be there.You betcha."	5.0	"What the phrase ""moving pictures"" really means"	2006-02-20	3	2	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1U537KOOROPL9	Lila Sears	"For anyone seeking realistic sets, characters, or action...For anyone hoping for toned-down nudity or sexuality...For anyone feeling sickened by the relentless violence of today's most murderous movies...For anyone looking for a calm movie night with the PTA...This film is NOT for you - but it sure is cool.If gratutious gore (albeit virtually all black and white and highly stylized) isn't your thing and you have a hang-up about on-screen nakedness, please don't watch this.  You'll hate it.  I don't know why anyone would seek out Frank Miller's seedy world of make-believe for character and plot realism, but apparently some people did, and those people hated the movie.  But on with a review...I went to see this movie out of sheer curiosity (and a strong desire to see Elijah Wood as a bad guy - wacky, huh?) and found it to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while.  I'd never heard of Frank Miller, which I suppose means I live under a rock, but I had seen some fairly mediocre attempts at making comic-book worlds translate adequately to film (Joel Shumaker does ""Batman,"" for example - ok, mediocre is HIGHLY generous here).  ""Sin City,"" however, does absolutely no apologizing for the fictional Basin City's other-worldliness.  It takes the illustrator's vision head-on and makes it a moving picture, which is a new and fantastic idea, but maybe that's the real difference between a comic book and a graphic novel (well, that and 15 bucks).Alright, the acting is stylized.  Big hairy deal.  It should be for this movie.  Clive Owen's American accent cracks me up, by the way.  Some of the actors pull off being evil characters a lot better than I thought they would, and some lend themselves to scummy parts naturally (ok, that was harsher than I meant it, Benicio).  As I said, Elijah Wood as Kevin was a big reason I saw it in the first place, and the creepiest thing about him is that, for crying out loud, it's the kid from ""Radio Flyer"" gone all Hannibal Lecter (except crazier & silent).  The women in the film aren't exactly the feminist ideal, but I doubt anyone would deny ""deadly little Miho's"" ability to make her point, or Rosario Dawson's ability to command respect.  Nick Stahl, um, looked better in ""Terminator 3,"" but in ""Sin City"" gives one of the most sickeningly twisted performances I'm sure he'll ever do.  I'm not a Bruce Willis fan, but he's good.  Mickey Rourke is incredible as Marv - just stinking incredible.Overall, I really liked this movie, but I'm not sure I could like, watch it every day or anything, just because I think it would warp my fragile little mind.  The R rating is there for a reason - or 70 - so watch out."	4.0	It ain't kid-friendly, that's for sure.	2005-07-12	0	0	0

It was very satisfying to see the extended scenes, but they should've let you choose between viewing the theatrical cut -OR- the extended/unrated version.  The special features were great to experience though, as you got to see more behind-the-scenes featurettes, along with Robert Rodriguez and his crew.

078886047X	Sin City	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	The film is all about style.  It is a comic book brought to life.At first I was intrigued.  The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point.  Blood is always red.  And so is lipstick.  Eyes are green or blue.  And there really is a yellow bastard.  The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into.  The special effects and style overshadowed everything.  And I was left wondering what all this was about.  I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense.  Finally I fell asleep.Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students.  It certainly is a departure from the norm.  But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest.

078886047X	Sin City	A1XK78VXIP8Q21	Liz Miller	Let me start by saying I'm not a huge Robert Rodriguez fan.  I've seen a number of his films.  I saw all three of his El Mariachi/Desperado/Once Upon a Time in Mexico trilogy, each time thinking, oh surely I'll like _this_ one.  But I never really was crazy about his stuff.  So when this came out, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it.  And I didn't.Then one night in a hotel room I saw a trailer for it.  And I changed my mind and immediately rented it.  It was visually incredible. It's like you could stop each and every frame of this movie and it would replicate a page from the graphic novel/comic book.  (No, I haven't read any of them, but you can just tell the artistry in framing everything.  It's stunning.)There are some down sides.  It's excruciatingly violent, so if you are offended by that, then obviously stay away.  In addition, I never felt particularly close to any of the characters so when violence happened to them, I didn't really feel anything.  (I am particularly thinking of the Carla Gugino character here.)  I'm not sure if that was deliberate or not, but I wish it had elicited something more from me emotionally.Mickey Rourke was incredible and almost unrecognizeable, but I thought Elijah Wood did a great and creepy job as well.My favorite Rodriguez movie ever.

The movie left a very strong impression on me, I must admit. If the crazy car chases and hyper-violent scenes are not enough for you, perhaps the incredibly faithful transcription from one medium to another that the story has gone through, in going from print to screen, will leave you as speechless as it left me.This reissue of the original theatrical version comes with a slightly alternate (unrated) version of the movie, which was recut and slightly extended in an attempt to make it even more like the original book. If you doubt that a movie can be faithful to a comic book (perhaps disappointed by earlier attempts in some Hollywood blockbusters), you will have a chance to follow the entire ""The Hard Goodbye"" story on the screen simultaneously with the included graphic novel... you will be amazed, I promise.As for extra material, there's plenty to wet the appetites of most fans of the genre, Rodriguez and Miller. From cuisine lessons (how to cook Breakfast Burritos) by Rodriguez; to an accelerated green screen version of the movie, where you can fully grasp the technical complexities in its shooting -not too far from how Episodes I, II and II were shot, mostly in the digital world-; there's something for everyone.

078886047X	Sin City	A1D2AXVN20OQZD	Marc A. Coignard	"Frank Miller's popular underground graphic novel is one of the most intense, dark, and dastardly comic books I've ever seen.  Along with David Lapham's Sray Bullets series, I can't think of a better example of dark underground comic book that is entirely necessary, and as dark and twisted as it should be.With that, I have to express my disgust with this so-called adaptation.  I say ""so-called"" because this film isn't really adapted as simply transfered, uncreatively, from one artistic medium to another.  Nothing is changed from the comic book, except there are less boobs.  Whereas the comic book is creative and artistic, the movie is one long cartoon that plays the same thing over and over again. Its predictable, the dialogue is corny (because as good as it may sound in your head reading off the page, hearing from actors attempting to make it sound serious is cliche, boring, and, again, corny).  The violence is cartoonish, at best, and with the exception of Mickey Rourke, I couldn't stand a single actor in this film, no matter how sexy she might be, or how believable as a tough guy he might be.  The plots are not to be questioned, but instead how they are arranged.  I think this movie could have been more watchable if the scenes between plots were intercut, instead of just showing one right after another.  Instead of waiting to see what happens next, I was just waiting for the ending.  When I first read the comic about 9 years ago, I thought they'd make a great series of film noir tales.  Instead of trying to do something creative, or re-visit the long overlooked genre of film noir, Rodriguez instead took the easy way out and decided to instead plaster Miller's material on to a film reel.  I don't care how many people die, or how cool it looks, this film is totally unnecessary.  If I wanted to watch a 2 hour comic book, I'd just go ahead and read the comic book."	2.0	Dangerously overhyped and unoriginal	2005-08-16	27	12	15

078886047X	Sin City	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	With some 600 reviews extant, I have no idea why I was sent a free copy of this to review, but I have to admit I'm genuinely happy that someone out there likes me.  The subject of this two-disk + graphic novel extravaganza is a film that dramatizes the Sin City graphic novel series written and drawn by Frank Miller.  Miller's storylines are archetypical noir set in a city where it is always night, and the darkest night at that.  People just plain don't come to good ends in Miller's work.The original release weaves four different Miller stores.  The Hard Goodbye is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-quite-borderline psychotic, who finds a moment of love only to have the woman killed as she sleeps next to him.  Revenge is slow in coming and not the least bit sweet.  Then there is a tale about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop who takes on a child killer and goes to prison for it.  Years later he gets to wrap up the grim loose ends.  The Big Fat Kill finds Dwight (Clive Owen) pitted against a crooked cop (Benicio del Toro) who doesn't know how to stay dead.  Next thing you know all the women of Old Town are in a war. And The Customer Is Always Right is a short that offers little explanation but somehow brings the story together.Robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.  Rather than remake Miller's artwork, he sets out to match it stroke for stroke.  This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.  Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.  Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.I prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.  The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.  In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.  The interviews, commentary, and other extras are quite good, though, so this is definitely the version to buy.	5.0	No Good Deed Goes Unpunished	2005-12-23	9	8	1
078886047X	Sin City	A3CLN2LRQYCFOR	"Margaret Martin ""khanyr"""	"I think that sin city is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  It has the pathetic capability to be looked at as a comedy like Starship Troopers, yet carries questionable scenes and voice over that make me wonder if the filmakers took themselves seriously.  Either way, the final product is a complete joke.  The style of the film is essentially the bones of the film.  It makes no difference, becuase there is no effort to make every shot flow into an actual piece of visual mastery.  Either the visual concept wasn't fluid, or the editing was done by an inbred fan of ""children of the Living Dead.  The acting was interesting, and basically terrible.  Clive Owen posessed the clever death tactic of drowning people in the toilet which realy wasn't as funny as it sounds because the charachters would force out their pathetic dialouge that touched on some form of phylisophical darkness posessed by pompus Eighth grade maralyn manson fans who cut their wrists and wear short sleaved slipnot t-shirts just to brag of their misery.I wanted to watch the car chase that was directed by Quentin Tarentino, but I had given up hope so I left.  My logic told me that a car chase, even if it was directed by quentin tarentino cannot save a movie posessing a chuck taylor-wearing villain who eat's people's souls.Even if Orson welles walked onto the set and redirected and stared in the whole rest of the movie, it probably wouldn't have done much good for the fate of this film.  I have decided that Hollywood is way too rich.  If it can blow millions of dollars on this complte atrocity of a film, I have lost all respect for the film industry."	1.0	a terrible sin	2005-06-11	50	7	43
078886047X	Sin City	A28R2Q0Y5D2AIA	Marie	"Rating: 3.5This was the first movie I had seen based on a graphic novel. The film is very different; a cross between the old Batman TV series and an adult rated Anime Cartoon (Jessica Alba in tight clothing is thrown in for an added bonus!).I know someone who reads graphic novels and he loved this film. My stand point is from that of someone unfamiliar with the genre. It seemed that the unique visual aspect of the movie overpowered the plot/storyline. The story line(s) can get a bit blurry at times and you are then flashed with a grand visual display. It was made to truly be a ""graphic"" novel for the big screen. I saw them movie twice and now still have a hard time remembering all the storylines. What stands out in my mind is how visually powerful the film was.If you're looking for a movie that is fast-paced, fun and at times racy (my husband truly enjoyed Jessica Alba's ""acting""), this film is for you. I did see V for Vendetta last week (this film was also based on a graphic novel) which visually could not compare to Sin City, but had a more of a true story line, was suspenseful, bold and even somewhat political and moral. Of the 2 movies I can say I enjoyed V more overall, but was glad I saw Sin City for its visual appeal."	3.0	A True Graphic Novel for the Big Screen	2006-03-23	1	1	0

Consider it film noir on steriods, the atmosphere is so darkly textural that there is a complete suspension of disbelief and emersion into the hard and cold world of Sin City.  Acting and casting was superb.  It holds considerable violence, buyer beware.  You can't have a dark story about corruption, prostitution, murder, revenge, and redemption without some graphic scenes, but they are still treated with incredible skill.  My advice is to read the books first, then marvel at the interpretation to the screen, but regardless, it's the best movie I've seen in many years.

078886047X	Sin City	A1Y87E22UVYCE6	"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi"""	"As a teenager I was very fond of comics, later my passion declined but I still pick up some classics as Harold Foster's ""Prince Valiant"", Hugo Pratt's ""Corto Maltes"" or the Argentinean Hector Oesterheld ""El Eternauta"" and enjoy them. So I'm not immune to this kind of products.One thing must be pointed out straightly: ""Sin City"" it is a violent and dreadful film only apt to be seen by adult audiences.  I suspend ethical judgment and take it as it is: a dark fantasy full of sadomasochist imagery, with all the id monsters running free.I was truly amazed by this movie: it is a Pulp Comic Book thrown UNCHANGED to the screen. There are perfect details: the glasses of the psycho Kevin always shining, the white blood, the silhouettes all black or white, the nude & gorgeous girls, the unbelievable gore, the amazing prowess of Marv & Hartigan, the one-dimensional ethical code of some characters and the list is goes on and on.IMO this is not an adaptation of a comic it IS the comic expressed with another language!The story is a transcription of three Frank Miller's graphic books: ""The Hard Goodbye"", ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""The Yellow Bastard"" that are loosely related having The City as a common graphic and moody background.The ""heroes"" are as brutal, bloodthirsty and revengeful as the ""bad guys"" with the possible exception of Hartigan (nearer to be a Dirty Harry). Nevertheless deep inside them there is a spark of goodness and nobility that make some distinction possible.The dames are a special condiment: almost all of them (un)dressed in sexy exotic lingerie; showing different styles are not less ruthless and dangerous than men.The whole cast seems to enjoy their own performances giving a ""plus"" hardly seen lately. It is most notably in Mickey Rourke impersonation of Marv. Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen are top. Rutger Hauer gives almost a cameo as the Cardinal. Elijah Wood as the cannibalistic psycho is creepy beyond believe.Jessica Alba is very sensual as the teen-striper; Devon Aoki is a wordless icon with her shining sword, Jaime King is Marv's goddess duplicated and a long list continues.I give this product big thumb up!

Well I borrowed it from a friend and finally watched it. Let me say, I was not disappointed. The movie told a interweaving story of three or four characters...and it was very engrossing. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because of all the narration, it was alright but could have delt with a little less of it.

I watched Sin City last night and I think  that it is one of the more violent trash-movies I've ever seen. Violence is always a bad thing but in this case is senseless and really stupid. Americans should realize that this country is one of the more violent in the world. People kills each other sometimes only for the pleasure of killing (think about the sniper in the Washington DC area 3 years ago) One of the reasons for this is what we see in the movies. And this movie is an example of that. Frank Miller is a mental-illed guy and his stories should be avoided at any cost.

078886047X	Sin City	A17LSEN4UY4XZQ	M. Daneker	First of all, I give the film 5 stars, that said, the blu-ray is only worth 3.Why? Because the best way to veiw the film is as a film, not as 4 short films. Yes, it's great to be able to veiw both ways, but, why is the additional footage not in the feature-legnth cut? The extended version is not a complete film, it's each story re-edited to separate short-stories. It's not the same tension or experience as the theatrical cut, which would be improved by the added footage.Now the blu-ray quality is there, the film's AVC @ 22.mbps average, and the DTS MA is nice though I have yet to grasp why DTS MA is 24/48 and not 24/96 (truely thunderous audio!) Still, it's a visual feast, an excellent film.

Based on a comic novel, it keeps the depthless surface of its source and used the original material as a storyboard. Miller did the comic, and his codirection credit was a nod to his originality, because the credits say Rodriguez ""shot and cut"" the film (i.e., he directed it). The post-noir pornoviolent excess has been likened to ""Pulp Fiction"" by Quentin Tarantino, who ""guest directed"" one sequence (Rodriguez is his protege; parts of this could be called ""Kill Bill Three""). Its source might be better dated back to Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), if that film had stayed with strictly storyboarded visuals, drained the Beethoven and color, and stayed with just the pornoviolence. A triptych of three episodes set in the same dystopian alternate world, the film follows the fatalistic misadventures of three antiheroes played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke (who got the best reviews), and Clive Owen. Of the three, I liked Owen the best: he had the spaced out look of a comic character, and registered not a single thought behind his eyes. As for whether it's worth seeing, you'll have to decide whether the film's vile, scummy view of humanity is a worthy tradeoff for the startling look at a bizarrely original world."	3.0	Not your ordinary exploitation film	2005-12-11	18	6	12

I loved this movie, it was like a dream come true for me, being such a huge fan of the comic and the author to see him come together with my favorite director, Robert Rodriguez.  The film turned out great, was totally faithful to the point that it LOOKS like the comic book.  Its just a great movie, i'll leave it at that.That much said, the DVD is weak.  There is one special feature, and there is nothing special about it.  Its like a 10 minute (if that) junket that pretty much only serves to advertise the movie.  Weak sauce.  There are three incredibly cool and creative people involved with making this movie, plus this movie is shot and put together in such a cool way, its a disservice NOT to have special features about the making of this movie.  Besides that they could also have features about the comic book, etc...Even if they didnt do that much... aside from ""The Faculty"" what Robert Rodriguez DVD has not come with ""Ten Minute Film School"" and a commentary track?!?!? None that I can think of....  So i was pretty let down.Anway, you have to get the DVD if you want to watch the cool movie at home, but i would hope that there is a better version on its way."	2.0	Great Movie, lame DVD	2005-08-19	6	3	3
078886047X	Sin City	AT393OR1JTYNR	Miami Nights	I already know that most people are not going to like this review because it's considered hip and cool to like this film, but it's all visual flair and style, with little substance, depth or reason to care for the characters. And, unfortunately, it's about 40 percent too long. If whittled down to just two chapters, it would have been great popcorn entertainment, a heck of a violent ride from beginning to end.On a side note, just because people express negative opinions about a post, that doesn't mean the opinion isn't valid, rather, it can often mean that the people disliking an honest critique of a movie are simpletons far too easily amused.But back to the movie, the chapters with Mickey O'Rourke and Bruce Willis are great. But the one with Clive Owen goes on far too long, with too many pseudo endings. And the opening and closing act suffers because Josh Hartnett comes off as the clothing model that he was -- all surface, no depth. He's more wooden than Hayden Christensen's performance as Mannequin Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars prequels.An interesting study in how to make a movie look and feel like a comic book come to life, but some emotional depth and resonance would have given these chapters some depth, and make us care for what happens to the characters. But as it is, it's just cheap laughs and a big-budget exercise in style over substance. Sure, your friends might think you hip and cool for going along with the crowd and singing the praises of Sin City, but honesty will make you more original and an independent thinker, free of the simplistic views of most of your peers.Yes, the simplistic kind of thinking (or non-thinking) that will have people saying my review, and others that are critical of this movie, are bad ones.	2.0	All visual flair, little substance or depth	2005-11-30	33	8	25
078886047X	Sin City	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	The director took a little bit of Pulp Fiction and combined it with some of the gore of Kill Bill to come up with this highly entertaining film.  It is like a dark comic book come to life, shot in black in white, with color only used when the director was emphasizing something.The main actors Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis are all excellent in different ways.  All three are protectors of the women and act as dark knights to save them.  Additionally, Josh Harnett seems to be floating about as someone who murders troubled women.The special effects are wild, the violance graphic and the women are very hot!  Don't look for realism in this film because you won't find it.  It is more like a dark fantasy where guys can get shot a hundred times, get hit by cars, jump off buildings and keep coming.  Highly Entertaining and well worth watching on DVD because you can rewind things that you couldn't believe that you saw!	5.0	Highly Entertaining!!	2005-11-27	5	2	3
078886047X	Sin City	A82LIVYSX6WZ9	Michael Bolts	"Opens up with a rooftop scene with a man and a woman...Josh Hartnett (Wicker Park) who plays a assassin and Marley Shelton (Valentine) who he kills. Then we get into more and more gritty, bloody, brutal and knockout hardcore stuff with 3 intermingling stories. Goes to Hartigan,played by a always rock solid Bruce Willis (Hostage), who rescues an 11 year old girl from the hands of a rapist, played by Nick Stahl (Bully) but Hartigan ends up on the recieveing end of a bunch of bullets landing him in the hospital. The first has Mickey Rourke(Once Upon A Time In Mexico) in a very very good comeback peformance as Marv who's love Goldie, played by Jaime King (Pearl Harbor) was killed by a silent assassin/cannibalistic psycho named Kevin, played with silent creepiness by Elijah Wood (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). Marv finds out that Goldie has a twin sister named Wendy, also played by Jaime King. So, Marv goes on a brutal killing spree in which he slices and dices everyone who gets in his path and ends up in a showdown with Kevin Boy. The electric chair scene was crazy!! Next up we follow shiny red converse wearing Dwight, played by a dynamic Clive Owen (Closer) who gets involved with a waitress named Shelly, played by Brittany Murphy (Little Black Book) and the corrupy cop named Jackie Boy, played by a insanely terrific Benicio Del Toro (The Way Of The Gun). Jackie Boy and his goons all get killed by some vicious hookers, led by Gail, a juicy Rosario Dawson (Alexander). They figure out that they killed a corrupt cop. My favorite scene in this whole movie would have to be when Dwight (Owen) is driving with a dead Jackie Boy (Del Toro)in the passenger seat and suddenly Jackie Boy starts to talk to him. The scene flips from different colors and that's the scene in which Quentin Tarantino special guest directed. Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) and gang kidnap Gail (Dawson) for the head of Jackie Boy and it ends up in a major bloodbath. The last one is the rest of Hartigan's (Willis') story where he goes to jail for something he didnt do and when he is let go he goes in search of a fully grown up Nancy Callahan, played by the delicious Jessica Alba (Honey) and he has to save her from the treacherous clutches of The Yellow Bastard who was the rapist (Nick Stahl) in which he saved little Nancy from before and Willis ""litterally"" punches The Yellow Bastard's brains in and rips off his other head as well. Josh Hartnett is also at the end, like in the beginning, playing the same man/assassin as he appears in an elevator with hooker Becky, played by Alexis Bleidel (Gilmore Girls). Also starring Michael Madsen (Kill Bill 1 and 2), Devon Aoki (D.E.B.S.), Nicky Katt (Suburbia), Powers Boothe (Frailty), Rutger Hauer (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Carla Gugino (Spy Kids Trilogy) and Frank Miller himself is in this...he's the preist whom Marv (Rourke) kills.

The movie looks unlike anything I have ever seen.  I will preface the rest of the review this, I am not familiar with Frank Miller's stories.  I cannot imagine that the movie watcher has to have any familiarity with the content, but I have not.  I usually love movies like this, like Pulp Fiction.  However, I just could not get into this movie at all.I was not put off by the non-ending violence, but what is the point?  The characters are stale and there is not one person in the movie worthy of emotional investment.  The movie plays like a visually stunning gore filled yawn.  After the two hours were over I did not care one way or the other about the characters.  I am sure there will be more tales from Sin City, but unless there is more character development, I think I will pass.	3.0	Apathy City	2005-11-22	14	6	8

078886047X	Sin City	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"I became a fan of Frank Miller's work the day I opened the pages of ""The Dark Knight Returns.""  Miller took the comic world by storm with his writing style.  His characters narrated panels instead of using thought bubbles. They were old, tired adults, not perky superheroes.  In Miller's hands, Batman became a weary war veteran desperately looking for a way to end his career without killing himself, Commissioner Gordon worried about his wife, and bad guys were Neo-Nazi naked monstrosities, all teeth and fangs.  It was a turning point for comics, transforming them into entertainment for adults, and the medium has never looked back since.  It was a turning point for my own writing as well; my stories from that point on took on a completely different feel, all inspired by Miller.Sin City is what happens when Miller is free to do what he wants.  He's a film noir fan at heart and Sin City is every bit an anachronistic blend of comic book action and pulpy dialogue. Fan of film noir will find all the iconic characters in Sin City: the weary integrity of a private eye, the pathos of a gangster past his prime, the desperation of a man wrongly accused of murder, the rage of a psychopath, and of course the femme fatale.Film noir is also about narration.  We hear the characters' thoughts and understand just how desperate and lonely they are.  By knowing our protagonists' minds, we can appreciate their paranoia and hopelessness.  And in film noir, the world is out to get everybody.  There are no good guys; indeed, often the authority figures that would be considered ""good"" (police officers, priests) are evil and the people deemed least ethical (prostitutes, murderers) are the heroes. Ultimately, whatever innocence any of the characters has is lost.  Sin City (short for Basin City, the very bottom of civilization) covers the entire spectrum.Sin City is actually three mini-movies combined, all taking place at approximately the same time.  The plots are from the graphic novels: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and The Big Fat Kill, with the short story threads The Customer is Always Right and Babe Wore Red thrown in for good measure.The first and last scenes of the movie perfectly capture the tone of film noir: a beautiful girl and a mysterious dark-haired man meet somewhere.  We don't know the circumstances that brought them together but can feel the tension between them.  They act like lovers even though they've only just met.  But it can only end in blood.In The Hard Goodbye thread, Marv (Mickey Rourke), a giant monster of a man sleeps with the woman of his dreams, Goldie (Jaime King).  He awakens only to find her dead.  Marv's not good for much, but he's good at killing, so he gets revenge the only way he knows how: by punching people until they squeal. Eventually, Marv discovers a serial killer who has a taste for ladies of the night.  When the two finally meet, we learn that Marv can be just as depraved when he's out for revenge.No, seriously, it's probably one of the grossest things I've seen in movies in awhile.In The Big Fat Kill, Dwight (Clive Owen) is the new boyfriend of strip club waitress Shelley (Brittany Murphy).  Unfortunately, Shelley has an old boyfriend named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a bad guy who likes to beat up women.  Dwight is determined to stop Jackie Boy from killing anyone else, only to trail him to Dwight's own ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Towne Girls.  The Old Towne Girls are prostitutes who run their own part of town.  There are no pimps, no dirty cops, and no mob.  Indeed, their part of town almost seems like some kind of nirvana for ladies of the night.  And of course, they all dress in extremely kinky outfits when they're not brandishing katanas, wicked-looking knives, throwing stars shaped like swastikas, or Uzis.  But Jackie Boy isn't who he seems and it's up to Dwight, Gail, and Miho (Devon Aoki) to keep a head (yes, I said HEAD) safe before a turf war explodes onto the streets.In That Yellow Bastard, another serial rapist (Rourk Jr., played by Nick Stahl) and son of a senator (Powers Boothe) is the one remaining loose end that good cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) can't put behind him.  On his last day of retirement, Hartigan decides to go after the untouchable Rourk Jr. and save Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), only to end up in prison for eight years for a crime he didn't commit.  We catch up with Hartigan later in the movie when he gets out of prison and discovers that the more things change, the more they remain the same.Except for Nancy, who in eight years grows up to be a major hottie, an attribute not unnoticed by poor, tortured Hartigan.There are too many villains to list here, but they are all memorable even in their few moments of screen time.  Three notable examples are the hilarious muttering of a lackey with an arrow sticking out of his chest, the elucidating thug who pronounces his every thought out loud Chandler Bing-style, and the hired mercenary who moved from bullets to explosives because, ""you just can't go back to shooting people when you've seen a pub blow up and all the parts fly out.""By staying true to the original characters, the director (Robert Rodriguez) creates an entirely new film genre.  It makes better use of digital effects first showcased in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and yet never forgets its comic roots.  The action pedigree is most evident in Marv, an unstoppable juggernaut who smashes through doors, bounces off of speeding cars, and rips people apart with his bare hands...a few bandages and pills later and he's fine.  Good guys and bad guys alike get shot so full of lead that they should be pencils, only to recover in the next scene. The men are all really nasty lugs and the women are all gorgeous and toned.The movie is filmed in all black and white, with splashes of color for good measure.  This achieves two amazing effects: it nails the feel of film noir and draws the viewer's eyes to important things about characters that might otherwise be missed.  For example, Dwight wears red sneakers, symbolic of having at least one foot dipped in blood from his murderous past.  The use of color, especially Yellow Bastard's...well, yellowishness, makes the character all the more disgusting. Color, when it appears, is as much a character as any actor on screen.The actors are suitably restrained.  If Sin City has a flaw, it's that it's too true to its roots at times, which might alienate modern audiences. Some of the characters have eye-rolling dialogue, but then, that's part of the mood of Sin City.  It's not meant to be realistic or even hip.  Sin City is true to itself, and it's up to the audience if they want to go along for the ride.This is the same kind of uncompromising vision that Peter Jackson brought to the screen with Lord of the Rings.  By deeply respecting the original creator's work, he shattered the preconceived notions of what a movie should be and conjures something we've never seen before.  I was skeptical about a comic book, even Miller's books, being turned into a new format, but Rodriguez did it and he did it with style.Sin City is dark, violent, and even sadistic at times. But most importantly, it has Frodo (Elijah Wood) as a hopping cannibal.  After seeing this film, I will never think of him as a cuddly little hobbit again."	5.0	Frodo Gone Bad	2005-04-03	5	4	1
078886047X	Sin City	A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ	Michael K. Smith	"This is an uncompromising and equally graphic adaptation (Rodriguez called it a ""translation"") of Frank Miller's series of vivid graphic novels, filled with thoroughly noir images and over-the-top comic book dialogue (some of which reminded me of HEAVY METAL in the old days), shot mostly in black-and-white with color overlays where they serve a purpose (i.e., Junior and blood in general, except when the blood is white). The story lines used were ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard,""as well as the short piece ""The Customer is Always Right"" -- and the story titles all appear in the dialogue. Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable as the bloody-minded warrior-god Marv, Clive Owen is terrific as the good-guy-bad-guy Dwight, Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the cannibal-ninja Kevin, and Bernicio Del Toro makes a good Jackie Boy, especially as the dead body version. Bruce Willis does a very good job playing a Bruce Willis character, in this case a vengeful cop. Jessica Alba is always extremely watchable, though her acting this time isn't very impressive. (The only one they missed getting for this film, who really belonged in it, was Christopher Walken.) And Rodriguez is obviously a major fan of Miller's work. There's also a lot of Tarantino-esque recursion in the plot line (not to mention that the character of Miho is straight out the Crazy-88 in _Kill Bill_, and so are her weapons), reminiscent of _Pulp Fiction_: The beginning isn't necessarily the beginning, nor is the end the end. Of course, there's a _Sin City 2_ coming, and then _Sin City 3_. I'm pleased to say this is a film your parents (or, in my case, my wife) will hate, with no redeeming social values whatever."	5.0	My name's Nixon. I'm a tax collector.	2006-02-13	3	2	1

078886047X	Sin City	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	No one, it would seem, has worked as hard or received more satisfaction and dedication out of his work within the movie industry then Robert Rodriguez. Starting off with a seven thousand dollar budget and a camera in hand, El Mariachi sparked the career of one of the most imaginative and sought after directors of our generation. He has not only taken up the responsibility of directing and writing the script for each of his films, but he has also acted as the composer, visual supervisor, editor, producer, production designer, and sound editor for several of them as well. Furthermore, not a single one of his films, including the visually complex and celebrity laden Sin City, was made for more then forty-million dollars, virtually unheard of in the modern Hollywood environment of one-hundred million dollars being the average price for a tent-pole project. Truly, Robert Rodriguez is a rogue of the film industry and his audience would not have it any other way.The story for Sin City not only meticulously blends seemingly individual plotlines together into a single cohesive feature film, but it also resonates the very characteristics that have made the film-noir genre so enticing and appealing to movie-goers over the years. More importantly, the script emphasizes a sad truth of life, which is that certain circumstances require morally corrupt individuals to put a stop to even more morally corrupt individuals from doing harm onto others. Sadly, unlike Superman and Spider-Man, not all comic-book heroes are as ethically heroic as would be believed. The only visible complexities within the script were the transition of one story arch to the next, which should have transferred more smoothly then it did, and the lack of connection in terms of intertwining characters and subplots between the three stories. It could have been more compelling and interesting had Rodriguez and Miller found a way to better blend the three separate storylines together, integrating several of the characters into blended scenes, more then the mere glimpse we receive of Marv in the bar that Hartigan steps into to search for Nancy, but it works fine enough as it stands.In spite of his appearance in numerous television productions since 1989, only in the last few years has British performer Clive Owen received recognition in Hollywood having been offered the leading role in the Jerry Bruckheimer production, King Arthur, and his Academy Award-nominated performance in Closer. Owen truly accentuates the role of Dwight, a rogue out to stop Jack Rafferty, performed by Benicio Del Toro, from harming the hookers of Old Towne, and his somber voice-over narration of the events depicted, typical of the film-noir genre, adds to the entertainment value. Del Toro's Jack Rafferty is the type of character which the audience would care to have a little more background information on in order to firmly grasp the concept of what is taking place in several scenes, but perhaps that is too much involvement then is required for some people.Mickey Rourke, a name of whom few within the current generation of young adult movie-goers would recall hearing before, has been long overdue for a comeback performance, appearing in The Rainmaker and The Thin Red Line, and he more then makes up for the string of commercial failures on his resume in the role of Marv. Observing his magnetic performance onscreen, it was as if Frank Miller, creator of the Sin City graphic comic series, created the figure of Marv specifically for Mickey Rourke, it is that comprehensive and enthralling. Though not the fault of the scriptwriting team, Jaimie King receives the short end of the performance stick in the role of Goldie given as how she dies within the first few minutes we see of her and even when she returns as Wendy, Goldie's twin sister, she doesn't do much beyond a few scenes with Rourke. And who better to fill the role of the silent and deadly cannibalistic assassin, Kevin, a young psychopath enlisted by the corrupt governmental structure of Sin City to kill off Goldie and pin the crime on Marv, then Elijah Wood? Was there honestly no one else within the same height structure as Wood that would have served as effectively in this role as he did? This is not meant to discredit his performance by any means. On the contrary, Wood turns what could have easily been an unintentionally derisive character into one of the most enigmatical and haunting figures in the film. The problem lies in the fact that when the audience sees Wood they automatically recall his performance as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Ring trilogy and the effect his character is suppose to have on them goes down a slight notch or two because of this.Jessica Alba, better known for her involvement in the short-lived James Cameron television series, Dark Angel, on Fox, is stunning to say the least about her in the role of Nancy Callahan, the young potential rape victim who grows up to be a strong-willed exotic dancer. And while it is still a little early to make a judgment call as to whether she will have a longstanding career in the film industry seeing as how her role is limited to the `damsel in distress' caricature familiar to the film-noir genre, her performance holds up quite well opposite veteran actor Bruce Willis. Willis plays up the role of John Hartigan, quite possibly the only honest cop in the Sin City police force, with gusto, as he had done in such other gritty dramas as Pulp Fiction and Twelve Monkeys. It was fascinating to see the relationship which existed between Nancy Callahan and John Hartigan develop into a chivalrous `knight on a white horse riding to the rescue of his fair maiden in distress' love affair onscreen. And though this will certainly receive some negative feed back from some audience members, this in a way represents a double-standard in our society. Headlined prominently in such risqu&eacute; comedies as Sex in the City as well as in those insufferable tabloid newsmagazines, Mr. Willis being one of their more recent targets, is the belief that older women chasing after young men for sexual pleasure is perfectly acceptable while relationships which exist between older men and younger women is repulsive and depraved. Though this type of behavior may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea, there is certainly nothing morally objectionable to it given that it is for a loving relationship and not merely sexual intimacy alone and our society must comes to terms with this fact. Sure, it would have been nice for Rodriguez or Miller to have provided the audience with a bit more information concerning the previous sexual attacks made by Junior against young little girls in order to receive a better idea on the type of character that is being dealt with, but it is understandable enough that it is not required. In any event, Nick Stahl gives a decent, if not limited, performance in the role of the senator's son, eventually evolving into the monster known as the Yellow Bastard. Unfortunately, this thus mentioned character leaves several questions unanswered. Why did he become yellow? What is the cause of this horrible smell emulating from the bastard which is repeatedly mentioned by either Hartigan or others? Yes, these are minor, if not trivial, matters but when it comes to a feature this imaginative, nitpicking is going to be a result.Overall, in spite of its failure to emphasize a canonical point within its script, Sin City is nonetheless nothing short of visually arresting entertainment in the best sense of the word and serves as one of the more innovative feature film projects to crawl out of the works in recent years. Truly stunning in terms of its scope, direction, and graphic style, which is balanced out thanks to the exceptionally amplified performances of its cast members and the pertinent dialogue throughout the two-hour movie. As marveling as this presentation turned out to be, it should be noted that there were some, albeit trivial in respects, minor complaints to be made. Rodriguez and Miller had a captivating concept going when Marv discussed through narration how he was confused within his mind as to whether the actions he was taking were that of a justifiable avenger of his lover's death or merely the aspirations of a psychopathic killer everyone said he would be come to life, but instead is only focused on briefly before being lost in the shuffle. It would have been interesting to see what may have developed had this been expanded on in the script. And though the violence featured in Sin City is meant to be comical in nature, visualize it alone the lines as the fight sequences seen in Kill Bill Vol. 1, and not to be taken seriously, there were particular scenes in which it was too over the top to be taken seriously. For example, the scene in which Benicio Del Toro's Jack Rafferty had not only his hand cut off but also has his gun backfire into his forehead and has his head cut `like a Pez dispenser', went a little too far it seems and should have been cut down more cleanly. There is no problem with violence being featured prominently in live-action adult movies, but should it merely be violence for the sake of being violence, it doesn't make sense for the film to bite off more then it can chew. Still, the black and white visual quality of the film spliced with hints of iridescence, the scintillating reverberation of rain in the dark night of the back alleys, passionate and harrowing tales of chivalrous love affairs, and plenty of vital fluids and savagery to satisfy even the most hardcore of Taratino fanatics, are reasons enough to resurrect the hopes of movie-goers disillusioned over the years by the stale and unoriginal presentations and hoard them back to the local Cineplex in droves.	4.0	The Moose Hole - 'Sin'fully Addictive	2005-04-02	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""Sin City"" is a live-action graphic novel that adapts 3 of Frank Miller's books for the big screen: ""The Hard Goodbye"",""That Yellow Bastard"", and ""The Big Fat Kill"". Actors were shot against a green screen, and all of their environment is computer generated imagery. The result is a fairly accurate representation of Frank Miller's graphic style, judging by the little I have seen of it. The film is high-contrast black and white with splashes of color. The visual style might be described as a caricature of classic film noir's low-key lighting. The story takes place mostly at night, often on shiny, rain-soaked streets. There is a stunning lack of detail and depth of field, which I found too simplistic for the big screen, but it resembles drawings on the 2-dimensional pages of a book. In fact, the entire film is a caricature of classic film noir, although Frank Miller and co-director/editor Robert Rodriguez are lesser visual stylists and bigger romantics than the artists of classic film noir.We are presented with three stories whose single common element is a bar called ""Kadie's"". Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) has tracked an 11-year old kidnap victim to a city warehouse, where she is in the clutches of a perverse murderer (Nick Stahl) with powerful political connections. Hartigan can outwit and outgun the murderer, but defeating the corruption behind him will prove more resilient. Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a psychotic, intensely violent ex-con. When his girlfriend Goldie (Jaime King) is murdered, his search for her killer leads him to the dungeon of cannibal-murderer Kevin (Elijah Wood) and up the chain of corruption. Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a barmaid at Kadie's, is trying to get rid of her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie (Benicio Del Toro) in favor of the better-mannered Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight follows Jackie into ""Old Town"", a red light district ruled by the prostitutes who live and work there, with the intention of ridding  the world of Jackie's menace. But the ladies, led by Gail (Rosario Dawson), have Jackie in their sights as well.""Sin City"" is the second feature film to place actors in an entirely computer-generated environment, and it suffers from many of the same limitations as 2004's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"": one-dimensional characters and visual tedium. Like ""Sky Captain"", ""Sin City"" is fascinating to look at for about 10 minutes. After that it's dull, dull, dull. I was intrigued by the idea of CGI films for a while, but, having seen 2 of them at this point, I have to say that they cannot create anything close to the visual interest of photography. ""Sin City"" is essentially an animated film, and it's not a very good one. The characters are one-dimensional and thoroughly unengaging. They all have the same personality, and they all do the same thing. The droning of incessant voice-over narration is so grating that I found myself tuning it out. The project might have fared better as 3 short films, which would break up the visual and narrative monotony.On the bright side, if you want to see Frank Miller's work brought to life ""Sin City"" does that -more literally than for its own good. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, as exotic dancer Nancy, generate some real charisma. But they are the only actors who do. These characters and storylines are not nearly sophisticated enough for a feature film, and neither is the CGI. ""Sin City"" is one of those rare films that had me looking at the clock every 10 minutes. I was profoundly bored. Watching the film has all the excitement of watching someone else play a computer game. You might have better luck if you consider it a live-action graphic novel instead of an actual film. Robert Rodriguez said, ""I didn't want to make Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City'. I wanted to make Frank Miller's 'Sin City'."" And so he did. The trouble is that Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" is not cinematic. Note that the film is ultra-violent and not for the squeamish.The DVD (Dimension 2005): The single bonus feature is a ""Behind the Scenes"" (8 1/2 minutes), which features interviews with Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, ""guest director"" Quentin Tarantino, and some members of the cast. They talk about the vision behind the film, but there is no discussion of technical details. Odd that we don't get more bonus features on a Robert Rodriguez film, but there it is. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish. Captioning available in English. Dubbing available in French."	3.0	Live-Action Graphic Novel, but Dull, Monotonous Movie.	2005-08-19	5	3	2

078886047X	Sin City	A2U3Y3V8MVWQVM	M. Ivey	First time I saw this movie, I didn't like or respect it much at all. I think for these types of noir, graphic-novel films, you need to be in a certain mindset. You need to think like you're watching a comic unfold, forgetting about reality for a few hours. If you do, this movie is AWESOME. Marv is a badass and was the best part of the film; the separate stories are all amazing on their own, let alone throwing them all together in a single film. I was worried that having so many stories of equal importance would prove to be a letdown by at least one of them, but that wasn't the case at all. You pretty much regret that each one has to end. Everything about the film -- cast, directing, writing, over-the-top-action, set, etc. -- are all perfect. Unlike the conventional favorites critics go nuts for -- Les Mis comes to mind, and subsequently makes me throw up -- this is a TRUE masterpiece.	5.0	One of the best	2013-08-21	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	A3NCIN6TNL0MGA	"M. JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge"""	Flexing its muscles in every explosive scene, Sin City is comprised of three stories, all centered on similar motif of the hero saving the damsel, in this hyper-realistic, other-worldly film, which I promise, with its intense imagery and in-your-face assured direction, will be unlike any movie journey you've ever taken. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen all do terrific jobs as embattled heroes living in a nihilistic, sex-obsessed metropolis where violence rules the day the way it did back in the cowboy era. Indeed, the film has many qualities of a good western. Similar to the western genre, Sin City takes a look, often sardonic, of masculinity, the way it becomes exaggerated in such a world of chaos and danger. Mickey Rourke, with made-up commando chin and hawk nose, is the greatest send-up of hyper-masculinity I've ever seen. The plots, which center on evil officials, sociopathic killers, and damsels in distress, are familiar, but the film miracuously creates a world you've never stepped into before, succeeding grandly in recreating the seedy, imaginary dream-fest of the graphic comic novels written by Frank Miller.There is concern for some viewers about the violence and I am no fan of graphic brutality. While I'll concede that the blood flows freely in this film, the violence is so stylized that even someone like myself could handle it. Finally, let me add that the film has an ironic, campy feel that mitigates the violent impact somewhat.Is the film about anything other than the director's assured style as he captures the gritty world of a graphic comic novel? I say a resounding yes. The film does stand for a certain kind of courage and integrity that survives in a world of corruption, lies, and nihilism. The heroes and victims are at their core tender, soulful archetypes and not just stick figures.I think though that what stand out in the end is the original style, so assured and consistent throughout. This is a landmark film and I would bet that it will pave the way for a new age of graphic novels adapted to film.	5.0	Assured Style Wins the Day	2005-04-02	10	5	5

078886047X	Sin City	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"""Sin City"" is a brutal and violent film.  It's a noirish look at a sprawling Metropolis, rampant with corruption, greed, gore and sex.  Just try and resist it.  Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) fuses the blunt brutality with a bold and breathtaking style, propelling the story through three loosely related subplots, connected mainly through their shared theme of the exploration of the dark and feral side of humanity.  ""Sin City"" grabs you by the throat and rarely loosens its' grip for the next two hours.  If its' a story about a hulking murderer (a mesmirizing Mikey Rourke) on a rampage to avenge the women who showed him a moment of kindness, you're engrossed.  If its' a story of a loner (Clive Owen) looking to help a gang of violent prostitutes from the mob, you're hooked.  If its' a story of a beaten down cop (Bruce Willis) looking to prtect a young woman (Jessica Alba) from a depraved and deformed sexual deviant, you're glued to the screen.  Rodriguez wisely chose to frame the films' visual style around Millers' original drawings and kept Millers' pulpy dialouge intact, which exposes the stories' wounded heart better than any screenwriter could have done.  And even though the film sometimes gets bogged down in its' own visual inventiveness, you will be floored again and again."	4.0	A Faithful and Bloody Vision of the Comics	2005-08-22	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	A3B2P9JBRAUMGU	M. M. Green	While there are 3 stories going on in this interesting looking movie, the one that makes this movie worth watching again and again is the Big Fat Kill! Mickey Rourke plays Marv a hard-hitting, gritty fighter ready to kill his way to the answer. No bull logic for Marv, he's all about fists and beat downs. He meets a beautiful woman (prostitute) who treats him like a decent human despite his horrid looks. While he's having a good time with her, he wakes up the next day and finds that she's been murdered right next to him. Marv goes berserk against the cops, hoodlums, everyone! He keeps remembering that she was the one person who treated him decent and now it was time to pay back the lowlife that took her life.Marv goes to the edge of the gutter and beyond to find the answers. He makes some funny revelations along the way that will have you laughing your socks off.  Be warned though, it gets disturbingly, graphic in the scenes with Elijah Wood as Kevin a catlike killer. As if Elijah Wood wasn't weird enough, we see him really do a number on Marv but the revenge Marv takes on him may be a little too much for most people to bear. I'm telling you all, there's a scene with Marv and Kevin that's the most horridly disgusting scene in the entire movie. The other stories are really intriguing as well as managing to bring all the stories to a nice logical ending. Karma is at work throughout this movie so don't worry, everyone will get what they deserve except maybe poor Marv.Sin City is definitely following the comic book making sure to try and hold up the comic book look. It is one of the few unique looking movies that have several well-known stars in it. I figured with all the big names in the movie it would be a flop because usually star powered movies are bad. However, Sin City is not one of them. If you are looking for some classic action, gun-toting characters, and an all around unique experience take a look at Sin City. Make sure to take note of the Big Fat Kill!!!!!	5.0	Mickey Rourke got the Big Fat Kill!!!!!	2005-10-01	1	0	1
078886047X	Sin City	A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C	M. Newton	"This film's over the top violence reminded me of ""Natural Born Killers"", but this film was infinitely better directed and had a much better story line.  I can certainly see how many people can love this film and find it terribly exciting.  I can likewise see how others will rate the film 1 star, based on the fact that the three interesting stories may soon be forgotten but that the graphic, horrible images may stick around for much longer.I don't think it can be overstated that this film is not for children.  In fact, anyone who would let someone under 12 watch this should literally be charged with child abuse.  The director appears to revel in graphic human torture; even the ""heroes"" in the story prefer torture to accomplishing a mission (or maybe torturing an adversary IS the mission).  This is the kind of film, even more than the name implies, is about the dark side of mankind.  Some will say that some characters are heroic, but even Bruce Willis brings much pain to the world by not finishing off a killer, prefering instead to torture him.  The writer really went after police and the clergy, ranking them well below prostitutes who tend to have a heart of gold.All that aside, the story lines are good and the film is extremely creative and well made.  Given the level of violence, I would normally turn a film like this off, but this film's creativity, storylines, and film quality keep me watching.  It was an enjoyable film, but I didn't think it was great.One of the attractions of the film was the all star cast.  Here's how the actors fared:Bruce Willis - Great job.  He IS his character. Wow. A+Benicio Del Toro - Also excellent.  A+ performance as expected from someone of his caliber.Micky Rourke - The most overated actor in Hollywood finally hits a Home Run. - A+.Clive Owen - Shows much more here than in ""Closer"" - AJessica Alba - Although very attrative, doesn't bring more than looks to the film. B-Elijah Wood - I keep looking for Gandalf when he was on screen - C, but not really his fault.Brittany Murphy - Better than expected performance - B+Rosario Dawson - Miscast in her role - CNick Stahl - He fits his character - AThe others, such as Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, and Josh Hartnett do well in their brief performances.  Devon Aoki gets noticed.Overall, this film is not for everyone, but if you're not too offended by wallowing in violence and discussions of raping and torturing children, you'll probably find you enjoy the film and possibly even love it.  Although there is a lot of violence, there is also a lot to like about the film."	3.0	"What ""Natural Born Killers"" tried to be"	2005-09-16	3	2	1

078886047X	Sin City	A2FS6OGMZMALTD	Mojo Jojo	"All right, let me say right off the bat I'm not a fan of ""dark"" fiction.  I always find it both silly and a little predictable.  So if you like that dark stuff, go ahead and add a star to this review.  Maybe two.  As for me, it just didn't mesh together well.WHAT I LIKED:  Marv, the psychotic maniac with a heart of gold.  His character, indeed his whole first story, made the film for me.  Truly an original character, Marv is struggling with mental illness.  He is ruthless, bereft of compassion for anyone that gets in his way.  At the same time, he's actually a pretty decent guy.  Despite his cruel nature I liked him a lot.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:  The narration.  I can see it in a comic book, reading it, and even liking it.  But spoken aloud, even by talented actors, it sometimes comes across as cartoonish, even ridiculous.  Lines like ""My Warrior Woman"" just didn't work at all for me.  They even made me chuckle a bit.The stories:  They're not bad, but they're all just simple variations of each other.  Scarred but noble men defending tarnished angels.  Only the first one held my attention all the way through (largely because of Marv).  The others were just weaker versions.The violence:  I know it's supposed to be dark, but the violence in this film doesn't come across as scary and horrifying, but ridiculous and goofy.  A guy gets shot over a dozen times but doesn't die.  Somebody gets hit by a car not once, but twice, and just walks away.  Is this a looney tunes cartoon?The extra ""Dark"" touches:  And of course, there's the over the top stuff that is just plain dumb.  A bad guy not only kills prostitutes, he eats them.  And not only does he eat them, he makes them watch him eat them.  Then he keeps their heads mounted on the wall.  Dark?  Please, that's just goofy.MOST DISAPPOINTING:  Where were the extras?  Normally, I don't care about them on a DVD, but Sin City took a lot of technical muscle to translate onto film.  But there's not a making of doc or anything of the sort.  Just a little promotional film with actors and directors saying how much the respect each other.  Yawn.FINAL THOUGHT:  I have to give Sin City a shrug in the end.  After watching the first story, there's not much point in going on except for some nice visuals.But I really did like Marv."	3.0	Too true an adaption for the movies	2005-10-24	7	3	4

I've read a little Frank Miller, but was unaware of Sin City the graphic novels.  From what it sounds like they took a lot of care to stay true to the original graphic novels so I guess I should really be crediting Frank Miller for the way this movie looks and feels.  The stories are also quite good, though thematically typical of at least a few of graphic novels I've read.  In a world where perverts can be the next president, corruption goes to the very top, love is bought and sold, and life doesn't seem to be worth very much, What does one cling to? Live for? Die for?  Kill for?  All in all, once you get past the bullets, blood, and dismemberment, the stories are really kind of sweet.	5.0	not for everyone	2005-04-09	1	1	0
078886047X	Sin City	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	I just got back from seeing Sin City in a sold out theater and everyone walking out was talking about the many memorable scenes and performances. Mickey Rourke absolutely stole the show as Marv. Not only was his character the best of an amazing bunch of interesting folk throughout the film, but his story was also the strongest of the three. Other major standouts would have to be Elijah Wood in a silent, yet creepy role as the serial cannibal named Kevin, Bruce Willis as one of the few characters in the movie that proves to be more on the good side of right and wrong, Benicio Del Toro (great casting choice here: 2nd Best Performance Behind Rourke's Marv), Nick Stahl as a less creepy, but still effective version of a Kevin like pyscho, and Devon Aoki as the silent killer for the prostitutes. Now those are just the many standouts to me in a cast with only one semi-weak performance turned in by Brittany Murphy (but by her standards this is a decent one). There are also plenty of lovely ladies for guys like me to drool over, especially Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino who shows off her immaculate body. The visual look of the film is stunning of course and the direction is perfect. The violence might seem a little excessive, but it is so over the top that you will not be able to turn away. Great dialogue that stays true to the source and mananged to get the crowd I saw it with to chuckle at least a dozen times (better than most comedies I have seen of late). All in all, if you are of the male gender and you have not made plans to see this film this weekend, please stop reading this review and get to your local theater pronto.

It is visually compelling but empty of meaning, interest and emotional impact. While I was captivated by the first twenty-minutes or so, I soon became bored and found the visual effects grating and annoying. The characters (and the actors themselves) are often quite beautiful (Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy) but not in the least bit engaging. There is not a character in the entire movie that holds any emotional appeal whatsoever and, while the film features some incredibly fine actors (Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis, Nick Stahl, etc.) all are wasted in thoroughly unlikable, one-dimensional roles. Many found this movie to be overly violent and, to a great extent, I agree. The violence is intense, but as cartoonish and one-dimensional as the characters who commit it. Yet the saddest part is that it was violence for the sake of violence (think the opposite of movies like The Godfather or Saving Private Ryan) and, as a result has no emotional resonance. Instead it is simply depressing and unpleasant. In general I found the movie to be pointless and extremely over-hyped. It resembles a comic book (or, if you prefer, ""graphic novel"") in every way: beautiful, shallow and deceptively hollow."	1.0	All Style, No Substance and No Point	2005-10-03	16	0	16

Each was so interesting and each had their flaws and all of them seemed human. Even though it's obvious that the film version and the graphic novels of ""Sin City"" take place in a world that is far away from here.Robert Rodriguez is one of the greatest directors of our time - he stands by Tarantino, Spielberg, Craven & others as collaberator of some of the greatest films that we've been pleased enough to see. He made amazing movies such as ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", ""Desperadoes"", 2003's beautiful and bloody epic, ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"", he also makes kid's films that are actually fun to see. He made the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy and he just finished the new 3-D picture, ""Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl"". But his true jems are films like this.""Sin City"" is filmed in a very interesting way. It's Black & White, but various objects (eyes, blood, outfits, etc.) are in color, which makes ""Sin City"" a breathtaking pulpy noir film. If the movie was fully in color, it would still be fun, but it wouldn't look as good as it does. It's three of the graphic novels in one 2-hour film.The first story begins the film and ends it. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis in his best work since ""Die Hard"") plays a cop who is retiring at 60 because of heart condition. He still has one loose end to tie up. He is trying to save an 11-year-old girl named Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba as the 20-year old version. This movie is worth watching just for her, she's SO HOT!) is in the hands of a drooling child molester. And now since Hartigan is off the force and he's free to do whatever the hell he wants, he saves Nancy but is nearly beaten to death. He was framed and he is spending 8 years in prison. And when he gets out, the first thing he does is try to save a now 20-year old Nancy from a yellow rapist who can only give in if his victims scream. And Hartigan is once again out to save Nancy's back.The 2nd story revolves around the character of Mickey Rourke. He plays Marv - a guy who is in love with a prostitute named Goldie. When he is sleeping, a cannibal (Elijah Wood in a thoroughly disturbing role). It's his job to save himself and Goldie's twin sister Wendy (both ladies played by Nicole Kidman lookalike Jamie King). The bloody results are anything but pretty.The last story revolves around Dwight (a very good Clive Owen) is trying to save everybody from a dirty cop with a penchant for violence (Benecio DelToro in a very enthusiastic part), he plays the ultimate bad guy and he gets his comeuppance. Dwight tries to save the girls of ""Old Town""( a city that is overrun by [...]). He takes place in a bloody war that includes Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel and other recognizable people.In conclusion, ""Sin City"" is easily the coolest movie of the year and it provides great surprises and thrills the whole way through. You shouldn't buy this DVD though. Rent it a few times, because director Robert Rodriguez has something special planned for fans that plan to wait for what is yet to come. There will be a 2-disc special edition that will include new footage and much more. This DVD has only a lousy 8-minute behind-the-scenes featurette. I bought it for about $10 somewhere, but I will be the first one there when the Special Edition hits the shelves.

078886047X	Sin City	A19M6KPPNGP4IE	"Movie Princess ""princess"""	I was expecting the same kind of Robert Rodrigues movie such as Desperado and the Spy Kids movies but found that this was not the case.  I have to say that it was very well put together visually and the many stories were scripted well to make the story cohesive.  I liked it very much.  I love all the characters even the Eric Stahl character. It was very good it showed a different side of top notch actors that some avid movie goers have not seen, this was fabulous.  It was well scripted and well directed it was true to the title and the graphic novel.  This was good work Robert and Quentin, but that is to be expected with these two directors, bravo.

I was amazed to discover that others found the so-called ""story lines"" compelling, for I was left utterly disinterested. In fact, I barely made it through the movie with my sanity intact. I am less amazed at those who found it to be visually compelling. But the visual interest is quite buried beneath a wealth of pointless violence and a truly horrendous script.

I must stress - I am grateful for that. Watching this movie on a my 42 inch Panasonic Plasma with the DTS soundtrack is one amazing experience. The stories in the movie itself are very captivating - my favourite being the Mickey Rourke character called Marv - this guy was supercool! The stylization in the movie is first class and reminiscent of previous Tarantino/Rodriguez flicks. The movie deserves to watched over and over again for the script, characters and downright super-coolness. As for the DVD transfer - perfect in my eyes- the black and white pictures enhance what little colour there is and especially on a Plasma screen - strikes out at you.

I just put Sin City's writer,Frank Miller, together with a film and script that I have greatly admired since the late 1990's titled Ronin. This film ""Sin City"" depicts the dark side of life in a lite style manner. It reminds me of taking  a ""R"" rated movie such as Roger Rabbit to a ""R""plus more violence rated status of the same genre. The special make-up work by K.N.B. EFX GROUP,INC. is excellent.

Of course Rodriguez' and Frank Miller's commentary track is the most revealing, and the long take, is a great insight into filmmaking as you see Quentin Tarantino direct a scene in real time.One of the most impressive Dvd packages I've seen.	5.0	Great film, one of the best dvd packages around.	2007-01-05	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A2H22I2RWE0HOV	Mr. Sinister	Are Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez comic book geeks?  Yeah.  Bigtime.  Is it any wonder that they were able to talk the hesitant Frank Miller into making his pulp comic dynasty Sin City into a movie?  Porbably not.  They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.  Hence, a comic book movie is born.Probably the first comic book movie.Sure there's Batman and Superman and X-Men and Spider-Man and blah-de-blah-blah.  But one:  None of these movies were filmed by Tarrantino and Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Two: These movies were adaptions of comics turned into movies.  Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.  Hard to explain....unless you've seen it.  Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid-80's) and he has a certain vision.  Rodriguez did not want this to be Frank Miller's Sin City as portrayed by Robert Rodriguez.  He wanted Frank Miller's Sin City.  Period.I think he got that and a helluva lot more.Do you need to be a Comic Book Geek to love this movie?  No.  It would help.  But it wouldn't be a prerequisite.  In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new-found appreciation of comics in general.To cut to the chase.  This is a dark and unseemly movie with dark and unseemly subject matter.  It moves like a hurricane.Dig it.	5.0	Sin City: A Feast For The Comic Book Geeks?  Yes & No.	2005-09-27	3	2	1

I guess kids who play ""Grand Theft Rapist"" or whatever won't bat an eye, but it makes you yearn for the days when directors like Hitchcock would leave it to the viewer's imagination, while the characters talked like they at least attempted community college.

078886047X	Sin City	A3DR6R79WUCQHP	"Nathan T. Milliner ""tmill68888"""	"Finally, after 13 years of waiting, Frank Miller's homage to the hard-boiled pulp novels he enjoyed as a youth have come to life on the big screen in the respectful hands of Robert Rodriguez.  Sin City won't be for everyone because like many films, they won't know what they will be seeing.  So far, friends of mine who have never read a Mickey Spillane novel or watched a Bogart film think the dialogue's too fast, the dialogue's too over the top and the actors were over acting.  This film was made in the film noir style of the 30's and 40's but by using modern technology they have tranformed it into a magical world that only exists in the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novels.  If you understand the pallet that Miller and Rodriguez used to make this film, then you might just appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.Frank Miller started out in comics back in the late 70s, first making his landmark with his famous run on Marvel's ""Daredevil"" series in the early 80s where he created one of the most beloved female assassins of all-time...Elektra.  After this, he moved over to DC where they gave him the opportunity to do anything he wanted which produced his first self-titled graphic novel, ""Ronin"" the story of a samurai from ancient Japan teleported into the future.  Then came the big one, DC gave Miller the reigns to the character that first inspired him to get into the business...Batman!  Frank Miller produced ""THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS"", the story of an old Batman who has given up.  Bruce Wayne has been retired from crime fighting for ten years but a swarm of gangs and violent crime in a Reaganomics Gotham City causes the Dark Knight to return and show these punks that you don't mess with Gotham!  But this time, the police aren't so willing to accept the vigilante actions of old Bats.Moving on, The Dark Knight Returns brought Miller a lot of publicity which led him to Hollywood to write the two Robocop sequels.  But he soon learned that being a screenwriter is the worst job to have in Tinsletown.  His scripts were cut up and flipped around so badly that he lost all hop of ever doing movies again.  So Miller returned to comic book land and decided to draw what he wanted to draw.  Taking his love of Dashiel Hammet, Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane novels, Miller created Sin City.  There would be tough guys, sexy women and classic cars.  The books are like a Spillane novel on steroids...as hard-boiled as you can get.  Filled with constant violence, nudity and hard dialogue.Robert Rodriguez first became famous for making El Miriachi in 1991 for no budget and really shot into superstardom with his follow up, ""Desperado"".  After a few other films that included ""Four Rooms"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Roadracers"", ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" and the 3 ""Spy Kids"" movies, Rodriguez started to persue a work of passion.  A massive fan of Sin City, Rodriguez literally stalked and hunted Frank Miller and begged him for the rights to make the movie.  Miller had been so disillusioned from his past experiences in Hollywood that there was no way he was giving up his baby unless he could direct it.  Rodriguez went out and got Josh Hartnett and another up and coming actor to film a test to show Miller what kind of film he was going to be making out of Sin City.  He filmed the three page short story ""THe Customer is Always Right"" which is the opening of the released film.  Miller loved it, and agreed to let Rodriguez direct the film but only if he could co-direct it.  Rodriguez agreed to this, but he was kicked out of the Directors Guild for doing so.Rodriguez decided to translate three of Miller's graphic novels to the film to give the world a good idea of what Sin City was.  The first story is ""The Hard Goodbye"".  The story revolves around a modern day barbarian of a loser named Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is seduced by a beautiful hooker named Goldie (Jamie King) to protect her from an unknown serial killer (Elijiah Wood) who has killed five of her friends.  After a night of amazing sex, Marv wakes up next to Goldie who is dead.  He's been framed, and he will go on a violent path of vengeance to find the people responsible for killing the only woman who was ever nice to him.  The second story is ""The Big Fat Kill"".  The story follows Dwight(Clive Owen), a man who is wanted for killing his wife.  While sleeping with his current girlfriend Shelley (Brittany Murphy), they are interupted by her ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benecio Del Toro) who is banging on the door with four of his drunk buddies.  Dwight wants to take them all down but Shellie pleads with him that it would be trouble.  Jackie Boy and his friends leave for Old Town, a section of Sin City where the hookers and the police have a truce.  The cops stay out, and the girls get to enforce their own laws and punishment. Fearing Jackie and the boys might hurt someone or maybe even kill someone, Dwight follows them into Old Town to warn his old flame Gail (Rosario Dawson) of their drunken states...only to find the girls are already waiting for them to make a mistake.  A mistake that will threaten the way things go down in Sin City and especially Old Town.The third story is ""That Yellow Bastard"".  John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is one of the best cops on the Sin City force but due to his angina he is forced into early retirment...but there's one case he isn't walking away from.  A child rapist/murderer (Nick Stahl) has kidnapped an 11 year old girl named Nancy and Hartigan is going to take this scum out even if it kills him.But the killer is the son of a power Senator (Powers Boothe) and the corrupt cops are protecting him...including Hartigan's own partner Bob (Michael Madsen).  Nothing will stop Hartigan from saving the little girl, even multiple gun wounds.  After blowing the killer's hand and genetalia away, Hartigan is gunned down by Bob but saves Nancy.  He is blamed for the kidnapping of Nancy and the murders of the other girls and is sent to prison for 8 years.  The little girl he saved, Nancy, sends him letters every week...but two weeks go by without any letters and when he finally gets one, there's a severed finger inside.  Fearing they may have gotten to her, Hartigan gives in and confesses to the murders to get a release so that he can save the now nineteen year old Nancy (Jessica ALba) from the mysterious Yellow Bastard that keeps following him.The movie is the most accurate and loyal adaptation of a comic book ever made.  It is literally word for word, shot for shot, Miller's graphic novels.  Filmed on green screens, the backgrounds were all animated giving the film a magical look, almost as if we are not in a real world.  The technique we first saw in ""Sky Captain and the World Of Tomorrow"".  At one point, I felt like I was watching the opening of The Wizard Of Oz during the tornado.  The cast is almost too perfect for the roles they play.  Mickey Rourke gives the best performance of his career.  Bruce Willis is more than perfect for the role of Hartigan, and Elijiah Wood delivers a frightening performance as Kevin the cannibalistic serial killer.Look for the scene directed by Quentin Tarantino between Benecio Del Toro and Clive Owen.  Rodriguez and Tarantino first met on the film festival circuit in 91 while they were showing their first films El Miriachi and Reservoir Dogs.  The two became good friends and even collaborated on two films, From Dusk Till Dawn and Foor Rooms.  Tarantino directing a scene for Sin City started back on Kill Bill Vol. 2 when Rodriguez agreed to score the film for $1.  In return, Tarantino directed a scene for Sin City for $1.Sin City is a film that really breaks new ground.  It is just as beautiful as it is ugly.  The violence is constant and brutal at times but easy to handle due to the comic bookish technique used by the director.  The nudity from the books was toned down.  There's really only one word to describe Sin City, ""COOL.""  It's probably one of the coolest films since Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"".  Like Pulp Fiction, some people have been confused by the films order.  You have to remember that these storylines sometimes take place at different times, so it won't be strange to see characters from other stories make an appearance in another story, even if they're dead...kinda like John Travolta in Pulp coming back at the end of the film.  Lord knows how many times I had to explain to people that the end of the film happens before Travolta is killed by Butch.  I've gone on long enough...Sin City is a tribute to the work of Frank Miller and in my opinion it's taken too damn long.  Frank Miller is one of the best comic book writers of all time and Sin City is as hard and as tough as they come.  It was worth the 13 year wait!"	5.0	A BIG FAT THRILL!	2005-04-05	7	2	5

078886047X	Sin City	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	The most faithful comic to film adaptation of all time, Frank Miller's Sin City is brilliantly realized by maverick director Robert Rodriguez, combining Miller's gritty and pulpy stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) with completely rendered, digital backgrounds.  The three stories, although separate, are meticulously intertwined, and brilliantly brought to the screen with one of the biggest casts ever assembled for a comic to film adaptation.  Disfigured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast), uncovering a plot orchestrated by a sinister cardinal (Rutger Hauer) while tracking down the cannibalistic killer (Elijah Wood, unbelievably creepy) and seeking revenge for the death of his true love (Jamie King).  Then, there is Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy at the wrong place at the wrong time.  His efforts to stop the violent ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of a barmaid (Brittany Murphy) goes horribly wrong, and leads to a showdown with the girls of Old Town, and a stunner of a revelation that promises blood flowing in the streets.  The final story revolves around old cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his attempt to take down a psychopath (Nick Stahl) who kidnapped a little girl, but he himself ends up in jail.  Eight years later, Hartigan gets his chance to save her again (Jessica Alba, hot as ever) in a climactic showdown with a yellow skinned psychopath.  The casting is excellent for the most part, including Rourke, Owen, and Del Toro perfectly cast as Marv, Dwight, and Jackie Boy respectively.  The rest of the cast, including Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Devin Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Nicky Katt, and even Miller himself, give memorable performances.  Rodriguez (who shares the directing credit with Miller, and Quentin Tarantino even helms a scene as well) uses the comics as directly as possible: from using Miller's art as storyboards to using the dialogue almost exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.  Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking, Sin City is a masterpiece.	5.0	Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking: welcome to Sin City	2005-08-25	1	0	1

You more than likliy know if you are going to enjoy this movie before you even read my review... hell you probably knew if you would like this film just by looking at the cover art for the DVD.

Where bullets fly, blood sprays, and jazz music plays in the background. Not everyone will enjoy this film, in fact I would go so far as to say that the movie is more of an ""aquired taste"". I commend Robert Rodriguez for having the guts to make a movie with such high production values and expensive star power, while knowing this film is far from the main-stream, and will probably only be appreciated by a select few. you, the reader know what kind of movies you enjoy, and If you are the type who likes the movies that your friends never quite understand, Sin City is a world you must experience.

This is exactly what happened in the case of Sin City.Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids) had been badgering legendary comic book writer/artist Frank Miller for years to bring his most cherished series to the big screen. After much pestering and a secret audition featuring Josh Hartnett (which is used for the opening of the film), Miller was convinced to green-light the project. In fact, Rodriguez was so hell-bent on staying true to the comic that he actually resigned from The Directors' Guild of America just to allow Miller to be credited as Co-Director.Translating the books to screen rather than adapting them, Rodriguez used all of Miller's original artwork as storyboards. Filmed entirely on green screen with digital cameras, the results are nothing short of amazing. The shadowy characters, the gritty cityscapes, the violence, the signature rain, the chain-smoking, the black and white film noir influences, the minimalist usage of bright colors -- and yes, even severed body parts - appear just as Miller had envisioned.The movie boasts an impressive, all-star ensemble cast which includes Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Mickey Rourke, Jaime King, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro. Perhaps the reasoning behind this much star power is that each story is of its own entity. Yet, the tales are seamlessly intertwined and the film paces well.In the first entry ""That Yellow Bastard"", Willis is a haggard cop battling a pedophile (Stahl). The role seems to be tailor-made for Willis who gives it just the edge it needs. Sure his portrayal may be stereotypical at times, but he makes it work with ease.""The Hard Goodbye"" is probably the most enjoyable story. Buried under layers of prosthetics, Mickey Rourke is at the top of his game as Marv, a tough-as-nails bruiser who sets out to avenge the death of his hooker girlfriend Goldie (King). When he ends up at the house of a mute cannibal (Wood), the sadomasochistic madness ensues in the most ridiculous of fashions.The third segment ""The Big Fat Kill"", though way over-the-top, features some of the most memorable moments of the film. Clive Owen plays Dwight, a good guy trying to cover up the death of a crooked cop (Del Toro) in order to preserve a negotiation of power between the law and a town run by hookers (led by Rosario Dawson). Keep your eyes open for an intense car scene directed by Rodriguez's good friend, the master of front seat dialogue himself: Quentin Tarantino.Shot and cut entirely by Rodriguez, Sin City is a triumph. The splashes of color and it's pulpy, film noir style are both abrasive and dazzling. Combined with Miller's sensationally slick dialogue, the result is a beautiful and timeless classic, which will undoubtedly be shown in future film schools for many years to come. Fan-boys rejoice.

078886047X	Sin City	A2C7Y2UIH03UKJ	"Nicole Victoria ""nicole"""	If you like your action films dark and gruesome, with a dash of black comedy then Sin City might just be your cup of tea.Directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez manage to pull off the finest comic book adaptation to date.Based on the graphic novels by Miller, Sin City is a timeless and brutal metropolis where the men are ridiculously brave and the women about as sexy.Combining three of Miller's novels the film focuses on the ultra macho heroes Dwight (Clive Owen) , Marv (Mikey Rourke) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis).Set in eternal night-time, the street wise trio embark on their own personal crusade to avenge personal injustices. In turn, they find themselves in a tangled web of corruption and evil.Our heroes motivation is more often than not the sassy women who inhabit the streets of Sin City. In classic comic style these vixens are all red lips and leather with a nasty sting in their tail.Femme fatales such as Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), twins Goldie and Wendy (Jaime King) and Gail (Rosario Dawson) work a sleazy end of town that often becomes a battle ground between the honest and the corrupt. The women are sexy in a way that many may see as sexist, however as a counterbalance they are also as tough as the heroes and hold their own as characters.Sin City's visual magic comes mostly from the subtle use of CGI to create a graphic and believable urban backdrop. High impact colour set against a monochrome background gives a feeling that you are literally stepping  into a comic book.However what really takes this film to another realm is how true it stays to the level of violence depicted in Miller's novels.Simple deaths take a back seat to multiple castrations, beheadings and amputations.The contradiction of combining simplistic and clich&eacute;d dialogue with this ultraviolence has the mark of special guest director Quentin Tarantino written all over it. There are laughs the entire way through as extra cheesy lines are coupled with bloodthirsty fisticuffs.It's an interesting film to bring out in such a time of political ambiguity. The black and white of Sin City's characters certainly harks back to a time where society was perceived as a lot less complicated.Sin City is most definitely fantasy cinema at its best.	5.0	Does a graphic novel adaption get any better?	2005-11-10	5	1	4
078886047X	Sin City	A15SK2QYTMW528	Night Reader	Film goir maybe. Frank Miller, author of the source graphic novels, was seduced into green-lighting the movie and settled for something even shallower than his graphic novels. I wish he had boned up on Rodriguez' previous film history before getting compromised in this first-person-shooter computer-game of a movie.  But now that Sin City-1 has paid the bills, maybe the sequel will try to aim a little higher.Pros:1. Stunning hyper-noir black and white visualsCons:1. Strict fidelity to the graphic novels - comic book stereotypes masquerading as noir protagonists2. Non-existant Sin City backstory - no depth at all to the weak screenplay3. Stylized, but endless and numbing ultra-violence including cannibalism, castration and suicide4. Acting talent wasted with hip, cliche-dominated dialogue5.

Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life.  However, some things need to stick to their original medium.  I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory.  After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end.  Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part.  After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO.  It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more.  Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute.  Oh, Thank God.

To others, it contributes to the film's ""ambience""; you know...  film noir. yeah, right.Sam Peckinpah's ""Wild Bunch"" and ""Straw Dogs' "" violence created about the same stir, impact, and  impression that I've read among the 4-5 star reviews here. And what is Peckinpah's reputation among the young, today? Exactly--Sam who?? (and that meager reputation is well-deserved; film as art, nor craft, didn't benefit from Sam Peckinpah) His films were just as bad; hokey-thin plots and monotonous over-kill violence for its' own sake--sure, it creates an ""atmosphere"", and if the viewer needs that element in film in order to consider it 'break-through entertainment' or ""film noir"", then I say, ""If God didn't want them sheered, he wouldn't have made them sheep"". There's nothing new here; in fact, it's all grindingly familiar in a borish way. The ""special-effects"" graphics and video manipulation delivering cartoon-esque visual cinema has been done ad nauseum--""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"", ""Roger Rabbitt"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Gladiator"", are all better examples of like talents used to better results. Mickey Rourke's performance is 'live osmosis'-- he's as wooden as ever. He might as well be Clarence Williams III. His low deadpan monotone spewing 3rd grade dialogue, coupled with action-adventure violence that is deemed 'unacceptable' for TV only means that such dribble can't be viewed for free--but it's definitely not worth even a matinee's price nor 2 hours out of one's life--we gave up after about 20 minutes.If imitation is Hollywood's sincerest form of flatulence, Peckinpah should be smilin'... and Tarantino too, for having skinned all the willing sheep from their money.

The movie opened simply, but I know from minute one that it was going to be a blast. The violence was so intense, but somehow not overpowering, at least not most of it. There were a few scenes that made me cringe; however, these were necessary to the power of the film. Having never read the books (although I hear that the movie is a mirror copy) I was a little shocked. I have seen worse, but this was coming from a ""Comic book..."" oh well. I loved the cast. Willis, Rourke, Alba, Dawson, Owen, and even Hartnett, Murphy, and Wood played it cool. I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time! These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_  Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_  Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute.All in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant; it accentuates the drama and gore to an extreme - bringing the characters to life. And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness. It takes formidable jabs at the hypocrisy that plagues the Church and the police, while glorifying the everyday, flawed, hero. It applauds loyalty and loathes treachery - important in a workable society.

Now if they can only do the same with Miller's ""Dark Knight.""The spirit here is classic film noir- in fact, it's more noir than noir, yet without appearing campy. But yet, it isn't quite noir, because the attitude is clearly one of good vs. evil- and good wins. Good may get the hell beat out of it and resort to hyper violence, but it wins. It wins because the innocent are either protected or avenged. Yeah, maybe these are morality plays, but they are good morality plays. Marv was my hero before I saw this- and he is still my hero now: ""That the best you can do, you Pansies?""The primary special feature here is an interview with Miller, the other directors, and the main actors.

Sin City is not very different from Spy Kids in intelectual delights or graphic innovation.  The violence (that is only strong for American viewers  that don't watch world cinema or, let's say, news) is relentless and a little pointless (I mean, there is no use to it, no interesting commentary about it, it simply exists).  The CGI backgrounds are well used this time (vs. the well-received and far-from-good ""Sky Captain..."") but some of the shots (for example, when travelling in cars) are so stilized that take from the possible force of situations all the tension: in a fantasy world, the world of videogames and C-movies Rodriguez and Tarantino grew in, you never die even when you do and so there's no danger.  The non-linear screenplay ala ""Pulp Fiction"" also takes out of the film its share of interest, and so we are left with the esthetics and the gorgeous girls (and maybe that was the intention of the auteur).  I don't know if the film is going to survive the relentless advancement of technological eye candy (that makes fx made for fx wonderment some years ago look like, ahem, garbage) but the undoubtful interest of Rodriguez in his material and the efforts put in the realization makes this film at least a candidate to top the comic adaptation sub-genre for many years to come."	3.0	Children's film	2005-09-08	6	2	4

They apparently evolved (DEvolved?) into the ""Graphic Novel""....a modern pic-book format that is simply a more stylishly presented comic book.  Computer-moviemaking has progressed to the point that these gratuitously violent cartoons can be presented onscreen.  SIN CITY is a hyper-stylized, cartoonish film that blends actors--sometimes in ridiculous pancake makeup (a la DICK TRACY)--with a pseudo-film-noir black-and-white/splash-of-single-color ""look"" and improbable, ultra-violent special effects.  Sick stuff, with cannibalism, child molestation and murder, and bloody pound-the-head-to-a-pulp violence forming the basis for short, brainless stories of revenge and glorified depravity.  Even Mickey Rourke's grotesque ""hero"", in the longest segment of this disjointed, adolescent mess, is supposed to be laudable for his habit of torturing--in blood-spattering detail--all bad guys who get in his way.  The simple-minded moral basis here is that as long as you wear the white hat, any violence you commit against anyone on the ""opposite side"" is justified.  A real Republican, reactionary, fascist-WASP point of view.  This movie is gratuitous, occasionally visually arresting (but the style gets old fast), and loaded with disgusting images worthy of those pimple-faced , maladjusted adolescence male punks who used to lurk around the hall lockers in high-school trading joints and cigarettes while plotting to be late for every class.  Don't waste your time.  Even the scrumptious current pop-tart Jessica Alba is poorly displayed....you don't really get the sense that she's there at all.

Frank Miller the comic genuis that attracted me to Daredevil back in the late eighties, then went on to renew my interest in Batman authored a series of graphic novels in the early nineties called SIN CITY. I have not read the graphic novels but remember skimming them back when they originally came out.Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller then adapted said comics into a live action motion picture, with a small cameo directing appearance from Quinten Tarantino. Is the end product as dark as it could be, it surely is pitch black with characters like Bruce Willis's aging detective, Brittany Murphy's waitress and Jessica Alba's kidnap victim turned stripper to name a few lost souls populating Sin City.The actors including Benecio (can't currently spell last name sorry) turn out excellent performances, but it is Mickey Roarke's Marv and Clive Owen's Dwight that steal the show.Miller's dialogue is crisp and edgy with dark humour counterbalancing the sheer splashes of blood red colour onscreen.Like Pulp Fiction the narrative of the movie is split into three vignettes, which led some reviewers I believe to critique the repetiveness. I forgive this however with the knowledge that the movie is maybe the closest adaptation of a comic ever lifting shot for shot and almost word for word from the source. Therefore if one views movie as three interconnected stories as opposed to one long one the repetitiveness may not be such a factor.This movie appeals to the comic collecting young crowd, but also to a crowd of older moviegoers that like innovative directing, searing action, ambigous morals and plenty of action in their movies."	4.0	How much more Nior can you get?

The movie is not deep in the least, is very violent, and is HORRIBLY misogynistic - the most misogynistic movie I have ever seen, but it is also unlike anything else I have seen - a dream perhaps, a film noir stripped to it's bare bones and then exaggerated a thousand-fold, Mickey Spillane on steroids.

With it's black and white filming, the unique use of certain colors such as red for blood and lipstick to accent certain people and things, it's rough but sometimes brutally funny dialogue, and it's riveting action sequences, there is nothing that has come before it that I can compare it to. It is a feast for the eye and you won't want to turn away for fear of missing a moment. Not for everyone as there are some very graphic scenes of violence but this is basically a comic book come to life. All the elements I've mention go into creating a wonderfully dark mood where the people of Sin City live and die, some heroically, some as cowards. I can honestly say there is nothing out there in the world of film like it.

078886047X	Sin City	A2W9CBN7UTVCLF	"Peteypea ""peteypea"""	Would give this 10 stars. So amazingly original and fresh. This is the next wave of cinema and i couldn't be more pleased. Rodriguez proves he is among the most talented directors working.Mickey Rourke is the standout. He really deserves an Oscar nomination(and the Oscar) for his role as Marv. In all that makeup he manages to make this character so REAL.Bruce Willis also exceeds expectations. Great role for him.Clive Owen supplies plenty of dry wit in a send-up performance of would be action heros. You have to really see the humor in Brittany Murphy's performance. Her role is purposely over the top and high camp, excellent job. Rosario Dawson is right on the money as the diva with some serious weaponry. And the actress whoplays the Ninja like vixen is deadpan and quite the unexpected tornado of death;an obviously gifted actress.I hope this will become a series.

078886047X	Sin City	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	After watching this movie, I look forward to get myself the extended version.  For enthusiasts, they would have already known that Sin City is based upon comics done by Frank Miller and from excerpt provided in behind the scene, Frank himself didn't believe a movie need to be made as it's perfect as it is.  However, Robert Rodriquez had an idea that he couldn't resist.  Rather than conforming the comic to the movie format, he opts to turn it the other way around, made a movie that looked like a comic.  This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.  It's an escapism, away from reality and for those two hours watching it, I literally was brought into the world of Sin City and totally captivated by all those characters (mainly strong men that had soft spots for fallen girls and who would be their protectors or their minders, to undo the wrongs or to make things right).  It's a movie that ought to be seen to be believed.  It's that good!  It would be one of those movies that would sit on well with Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill I and II.  Highly recommended.  This edition is thin on extras, only a behind the scene which is brief by any standard.  Get the extended one if you may.	4.0	Captivating	2006-01-14	3	3	0

I liked the entire concept and the entire cast, but the ending part with the ""yellow man"" was kind of boring. However, this particular cut makes other parts longer and better, which makes up for one segment that looses it near the end. The star cast of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Anna Paquin, Clive Owen, and many more make it worth all the while.You also get this cool additional comic book, which is where it all started, isn't it? Frank Miller also revamped Batman in the 80's with the Year One plot that became a basis for the excellent ""Batman Begins"" film. He also directed the highly underrated ""Spirit"" from his own idol that starred Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johanson. He also did the original comic of ""300"" and the prequel ""Xerxes"" (the latter which has been adapted into a sequel).If you are at all a fan of Frank Miller, anything he's ever written, check this edition out even if you saw the original version.

When I read about a multi-disc version coming in a few months time it just goes to show how greedy the movie studios are and they will continue to do this unlesss gullible, impatient sheep stop buying these plain discs and demand and wait for the proper full version.It wouldnt be so bad if they made a load of extras now and then released the later one with different extras and more scenes so at least you would have 2 different versions. Also does anyone know if the later discs will include extra/deleted/extended scenes? Better yet why couldnt they release just one, full, definitive version like the star wars trilogy?

The unique style of filming which blends comic book style visuals with very dark overtone, makes the movie an excellent choice for the comic book enthusiast. The story line is good - but not great. There are weak threads in the movie which though not absolutely necessary, do weaken the fabric of the movie. The characters are excellent and very well developed and at the end of the movie you feel like you just read a 200 pages intense comic book with some richly designed visuals.

078886047X	Sin City	A3SARNBM5U4A20	RAUL DASILVA	Since the late 19th Century film paralleled the development of the comic strip in the United States generally conceded to be The Yellow Kid then The Katzenjammer Kids quickly following (originating in Germany and arguably the first true comic strip since it entailed sequential frames).It has taken over the past one century for filmmakers to closely emulate the comic strip, here, the work of Frank Miller.  Although the script(s) here are shallow, melodramatic and outrageously exaggerated (specifically in violence) this film is well worth viewing beyond its surprising entertainment value.  The work here is startling and highly original.	4.0	Unusually creative product	2006-02-25	2	0	2
078886047X	Sin City	AMCH34Z0KHD41	"rawk ""rawkabilly"""	After much hassle, I at long last go to see SIN CITY, the movie version of the classic Frank Miller graphic novels. I sit through 20 minutes of previews, including one for HITCHIKER'S GUIDEwhich I'm excited about (I dig Doug Adams), and the tedious STAR WARS 3 : SITH HAPPENS, which revolted me to no end.The movie begins. (WARNING: I don't give much away in this review, but at this point I do give away small clips).Love the opening. Great mini which sets up the feel of the city and hence, the feel of the movie.Love the tragic Bruce Willis short. Glad to see Nick Stahls working.Then, we get right to the good stuff: MARV.The Marv segment steals the show for me, hands down. I love anti-hero stories, I love intense violence and gore, I love insane cannibal stories and I love Mickey Rourke (good to see him in a bigger role again). This segment had it all and then some! Whoever thought Elijah Wood could be scary? Better yet, who ever thought there would be a flick where Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood brawl!?! Marv is a superb anti-hero: he's mean but to the right people, he has self-loathing and a disorder, he reflects on the old days when he kicked everyone's assess, one of his only pals is a lesbian, and he goes nuts when anyone roughs up a woman.But although he easily takes the cake here, let's not overlook the other goodies.The next act, featuring the incredible Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and some bloke named Clive who I've only elsewhere seen in I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD (which sucked while I watched), was good but I didn't care for Clive. He was too bland for me. Too David Duchoviny. Other than that, it was smokin'. Benico shined bright as always.Bruce Willis returns in a wonderful grand finale. I was particularly fond of Nick from IN THE BEDROOM as Junior/Yellow Bastard. What a sickeningly good show he put on. He looked like what would happen if John Malcovitch and Big Bird had a child together and then locked it in a fruit cellar for thirty years.The stylish noir of the film is genius, the stark B&W; with the touches of burning color. It's hypnotic and gorgeous.  Rodriguez redems himself for the hilariously bad ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. The hard-ass saving the dirty angel theme runs throughout the film but doesn't get oldor stale, the violence is over the top and splendidly brutal, and the gore and T&A; is aplenty, pleasing the heck out of a depraved maniac like me.This film gets stars all across the board from me. Although the casting of that  bland bloke Clive in the hooker showdown tale was a bad move, and although Bruce Willis plays an old man and yet nobody thinks to slap some old man make-up on him (even when he ages during the course of the film), the movie over-all is stunningly good and Miller's brillance was wonderfuly transported from the page to the screen.The real stroke of genius here was letting Frank Miller co-direct the movie. Rodriguez (and Tarantino, somewhere) aided with the techincal and camera direction aspect  but Miller repainted the mood of his graphic novels. This is why it came out so  good, unlike the bastardized versions of comics which hit theaters without consultationof the original creators (doody-tanks like THE PUNISHER and THE HULK). Rami did great on the SPIDER-MAN films because he was such a hardcore fanboy, but normally such dedication to the original artisty isn't present and directors think they have ways to improve the original story, and then they, in the end, ruin them.BATMAN BEGINS was originaly based on Frank Miller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE. While BATMAN BEGINS still looks to have some promise, it likely would have been better if they had worked with Miller on it. Miller was one of the best things to ever happen to Batman. We'll see if Christian Bale cuts the mustard or if he simply cuts the cheese.So far, I have mixed feelings about it. It looks good overall, but Bale looks so much like Kilmer in the suit. This seems like a bad omen. Don't get me wrong, I like Bale. AMERICAN PSYCHO was great! ButBale as Batman? I don't know about that.Anyway, SIN CITY was the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys crime, noir, horror and overall fun movies.	5.0	One of the All-time Best Comic Book Movies	2005-04-19	3	2	1
078886047X	Sin City	A3Z17HIHANHXZ	"Raybrn ""raybrn"""	First, let me start off by saying that I'm a huge comic book fan. I'm even a big fan of some of Frank Miller's work and recognize that Batman: Year One is one of the best Batman stories ever written. That said, I hadn't read any of his Sin City stories and I definitely won't be reading them now.The thing that bothers me the most about the steaming pile of crap called Sin City is that it is being held up as an example of what comic books are truly about, with numerous reviewers touting it as the first authentic translation of a comic book.The only positive thing about Sin City was its visual style, specifically the limited and dramatic use of color against a backdrop of a black and white world. The acting was very poor, even by the big name actors. The dialogue was so cheesy it made me wince. And the story was trite, ridiculously gory and completely mysoginistic. The outcome of all the violence is also so unrealistic (with people getting shot repeatedly, blown up, being in horrific car crashes, etc., and then getting up and walking away as if nothing had happened) that I half expected Bugs Bunny to pop up at any moment. And some of the scenes were profoundly disturbing, and not in a good way (like the sick romance between Jessica Alba and her father-figure Bruce Willis).My friend was begging me to walk out after the first half-hour, but I stayed hoping the movie would get better because I really wanted to like the movie. I am completely baffled by the number of good reviews this movie has gotten. It's hard not to wonder if we saw the same film.Please don't leave this movie with the idea that this is what comic book fans like. Sin City is not at all representative of the diverse, mature works the comic industry is capable of. If you want a true example of a good adaptation of a good independent comic, go see American Splendor or Ghost World. And if you want a good example of the best that the action adventure genre of comics has to offer, go see Batman Begins instead.	1.0	Horrible example of a comic book based movie	2005-08-14	40	9	31

078886047X	Sin City	A2TBWLOHTZNK54	Reviewer	Sin City is what it is, a splatter-packed, nudity filled, violent vision of perverts vs. vigilantes, and shameless prostitutes vs. the world. The visual techniques are very impressive and make Sin City a film icon unto itself... it's not reality, nor any other movie you've seen, but occupies it's own niche as something black, white, and painted... something artistic.The plot follows a few short stories that all revolve around the main characters immediately getting knee deep in the dead. The characters narrate their own adventure with bleak, grim voices, which is a hit and miss technique. Women are portrayed very badly, as hookers and strippers almost exclusively, who rarely wear clothes.Overall, I really liked the ridiculous violence, stylized visuals that are actually not gimmicky, and atmosphere of the story telling. I'd warn you though that many women may feel differently because of the sexism of this type of male fantasy flick.	5.0	It's a beautiful looking movie that will appeal to the teenage boy in men	2006-09-21	0	0	0
078886047X	Sin City	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	The first and most important element of any decent Sci-Fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation, plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters. Without these, the film invariably descends into a campy parody of itself, and that is precisely what's happened here.It doesn't matter how closely this movie sticks to the comics that spawned it - when you move to a different medium you need to make changes to reflect the move (like the cut-down character backgrounds in the X-Men movies, or the plot tweaking and omission in the Harry Potter series - two extremely successful sci-fi/literary adaptation franchises), and sadly, 'Sin City' seems to think it can get away with having the actors spout the same kinds of dialogue as they do in the comics.This doesn't work for several reasons. On the printed page, we need to have things spelled out for us that comic art - particularly the kind of comic art contained in the Sin City books, a hugely graphical and stylised look - can't capture. Character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - all of these are things that comics more often than not need to have as printed text, and in the comic book medium, this works. On film, these things - character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - are all possible to achieve with visuals - facial expressions, body language, montage sequences, and so forth. The movie of 'Sin City' has its first major failing, then, in that the characters - grim and gritty men and women of action and consequence - wax lyrical over themselves, their current situations, and their previous histories - until they end up sounding like pedantic Drama majors about to embark on their first audition. The Valkyrie speech? The White Light line? The entire opening monologue? Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self-importance that it makes the rest of the script surrounding them pale into mundanity - which isn't too much of a problem since it was all pretty mundane to begin with.The second problem with 'Sin City' is the amateurish use of spot colours, here and there, to suggest a tie to the excellent style of the comic books. 'Schindler's List' used this ploy to great effect, but sadly, here it just looks overdone. Not that this is a bad idea in theory, but thanks to some pedestrian direction (particularly in the first and second stories) it seems to be there just for the sake of it, as opposed to highlighting anything actually important. Case in point: the blue eyes of the young hooker in the second plot are just annoying because there aren't enough worthwhile close-ups of her face to make the colour stand out. It becomes a mere annoyance noticing these small splashes of colour against, it must be said, an overall rather effective visual style of high-contrast black and white areas.Direction is run-of-the-mill action fare.Performances are forced and difficult, particularly the action movie veterans like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. It can't be much fun having to deal with such clunky dialogue as this. They do their best but sadly, as is the case with the more traditionally artistic actors like Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, fail to deliver the mawkish, over-the-top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief.Two stars for a brave attempt is all I can award this movie, such a potential wasted and with such a horrible, forced script, it's lucky to get even that. Pick up the comics instead, they're far more rewarding and not half as annoying.	2.0	Not good	2005-10-17	9	2	7

I've always been a fan of Rodriguez, if only because of his sheer originality; though a buddy of Tarantino, he can still maintain his individuality and integrity. One reviewer didn't like the voice over; if he'd watched the best of 40's film noir, he'd he'd realize that they all had voice over, and for a reason: Precision. I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing; appropriate black & white photography, with splashes of color that intrigue. I agree with the guy who said this DVD is lacking in extras; no doubt. This project must have been so complex, I'm very interested to hear more about background stuff. The acting is excellent throughout. I particularly was impressed with Mickey Rourke, as well as Brittany Murphy. Benicio del Toro played his somewhat carricature part as if nothing could be more fun. This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike ""Pulp Fiction"", but a little more clever and even poetic. I thought the script was wonderful. This is indeed a sort of ""parallel universe"" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained.Rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent.

078886047X	Sin City	AGJLO8GK3A1SX	R. Hussain	Okay, I've seen it (and got the T-Shirt) and here's my initial words on the topic... I've tried to keep it brief.I had very low expectations due to some of the casting and the Digital-Video shoot. However, after seeing the evidence, many of my misgivings have been swept away. Read on...This is easily the best use of SFX and CGI in quite some time. STAR WARS III pales away into insignificance due to the effects swamping the story and dwarfing the characters. In SIN CITY, all the special effects are there to service the plot and characters and this blending is so seamless that one easily forgets that you're watching SFX, instead you focus in on the story and become completely absorbed by the population that resides in the hard-boiled streets of SIN CITY.The Noir style of the film, with all those jagged jaws, tough women and blood splattered corpses, makes this film the most visually arresting of the last few years. It really has pushed the envelope in what can now be done to illustrate a story and create a credible world for the characters to inhabit it. Absolutely magnificent imagination at work here and all the artists should be commended for giving us such a vivid creation. This is easily the best comic-book adaptation ever committed to celluloid.And what a gargantuan task it must have been for Frank Miller to adapt most of his novels into one cohesive story! He makes the art of script-writing seem so easy. Other writers should take note and follow in his footsteps. Anyone who saw the recent film THE JACKET knows what I'm talking about here.The performances are very convincing and no one actor overshadows the others. This ensemble piece is spellbinding and, once again, is there to showcase the diverse stories rather than glorifying individual characters. This allows us to become immersed in the world of SIN CITY and watch, almost like a fly which spies from a wall, the different people as their paths criss-cross the bars and alleys of the rat infested city.The music and soundstage is also carefully tailored to bring out the best details and deliver realistic sounds of a city losing it's soul. Robert Rodriguez delivers a pulpy music track that blends smoky Jazz, salty Brass and the thumping electricity of glass being cracked with bare feet. Bullets buzz like wasps and knifes slice the air in vindictive whooshes that scratch eyeballs.Tarantino, Miller and Rodriguez have given film connoisseurs a movie that will tickle their taste-buds. They have shown great innovation and new areas have been ploughed for future generations to mine and explore.SIN CITY is a landmark film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, it oozes class and style and will give you old fashioned entertainment. Stinky juveniles should stay well away and allow adults to savour this Pulp-Noir.Okay, I'll shut up for now...Recommended.	5.0	Film-Noir is back with a pulsating heart!	2005-06-22	4	3	1

078886047X	Sin City	AXOS8IWBXNZGT	"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi..."	This past Sunday, I went to see Sin City, another in my recent binge of comic-book-based flicks. The film is comprised of three main stories. One features an unrecognizable Mickey Roarke as a reformed ex-con enforcer-type, who's been set up for murder. Another features Bruce Willis as an about-to-retire straight-shooter cop, who takes the fall for a nasty crime he didn't commit. The last features Clive Owen as a defender of the Old Town ladies of the evening, who run into a spot of trouble when they off an abusive, seedy chap who turns out to be a cop. There's a large, talented, well-known cast...except for Jessica Alba, who's nice looking but I'm not yet convinced that she's picked up any acting chops.The movie's cinematography has the feel of a comic book, right down to its core. Everything's noir-ish, in primary comic-book colors, with odd camera angles that give it just that right feeling. The dialog is similarly stylized, and it's also pretty crude at times...not for younger children. Lots of stylized, noir-ish violence to be seen here as well. Just for reference, there's nowhere near as much violence here as in, say, Kill Bill Volume 1.All in all, I was pretty pleased with the movie. Surprised by how will Roarke did; it's been a long time since I've seen him in anything. Worth seeing...but don't be taking your kids.	4.0	City of Sin	2005-04-12	3	3	0

I've watched it a dozen times and am still blown away by the dialog and gritty throwback feeling it evokes of the old 30's and 40's hard-drinking, hard-fighting tough guys. It actually inspired me to sit down the night I saw it, and jot down the outline for a Film Noir type novel that's now moved to my front burner after completion of my third novel in my McCarthy Mystery series. I just hope I can write something half as compelling as Sin City.The film makes no apology for the raw lust and violence and yet never falls into campy self-parody.But it's the film-work, the use of light and shadow and especially color that really blows you away. Yellow for the corrupt, cowardly blood of the pederast villain.

078886047X	Sin City	A1MV5RJTPCUAEO	R. McOuat	"According to ""The American Monomyth"" by Jewett and Lawrence (1988), the American monomyth is an ""an archetypal plot pattern emerging in which a community threatened by evil is redeemed through superheroism."" The monomyth is summarized as ""vigilantism without lawlessness, sexual repression without resultant perversion and moral infallibility without the use of intellect."" The three heroes, portrayed by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke, are far from saints, but each resolves to reap justice from the moral wasteland called Sin City. Character development is simple. Males are psycho-killers with a soft-heart for beautiful women; women are cover-girl prostitutes with guns. Bad guys are the psychotic rapists with a penchant for dismemberment. Rourke, Owen and Willis must break all rules to save a woman whose main endearing attribute is that they were once nice to them.This is truly a comic book come to life. Darker and more gruesome than any predecessor, Sin City also more closely adheres to the comic book feel than its brethren. Unlike, say the Hulk, where the cartoonish animated comic book hero seems out of place among real landscapes and real people, in Sin City, everything is equally stylized so that nothing seems too real or too cartoonish. Cars jump hills, men take bullets in the shoulder, characters move in an impossible ways.In Sin City, there is no ultimate truth or final solution. Each hero undergoes a personal battle against inner demons and outer fiends. You don't feel like the city is a place you've been and the characters are not people you ever think you'll meet, but they are real and three dimensional. Sin City is simply the heroic tales of three super-powered psycho-killers saving three smoking-hot dames in distress.

078886047X	Sin City	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"First and foremost, SIN CITY is a treat for the eyes.  There's never been a movie that looks quite like this one.  It was filmed largely in front of green-screen sets, much like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  Unlike that dreary movie, which tried to make us believe the ""sets"" were real, SIN CITY tries to make us believe the entire movie is a comic book that's been animated.  It attempts a lot technically, and ACHIEVES it.  There are a few moments in the movie (the shot of Bruce Willis leaving prison, with snow coming down on him, for example) that are beautiful, pure and simple.  Others are whimsical.  Others give us vertiginous angles that wouldn't be possible in ""real life.""  The movie is worth a look just for the technical aspects.I've never read anything by Frank Miller.  I'm not a graphic novel reader.  But I am a fan of film noir, and what I loved about this movie was the way it melded ""old style"" film noir narration (a la the books of Dashiel Hammett or Raymond Chandler) with a modern sensibility.  The movie is also ultra-violent, but if you read something like RED HARVEST by Hammett, written in the 1920's, you see that streets running red with blood is hardly a new thing.The movie tells three (OK, four) loosely interweaving stories that are set in this metropolis that is utterly corrupt.  No one ""normal"" even seems to live there...it's populated entirely by corrupt cops, killers, strippers, hookers and psychopaths.  Some of them have hearts of gold, or at least, hearts that aren't totally black, and these are our heroes.  I don't want to delve into the details of each story, but I found them all fascinating, although the first major story, with Mickey Rourke as the disfigured tough Marv may have been my favorite.  I felt it most cleanly walked the line between humor, pathos and suspense.  His character was an original.Nearly everyone in the movie was terrific.  You can tell they were energized by taking part in Robert Rodriquez's little experiment.  Mickey Rourke was outstanding...too bad no one will recognize him, because this could be his comeback vehicle.  Clive Owen (whom I've always found a bit hard to warm up to) was very good...tough, vulnerable, funny.  Bruce Willis does his patented world-weary cop, but there's a reason he keeps getting parts like that...he's darn good in them.  Benicio Del Toro clearly had fun with his creepy role.  Elijah Wood, while not really called upon to ""perform"", certainly shatters his ""good hobbit"" image in this flick!The women don't fare quite so well.  The parts are somewhat underwritten and incidental.  Jessica Alba is the most important female character, and while she looks the part, her acting talents aren't totally up to snuff.  Not enough to make one cringe, but there could have been more depth.  Rosario Dawson really chomps into her role...she fares best among the women.  Alexis Bleidl is OK and Brittany Murphy overacts mightily. I know many will find the movie to be anti-woman.  True, women aren't portrayed in too great a light here...but you know what?  Men aren't either.  These people are all just shades of scum...some scummier than others.  But the women are also strong and can ""take care of themselves.""  So, if you want to argue the movie glorifies violence...that's one thing.  But hates women?  That's a non-starter for me.But this movie, primarily, is a feast for the senses.  A great overall visual look (Visual Effects supervisor:  Robert Rodriquez), great editing (Rodriquez) and camera work (Rodriquez).  Good musical score (co-composed by Rodriquez) and great sound work.  It's a dizzyingly fast-paced movie that never feels hurried.  There's always something fun to listen to or to see.It is VERY violent.  If you were turned off by KILL BILL,  you might be equally appalled by the violence here.  Absolutely not for little kids.  But if you want a visceral  treat, this is a MUST SEE movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and am ready to see it again!"	5.0	ORIGINAL and THRILLING!!	2005-04-05	3	2	1

The reviews on the back must have been paid for because for the life of me I cannot see why anyone would find it ""in an acclaimed and visually stunning hit that's the coolest movie of the year"". For starts the movie is in black and white and is done in anime (I think that is what it is called) where it is a ""life like"" cartoon. The actors are, sometimes, real but everything is else is cartoon-like. In some instances the lips, eyes, blood, car and in one instance yellow skin are in color. Color is used to accent something. I bought it because I like Bruce Willis. He's in the first story and it is 13 minutes long. Then there is a second story which was 34 of the longest minutes I've ever watched a movie. I have no idea how it ended, if it ended. The third story was so bad I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes. Seeing the movie was only half over I clicked further up the bar and came to a second part of the first story. This is where the yellow man showed up. Even though it was Bruce Willis it was BAD!!! (I bet he doesn't claim this movie on his resume.) Powers Booth was also in this part of the story and, though I like him, the movie was still bad. Not necessarily the acting but the plot and the whole thing. I usually like to watch a movie a second time and/or more because, sometimes, if you don't like it at first you do on a re-watch because you better understand what is happening. I don't think I can watch this movie again and am not even putting it in my collection. I may take it out and put it on the ""community table"" for anyone that wants it. I bet if someone took it it would end up on the table again. And again.

078886047X	Sin City	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Sin City (Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, 2005)A lot of people are going to hate Sin City. A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday. Yet only three days after its release, it sits (as of this writing) at #112 on IMDB's Top 250, and at least a smattering of critics have praised it. So there are at least a few people getting it.Sin City is old-school film noir. If you're not a big fan of sitting in arthouses watching revivals of old Joseph Cotten films that were just discovered in vaults after being undisturbed for sixty years, you're probably not going to get terribly much out of it. Much of what the critics have criticized in the film, especially the shallowness of the characters, is very much in the style of traditional noir, and as such seemed to me to be strengths, and not weaknesses, of the film. Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.All that aside, the one thing the critics have agreed on is the style. And what style it has. Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade-- certainly since Begotten, back in 1991. Unlike Begotten, which struck the viewer with its continuing unwillingness to give you a complete picture of what was going on, Sin City revels in clarity. While much of the film's violence is rendered in cut-away drawn shots, as opposed to the live-action carnage one expects from Rodriguez, the sketched-out scenes paradoxically heighten, rather than mask, the brutality. (Don't worry, boys, the nudity is all real, even if it doesn't include Jessica Alba.)From the standpoint of the plot, your best bet is probably to think of Sin City as Pulp Fiction on steroids. Rodriguez juggles the plots in roughly the same way Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction, but without as much parallelism. There's really not much to say about the plots; this is noir. Plot is secondary to style. There are plots, however, rest assured.To try and cover all the actors in this film worth mentioning would take a thousand words in itself. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Nick Stahl head the list for the macho component, and Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, James King, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel get the top billing for the ladies. And I've just scratched the surface. There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie. (When Josh Hartnett and Nicky Katt are that far down in the credits, you know most of the film's budget was spent on the actors, right?) For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road. The biggest of these is Michael Madsen, which came as quite a shock given that only a few months ago I was praising him to the heavens for making Kill Bill vol. II such a pleasurable experience. A number of parts are overacted, but once again, it's expected in noir. Mickey Rourke, especially, chews scenery in a way that hasn't been seen much since Charlton Heston stopped being a rugged male lead.Simply put, you'll either love it or hate it. How did you feel about the original version of The Desperate Hours? If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City. If you thought it was boring and overacted, well, you get the idea. Me, I'd sit through it again right now, if I weren't sitting here writing reviews. ****	4.0	Unsurpassed in its beauty.	2005-04-04	10	6	4
078886047X	Sin City	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.  From the moment it starts, the viewer is treated to a succession of characters and their bizarre adventures, which appear disjointed and non-sensical, but vivid with unbelievable violence, sudden death, and what are revealed to be intriguing clues to a bigger picture that is never completely explained.  It is filmed for the most part in black and white, a wonderful evocation of film noir and gotham, with occasional colors thrown in for unusual characters like the yellow man, or simply for splurting blood.The acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.  He is a sick cop, trying to do some good one last time, leading to an awful adventure.  His ward, a lovely young girl who grows into  Jessica Alba, is a pawn in a larger game that is unclear.  Then there is Micky Rourke, an extremely ugly thug who is out for revenge and crazy but also, the viewer suspects, perhaps redeemable even if he tortures some victims to death.Recommended.  I will definitely watch this again.  There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.  That is far better fun than a single-watch passtime film.	4.0	raucous, grotesquely violent, cynical, unbelievable, and very fun	2010-10-27	1	1	0

078886047X	Sin City	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"With the appearance of SIN CITY (I managed to see it at a preview the day before general release), we have what is easily the finest adaptation yet of any graphic novel.  Not merely that, this amazing film replicates the visual excitement, dynamic vitality, and dramatic stylization of the genre.  SIN CITY isn't merely based on Frank Miller's film noir graphic tales, but an astonishingly accurate translation into a new version.  For that reason alone the film would stand out as one of the more remarkable films of recent years.Thankfully, SIN CITY is much more than a mere screen equivalent of some superb graphic tales:  it is by any standard a film of the front rank.  The success can be traced primarily to two individuals:  director Robert Rodriguez and writer Frank Miller.  Most fans will know that Miller has long resisted having his works turned into film, until Rodriguez sent him a brief test piece that would have knocked the hesitation of even the most sceptical author.  Miller's stories pay homage to the entire film noir and hardboiled tradition that began with Dashiell Hammett and BLACK MASK magazine (and its imitators) and has continued all the way until today with contemporary masters like James Ellroy, but he also gives each story a remarkable twist, while embedding all in a mythological setting.  Rodriguez's genius is in finding effective means to reincarnate these stories digitally.  I have been a fan of Rodriguez ever since I saw EL MARIACHI when it first came out, a film that I still consider the best no-budget film ever made, and despite the cost of the film one that will stand comparison with most of the big budget films ever made.  I have followed his subsequent career with both delight and dismay, as he did a shockingly inferior Hollywood remake of EL MARIACHI in DESPERADO that was a pale imitation of the original, and then made a string of movies that were either good (the first two SPY KIDS films), interesting if uneven (FROM DUSK TIL DAWN), or perplexingly unsuccessful (DESPERADO and ONCE UPON A TIME N MEXICO).  None of these seemed to fulfill the enormous promise of EL MARIACHI.  This one does.  This is the kind of film that possibly signals the emergence of a very promising director to the level of a great one.  The movie truly is that good.The film features an impressive cast, but this is not an actor's movie and they add less than one might expect.  That is not to say that they are not used well.  Indeed, Rodriguez uses all of the superbly.  Some are almost unrecognizable under various prostheses, in particular Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro, neither of whom you would know was in the film unless made aware of it.  This film, in fact, represents something of a comeback for Rourke, who started off in the early 1980s as a hardboiled performer who seemed to have stepped off the pages of a Jim Thompson novel.  We've seen Bruce Willis do good things before (in addition to a lot of bad things), so his excellent job as a used up cop almost manically dedicated to preventing a young girl from being raped and murdered is no surprise.  Clive Owen, on the other hand, has been better in the past and will be better in the future.  One brilliant bit of casting was putting Jessica Alba in a key role (I'll skip the name because it would involve a spoiler).  I've always argued with friends that although Alba is without question one of the most stunningly attractive women in movies today, she is oddly not very good at being sexy.  Sure, she is sexy in that she has a face and body that are improbably perfect, but instead of radiating sex, she always manages to radiate sweetness and innocence.  You see her at length and you inevitably end up thinking, ""You know, she seems like she has to be a really sweet soul.""  That quality comes out here as well, and it tremendously adds to the believability of the story line of which her character is a part.  One actor whose presence is memorable even though it involved little contribution on his part was Elijah Wood as Kevin, who looks like a blend between a nerd and a manikin, but fights like a super ninja while sharing some of Hannibal Lecter's less appealing dietary habits.Each of the three major stories that are intertwined in the film revolves around a primary character acting as knight-errants.  In his foundational series of detective novels and stories, Raymond Chandler conceived of Phillip Marlowe as the modern, cynical embodiment of the medieval knight dedicated to fighting for damsels in distress.  Miller embraces this ideal completely in the three stories found here.  In Bruce Willis's sequence, he sacrifices everything to protect the innocent young Nancy.  In Mickey Rourke's amazing Marv sequence, a thuggish, seemingly indestructible, hideous brute of a man expends everything in order to avenge the death of a woman who has shown him a tiny bit of affectionate attention.  Clive Owen plays a man who struggles not merely for one woman but for a whole group of women.  Who said that chivalry is dead?Notice that I have gotten this far without saying anything about the technical innovations of the film.  Most will know that SIN CITY was primarily filmed by actors in front of green screens, with all of the backgrounds added through CGI.  SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW did this, though Rodriguez went so far as even to use digital cameras for the actors.  Some reviewers without having seen the film (look at a couple of the earliest reviewers here on Amazon, reviewers who clearly haven't seen the film) are so bothered by this that they automatically dismiss the film.  In fact, Rodriguez uses the CGI with great virtuosity, always using it to enhance and devolve the story, never to call attention to itself.  The CGI does give the stories much of the feel that one gets reading a comic, such as when Marv attacks two would-be hit men, shoving one into a brick wall, causing an indentation in it.  Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, however, the focus was always on the story and the characters, and not on the CGI.  The distribution company (Rodriguez is essentially his own studio, he and his wife operating on their own in Austin, Texas) complained about the film being in black and white, but it was a perfect choice.  There is a considerable amount of colorization, most of it to great effect.  For instance, in the opening sequence, a man is talking to a woman and mentions her eyes, and at the word ""eyes"" they go from black and white to a subtle green.I honestly feel that this film represents a turning point in several ways.  First, it might represent the complete shift from Robert Rodriguez from promising director to a full-fledged master.  Second, it could be the film that provides the model for all that follow in the correct use of CGI.  Third, it could serve as the pattern for future adaptations for the filming of graphic novels.  But all that aside, people need to see this because it is one of the best and most original films of the past couple of years."	5.0	Arguably the most original, brilliant film of the year	2005-04-01	17	14	3

There is little in the way of ""art"" here.  Unfortunately, I was suckered in by the professional reviews.  This is violence for violence's sake.  Pretty much period.  The acting is wooden, the script is lame, and there's no message to speak of.  But if what you're looking for is over-the-top violence, this is the movie for you (and possibly even the ""GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE"").  Oh, there are also a plentiful number of scantily clad or partially unclad young, attractive women.  And as the other reviews make clear, much of the violence is explicitly within the context of sex (or the sex business, or as a substitute for sex, or...).  Some of it was pretty disturbing.  Or it would have been if the visuals weren't done in the spirit of the original comic book rather than real life (oh, I'm sorry, ""graphic novel"").  Of course, that's the main drawing point of the movie, the linkage of violence and sex.  As repellant as I found this movie to be, they did do a excellent job of sticking to their main point.  I found it pretty darn misogynistic really, but it just may be your cup of tea.  Of course, the black and white visuals with splashes of color was an interesting approach, but not worth sitting through the movie for.

Bruce Willis is a cop that just can't cometo terms with the fact that he is aging and is just about outof the game.It's an action packed and gory thrill ride. Yes, it's a comicbook thing, but you believe in the characters and they feelreal. All three stories manage to keep your interested throughout the entire two hours. Out of all the stories I'd sayMickey Rourke is my favorite as the beastly looking man outto get revenge for the men that killed his hooker girlfriend.It's rare to have a movie be really good eye candy and actuallygood at the sametime.

I have to admit that the creation of the comic book atmosphere is well done, and the acting isn't bad within the requirements of the plot.  What turned me off was the over-the-top non-stop sadistic violence, and the total lack of any character that one could empathise with.  The film works startlingly well at creating its sick dirty world.  It just isn't a world that I think any mentally healthy person would want to spend time in.PS Judging by the percentage of people rating this review as unhelpful, I guess only fans of the film are reading this review!

078886047X	Sin City	AKELS44ECAVEB	"Rogue Fox ""Rogue"""	"It is hard to explain in words what kind of film,...... ""Sin City"" is !!! I could probably best explain it like this,... it has the outline of ""Pulp Fiction"", the style of ""The Matrix"", the darkness and gritty feel of the ""Spawn"" comic series; with a bit of a horror feel like ""Friday the 13th"", and the Jason and Freddy films during some parts. With bit of a ""Punisher"" feel as well, if you take a look in the movie. It also has the whole innovative comic like feel of ""Hell Boy"". Let me tell you if you saw the ""Kill Bill"" films; and thought that they weren't bizzare or violent enough. Chances are I probably just confused you and/or gave you a headache, but if you watch the film you'll see what I mean by all that.The film is based on Frank Miller's creation of the original ""Sin City"" graphic novels; with help from great directors(Tarantino, Rodriguez). Before, I watched the film I didn't real know what to aspect or hope for until, well I started watching the movie. I love the CGI animation, and the whole comic book feel. I never would of guessed that they were going to make a movie like ""Pulp Fiction"". If you never seen ""Pulp Fiction"", the set up is like this. You get multiple stories from different characters, and throughout the movie they will show how each of their different stories or points of view coincide into each other to form a circle which is called a story.In this film you'll hear the main tales of the old cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a rogue named Dwight (Clive Owen), and a big tough guy named Marv (Mickey Rourke); living in Basin city which is ran by a crooked gangster like major leaving the city in his dark shadow. I think that the black and white look makes it fell like an old gangster film; with a bit of imangination. There are many other charcters as well like Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, Eliah Wood, Devon Aoki, and some others.Hartigan(Willis) is an old cop on the verge of retriment; with some heart issues. He is up in years, but still as tough as ever. Hartigan is out on one last job, he must save a little girl from a mad rapist, who turns out to be the major's son. The major is crooked and of course has many connections; and would make his life a living hell if he attempts to save her. So he has a choice, save the girl and throw away the rest of his life or he can walk away!!! Hartigan can't just leave that poor little girl in the hands of a maniac, so he confronts him in a fierce battle. In the end he does save the girl; and manages to wound the major's son, but then he himself is shot up pretty badly and he thinks to himself ""An old man dies a little girl lives.... fair trade."" then the film fades into the next story.Marv(Rourke) is a tough guy; with a rough past is out for vengenace after Goldie(a hooker) is murdered. He wants answers, and is willing to kill his way to find answers. Marv is more like character like the ""Punisher"" a dark hero. Marv is obviously the most rememberable character. He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything; he in fact is able to take out 13 or 14 cops single handedly; thats what I mean by Matrix style. He even takes Eliah Wood's character a psho cannibal boy and manages to cut all his limbs off and feeds it to a wolf; which kind of tells you that this is no Pg 13 Marvel super hero film, and you probably already got the idea by the title of the film; and believe me nudity galore. This film is very dark and gritty with a ganster feel.Then you get to Dwight's tale (Owen) who is plainly a rogue. Who is pissed off at some guy who has been getting a little too clos to his girl(Murphy). He teaches him a bit of a lesson, but not sastified. He goes after him, and chases him into the other side of town, which is ruled by a bunch of wild Amazon like hookers; with assault weapons,.... boy oh boy. Well, they end up taking care of the guy; but he turns out to be an under cover cop. This act would indeed cause a war between the Hookers and cops led by the dark (King Pin like character) in a civil war. THat's pretty much where the creativity part comes in. He must destroy the edvidence, but on the way he runs into a lot of trouble. He must face rouge mercenaries, and must spill blood with his Amazon friends.Hartigan(Willis) is far from done yet though, he finds himself in jail being framed for the crime; he though refuses to testify, and keeps recieving letters from the little girl who keeps her idenity secret. He eventually gives in, after a bluff and he stops recieving letters from her. After 7 years he's back and he is able to track down her who has really grown up and turns out to be (Jessica Alba); he must save her from the mysterious looking man who turns out to be the major's son once again. Basically, Hartigan is the hero like redemption story and must finish what he started years ago.The world of Basin city is very complex and explict ""Sin City"" is very, stylish and entertaining film. ""Sin City"" though is a little darker for some people's tastes so you'll either absolutely love the film or absolutely hate the movie. THis film is awesome; it's just amazing to me that they were able to combind 3 graphic novels into an awesome combo such as this. 2 hours of fun. Yet, it's no ""Pulp Fiction"" by any means, and very different that anybody that saw the movie expected it to be.Overall I will give this film a 4/5, a great film with loads of style. ""Two Thumbs Up!!!""Acting: 5/5 I loved all the characters but especially Rourke's character, that character was pretty much made for him and heck Willis is an expert at playing the role of a cop; just see the Die Hard films.Presentation: 5/5! Loved the comic book style, with the Matrix/ Pulp Fiction feel. Like I said nothing quite like this not by a long shot. Absolutely loved the black and white gangster/underground feel as well!!! Kudos to (Tarantino, Rodriguez) and the creator Frank Miller.Showtime Value: 4/5 Great film!!! Very, fun to watch and is great buy for comic book fans or people who like action and violence and such. The film though is rated r fo a reason and may be to dark for some people. There were no bonus features as well. The film itself is a great buy for the right people.Overall: 4/5-Rogue Fox ""Rogue"""	4.0	Never Seen A Movie Quite Like This,.........One Of The Most Stylish Film I've Ever Seen !!!!!	2005-10-16	2	0	2
078886047X	Sin City	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2Robert Rodriguez' ""Sin City"" is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing).  The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe.  ""Sin City"" has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.""Sin City"" tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated ""super heroes"" (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity.  The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.""Sin City"" is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity.  The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested.  Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective.  As in the ""Kill Bill"" movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie.  The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film.  Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based."	3.0	generally effective comic book film	2006-04-30	3	0	3

Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the 40's.

Marv steals the movie, IMHO. Most of the movie is in black and white (as the comic). This is a beautiful movie to watch. It has a little Pulp Fiction feel to it as the stories intertwine (also, Bruce Willis is in the movie).The stories in the movie are all very gritty, violent and dark, mostly about people driven by revenge. A woman killed, a cop set up and jailed...not very hard to follow but made interesting by the way they tie together. All the acting here is well done and Frank Miller makes a cameo as a preist.

078886047X	Sin City	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	Sin City is the first movie of 2005 to actually get excited about; it follows the source material 99.9%(which is astounding for it's extremely violent content).  I've heard comparisons  ranging from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars but really the film stands all on its own.  An amazing and altogether unique moviegoing experience that reawakens us to the incredible possibilities of film.I'm not surprised that we have Robert Rodriguez (and of course, Frank Miller) to thank for this.  The guy knows how to make movies like no other.  I was impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's fanboy fueled Hellboy last year and with Sin City we get an equally impressive and awe inspiring realization of an underground comic brought vividly, and brutally, to life.Sin City is comprised of three books, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard.  I could almost swear that for some minor deviances due to film constraints and the insecurities of Jessica Alba (really, it wouldn't have killed you to be topless as Nancy the stripper for cryin' outloud!) the movie is a frame for frame reenactment of the comics.  It helps to have read the books first, just to fully understand what is being done.In 1990 Warren Beatty did a superb job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen and now, in 2005 we have Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wholly deserving of praise for their new noir masterpiece.  It's visceral, it's raw, and it's entertaining from start to finish.The casting is top notch, Bruce Willis as Hartigan; the truly underappreciated Mickey Rourke as Marv; Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe-they all do fine jobs.  But it's Benicio Del Toro who has the standout part as Jackie Boy.  He's funny, vicious, and unsettling all at the same time.If you're looking for hard boiled, white knuckle action with insane violence (we're talking gleeful overkill here) look no further than Sin City.  The first must see movie of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.  I'm hoping this makes a killing at the ol' box office because there are more Sin City books ready and waiting for the big screen.	5.0	"""Sometimes you have to kill a whole lot of people."""	2005-04-01	8	7	1

There wasn't much added in terms of extending the film, a few comical parts with Marv and longer credits, which honestly, who needs that?Special features are really nice, it's cool to see them break down parts of the movie especially the part that was specially directed by Quentin Tarantino in the car.Maybe it's because the film is mostly black and white (minus a few color accents, mainly red), but it looks really good in HD and worthy of an upgrade if you're a fan of the film or bought into the original release which was movie only with no features whatsoever.	4.0	One of the first great comic/graphic novel movies.	2012-10-08	1	1	0

I guess its just a acquired taste. I'll stick with Quentin as opposed to Robert. Never been a big fan of his except Desperado. And bewarned, this movie has a lot of sexuality in it.

078886047X	Sin City	A2UAOP0VUA12EQ	"Sam Allen ""A zealous individual"""	Sin City is indeed a five-star film-but knowing that this DVD doesn't have all the goodies that the special edition will have, this one's good for a rent. The movie is very faithful to the comics in terms of character design, atmosphere, and even dialogue, which is quite a nice first! The music didn't really seem fitting at first (you wouldn't expect to hear raspy saxophones at the beginning of an ultra-violent movie based on an ultra-violent comic), but eventually, it really blends in with the dark, gory atmosphere of the movie.But boy, if you take anyone under 15 to see it (I'm 16), you will live to regret it. It is SO violent, SO intense, that those with weak stomachs will not even be able to bear the soundtrack's hard jazz saxophone grunts and techno beats or the unrelenting violence that lasts throughout a vast majority of the two-hour film.One of the big plusses in the film is that even with such insane amounts of violence, it has a PLOT, not to mention the fact that it has a star-studded cast, filled with men that make girls cream and chicks that make boys (like me) salivate. And by that, I don't just mean Bruce Willis.The men that make girls drool include Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood (aka Frodo Baggins), Josh Hartnett. Clive Owen, and, for those older ones out there, Mickey Rourke and Michael Clarke Duncan. As for the chicks that make us guys drool, you got Carla Gugino, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls), Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba. All of them, among many others. Also, fans of Japanese animation from ADV Films should know Jason Douglas, who does a good job on screen as a hitman.Also notable is that the film really does well illustrating the atmosphere of the comic. For the most part, the film is in black and white, but certain color effects are used (in some instances) for eyes, blood, and (in one case) skin.But once more, take note: do NOT show this film to a child or watch it when a child is awake in the house it is being viewed in, and do NOT watch it if you are the squeamish type, it is the most intense, unrelentingly violent film I have EVER viewed.

078886047X	Sin City	A2CGWWK1XD2AND	Samanda b Jeude	OK, so i like Frank Miller.  I like his grittinesss, his unflinching way of looking at Reality, & his quiet confidence in the concept of Film Noir.  & i love Robert Rodriguez'  fun send-off of Kiddy's Films ala the quirky -Spy Kids- films, which bundled technical whiz-bang w/a family-friendly outlook.  So i expected Rodriguez' Heart, Miller's Soul, & gritty Reality from both.So why did i hate -Sin City-?  Because it's a loud [as in noisy!], unreal subsonic mess.  Rodriguez threw finesse out the window as Miller went for the juglar.  Heroes get shot, stabbed,  electrocuted, have heart attacks, get hung ... & keep on tickin'.  I actually  gt to the point that i *expected* Micky Rourke's & Bruce Willis' characters to survive their fates, & Clive Owens' to die.  *shrug*  & i didn't care any which way, which is the Real Crime in -Sin City-.Cars from nearly every era abound, guns waver from the Wild West to Terminator 3 glitziness, bad guys keep getting up after receiving several mortal wounds, technology staggers from one time to another - the hospitals are firmly set in the 50's [i know!  i've been there!], the med tech in the '00s [again, i've been there].  So ... the sense of 'timelessness' isn't there, just time=Everytime ... or, at least, every needed Time.  No rhyme or reason given, or i guess, needed.& then there's the subsonics.  I've walked out of films for playing subsonics [which i can hear], because they're a sign the filmmaker wants you to flinch [heck, that's why i no longer go to M. Night Shamalayan's movies; the subsonics in -Signs- told me he'd rather cheat that spook you].  & there are subsonics in -Sin City-, just enough to irritate me w/o driving me from the cineplex.  Or, just enough to spook a reveiewer i admire from being depressed w/o knowing why.Frank Miller was pleased i hear, because Hollywood Didn't Mess w/his Vision.  Damn shame, if it means that no1 told him he was looking waaaaay out of his field.  -Sin City- has its nice touches: the B&W; look of the film is *great* & Jessica Alba can't be beat as a tough kid in a nasty city.  But eye candy won't cure the lack of a soul or a real heartbeat in this cobbled-together Frankenstein w/no raison d'&eacute;tre.	3.0	Stark.  Brutal.  Stoo-pid!	2005-04-07	10	3	7
078886047X	Sin City	A37S3ACL57LN62	"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra"""	"When the movie title appears, the lighting becomes dim and the audience receives its first glimpse of the evil portrayed on the screen.Frank Miller's Sin City is highly stylized and very violent. It is based on a graphic novel, but is also reminiscent of film noir of the 1940s and 50s. This is evident in the use of voice-overs, crime and the personalities of the characters. The extreme loyalty of the film to the novel is refreshing after so many disappointing adaptations such as The Hulk and Daredevil.The film was praised for staying true to its roots. The novel was often superimposed into shots of the film to make the two as identical as possible.The characters are stereotypical representations of what one might expect from a bad neighborhood. All of the men are murderers, even the police. There are good guys and corrupt ones and their clashes result in death most of the time. The women are strippers or prostitutes who use violence to take care of themselves or who utilize their men to do the dirty work for them. The cast is exceptional with stars such as Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro and Nick Stahl. The characters are highly controversial and they hardly depict role models which is cause for some to question why such famous actors would want to be part of such a project. Director Robert Rodriguez said, ""Actors want to create memorable characters; they don't want to play themselves in movies over and over again.""The story itself is presented in layers. There is a short story with Josh Hartnett that acts as the very beginning and the end of the film. It is based on the short ""The Customer is Always Right"" and was created as a vehicle to sell the film to producers. The compelling story starring Bruce Willis ends and returns again after the two center stories. It is based on the short ""That Yellow Bastard."" There are two middle stories that only have one segment each. One called ""The Hard Goodbye"" stars Mickey Rourke as a Hulk-like do-gooder that constantly faces trouble. A second non-returning segment stars Clive Owen and is based on the short ""The Big Fat Kill."" Each story revolves around a man's love for a woman.Rodriguez was ejected from the Screen Actor's Guild for breaking one of the rules with Sin City, working with one or more co-directors.Quentin Tarentino appeared as a guest director and was paid only one dollar for his contribution. The style of the film is reminiscent of Tarentino's own work. The chronological structure of the film is similar to that in Pulp Fiction. There is even a homage to Reservoir Dogs when a man's ear is shot clean off. Tarentino's own fame has brought conflicting ideas about which scene he directed. The general consensus seems to be that he probably directed a relatively unimportant scene.This film is not for the weak at heart nor is it for women who easily get offended by films that might seem to degrade them on the surface. This film contains violence and female nudity. The nudity is not excessive and makes the film realistic.Violence is the most obvious element. It is so abundant that the film almost received a harsher rating than the R rating it received. The visual effects aid this dilemma. They make the amount of blood and the severity of the violence less intense. Some might say that the extremity of the violence is used to generate publicity. Male genitals are attacked several times throughout the film and cannibalism is an addressed issue. Each of these adds to the shock value. The film has been scrutinized by some for being too violent, but creator Frank Miller said, ""Chuck Jones got criticism for violence!"" referring to the creator of Wile E. Coyote.The visual effects were so unrealistic, they had to be done on a green screen. The film was shot in color and was later changed to stark black and white through a digital process.USA Today outlined the seven cardinal rules of movie-making that Sin City broke. These rules included never making black and white movies, never using voice-overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.Overall, Sin City seems to be a hit or a flop with people with no one in between. The sexuality, violence, and unusual film-making are certainly refreshing elements even if they shock instead of thrill."	5.0	Sin City Breaks Rules	2005-07-06	16	14	2

078886047X	Sin City	AQI2CW6UKF1ES	Samario C. Oliver	"I never ever read of or herd of Sin City, until I saw the comercial.  My friend tho', he wouldn't stop whinning about how much this movie was gonna suck because the men who directed Once upon a time in mexico, and Kill Bill were gonna screw it up, and that Frank Miller was nuts even considering to work with them.  But when the movie shut him up, he wouldn't shut up about, you gotta see this movie.  So I checked it out.Hartigan(Bruce Willis), a man sworn to protect the law, and a little girl, Marv(Mickey Rourke), a man who want's the one responsible for his only true love, and Dwight(Clive Owen)a man who has a reason for going to Old Town, are all the 3 main focuses on Sin City.  When things go wrong for the situations that happened for these 3 guys, they a;ways have that matality to prove that they're still worth a d@mn, but will it be enough to get them out of the situations they are deeply into?I love the movie's feel for bringing the comic book to life.  I only saw pages of the comic on the movie, but it just feels so much like a comic book.  I mean, this is nearly true comic brought to life.  The black and white CGI fast paced cartoon feel is definitly a upside to this film.  It also contains comic humor, like Jackie Boy's(Benicio Del Toro) slow yet utterly rediculas death, when Marv dragged a guy on the street by his car while driving, and Miho(Devon Aoki) throwing a shrukien that looks like something that will upset a certain group of people.  And the cool dialouge is also another factor that makes it stylish, and my personal favorite cones from Marv:""The hell I send him too must seem like heaven after I'm through with him.""Sin City is definitly a comic book brought to life.  My whining friend instantly fell in love with it.  He ownes all covers, and s trying to grab every poster made.  Me, I'm just glad I got the oppertunity to see such a fine crime-drama action comic style movie like this, and have enough money at the time to buy it.  I like this more than Spider-Man 2, The Crow, but it's hard to choose between this and Batman Begins.  But anyone interested in the Crime/Drama action or Frank Miller's Graphic Novels should definitly check this out.

After a couple of action sceneswith Mickey Rourke you'll just look at the violence as if it is fun like Tom and Jerry. When you reach that mood the cartoon based movie is definetely nice to watch, especially with so many colourful characters being there. However Sin City shouldhave been at least 30 minutes shorter as Rodriguez needs to use his brilliant trick with the violence for 3 story lines. After the second story line his trick I would have liked to see something else, but this is where the movie let me dow a little. (SARR)	3.0	Too long	2006-05-07	5	0	5

078886047X	Sin City	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	"One of the best movies of 2005, Sin City has action, horror, and spectacular visuals; all you need is a strong stomach and a twisted sense of humor.  I've never read the graphic novels, so I won't be doing a comparison to those, just a review from a happy moviegoer who loves it when style and substance meld together to form a visual treat like Sin City.The plot is simply mayhem and revenge, cops and criminals, in a dark world of concrete and sin.  There's lots of blood, Tarentino style, but most of it is in black-and-white so it cuts down on the squishiness.  The plot is not what you want to buy this movie for.  Buy it for the absolutely spectacular and stylized photography and visuals, and the stunning performances of the cast.Bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his ""Diehard-deadpan"" style.  Mickey Rourke is legend in Sin City as Marv, I doubt you will recognize him at first.  The hardest, baddest, meanest, toughest, most vile criminal on the streets, and someone you can root for.Clive Owen (King Arthur) puts his arrogantly serious handsomeness to work as Dwight, a man not to be messed with.  Dwight's Valkyrie, Rosario Dawson (Kids, Alexander) as Gail, gives a stellar (and stimulating) performance in naughty lingerie and a deadly attitude.  Benicio Del Toro (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Traffic) is excellent as Jackie Boy, a bad cop with a bad heart and a bad attitude.Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3) is awesome.  If you liked him in Bully, you will love him in Sin City as Roark Jr, later to become the golem-like yellow freak.And who can ever get enough of Rutger Hauer? (Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc)  Not me.  I love Rutger, and as Cardinal Roark, those deadly, cold, ice-blue eyes are soulfully used.Elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin; a part that you can just tell Elijah had fun with.  Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) can't act, but doesn't have to in the pretty part of Nancy.  Hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King) as Manute and Devon Aoki as Miho.Sin City uses voice-over narration, a third party telling of the action you watch on the screen.  This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.  Filmed mostly in black-and-white, the photography is reminiscent of Schindler's List, though 'List' used only one small splash of color and Sin City uses a bit more, the use of color is still limited to such minute and clever spatterings that the impact is still heavily felt.Using over-the-top violence, impossible feats of heroism, strength, agility, and prowess (Watch for Marv's driving scene and Miho's flying archery) and some very black humor, Sin City achieves a horror aficionado's Zen-like state of almost-nirvana.Really, forget the plot.  It's the photography, cast, acting, FX, costumes, stylization, props, and atmosphere that, alone, bring Sin City to five stars and beyond.  Sin City is a must-buy movie.

078886047X	Sin City	A2QAUMR0V33GC9	"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic"""	"Anyone whose read my other reviews can tell you that I HATE multiple DVD releases.  We all know it's either the studios or the filmmakers (probably both) trying to milk as much cash as possible from the fans.  Robert Rodriguez, one of the ""young turk"" filmmakers of the '90s, I think, now suffers from the ""Lucas Syndrome"" - that is, the ""I'm justified in making as much money as I can from my artistic vision because I worked my way to the top"" mentality that true all-around film artists develop once they become part of ""the Establishment"" they hated so much as youngsters.  Maybe so.  I'd believe this too if Rodriguez hadn't earlier showed himself to be all about the fans with his previous home-video releases.  Still and all, this guy really DOES deserve it to the extent that, unlike George, he's more ""hands-on"" than anyone in Hollywood because A: he wears ALL the creative hats behind the camera, and B: the man believes - REALLY believes - in outdoing himself creatively.Which brings us to ""Sin City"" - the theatrical cut, the ""director's cut,"" and the DVD's.  I feel, and this is just my opinion, that the bear-bones first home release was just to get a quick cash flow and tweak Disney for the way they treated the Weinstein brothers.  How else can you explain why Rodriguez would release a version with only the Electronic Press Kit (EPK) as a ""special feature"" (and the only one at that)?  Yet it was good for the movies' sake, because ""Sin City"" was yet another bold new direction for Sir Robert.  In many interviews he was quoted that the flaw of adapting comic book titles to the screen was adapting them to the realities of motion picture. Here, he made the film medium adapt to the comics, and created something new.  Something truly revolutionary in film.  Something that was disturbingly beautiful.  He did more than make four of Frank Miller's noir series work on film - he (along with Miller, who gets a co-directing nod) made film work around the comic's artistic motifs.This wasn't easy.  To do it, he had to film every single actor in green screen and create a reality around them; sometimes with noone to react to where they would be later seen to be talking to another person.  It's been done before - the beautiful but flawed ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" comes to mind - but here it works.For those who, like me, couldn't wait for the second cut (a mistake I WON'T be repeating with ""Blade Runner"") - one might feel resentful with having to purchase yet another DVD.  Well, put that out of your mind because, not only do we get all the extras goodness - studio featurettes, an interactive character's guide to Basin City, and the quirky Rodriguez behind-the-scenes ""film schools,"" green screen rushes, party footage, etc. - but we see the complete Sin City stories recut, added to, and retold, yet again in their original format.  Sure, they didn't add a whole lot of new footage, but what's there further develops the stories as Frank Miller wrote them.  With all this, you get a paperback reprint of ""The Long Goodbye,"" three new commentary tracks, and the satisfaction that this repurchase was WORTH the cash.Besides, worse case scenario, you can resell your first ""Sin City"" DVD used.  I guarentee you, with this cut, you won't need it."	5.0	For Those Who Felt Screwed By DVD #1 - The Big Fat Payoff	2006-09-08	11	8	3
078886047X	Sin City	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	"I rented this film and was not expecting such a thrill ride.  2005 came out with an exciting adaptation of Frank Miller's exciting graphic novel, Sin City, based on three of Miller's immensely popular and immensely gritty books (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard).I was first struck by the photography: the black & white noir, harkens back to Dashell Hammet's gritty crime scenes, a Mickey Spillane (crime novel writer to you kids) special.  The color'd items popped into view: green eyes, red lips and occasionally white blood -- decapitations and body limbs flying not withstanding.Jessica Alba is hot in this picture, just seeing her in the cowboy outfit rates a couple of stars right there.  Bruce Willis, the tough, arrogant cop framed for a rape/murder he did not commit, a linking of tale and trouble, seemless in its execution.I liked the guy who was in love with Goldie, who was murdered in his bed as she slept; the mysterious fella with the Harry Potter look who ate the souls (and flesh) of whores -- shivering in me timbers, I was.[SPOILER} Some parts were hard to follow:  Who was the guy in the beginning who murdered the woman on the balcony and who later appeared at the end of the film to confront our traitoress in the elevator?

Everything works like going from picture frame to picture frame. Even the color and dialog mimics the simplistic style and phrasing from a comic book.The movie is very violent but, this work is adapted from a very violent graphic novel. The violence should not surprise anybody. This is hardly for children.The stories are fun and suspensful. You will root for teh hero and wish nothing but pain for the villains.The best performance is from Micky Rourke playing a very violent thug that also has as soft place in his heart for women. He portrays the toughest SOB I have ever seen in film. I love the electric chair scene.This is a very daring, adventerous yet arty movie that worked, It should not be taken seriously.Other movies tried to be like a comic book (Dick Tracey, Batman, Superman) but this actually accomplishes it.

078886047X	Sin City	A3FNZQU6KBXWLM	Scott Delo	Sin City is fabulous at what it tries to be, a piece of noir fiction that let's us believe that the good will always win out over the bad. This film isn't realism, the art deco raindrops and exaggerated physical attributes tell you that. Instead, it provides us with a black and white world where the bad people are remarkably bad and the good people are bad as well. Only, the good people find something worthwhile to stand up for and that redeems them. I wouldn't want to live in Sin City but if Sin City did exist, I would want to know that Marv, Hartigan, Dwight and Gail are there to protect the rest of us. I enjoyed the film as a whole but have to admit that Mickey Rourke's Marv stole the show. Bruce Willis gave me pretty much what I expected and I found Clive Owen surprisingly good in a tough-guy role but Rourke was worth the price of the DVD alone. As a one-man killing machine, Rourke was exceptionally good. I'd always been a fan of his work but was disappointed with the direction his career took the last decade or so. Hopefully this is the start of a resurgence for him.	5.0	Mickey Rourke Rules!	2005-08-20	5	5	0
078886047X	Sin City	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"If this were a straight ""movie review,"" I'd give Robert Rodriguez's (and Frank Miller's) ""Sin City"" five stars.  But this is a DVD review, so the product itself gets a mere four stars.  Buyers beware -- there is a ""Recut, etc."" edition of this DVD that has a heck of a lot more in the way of cookies, extras, and all those other little treats that make DVDs so much fun.  This is a ""smaller"" DVD with fewer extras.  Make sure you're buying the correct edition.On to the movie.  ""Sin City"" throws the audience into Frank Miller's ultra-hard-boiled comic metropolis, Basin City (aka ""Sin City"").  One wonders how this city functions, as its only inhabitants appear to be cops (generally corrupt, with one lone exception), prostitutes (generally, with one lone exception, with hearts of gold), criminal scum, and corrupt politicians.  I pity the schoolteacher who works at Basin City Senior High School.A revolutionary use of digital filmmaking technology allows ""Sin City"" to be told in the same stark black-and-white color scheme that makes Frank Miller's graphic novels so much fun.  There are occasional blasts of color, but generally black-and-white rules the day.Fans of Miller's graphic novels will see no surprises in ""Sin City,"" other than the technical skill with which the filmmakers translate the comix to the big screen.  This is almost a shot-for-shot remake of three graphic novels:  ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard.""  There is also a very brief short story that sort of bookends the film, based on Miller's short tale ""The Babe Wore Red.""  These are essentially the same stories exactly as Miller wrote them in his graphic novels, only slightly truncated for time.But the tone is all there.  Miller's Holy Trinity appears to be ""Bullets, Booze and Broads,"" the title of his collection of short story comix set in Basin City.  And boy, does this movie bring the goods.I'll leave the summarizing of the plot for other reviewers.  I'll just give you my reaction.  ""Sin City"" is one of those movies that qualifies as a ""Great Guilty Pleasure.""  There's nothing ""redeeming"" or ""important"" or ""telling a story that needs to be told"" in ""Sin City.""  It's Dashiell Hammet's ""The Maltese Falcon"" for the 21st century.  The acting is all just this side of over-the-top, which qualifies as perfectly restrained given Miller's hyperbolic stories.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen . . . these are fine actors, but ""they don't do nuance.""  And that's perfectly appropriate.  There are several fine performances by the actresses, too, as Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba emerge as the most memorable amongst the bevy of beauties who live in Sin City's Amazonia, Old Town.All in all, ""Sin City"" is a thrill ride, the kind of movie where a man can describe his girlfriend as a ""Valkyrie,"" and it comes across as perfectly appropriate, given the hard-boiled circumstances.  Check it out, but just make sure you're buying the right DVD edition."	4.0	Good DVD for top-notch pulp movie, but better DVD out there	2006-01-23	4	4	0

Bruce willis is as always a tough badass. Mickey Rourke made his come back. He did a great job playing Marv. A criminal who is in love with Goldie who was killed, therefore he tries to find who killed her. Bruce willis is an old cop who tries to save a young girl. Even after many years when this girl was in danger, he still tries to help her out. Clive owen is the next big thing. He did a great job.

078886047X	Sin City	A14KWMUENAVP21	"Shyza ""Film Aficionado"""	"Frank Miller's immensely popular noir comic books come to the screen with the perfection of a skilled film-maker, a man that has made some wonderful films...and a not-so-good 3D film, Spy Kids. Sin City is the epitome of comic-noir, the psychedelic dream of pulp books and films. I have never read a comic so damn entertaining and grounded. And now I've never seen a comic-to-film adaptation so damn close to its source material.If you've never read a comic by Frank Miller, it won't matter when seeing Sin City. The tone is always dark and brooding, with a light comic touch, narrated in such a way as to mimic the style of a 50's crime novel. ""She smelled the way angels ought to smell,"" says Marv, a hulking brute, down on life, the center of one of the three stories in the film. A beautiful woman lies next to him on the bed, naked as the day she was born, and gleaming in full color while all around her is laced in black and white. She's dead. And Marv wants to know how and why. A whole world of corruption falls into his lap, pointing the finger at him, framing him, making him the fall guy. But Marv will get the truth out of somebody, and that somebody will have hell to pay.Another of the tales centers around a retiring cop in pursuit of a pedophile, one that gets off on hearing little girls scream as he tortures them and rapes them. But this pedophile is the son of a powerful and corrupt senator. Crap hits the fan, needless to say.The third tale is about hookers running a certain part of Sin City. The cops look the other way while they run the streets. One day all this comes crashing down when a sleazy cop is murdered by Miho, one of the many hookers running the area - she kicks butt like no other in this film, like something out of Tarantino's Kill Bill. Everything begins to fall apart, and it ends in a graphic bloodbath.Sin City is nearly identical to the comics word for word, shot for shot. Try reading one of the comics and then watch the film, you'll be amazed at the intricacy. The look of the film is all black and white, exactly as you would see them in the books. Hints of color pop out at you from time to time; blood is always red, eyes of a few beautiful ladies are blue or green, Blondie's hair is shiny gold. It is truly a masterpiece of design. Robert Rodriguez directs this film as if using Frank Miller's comics as storyboards, where all the shots were set up as many as fifteen years ago. The all star cast takes up the characters as if they were tailor-made for them when the stories were written. Anyone else not so gifted an actor could have put this film in the grave long before its release. Each actor's ability on screen shines forth with ferocity and dedication.Every shot, every scene, every nuance of Sin City is like a painted picture, one that can be free of its bonds on paper and flow with grace, creating a perfect whole of film noir and comic violence."	5.0	Film Noir meets Comic Violence	2005-10-03	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	"Sin City is definitely not for everyone. If a depressing, violent world with ambigious heroes and crime and corruption isn't your thing, you'll definitely like it even less with Sin City's stylized visuals and heightened gore, sexuality, and skewed morality. For everyone else though, this is definitely one of the more memorable films in recent years, and turns the genre of comic book adaptations into an artform. An all-star ensemble cast is directed by Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino!) against a green screen studio set, bringing to life Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel series. It's a fantastic mix of the technical and creative, and leaves you wanting more after the film's finished.The recut, extended, unrated, etc. etc. dvd collectors edition is both good and bad. The bad is that recut and extended doesn't really amount to much, and you'll definitely feel cheated if you go in expecting a radically different film (though you can watch all the stories individually now). The good is that like the other Rodriguez dvds, this one's loaded with great bonus features. You know, the kind that's informative, fun to watch, and isn't promotional fluff. Plus the package comes with a digest sized version of ""The Hard Goodbye"" so you can compare the film to the source material. A great value.Those who enjoy Sin City (and you can pretty much tell right away from the title if it's your kinda flick) will love this dvd set. Highly recommended."	5.0	Great film, great adaptation, great dvd	2007-05-08	2	1	1

Did you know its cheaper to make a movie in black and white? Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the ""he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea"" statement. The old 70's spider man series did this concept ages ago.Anyway. Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring. I am not a big KillBill fan either. I like Quentin Tarantino when he does stuff like ""from dusk till dawn""Sin city might be worth watching once, but I would not see it again.

078886047X	Sin City	AVI158V7UOB2B	Sir Cinephiliac	With any kind of movie, no matter how good the story is, it is essentially the quality of the cast which will make or break it, and in my humble opinion, the fascinating characters of Sin City couldn't have been cast any better.Rich and unforgettable characters such as Hulk-like Marv, brought to gritty life by Mickey Rourke, or Jackie-boy carried by the intense Benicio Del Toro perfectly conveyed the dark, sinister mood that kept me riveted.A huge surprise for me, was the part of Kevin, the cannibal, played by Elijah Wood. Sure, it surprised me that he was cast for the role at all, but more astonishing was that he played the part so convincingly. An actor that I until recently found difficult not to associate with a gay halfling named Frodo Baggins had broken free of that mold with simply an eerie, whackjob facial expression and a welcome muteness that lasted the entirety of the film.Indisputably the most eye-catching and gratifying scenes of the film were captured by the ladies. Oh yes, the ladies! Violent and ruthless, yet beautiful and seductive they were. 'Deadly little Miho', a slicomatic in the guise of an innocent cutie and insatiable 'valkyrie', Gail, the boss of whores, were just a few of the most captivating vixens to never leave my mind.'Not so little anymore' Nancy Callahan was simply mouth-watering to look at, and one hardly cared what came our of her mouth so long as the camera never left her. Alba, who fortunately did not have to rely wholly on her meager acting abilities (and with her looks may never have to), was in my mind most notable for her lusty bar scene.Lastly, it should be an indisputable fact that noone could have made a lesbian cop look as painfully sexy and alluring as Carla Gugino, who, from a purely libido-stimulating perspective, surely had the most worthwhile scene of the movie, and should, as far as I'm concerned, never have to put clothes on again... ever.To summarize, Sin City was a superb example of what the combination of great casting and a wonderfully dirty imagination are capable of producing. Thanks so much Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, and I am in eager anticipation of more sin to come.	5.0	Sin Never Looked So Good!!	2005-09-18	2	0	2

This Blu-ray has a nice amount of material to kick back and watch, and even has an interactive game, which while kind of cheesy was also cool.

078886047X	Sin City	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	Blood. Blood. And more Blood. But the gore, gore and more gore is often minimalized by an effect that shows the splatter in off white and usually only the carnage gets red treatment. In fact, the entire movie was in some cool variation of black and white with red as the predominant color that does not get black and white treatment. Oh, there's an occasional pair of blue-eyes here and there and other brief color treatments, but the film is mostly in the funky black and white.Sin City jumps around a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. The jumping is actually effective and easy to follow. The movie is the story of the pursuit of a couple of serial killers...one pursued by Bruce Willis, the other pursued by Mickey Rourke...and the story of a network of hookers...and how the pursuit of the serial killers and the network of hookers all ultimately interconnect.Captivating, very entertaining, and suspenseful at times. An original movie with a great cast. Worthy certainly of a rental. If you have to own, you'll likely get more for your money with the recut and extended edition, so I'd opt for that.	4.0	Comicbookesque..But Not a Comic Book for the Kids!	2005-11-01	1	0	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1TR9417Z4U72F	"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck"""	"Sin City isn't a perfect film; in fact it isn't even close.  It's hard to say inclusively that it's bad or good, because there are a lot of different aspects to the flick.As far as translation from book to screen, the movie is near flawless.  Rodriguez and Miller have managed to recreate Miller's heavily stylized comics on the big screen without losing an iota of the heavy black or stark white.  They also manage to keep the dialogue and internal monologue intact which are both a merit and a major problem with the film.  Most people who've read Miller's Sin City work don't make the connection to Mickey Spillane and Sam Spade, to Humphrey Bogart and the lingo of the Hard Boiled detective pulp novels.  So when they hear the dialogue in the movie delivered in such a manner it'll probably come off as comic or exaggerated.  People today just don't remember or care for the older genres that so many of today's writers and directors fell in love with as children.  People expect an update not a faithful homage.  Yet they complain when they feel a book to film translation isn't faithful.  Simply put, people don't know what they want.That being said, I think the film also suffers a little in it's editing.  Being so faithful to its graphic novel roots, I feel that Rodriguez failed to treat the three novels as individual stories.  The three chapters blur into one another in a slightly uncomfortable manner with only a change in narrator to tip the viewer that we are switching gears.  I think the film would benefit from titled chapters, ala Kill Bill, which would be in keeping with the source material.The film is also heavily CG'd, but I think that helps to define baSin city as it's own world just outside of our reality.  It also makes it easier to swallow the use of bright highlights of color and the exaggerated cartoon violence.I also feel the film was superbly cast with Mickey Rourke as a standout and Elijah Wood as a surprisingly creepy Kevin.All in all I think a lot of people are going to have a problem with aspects of the film that are actually quite faithful to Miller's graphic novels.  The ""corny"" dialogue, over the top unrealistic violence and action, the slightly cartoonish or simple characterization, all of these are in the Sin City books, and I think a lot of fans forgive this in the comics but won't in the film.  To me this points to unrealistic expectations of the adaptation to the silver screen, or more commonly, be careful for what you wish for, you might just get it."	4.0	Be careful for what you wish for, you might just get it...	2005-04-04	4	4	0

078886047X	Sin City	A1XVYE0A34BDKR	Southern Man	"My prediction: Sin City will become the Road Warrior of the next 10 years.  That movie also was considered a bit cultish on its release and wasn't a huge theatrical success.  But through word of mouth it became one of the most popular films among young and youngish males.  Sin City will do the same.This movie brings to life what comic books really feel like in the mind of the reader (albeit a comic book directed at young male adults).  Clearly the direct involvement of Frank Miller (author of the comic books) played a key role in the success, although I couldn't imagine a better choice for director than Robert Rodriguez.All of the stories are interesting and visually compelling, but very violent.  To me, though, the violence was not disturbing because it was delivered in a highly stylized manner.  It's impossible to explain the look and feel of the film because there's no precedent.  It succeeds (and then some) at what ""The Crow"" only hinted at.  Key to the success is that they didn't try to make this believable in a real world context.  There's a license to create a world that could only exist in comic books and that license is fully utilized.  The way people talk and act and the look of the world they live in is disturbingly unreal and that's as it should be, it's based on a comic book after all. There's no attempt, as in so many other comic book adaptations (Spiderman, X-Men, etc.), to make it appear that this is the real world and comic book characters just happen to inhabit our world. I like that.The stunner for me was Mickey Rourke in the opening of three loosely connected stories.  In this performance, Rourke does not appear to be an actor giving an impression of a character in a comic book world.  He makes us feel like a window has been opened and we are watching someone who lives in that world.  A truly stunning performance.This film no doubt has many detractors who aggravate over excessive violence, misogyny, etc.  These people don't get it and should stay away from a film like this in the first place.  Sin City is making no attempt to please everybody.  To me it's refreshing that someone took a risk instead of making movies by polls and committee, which is how so many awful movies get realized.  I can't guarantee that you'll love this movie.  But I can pretty much guarantee that, if you read all the reviews and know what to expect going in, and you still decide to go ahead, then you will love this."	5.0	This generation's Road warrior	2005-11-01	3	1	2

It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder. What makes the movie so eccentric is the black and white effect in addition to the bizarre characters, especially Marv played by Rourke and Kevin played by Wood.I can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.Sin City is a comic book come true!RecommendedA	5.0	A comic book come true!	2006-02-18	3	0	3

078886047X	Sin City	AZQ6PYDEJQJEF	"Staring Girl ""Staring Girl"""	I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, as far as comic book movies go, this was perfect. The script was the comic book; it followed it exactly. This is the only way Frank Miller would have had it. He's been approached for this movies several times in the past but rejected doing it simply because he wanted it to follow exactly to the comic. He didn't sell out like a lot of other comic book movies do. It's not Hollywood-ized at all. Perhaps this is why so many people just don't get this movie. If you view this movie as if you are viewing a comic book, then you get it. It is a film like no other.Robert Rodriguez and Miller (who shared directing duties) did an amazing job with the filming. I love the way they used live actors with CGI backgrounds. The whole film (like the comic book) is black and white with touches of red and yellow. For example, in the beginning scene of the movie everything is black and white except for a woman's vibrant red dress and lips. This paints a very somber mood for the movie.I don't think they could have picked better actors for the roles of the characters. Everyone did a superb job. Elijah Wood was just down right creepy as a maniac who eats women and hangs their severed heads on his wall. Mickey Rourke just seemed at home on screen. He was perfect for the role and it just feels like he was the heart of Sin City; like this is where he lives. Bruce Willis is finally starting to play his age. In this he played an old cop with a heart condition. He's on the verge of retirement when he gets the biggest case of his carreer involving the senator's son. Then there is Clive Owen who plays the hard-guy who helps the prostitutes with a crocked cope played by Benicio Del Toro. Everyone just seemed to have fun playing their role and it was entertaining to watch them.From start to finish, this movie thrusts into momentum. There is no down time or lulls. Be forewarned though, the title is a dead giveaway for what you're in store for. There is nudity, prostitution, violence galore, cussing, killing, raping, kidnapping, eating, severing, bashing, dimembering...you name it...Sin City has it.	4.0	What a naughty hobbit!	2005-09-06	2	2	0

078886047X	Sin City	A166X8E096D1YG	Stephen D. Schnee	Although Frank Miller's The Spirit has been recieving terrible reviews, you can't deny the majesty of this movie!  I could go on and on about all the different aspects of the film (including the beautiful women!) but [..]sez it better:Review by Jeremy WheelerAs far as comic adaptations go, Sin City is an unprecedented book-to-screen translation that's locked, loaded, and rip-roaring ready to introduce movie audiences to the mad genius that is Frank Miller. By meticulously re-creating the acclaimed comic creator's most personal work, co-director Robert Rodriguez has given Miller's creation the chance to live and breathe using the exact hard-nosed dialogue and iconic camera shots from the acclaimed graphic novels. The end result is a mad brushstroke of digital filmmaking that is risqu&eacute; enough to be considered bold, while palatable enough for exploitive entertainment purposes. It remains to be seen what the unprepared masses will think of Sin City -- in fact, there couldn't be a better, more PC time for the flick to hit. Basically a slap in the face to neo-conservative ideals, the film is so full of gleeful graphic violence and raw, steaming sexuality that there's sure to be some kind of backlash somewhere. The cast is a knockout, with major kudos going to Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and even a smaller, supporting appearance by Rutger Hauer as they fulfill their inspired casting choices and take delicious delight in this world of corruption and sleaze. The stark black-and-white visuals are the real star here though, merging film noir sensibilities and dynamic comic panel storytelling with the help of a heap-load of computer graphics and inventive filmmaking to create something that's new, raw, and refreshing. Additionally, the direct translation is both exciting and a bit jarring, lending an unusual pace that you don't see in modern cinema; just as the gusto violence will turn off many and probably create more cynics in the critical circles, so too will the film continue to polarize its viewers due to its experimental nature. Comparisons will no doubt be drawn between the page and screen for years to come, which might hurt the film simply because it is an adaptation and no matter how direct a translation it is, there's bound to be things that are lost in the process. Still, after years of being jerked around in Hollywood, Miller is finally given the tools to strut his stuff on the big screen and, love it or leave it, perfect or not, that's exactly what Sin City is.	5.0	Stunning film...	2009-01-08	1	0	1
078886047X	Sin City	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"First of all, this Robert Rodriguez film of Frank Miller's graphic comic books is mostly in B&W;, not color as advertised.  This is ideal for the material, but may have accounted for deserted theaters the second week of its release.  It is a brutally violent film noir, co-directed and co-written by Miller and Rodriguez; Rodriguez, who also cut and photographed this baby, wanted a flawless translation of Miller's inky B&W; comic book novels.  So, we have a movie that is 90% B&W; and incredibly violent.  Let's get that out of the way up front.Basin City at night becomes a nightmare film noir city of awful violence and evil characters, in B&W; with dabs of color now and then--a red dress and red bedspread, a woman with gold hair, a zombie with bald gold head, a blue car--in an otherwise B&W; landscape.  The art direction and visual effects are stunning and make SIN CITY worth recommending.Rodriguez and Miller basically have three stories to tell that all take place in Basin City at night--(1) Bruce Willis as a retired cop with a bad heart who wants to save exotic dancer Jessica Alba; (2) a heavily made-up Mickey Rourke as a prizefighter out to avenge the death of his beloved girlfriend; and (3) Clive Owen in a very complex tale of Old Town prostitutes and a guy who wants to save one of them from psychopath Benicio Del Toro.You will probably either love or hate SIN CITY, and know which after only five minutes of screen time.  It is exceedingly brutal and nasty, but also has towering production design, stunning visual effects, and unusual characters.  It is the kind of movie that Leonard Maltin can hate, while Ebert & Roeper can give ""Two Thumbs Way Up"" to.  When it opened, the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's Mick La Salle gave it ****.  If you like the Frank Miller comic books, you will probably find it a masterpiece.  On a too short behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, Miller says he is floored by how faithful Rodriguez is to the source.  That is why Rodriguez brought him on board as co-director, which cost Rodriguez his membership in the Directors Guild.  Things must have deteriorated inside the DGA since Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly co-directed ON THE TOWN (1949) and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952).

078886047X	Sin City	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	"Sorry folks, more summaries of the story lines have been published here already so this review will focus only upon the quality of the movie's transfer to blu ray.  Only 1 disc in this Blu Ray package.  I do wish Amazon would separate the Standard Def reviews from the Instant Download reviews from the Blu Ray reviews.  It would greatly help those who are trying to find qualitativereviews focusing on what they hope to read.VIDEO....Watching the video on a new Panasonic ZT 65"" Plasma set was an epiphany of incredible color grading.  Blacks are as deep and dark as you can possibly get to true black without that hint of grey found in so many discs and other monitors.  Colors literally pop off the screen with dynamic force and details, even in the darkest of areas are outstandingly produced.  At no point did I see even the slightest hint of artifacting and even though the CGI moments, of which there are many, are present and clearly discernible, they actually contribute to the graphic novel feel of this film.  On another note, when I first saw this movie on a rental disc I didn't care for it.  Then I bought the Standard Def DVD on a big sale and liked it a whole lot more.  Now on Blu Ray, and still at a $7.99 price at Walmarts, I am very happy to have this film in my Blu Ray collection.  It's funny how opinions can change after a few viewings.AUDIO...The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is top of the line.  Not only is the dialogue clear and transparent but the audio editors made full use of the entire 5.1 audio system with a great amount of discreet channeling to the front and rear side speakers.  I watched it on a 7.1 system with the 6 & 7th channel muxed from the rear signals to create a greater audio immersion but even with a 5.1 system, which is what most folk have, you will not be disappointed in the dynamic audio mix.  Your LFE sub channel will be put to use throughout the film as well with deep, guttural bottom end.EXTRAS...While I have yet to watch these on the blu ray disc, they appear to be the same as was on the Standard Def DVD.I do hope this type of review has been of assistance and help to you in deciding your purchase as all my reviews focus solely upon a Blu Ray's transfer quality.Thanks for reading."	5.0	Sin City on Blu Ray	2013-11-13	7	5	2

078886047X	Sin City	AJN24TVEGZEI4	Steve	"This movie is an absolute must get.  It is one of the best movies you will possibly see and is amongst the best graphic novel based movies you will probably ever experiance.  The movie pays tribute to the great film Noir genre, throughout the movie, the director utilizes a series of predominantly black an white color palates while using color only for specific ""popping"" effect.This movie has a wonderful gritty, deep, feel that perfectly portrays the dark underworld that it is narrating.  The cast in the movie is phenominal, and the acting is amazing.  This movie has the best of all possible worlds in movie making.. it has violence, a deep story line, sex, and action that keeps you wanting more and more.  The beginning scene of the movie leave you begging for more, the end scene leaves you stunned and the middle is just unbelievably amazing.I have never read the graphic novel, seeing this movie certainly pushed me to go out and get it.  I absolutely loved this movie, and you will too, it is phenominal.. no plotholes here!  GO AND GET IT!!Just a note if you can get the unrated collector's edition.  Appearantly movie companies think that people want an edited, censored version.. WTF, I hate when movies are censored and edited so they can make the R cut.. Just give us the unedited movie to begin with with a choice in teh menu for the edited version.. But no, they feel the need to double dip and make double profit off you...

078886047X	Sin City	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	"The film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.Movie/DVD Grade: B"	4.0	GREAT VISUALS, WEAK PLOTTING, GOOD PERFORMANCES!	2005-10-16	2	1	1
078886047X	Sin City	A1U4V6I5Z71M0M	Steven Kawano	Okay, for all of you who are whining and moaning that this movie was too violent or that the women in it were all whores (they may have been prostitutes but look how freakin' strong they are, they don't take crap from anyone as is obviously shown in the alleyway scene!) I have one question for you: What did you expect when you went and saw it?! All you have to do is look at the title of this movie, it's called SIN City, it's not gonna be some stupid G rated Disney movie! I obviously Loved this movie, it was so different (and as we all know sometimes that's a Bad thing!) but it really worked, I've never read the comic books but I loved it all the same, the acting is good, the stories are interesting and exciting and it's just beautiful to look at. I highly recommend seeing this movie.	5.0	What did you expect?!	2005-07-11	12	8	4
078886047X	Sin City	A359IT81FBX64Y	Steven Mason	There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.	2.0	Miller's Maniacal Manga	2005-09-21	19	13	6
078886047X	Sin City	A2KAOY6VB9ZAOW	Steven Piek	I'll have to admit movies as of late have either been huge successes or major failures. You could say over the last 5 years maybe only 3 to 4 movies a year really stand out in people's minds, out of the hundreds of releases per year. This is bad, since movie ticket prices have risen quite a bit over the last few years too, making it hard for us to sleep at night after dishing out the coin for a crappy flick.Finally, though, Sin City came out. After seeing a teaser trailer on TV, I was instantly interested in seeing this movie. The trailer seemed made perfectly to attract the way-ward movie goers into seeing something, finally, worth seeing. I had no fore-knowledge before gonig to see this movie. I had not read any of the graphic novels from Miller and had no idea what any of the characters were like. I was imopressed with how well all of the characters were introduced and explained. The twisting sotry-lines did not take away anything from the over-al flow of the movie.As far as the black and white with hint of color(only at special times) was a great idea. Artisticlly it was a great turn for a graphic comic translation. Where as the Hulk, just plain made me cry when I saw it. Comic book movies have been a huge hit over the last 3 years. Startnig with X-Men back in 2000 then going to Spider Man, X2 and Spider Man 2 as well. Although Sin City isn't as big a commercial success as Spider Man or X-Men, the movie is sure to draw people to the name Sin City.If there is one flaw with this movie, I'd say the story is a bit drawn out in some places. And there is a bit of confusion at some points which make you stratch your head in wonder, but it does not take away anything from the over-all flow of the movie.Sin City is a great movie of 2005, right up there with Batman Begins and Star Wars Ep 3. Take a view of this one, it shall stand out.	4.0	Almost perfect movie for 2005	2005-08-12	5	3	2
078886047X	Sin City	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance you have of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voiceover narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but are instead distracted by a never-ending string of ""hard boiled"" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed truly to capture them. These could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - nor himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page, he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual style. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film that's technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core.  And violent. Violence is justifiable in the context of a story, but this whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity and meaning.  And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it.  Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it, nor refresh it by flipping it into an unexpected context (as Rian Johnson did so effectively with ""Brick"".).  Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love.  But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take that claim seriously."	3.0	Technically interesting, but no heart	2005-07-30	8	4	4
078886047X	Sin City	AM71STVDHO48S	Stoddard76	"After I first saw ""Sin City"" I was astonished at how amazing it was. This is not a movie based upon the Frank Miller comic; this is Frank Miller's comic itself. The film breaths, speaks and looks just like the comic's very people and locations; whole scenes are exactly as they appear in Miller's book. Simply astounding! Furthermore, the special effects (most of the movie was filmed against a green screen) are seamless and create a look in the film that is absolutely beautiful. I also love the fact that Robert Rodriquez insisted that Frank Miller work as a co-director in the movie (along with Quentin Tarantino) much to the chagrin of the director's guild. The result is that the film retains all the richness of Miller's vision and style (unlike movies that promise a faithfulness to a particular author but in reality never deliver the proverbial goods-""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" by Francis Coppola comes to mind-what a piece of crap!).My only caution is that if this is a movie you want to purchase for your child; don't. This is not a film for children-""Sin City"" is definitely for mature audiences only. At any rate, along with ""Batman Begins"" ""Sin City"" is the best comic book movie I've ever seen. This is not an overstatement or exaggeration. You will not be disappointed.Caesar gives two enthusiastic thumbs up!"	5.0	BEST Comic Book Movie EVER!	2006-01-03	6	5	1
078886047X	Sin City	ADE9OU2OLWS3N	Stone Cold Nuts	This was more violent and sadistic in content than I was prepared for, but that's probably a natural hazard when you're turning comic books into films.  The major weakness was that the individual stories were not adequately tied together at the end, and that reveals some weak scripting and a lack of immagination that otherwise flooded the screen.  The separate plots in, for example, Heavy Metal, were linked in a fashion that gave me a chill (or two).  Brilliant imagery, brilliant dialogue at times, and well packaged...but no chill.	3.0	Heavy Metal-ish Film Noir?	2007-11-18	0	0	0

Unfortunately, in each case the woman is someone who they either don't know at all or have only just met - so as motivation this is totally unbelievable.Frank Miller's Dark Night Returns had a lot more depth than this.  Perhaps Miller is running thin on ideas and is repeating himself.  If the two planned Sin City movie sequels are made, perhaps he will redeem himself with a broader range of character types with more depth and believability.	4.0	A Shallow Masterpiece	2006-08-06	5	4	1

078886047X	Sin City	A1QVARU29455D0	Stuart W. Liming	Frank Miller does not like women.  I'm firmly convinced of this, as every woman here (and most if not all in his comic book epic this is based on) is either a stipper, prostitute, or college professor.And the college professor died before the movie starts.Despite this, there are no real weak female roles.  While they all have less than respectable professions, they are all strong, unique characters, and I think that pretty much lets Frank off the hook.In a more general sense, this movie is about a film noir kind of town.  Guns are everywhere, blood and death abound.  Howeveer, the visual style of it all is so compelling that it looks remarkably similar to the comic opus.  Strong uses of black and white keep everything graphic, but not gory.The movie is actually about 3 character's tales, that intertwine on a very superficial level.  You can tell they all inhabit the same city, but rarely get in each other's way.  That said, this film is a work of art, in that it is visually compelling and wonderfully written.  It is gritty and violent, but there is a beauty to it all.	5.0	Gritty, violent...but beautiful.	2006-02-10	5	1	4
078886047X	Sin City	A1W3FS1C2H4RCV	stu	"I have never read Frank Miller's Sin City comics.  I was only vaguely aware of them when I saw the ad for the film.  I just thought that the imagery in the commercial was striking and so I went to a matinee.I have read in other reviews that the movie is more of a recreation than an adaptation of Miller's comics.  Now, as I have stated, I don't have any first hand knowledge of this particular comic, but I have seen enough comics to know that this is the most faithful and evocative depiction of the comic strip form that I have ever seen on film.  Visually, Sin City is stunning.  It is a comic strip come to life.  The only thing is, this comic is dull.  Not just dull, but dumb.Miller may have a gift for drawing, but he is no story teller and his prose is heavy-handed.  Sin City is Film Noir because it deals with hard boiled guys and urban settings and violence and underworld themes but it seems to have more in common with low-budget sleaze than with The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep.  Actually, I really like some low-budget sleaze and as a big-budget ""low-budget sleaze"" film, this movie is great.  All the men are old and surly.  All the women are barely clothed and are either innocent virgins or callous whores.  The bad guys are really bad and hold all the chips.  The good guy is washed up and cynical and has nothing to lose.  The violence is great,  Thank goodness for the violence.  It's all over the top (think comic book) and fun and there isn't much squirm factor.This review turned out much more negative than I had planned.  I enjoyed Sin City.  I just had to get used to the idea of absolutely no intelligence and then I settled in and enjoyed the spectacle.

078886047X	Sin City	A2267FFVZR8PSB	"Stupidface ""Stupidface"""	This is one of those rare films where it's best qualities aren't its worst. That only happens in cinema everytime the opposite fails to take place. Having said that, I think every viewer should know something about anything before sitting down to invest time into sitting down (with this movie, naturally).The story starts out with several related elements, and the scenery only enhances itself. Throughout, the erudite viewer will no doubt pick up some elements of the plot that weren't immediately evident before the movie began. But this is a small price to pay for something that's worth more than the paid price!By the way: don't look for any cameos by my friend, Jerry, because he doesn't even live in Sin City.Shrimpboat Lou	4.0	Torn between two lovers!	2005-08-18	13	3	10

078886047X	Sin City	A15MPXKU6SXLES	"Sunny Skies ""readaholic"""	Let me start off by saying, I have never read the books/comics this movie is based on AND I had read all the hype about this movie. WARNING: This is a VERY violent, bloody movie like the ones mentioned in the title.Having seen some trailers and clips on the review shows I kind of knew what to expect. I thought the style was quite interesting, black and white with touches of color. The narrative style reminded me of some of the old private eye radio shows. There were some that had a problem w/the way the women were depicted but I figured a movie called Sin City probably didn't have too many saintly figures, female OR male.The opening vignette was surprising, but probably the only relatively bloodless scenes in the movie. The blood spewing goes up from there. The story is told in several vignettes and the characters overlap into subsequent stories. Let me say the violence is relentless. There were several times during the movie I had to pause it to take a break. About 2/3 of the way through I told my husband I had seen about enough. I listened and glanced at the rest of the movie while cleaning up the kitchen. There were some interesting stories. I did not mind the voice over. I did wonder what the deal was with the Mickey Rourke character that could not seem to die, but you never found out (maybe the books/comics explain this). I just went with it and it did not bother me, just curious about him.I think this kind of movie probably does not require phenomenal acting skills, since the characters are comic-book-like and the stories come off that way too. I very rarely watch violent movies, especially if there is gratuitous, unnecessary violence (Jason movies, HellRaiser), but I can appreciate the stylized, unusual look of the film and the stories vignettes were interesting.	4.0	If You Like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction - You Will Like This	2006-01-23	2	1	1
078886047X	Sin City	A3CJBYR9PSXORU	Sun Tzu	Sin City is the closest that mainstream US film has come to capturing the essence and appeal of graphic novels.Visually stunning, each frame of this movie is highly stylised, no less than a work of art in itself, to closely resemble the style of the graphic novels themselves.It is ultra-violent, this is Pulp Fiction on steroids, and will likely thrill or disgust those who love or hate the likes of Kill Bill.I loved it.It is set in the twisted environment of Sin City, part modern day, part film noir era, where among the heroes are Marv (Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk of a man on a trail of vengeance) and Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis doing the kind of role he was made for).In short, you can't take it too seriously and I find the violence totally inkeeping with the style of the movie and the work of Frank Miller.It's obvious that this production has gone to pains to be faithful to its source material. Therefore to make something that didn't have comic-book action and ultra-violence would have been a real sell-out.Fans of Frank Miller have been waiting a long time for a faithful translation of his work to the screen.Back when Miller produced the Graphic Novel - Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I remember people having some hope that the remake of Batman would carry some of that film noir appeal and gritty themes.What did we get? Michael Keaton in a rubber suit.So I don't think people griping about the level of violence in this movie is really a legitimate criticism. Like Tarantino's movies, the violence is a dramatic device, and also a vehicle for humour.I watched this movie with someone who doesn't know the work of Frank Miller and has little love for screen violence, but they really appreciated the design, art and style that went into it.Plus, the storylines and source material are great with plenty of twists and turns that you rarely see in mainstream US movies these days.I really hope this movie will spark off sequels and other faithful adaptations of graphic novels like those from Frank Miller.Just to say it again - I think Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are outstanding in this film and are perfectly cast.This movie is a triumph and hopefully sets a new standard to be matched by future productions.

Even though each character in the story has very little screen time. The characters(to me at least) that have the most screen time are Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Rosario Dawson. They have very important roles in the movie. There screen time are in different segments of the movie and all these different events are happening over a period of 1 night. There is a cannibal in this movie played by Elijah Wood and he eats people. Its really scary and the violence is so bloody even though the movie is only in Black, White, Yellow, red it shows some skin tone to Jessica Albas character at the bar. Many of the other characters including Alba dont have much screen time. But Jessica Alba just ties the whole movie together. Its very interesting and a little bit bizarre. But my favorite part of the movie is the segment ""Big Fat Kill"" its where Clive Owens character is very angry by the way Jackie Boy is treating his new girlfriend Shellie. He wants to get rid of him Shellie his very abused by him but she takes it. He finally says he is going to kill him but as he jumps 5 stories out of the apartment building she screams stop but she was really screaming cop. Jackie Boy wants to attack a hooker so he chooses Becky(Alexis Bledel) then soon all the hookers gang up on him and finally kill him but then they dont realize that Jackie Boy was a cop and when a cop gets killed other cops join in and get rid of all the hookers. They want to stay calm So all the hookers decide to go home Becky goes and she is actually telling her mother whom she loves dearly that she isnt a hooker and she is always talking to her on the phone every night just to hear her voice but not this time she goes and tells the police department what happened. Gail gets really angry and then Dwight(Clive Owen) comes to save the day. Finally the whole entire police is dead Becky gets shot in the shoulder but she doesnt die she hides in an alley to escape all the gun shots and finally the big fat kill is over. That was my favorite Segement. Their are other segements involve other characters. This does have some confusing parts but it is indeed a very good story. At the end Becky gets out of the hospital with a sling and a bandage over her neck because gail bit her there. Shes still talking to her mother when a doctor who is actually a hit man is in the elevator with her and nobody else. Suddenly he says Becky do you want a smoke and she gets really scared and shocked then she says a dramatic I love you to her mom and she knows that will be her last conversation with her mom. the audience assumes that either Gail or Dwight hired him to go and kill Becky. It can be really confusing but i loved it anyways."	5.0	I LOVED IT!!!	2005-11-27	7	2	5

Blood gushes everywhere as a sadistic murderer is hacked to death and violently dismembered. The screen is equally splattered as other characters take multiple bullet wounds without dying, in true comic book form. The nude scenes are not as graphic, but are cartoonish. Mickey Rourke offers his best performance since ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,"" while Bruce Willis shines in his best movie since ""Hudson Hawk."" The plot, which consists of several interweaving stories, is outlandish, and ultimately the movie doesn't hang together so well.

078886047X	Sin City	A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP	Takis Tz.	"Not surprisingly most of the rumours circulating about this film (as it is with most films for that matter) were inaccurate. Not all, but most.It was supposed to be ultraviolent to the point where it could disturb some viewers. Not the case. Aside of one single scene everything else we've seen before on this violence level. In fact, to me this film worked more as a very dark comedy than anything else.Then again it turned out being very close to an art-noir film, something not included in all the talk before the film was released. It has all the characteristics of being artsy: clever and intriguing use of color, surreal city-scapes etc.Where it falters is (again not surprisingly) in character development. Keeping in mind that it's based on a comic, we should rememebr that when one reads a comic he builds the characters himself. You tend to attribute traits to characters as you read a comic or a book because your imagination plays a much more active role compared to watching a film. It's the difference of the medium that dictates this.In Sin City most of the characters are shallow with the exception of Bruce Willis who's given unequally more depth than the rest. At some point it all gets too close to a very stylistic but smallminded slug fest where body parts are flying away , various characters are blasted to smithereens, chopped or gunned down.But still the film works, mainly because of its unique premise that there's no hero on the good side involved. Everyone in Sin City is a doomy shady character, every relationship has a strong dark side, every mission has evil intentions, the whole city lives and breathes under dim ominous lights. That's the biggest success of the director and his crew, that they managed to bring acroos this atmosphere very convincingly indeed while delivering it with an artistic overtone.Despite the shortcomings, Sin City is worth watching and if the other rumours are true (i.e the creators planning to turn this into a long lasting movie series) it's obviously bound for commercial success as well.But having spoken of very dark comedy, the very first 40 minutes where Mickey Rourke is involved are gonna draw some serious laughs from those with a more flexible sense of humor. This is a character where the word ""unsubtle"" applies with a vengeance.As far as Rodriguez is concerned Sin City is easily an improvement over Once Upon A Time In Mexico. There could be further development from him to see."	3.0	Newsflash: A comic's comic , a film's a film...	2005-08-21	3	1	2

New and innovative films are sometimes lost on those in our society that believe that in order to enjoy a film they must be able to relate. Instead they attempt to take in a film that they do not understand and criticize harshly. When I sat down to watch this film I did not know what to expect never having read the graphic novels. Black and White film no matter in your personal camera or a Movie camera has a special quality and when mixed with just a dab of the right colors and at the right times just sets it off the same way that certain colored shirt or accessory helps bring out the best in you. The characters are amazingly compelling, semi hard to relate to with just enough 50's feel about them to give you a feeling of familiarity. This movie is not for everyone as the rating suggests due to over the top violence, sex scenes, and its very sexist portrayal of women. Interesting though that people can view the daily news of which contains the very armpit details of our world culture and then talk about it at the water cooler like its the most important thing in life, but be offended by a movie that is more akin to a piece of modern art. Open your mind, be mature about it, don't take it to seriously and just sit back and watch the fireworks that this film displays.	4.0	REAL movie fans will love this one!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-08-16	1	1	0

The sets, the characters, and the CGI were all outstanding.  Sin City grabs you from the initial scene and drags you into a world of crime, corruption, and prostitution, and by the time its over you have to shake to remind yourself that you're back in the real world.Almost the entire film is in deep, dark black and piercingly bright white, you really feel like you're in a comic book.  The occasional color is only used for emphasis (kind of like Snoop Dogg's ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" video), and it works, on so many different levels.  While a little confusing at times, this movie reminds me a little of the Max Payne Video Game series, with the constant narration and graphic violence.

078886047X	Sin City	AK2K0SR3KSS0B	TheAgitator	Unlike Batman Begins which appempts to make a comic book more realistic (until the end of the movie where they drop the ball completely) this movie knows what it's supposed to be.  It's an over the top fictional world and a pretty darn cynical one at that to the point that even its cynicism is over the top.  I really enjoyed this.  It's a disjointed story with various different plot threads that have a few connections with characters from previous ones appearing in certain scenes which are obviously not in chronological order since some people have already died in a previous scene.  The film has a very unique visual style of the likes I've never really seen before.  It's like a comic come to life and it was very well done.  Also, if you don't like seeing people's faces smashed into a bloody pulp you may want to skip this because it was pretty violent.  However, some of it is done in some creative ways such as the blood being a different color or a person being ripped to pieces in silhouette form.  Great film.

078886047X	Sin City	AWDFOM2D4PTZD	The Chalcenteric Kid	"When I go to the movies, I want to see stuff I haven't seen before. I don't want sequels, retreads of TV shows from my childhood nor anything with Matt Damon trying to be Jason Bourne.This movie is like nothing you have seen before and ( sorry to all the nay-saying reviewers ), simply ground breaking and fresh.Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez take hardboiled noir crime fiction and compact it into a diamond of a movie, shot through with hardboiled lugs, an honest cop and oh-so sexy dames.Let me address the movie's critics one at a time.a) No good guys.That is so palpably untrue. The three principle male character are all good guys - all trying to do what's right in the confines of the moral murk in which they find themselves. The bad guys aka the true murderers and the Mob all die - some really horribly in forms of almost karmic payback.b) The picture demeans women.No it doesn't. If they were all pathetic objects to be used and thrown away and potrayed as such, that might be an argument with some validity. The girls in Old Town are all in charge of their lives and are quite possibly the strongest group characters in the movie. Even Goldie makes a conscious choice when she seeks out Mikey Rourke's character. She isn't an objectified victim and he ( monster that he is ) loves her for the kindness she has shown him.c) Cheesey voiceovers.Some people never seemed to have heard of Chandler or Hammett. The dialogue fits perfectly to the movie. Like the line from Chandler ""It was a blonde. The type of blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window"". You can imagine both Bruce Willis' or Clive Owen's characters saying THAT line.Even Mikey Rourke's last line is so pitch perfect to his character. The entire dialogue is spot on for the genre.d) People are shot, pounded and pulverized and don't die.It's a movie, from a set of graphic novels. That's the genre. Heck the end of ""The Wild Bunch"" is pretty similar, but that doesn't detract from that movie being the greatest American film of the 20th century. And isn't it really what you want in a movie, the good guys to keep getting up and the bad guys to go down horribly? That's oh so satisfying on a fundamentally moral level. I'm not looking for ""realism"" in movies, that's not why I go. If I wanted that, excreable flicks like Gary Oldman's ""Nil By Mouth"" would have been a box office smash and people would have seen Ewen MacGregor's ""Young Adam"".d) Jessica Alba's relationship with Bruce's character.Disturbing? Yes. Probably meant to be and Bruce realizes it's wrong and ultimately does something about it. He does the honorable thing. As I said previously, all the principle male charcaters are essentially good guys and do the right thing in the end. Ms Alba's motivation? I can quite easily accept that her affection for the one man who ever showed her kindness could, over time in a place as morally bankrupt as Sin City, become something deeper for her ( and so more difficult for him ).e) The stories not connected.They are if you stay to the end. Just not in any kind of grand way. The characters all cross paths, that's all. That's OK with me. Everyone doesn't have to know everyone else.To conclude, this is one of the best movies of 2005, a perfect fit of style and more style."	5.0	My Critique	2005-08-23	10	7	3

Then I took out his other one.""""Now, that's a mighty fine leathercoat your wearin'.""- Hartigan takes down The Bastard, for the second time, while Marv goes coat shopping in ""Sin City""Robert Rodriguez hits the nail on the head with this religously, faithful adaption to Frank Miller's cult comic book of the same name. Miller was very cautious as to whether or not he wanted to bring his comic to the big screen (he had been burned by Hollywood before with ""Robocop 2""). But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)""Sin City"" is much in the same way & inspiration as that of ""Pulp Fiction"" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film. A minor debt he owed to Rodriguez, since Rodriguez supplied Tarantino the score to both editions of ""Kill Bill"" for one dollar). If you like ""Fiction"" you'll love ""Sin"".""Sin City"" consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.The first two stories bookend the film. The first story has to do with a sociopath (Josh Hartnett), with ""Sin City"" segueing into its 2nd story about a cop (Bruce Willis) on his last day on the job, before retiring, trying to catch a child molester he's been after, called The Bastard. The cop gets in over his head when he finds out that The Bastard has family in high places.The 3rd story has a former boxer turned nutcase, by the name of Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is looking for the killer who killed off his favorite & only prostitute, Angel, & getting framed for the whole thing.The final story has a brutal cop and his buddies getting killed by a group of prostitutes, in Prostitute Row, a section of Sin City that is ruled by its prostitutes. The only rule is, is that cops can not be killed for any reason at all. Oops. The leader of Prostitute Row (a scantily clad, Rosario Dawson) & her boyfriend (Clive Owen) try to cover up the whole mess before the authorities arrive. They don't stand a chance.Sin City is shot entirely in green screen & on a soundstage no bigger than a warehouse. The handcuff fight sequence between Marv & the young psycho kid were shot seperately. Mickey Rourke & Elijah Wood never met each other until the films L.A. premiere!The look of the film is jawdropping. It looks exactly like the comic book, panel by panel (for those not in the know, the comic book is in black & white with some elements in color. I.e., a character says he drives a red Cadilac, you will see him drive a red Cadilac, but everything else on the page is B&W;). At times I felt as if I was watching the comic book come to life. And it does.""Sin City"" came out in theatres in early April '05 and will most likely be hitting DVD in late July or August, with everything including Marv's bandages thrown in. You'll need' em.With ""Sin City"" already recouping most of its budget expect to see more return trips to the City in the future.

Everything about this film is amazing, stylish, and plainly eye candy with each action scene eclipsing the last. This film is based on the comic book series called ""Sin City"", and this movie has such detail and is able to explain the entire world surrounding it in one movie, which is like 4 short movies in one!!! It is one of those films that some people will love, like, or hate; it is rated R for a reason!!!It has that dark and gritty feel to it, along with an exotic take on the city, and how Basin City (Sin City) is!!! Love or hate, you have to admit that this film has got to be the most stylish film of the year so far, second next to the Matrix!!!Rodregiuz and Tarantino team up to make an innovative and original film, that will change the way you look at films like it or not!!! This movie is a combination of when ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" meets ""The Matrix"", mixed with ""Spawn"", along with the ""Godfather"" feel in a comic form, with plainly awesome innovative visually effects!!!It has the dark, gritty, horror feel of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", the action packed and visual eye candy of ""The Matrix"", along with the dark hero example: (taking out ten armed cops out in slow motion), redemption feel as Spawn did, and the underworld mafia feel of ""The Godfather""!!! It is also can be related to the film and mavel comic ""The Punisher"" as well as ""Spawn"", as Mickey Rouke's character avenges his love's death as a tough guy, under dog dark hero killing his way to answers!!! It also has a little bit of a mystery feel to it!!!The redemtion part comes in when (Bruce Willis) character, a cop, who saved her life, but from the major's son and injured him!!! He is locked up due to the crooked major( thats what I mean by mafia, underworld, ""Godfather"" feel), and serves an 8 year jail sentence as he then he must save her (Jessica Alba's character- damn she is HOT), once again from the major's son, now looking like an alien, as he quotes ""Old man dies, little girl lives; .... fair trade, as he gives his life to protect her!!!The underground and exotic parts come in when a guy, (Clive Owen)teams up with the prostutes wage war against the mobsters and cops; to stop a civil war between them!!! Kind of an Amazons from hell, meets The Mafia in a duel to the death!!! This all starts when a guy(undercover cop/ no know of at the time) is harassing his girlfriend (Britney Murphy), and he isn't pleased about it, and pursues him in anger!!!Well, the Amazon war ladies take care of them, but it turns out that he is a cop which would ignite a civil war between them!!! The mafia want the war so that they can make the prostutes their slaves. It's up to him to dispose of the bodies, then he is ambushed by mercs, and after a chain of events it turns into a blood bath, well the whole movie has been!!!What can, I say can you can tell, by giving brief descritions of the movie that this is unique from anyother movie I've seen!!! Most of this movie has that larger than life feel, in the underworld feel, with a lot of star power to top it all off!!! It's kind of has the feel that ""Kill Bill"" films had if you know what I mean!!! This film has a lot of creativity and will be a gem for a fan of comic books, dark gritty, action, with nice black and white visual eye candy with 4 stories in one movies along with some great special effects on disc 2!!!Love or hate it, you got admit this film is the first of it's kind and is the absolute most stylish, fil of the year!!! This film though is not for everybody, it may be to dark and gritty for some peoples tastes, but if you're a person like me you'll get a kick out of it!!! It was surprisind and completely unexpected, but very artsy, overall not the best, but definettly the most stylish!!! Overall, I will give this a 4/5!!!"	4.0	"Most Innovative,......

If you turn on the TV to fox news you'll see more people dead in our screwed up world and the only thing your doing is blaming it on movies and other works of art.Now about the movie. This movie is a story of revenge, lust, and murder (which yea are sins you Christians, hence the name sin city) and I absolutely loved it and I believe frank miller is a genius, and for those of you whom enjoyed it they are making 2 more at the moment, but may still make more, and I also recommended the graphic novels. The movie contains: The Big Fat Kill, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow [....], and a short, which was longer in the comics, The Customer Is Always Right. Mickey Rourke (Marv) was undoubtedly the best anti-hero in any movie I've seen. This DVD also has many special features which unlike most are pretty sweet.

078886047X	Sin City	A3M7RECGYLXOPA	The Wickerman	"I very rarely write movie reviews, mainly because I'm not that good at it, but I have to make an exception for this one.  ""Sin City"" is by far one of the most creative and stunningly well-made movies I've seen in quite some time.  I got the same  feeling from watching it as I did ""Kill Bill"", in that I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterward, simply because it's so freaking good.First of all, there's the cinematography, which is just unbelievable.  The whole movie was filmed in a studio here in Austin, and nearly everything but the characters is digitally inserted.  They used basically no set for the whole thing, but everything looks so real (in a surreal kind of way).  And, the use of color is just brilliant.  The movie is mostly black and white, but other colors are sporadically thrown in for emphasis, and to brilliant effect.  The flashes of red blood, the cold, murderous stare of Elijah Wood, Alexis Bledel's gorgeous blue eyes, the vivid, um yellowness of the Yellow Bastard, all are brought out wonderfully amidst a black and white world.Now, just the special effects alone are enough to make this an entertaining movie, but it doesn't stop there.  The performances are all great as well.  I've never cared much for Mickey Rourke, but he does a spectactular job as the relentlessly vindictive Marv.  Bruce Willis has long shed his action hero image, for which he was once well-known, but here, he returns to that style with a vengeance (no ""Die Hard"" pun intended) as the hard-boiled Detective Hardigan.  Elijah Wood is just amazing as the silent but deadly Kevin, and of course we have Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, and many other lovely women with sedutive and memorable roles (I wish I'd known when they were filming this; so many girls I could have hit on ;).I don't want to reveal too much about the story, but basically it consists of several smaller stories, that all weave together into one larger plot.  The constant shifting of main characters, and the voice-over narrations of each one help to keep things interesting, and to demand your attention.  Much like ""Kill Bill"", it sort of skips around chronologically, but I think the story is initially much easier to follow overall.  And, like ""Kill Bill"", there's a lot of graphic, over-the-top violence, but the black and white sort of helps to dull it over a bit, so it doesn't really seem quite as gory as it is.Anyway, this is a fantastic movie that any fan of excellent cinema should see.  Robert Rodriguez has said that he wants to make movies of the entire ""Sin City"" series (and Johnny Depp is even slated to be in one), so I greatly look forward to the next installment."	5.0	Dark, cryptic, disturbing, and absolutely brilliant.	2005-04-05	4	2	2

But this movie is dumb, and it's so violent that it's ridiculous.  And the directors seem to be unable to decide if they want to make a live action movie, or an animated movie, so what you get is a weird combination  of both.  It was ridiculous how the characters in the movie were so hard to kill, especially Marv (Mickey Rourke).  And the movie had cannibalism in it, and people being hacked up with saws.  And Nick Stahl's character had his sex organs shot off, then surgically replaced, then ripped off again.

078886047X	Sin City	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Rest assured, ""Sin City"" is like no other film you have ever seen.""Sin City"", directed by Robert Rodriguez (""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Spy Kids"") and Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novels the film is based on) tells a number of stories, which share characters and themes. A cop with a bad heart (Bruce Willis) attempts to save an eleven year old girl, Nancy, from the sadistic killer, Junior (Nick Stahl). Marv (Mickey Rourke), a gangster, trawls the streets looking for the person who killed the hooker he slept with last night. Another gangster (Clive Owen) leads the abusive ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) into Old Town, an area run by hookers.Each of these stories pays homage to Film Noir, a type of filmmaking prevalent in the late 40s and early 50s. Every so often a filmmaker will take a stab at recreating the genre, with mixed results. Rodriguez appears to have been inspired by the source material, because this is not only one of his best films, but also one of the best modern takes on Noir. ""City"" has all of the trademarks of classic Noir; black and white cinematography, heroes and heroines trying to live in a corrupt society, villains trying to maintain control and desperate, desperate people.Like much of the ""Spy Kids"" films, Rodriguez shot most of ""City"" in front of a blue screen. Basically, he filmed the actors in front of a blank wall and added the backgrounds and special effects later. Many films use this technique for part of the process, but ""City"" appears to have been made using primarily this process. Almost all of the film is shot in black and white. This might be problematic for some, but I completely forgot about the lack of color, until he used brief glimpses of color. The backgrounds are richly detailed in shades of black, white and gray. They also appear to be consistent, helping to create a believable world. Because I believed in the setting of the film, I didn't miss the color. Color is used as a punctuation point. In some scenes, the red of blood appears, in others, the gold of a woman's hair. This creates a unique, interesting visual style, which appears to be inspired by the source material. Rodriguez also moves the camera to replicate graphic novel angels, making us believe that we are in a living comic book. Normally, all of these `tricks' would serve to draw the viewer out of the story and universe. In ""City"", it all serves to draw us in.The unique visual style is only the first element necessary to make us believe. The second, and perhaps most crucial element, are the actors. Frequently, in a movie based on comic books or similar material, all of the work is put into the visual. The actors walk through the story, spouting their lines. In ""City"", every one of the actors, and there are many, portray their characters in a serious way, as though they were in a run of the mill crime drama. No one lets on to the fact that they are basically in a live action graphic novel. Because they believe, this helps us believe, adding further to the creation of ""Sin City"" as a `real place'. It is difficult to say there is a lead in the film, but Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all take on meatier roles in the interconnecting stories. They are joined by Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a collection of young starlets. In any film with different stories, and this many actors, each person needs to make an impact and make one fast or they get lost in the shuffle. A lot of this has to do with how central the character is to the story; if they have a lot to do, they will be on screen more. Also, in Noir, the stories are usually accompanied by voice over narration from the lead character. In each of the stories, the main characters provide voice over, giving us insight into their thoughts. Hartigan, played by Willis, is steely, determined and effective. Marv, played by Rourke, whose plastic surgery is covered with enough make-up to make him resemble a Dick Tracy character, embarks on a memorable journey. Owen and Del Toro are also effective as they battle each other in Old Town, with the help of a number of very deadly hookers. All of these actors do a great job of helping to make ""Sin City"" all the more engaging.The interconnecting stories will probably bring ""Pulp Fiction"" to mind for many. When a major star appears in the first five minutes of the film, you get the feeling that their character will return at another point, probably the finale. The interconnecting stories share timelines and characters, creating a larger more interesting portrait. I find it interesting to watch a filmmaker's career and trace the `ancestry' of their films. In ""Sin City"", Rodriguez uses the digital technology that he used effectively in the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy, but takes it to another degree. He combines this with the sort of violent story that he has told well in previous films like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"".""City"" is hard-boiled Noir. As I mentioned, color is used sporadically throughout. There is a lot of violence and, thankfully, Rodriguez only occasionally shows the blood in color. More often it appears as a milky white. He uses red as a punctuation point, drawing our attention to the actors or action; occasionally, red appears in a pool of blood, or in a person's shoes, or in a hooker's dress. This doesn't diminish the effect of the violence, it enhances it. Nudity also has a place in Sin City and it is the most gratuitous element of the film. Somehow, this is also fitting. You would expect nudity to be fairly common place in a town known for its sin.""Sin City"" is one of the most visually interesting and challenging films I have seen in a long time. It has a dazzling visual style all its own, combined with a hard-boiled story and some very good performances, ""Sin City"" will be remembered for years to come."	5.0	If Loving This Movie Is A Sin...	2005-04-04	4	3	1
078886047X	Sin City	A1QG3ZZLPXYT59	"Tim Leigh ""Tim 74"""	This movie is one of my all time favorites.  It does an excellent job capturing the essence of the Graphic Novels of Frank Miller, probably because of the close working relationship between Miller and the Director.  When you watch the film it feels like you are reading a comic book where the story relies more on the visual than the dialog to advance the story, and the visuals are truly one of a kind. The film is shot so it matches the story board of the comic book frame by frame down to the smallest detail. While this movie is not for everyone people who like Pulp Fiction and comic books should enjoy it.	5.0	Great Comic Book Movie	2006-03-17	1	1	0
078886047X	Sin City	A3G00T481USIIM	Titlelog	"Not much to like here.  As interesting and well done as the movie is from a visual standpoint, I couldn't have cared less about the characters.  Everyone in the aptly named Sin City is morally bankrupt.  They do all the wrong things for the ""right"" reasons, which usually means rescuing a damsel in distress from a child molester or serial killer cannibal.  Violence is the norm in this twisted bizarro world.  In addition to routine shootings you'll also find neck-slashing, impaling, amputation, beheading and body parts being ripped out.  At times I felt like I was watching a horror movie, especially when Alexis Bledel shows up as a double-crossing hooker.All the stories in this movie take place only at night, and the whole thing is shot in stark black and white with a few splashes of color here and there.  The tough guy ""heroes"" talk in hoarse, low voices, even when they're not doing hokey film noir narration.  As much as I love Clive Owen, he comes across as laughable at times, but the big surprise here is Rosario Dawson.  She does an amazing job with what she's given."	1.0	They forgot the script	2006-05-20	20	5	15
078886047X	Sin City	A3P1A63Q8L32C5	T. Lobascio	"When I first found out that Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novel series was going to be adapted for the big screen, I was both excited and concerned at the same time, at what could come out of it. The books were so unique, even for the comic book medium, that I knew they would be tough to adapt on film. When I saw the film's opening sequence in the theater  all of my concerns were put to rest, and I knew I was in for one heck of a ride. The end result is one of the most faithful films to its source material in the comic to movie genre ever made.Director Robert Rodriguez asked Miller himself to co-direct the film which loosely connects three of the series best stories. It leads off and ends though with a short vignette called The Customer Is Always Right, with Josh Hartnett as The Man. This helps to set the tone at the start, as well as put on a proper coda for the movie.The Hard Goodbye--Tortured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke) is framed for murder and he turns to his parole officer Luc (Carla Gugino) for help. Even as he forced to go it alone in the end. What he finds out is both unsettling and brilliant at the same time.The Big Fat Kill follows Dwight (Clive Owen) and what happens when he enters into a casual relationship with a waitress named Shellie (Brittany Murphy). Little does he know that he's about to put in the middle of a struggle for power over the red light district that forces him to do some wild things. During this segment of the film special guest director Quentin Tarantino was asked to helm a scene. While I am not a Tarantino fan by any means, I appreciate his work on this film, and his friendship with Rodriguez.That Yellow Bastard Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a rare honest cop in Sin City. Even as he prepares to retire, he will stop at nothing to put an end to a child molester's reign of terror, no matter how well connected the sewer rat might be. In order to have justice for the victims, Hartigan will sacrifice a lot, especially when his life becomes intertwined with victim Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba). When Hartigan's investigation takes him right to the vile Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl) himself, forcing him to discover just how far he's he's willing to go.Using green screen effects and CGI, Rodriguez was able to bring Sin City to life without really needing to tamper with the look and style of the books themselves. The results are dazzling. The true success though really has to do with Miller's characters and the way Rodriguez doesn't alter them to make them more Hollywood. The performances from the cast are first rate and help sell everything else. I have been critical of CGI/Green Screen flicks like Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow, whose characters let the film's tech look overtake it, but here, the tech acts to serve the characters--not vice versa. Like the books, the noir flavor shine through, while allowing for a dash of licence.Disc One includes the original theatrical cut of the film and these extras. A feature length audio commentary with Rodriguez and Miller, a second audio commentary with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Bruce Willis, and a third audio track featuring audience reaction at the premiere in Austin. The commentaries give you a well rounded look at how things came together, from both a creative standpoint and actor perspective. The reaction track is a hoot and worth a listen as you watch the film. There's also a series of featurettes on everything from Miller and Tarantino, to the film's cars, props, make-up effects and costumes. Some of the info from these can also be heard on the commentaries...that said they are worth watching. An interactive character time line and the theatrical trailers top off the disc.Disc Two includes an extended cut of each story--treating them more like separate short films---rather than a whole with a few connective threads. Some of the ""new"" footage is just incidental stuff. But there's some meaty additions in That Yellow Bastard and The Hard Goodbye that fans should like. Three more featurettes focus on how Rodriguez brought the film to life. Focusing on the CGI effects, a high-speed green screen only version of the movie, and a 14 minute uninterrupted take of the Tarantino scene. These are for die hard fans only. You'll also see what it was like at the wrap party with cast and crew. And wrapping up the second disc, you can learn how to make Sin City breakfast tacos (??!), yummmmm.The package also includes a paperback copy of The Hard Goodbye... Sin City is a great film, no matter which way you decide to watch it, and the 2 disc DVD is well worth it."	5.0	Sin And The City	2005-12-16	0	0	0

It was what it was, as it was. And what there was, was damn cool. I liked the style and the stories. Stark, grim, gritty, desolate. Not the kind of thing I'd watch before going to bed, but reaching down into the viscera and doing some twisting and making you wonder what dark urges and impulses lurk inside yourself. Asking some troubling questions maybe. Very violent, butI'm all for that kind of stuff, and while for others the `comic' connection may be what turns them on, for me it's the revelatory character of it all. That should be sufficient to make it worthwhile for those who, like me, can handle material like the Fables series and Y, but shy back from other graphic stories, like Frank Miller's.My favorite of the stories is `That Yellow Bastard'. To me it's the most poignant and visceral. I'm sure other people have other favorites, but that's cool.  This is one of those flicks that can be a lot of things to a lot of people. Which is all good.Till Noever[...]	4.0	Dark and troubling	2006-04-30	2	1	1
078886047X	Sin City	A35PQZRJDYQT8H	"Todd Faulkner ""hyphenate"""	Admittedly, this was my favorite film of the year in its original form.The Special Edition was worth the wait, and in my opinion, is worth buying even if you purchased the original.The second disc includes the film in a new version -- as three separate graphic novels (and one graphic short story) --fully capturing Frank Miller's incredible vision in glorious black and white (and red and yellow).  In a word, amazing.  I almost always find director's cuts to be a tiresome affair -- simply re-inserting scenes that were correctly cut the first time.  Not so.  Not one frame feels like filler.  Everything serves to deepen and enrich the amazing world of Basin City.I haven't made it through all of the new extras yet (on the second disc), but two are definitely worth noting.  The 15 minute Flic School (a staple of Rodriguez's special editions) is great and focuses on the process of shooting in the digital domain -- one surprise was learning that many of the actors who work together seamlessly in the film never actually met in person.  Ahh the magic of digital editing.The companion piece to the flic school is an all greenscreen version of the theatrical release.  That is -- Rodriguez takes only the raw footage of the film, without any special effects, de-colorization and in many cases, sets -- and speeds the whole thing up so you get to race through the film and see how they did it -- which sets were real, which ones weren't, etc.Truly incredible.This one gets my vote for DVD release of the year.	5.0	Even More Spectacular Than The Original	2005-12-07	10	8	2

078886047X	Sin City	A233QN6P2EEKPS	Tom Collier	"Any filmmaker that dares to try an adaptation of a comic book faces many problems. In order to put page to screen within a tidy two hour package, it is absolutely necessary to change elements of the comic that will get even casual fans up in arms.  Also, comic books overwhelmingly tend to feature characters and events that defy reality, making special effects take front and center over the characters that are often the main appeal in the first place.Director/Editor/Writer/Composer Robert Rodriguez has managed to circumvent some of those problems while taking others head on. Sin City is based on a black and white comic book series that very few people in the audience would even recognize. Rodriguez left the Director's Guild of America to bring artist and writer Frank Miller on as co-director to duplicate the comic panel by panel. In the process he effectively sidesteps any criticism from hard-core fans. Going in the opposite direction for effects, Rodriguez takes a story that could be done with very few special effects and no computer imagery at all and completely soaks each and every black and white frame with as much technical wizardry as he can. Shot entirely with digital cameras and using very few sets, it is clear Rodriguez had a ball making the picture, but as all students of film know, making a good movie is about as fun as a root canal with no painkillers.The plot itself consists of three interweaving tales dipped in incredibly gruesome violence, rolled in hard-boiled noir, and sprinkled with macho male fantasy. Indeed, the three heroes soak up bullets like a tank and don't die, and every woman in the movie is either a stripper, a prostitute, or just plain naked. The first and by far most interesting tale is that of Mickey Rourke's Marv, a hulking brute of a man who relentlessly kills his way across the computer generated Basin City to avenge the death of a prostitute. Next up is Clive Owen butchering an American accent as Dwight, one of those people who doesn't seem to have a specific role in society but who still manages to get himself and an entire town full of prostitutes into grave danger. Ending the miniature trilogy is Bruce Willis as John Hartigan, a cop with a bad heart(literally) that protects a girl from a repulsive but powerful pedophile. Aside from Rourke, the star-studded cast is generally calm and unmemorable. Most surprising of all is the normally reliable Willis, who speaks his lines as if he has a sore throat and is reading them from a note card held up by a production assistant.In adapting Frank Miller's excellent work to screen, Rodriguez brought everything but the kitchen sink and the soul. Style and effects is the name of the game here, with the story itself a very distant third. Despite the ferociousness of the violence, it fails to make an impact as the film never ratchets the emotional intensity of the characters to anything above a whisper. When Willis' character struggles through a heart attack to save a young girl, he seems more like he has a bad case of diarrhea than a serious heart condition. Noir style dialogue that lights up the comic book falls completely flat when said with the painful lack of flair demonstrated by the majority of the cast. The strict adherence to the frames of the comic is a fatal flaw. The lack of versatility in the shots leads to awkward moments that resemble the type of cartoon the film needs to avoid. A subtle but deeply damaging aspect is the music, which attempts to be noir but sounds like it was composed a few hours before prints were to be shipped out to theaters.It is interesting that both Rodriguez and Sin City are so frequently compared to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Rodriguez and Tarantino are good friends, and Tarantino even ""guest directed"" a short segment of Sin City. As I watched that segment, I longingly thought of Tarantino's films, celebrations of all that is film and pop culture, bringing the best elements of both together. Sin City definitely has similarities with Pulp Fiction, but where Sin City lacks a serious consideration for the thoughts and feelings of its characters, Pulp Fiction revels in any and everything to do with the people on screen. Watching anything by Tarantino gives you the awe-inspiring sense of watching a master at the top of his game, while Sin City just makes you sadly shake your head at a big kid playing with his digital toys."	2.0	Huge Disappointment	2005-10-16	6	4	2
078886047X	Sin City	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	I am probably running a bit counter to the main stream with this but really this was over the top. We have one character have his arms and legs sawn of and then he is eaten by a dog. There are two castrations and a character is killed by having his head bitten to a pulp. And these things are done by the characters who called loosely be described as the goodies.There does seem to be in a number of films a growing pornography of violence. Hostel, Wolf Creek, aspects of the 24 Hours series and this. Repulsive violence as an end in itself.Now of course this does not mean that the film is not directed by someone who knows what he is about. It is not to say that the actors are less than skilled or that the dialogue and voice over are effective and professional but really there must be some point when things just get a bit gross and I think that this film has reached it.In the real world police work is a grind. Police have to painstakingly catch offenders and try to construct a case against them. The majority of offenders will commit small time offences and be stupid. Police then have to try to develop ways to catch bigger time offenders when small time offenders have tipped them of as to who is there boss or who supplies them with the drugs. This requires hours of phone taps, trying to stick up minor offenders and the like so that they will roll over and pot the big guys. Not the sort of thing that makes an interesting comic book.Comic books are interested in battles a bit like the World Championship Wrestling. People dressed in leotards with some playing the role of good others evil. With comics like Superman or Batman the villians are usually caught in the act and the action is all about a fight over apprehension.To create viewer interest things are made simple. There are good guys who look nice and who we are given parts of their back story so we feel for them. Batman whose parents were killed by a criminal. Spiderman whose de-factor father died as a result of a robbery. The Punisher whose parents.....come to think of it they are all the same.Now in Sin City the technique is to have villians so bad that not only do we want their deaht but we want them slowly tortured to death. (There is one exception but that involves women who are scantilly clad and carry around guns.) Thus the villians have to be cannibals who not only eat their victims but cut of bits of them while they are alive and eat the portions with the victim eating on. Now whilst this is possible, (Said to be a Japanse atrocity towards the end of the war.) it seems to me to be a transperent plot devise to justify laothsome behavour.America is now the country which seems to think that torture is okay. That kidnaping and locking people up in Cuba without trial is okay if there is a slight suggestion of wrongdoing even if no one is sure. One can see that films like this might be either reflective of the mindset or the cause of it.	1.0	The pornography of violence	2006-02-04	40	8	32
078886047X	Sin City	A1M0YAZ6JV488Z	"Tom's Reviews ""Tom Hunter"""	First off, the visual imagery in this film is creative, true to the graphic novels, and powerful.  Second, they used Mickey Rourke perfectly with the makeup and his build, he was perfect to play the character of Marv.  True, the violence in this film is extreme, but that is a major component of what the graphic novel and the storyteller were attemping to convey - and the film stayed true to that.  The use of color in some scenes was also visually powerful.  I would very much recommend this film for those who are interested in this genre (though I honestly wouldn't know how to classify this one, other than action-drama).  For fans of Jessica Alba, well, you won't be disappointed, either...Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

078886047X	Sin City	A2QJEATI3XHJXS	TorgosPizza	Billed as a hard-boiled contemporary noir--not an homage, but the real deal--Miller's story gives us stuff in the vein of cannibals, ninjas, and hookers.  As authentic to the genre as putting dragons and wizards in an espionage film.  The characters have false voices, as well--Miller actually has an eleven year old schoolgirl talking with such a clipped, bad-ass cool, it makes Fred MacMurray sound like Wally Cox.  He also seems to enjoy portraying castrations of many types, such as gunshots to the groin, knifings, and so on.  A fun time for all.  A brilliant work, if only it was written by a highschool prodigy, but for a major Hollywood work, it only serves to reinforce the stereotype that it takes little to impress fanboys.	1.0	What the..?	2006-02-19	25	13	12

078886047X	Sin City	A6VXZ1EEPRTLV	trebe	You can't but admire Robert Rodriguez for achieving his vision of bringing Frankie Miller's graphic novel Sin City, to the big screen.  The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.  Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co-director.  Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.Another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.  From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Torro, Jaime King, Carla Gugino, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, and Elijah Wood, head what is one of the more remarkable casts in a film of this decade, one that also includes Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett and Marlee Shelton in minor roles.Presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a  bit more humor than the rest.  The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.There are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.  Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.  Shooting against a green screen, enabled scenic elements to be inserted in post production.  The extent to which this cool technique was employed, can be seen in 'The All Green Screen Version'.  There is also a short documentary about how Frankie Miller was convinced to greenlight and join the production.The film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.  They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.  Also included is a copy of The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.  The recut, extended version (DVD or Blu Ray), costs more, but if you enjoy Sin City, this is certainly the one to get.Amazon should revise their policy of regarding different versions of the same movie as being equivalent.  This two disc recut version, not the same as the regular edition single disc release.  This situation widespread, and leads to confusion for those seeking specific information about what special features and extras may be included in any particular edition.  This policy not realistic, and does not serve the best interest of consumers.	5.0	this sure as bloody hell ain't vegas . . .	2009-10-03	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	It's graphic book version of 'Kill Bill,' it's pitch dark, it's violent, it's nasty, it's whatever makes you sick, and it's very fascinating.  Not everyone would find the film that way, and I confess I am not a big fan of this film or Frank Miller's original books, but I still kept watching this brutal world where the revenge story of The Bride is enacted on everyday basis.Perhaps it is pointless to repeat the story after more than 500 reviewers pasted their own views.  As they said, 'Sin City' means the title itself, the city filled with crimes and violence, where the dark world of the original comic book comes alive.  Three stories, each of which are connected tangentially (ala 'Pulp Fiction'), features three tough guys: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen.  And all of their stories involve women, as old noir films do.[BRITTANY MURPHY SAID ... ] I would like to add something else.  Brittany Murphy, who came to Japan to promote the film (with Devon Aoki), during the interview with Yahoo Japan strongly recommended that those viewers who find the content too sick should wait for Mickey Rourke.  She said, 'it's 'meant to be funny.'Funny?  She said so clearly.  I'd rather say 'darkly funny' but she made a good point about Rourke.  Marv, played by Mickey Rourke, vows a revenge for a beautiful girl who slept with him just one night, and follows those responsible no matter what it takes.  As you see, the story itself is nothing new, just a standard noir one.  But it is the way of revenge or killing that matters.  Bullets are too ordinary.  You should be Hannibal Lector to claim originality in Sin City.[MICKEY'S SEMI-COMEBACK]  Among the various players gathering for this rare chance to become the comic book characters themselves, Mickey Rourke steals every scene in this film.  In fact, almost all actors are excellent ... I said 'almost' because Bruce Willis looks exactly Bruce Willis (perhaps that is not a bad thing), and Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, and Nick Stahl, all cast against type, are less convincing and impressive than Rourke, Owen, or Benicio Del Toro.As to the story and script 'Sin City' needs more re-writes.  Frequent voice-overs are annoying to me, and some materials are used too much (like torture and imprisonement). 'Sin City' is not as groundbreaking as 'Pulp Fiction' but is visually rivetting, no question about it.	4.0	(3.5 STARS) Frank Miller's Noir World: Extremely Brutal, But Visually Stunning	2005-11-01	1	0	1

078886047X	Sin City	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"After extolling his nihilistic tendancies through his magnum opus comic, BATMAN: THE DARK NIGHT RETURNS and the screenplays for ROBOCOP 2 & 3, Frank Miller returned to his comic book roots and modified his pessimistic worldview by writing a series of extremely gritty, largely black & white graphic novels that came to be known as part of the Sin City series. Miller hasn't had very many positive experiences with the Hollywood system and for the longest time swore he would never allow the Sin City books to be transformed into a movie.Then Robert Rodriquez entered the picture. Despite the fact that he shoots most of his films in his studio near his Southwestern home (in Texas I believe) and is a filmmaking maverick who not only directs his films, but usually writes, edits, and scores them as well; Rodriquez has established himself as a powerful Hollywood filmmaker. Rodriquez has been a fan of Miller's Sin City books from their first publication and secretly shot a short based on one of the stories as test to show to Miller. Rodriquez showed the short to Miller, Miller loved it and the short became the opening sequence to SIN CITY.SIN CITY is one of the most brutal crime noir films ever to be made. The movie tells a series of three and a half different tales that are loosely connected that take place in Basin City. Basin City is sort of an overly corrupt, crime-invested version of NYC. Things are so bad that grafitti artists have spray-painted over the ""Ba"" in the town's sign, thus the name ""Sin City.""Rodriquez used Miller's comics as the storyboards for the movie. Therefore, SIN CITY is filmed mostly in black and white with only the occasional dash of color: a red dress, a blue hot rod, a yellow deformed man, blond hair. Also, there is a bar in Sin City that virtually all the main characters in the movie have an association with. Sometimes in this bar things seem to lighten up and the cold black & white world outside is allowed to be tainted with a tinge of colors in their softest hues.The casting for SIN CITY is brilliant and all of the actors do a good job for their roles. The most exceptional performance is pulled off by Mickey Rourke who plays Marv. Marv's story is perhaps the most optimistic of the tales, even though it does include a beheading, cannibalism, and an execution.SIN CITY is an incredibly violent film and had it been shot in color would have probably received an NC-17 rating. There's all kinds of shootings and stabbings, several explosions, cannibalism, two beheadings, a castration, an attempted child rape, suicide, and other acts of violence I can't recall. Staying true to the color-style of the film, whenever someone bleeds, their blood is usually yellow or white, but never red.Depressing as the movie is, I have to admit that I did enjoy parts of the film.  I was rooting for Marv and hoping he would at least win the girl, if not the day. I was impressed by the cinematography. I liked the score. However, reflecting upon the movie later on, I was almost sick to my stomach.  Technically and cinematographically, the film is brilliant.  But as far as stories go, SIN CITY is true to its title and wallows in sin & filth; making it one of the bleakest films I have ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that everyone will enjoy, and even some who do (like myself) will discover later that it--like sin-really wasn't that great of an experience after all."	4.0	Welcome to Basin City.	2005-04-05	9	8	1

One disc has the ""Recut"" version which adds about 6 minutes of story content, and also presents each story as a separate feature. There's not a big difference between this and the theatrical version. I think the theatrical version flows nicer, because it blends the stories together, so I recommend that for a first viewing. I enjoyed watching the ""recut"" version as a second viewing, because it's changed just enough to keep it feeling fresh, like listening to a favorite CD on shuffle."	4.0	Has recut and theatrical versions	2012-01-16	11	9	2

078886047X	Sin City	A3OVG2AHZRGA55	Tyler Durden	Being familiar with Rodiriguez's past films, from El Mariachi to Spykids to that The Faculty, I approached Sin City with a certain sense of expectation; this is not a director particularly interested in story and character. He tells a damn good, visceral action tale and blows things up with startling aplomb, but that's about it. I was expecting nothing more from Sin City than an entertaining action film, and what I got was much more than that.Sure it's all adolescent male fantasy with large-breasted women in bondage clothes and badass dudes with big guns and hard attitudes, but in a way it's a look out our society devoid of pretense; men are manly and immoral or not worth a damn to the general public, women are essentially in bondage and, despite notions of female empowerment, still basically subservient to the whimsy of the great phallus that rules over us all. Granted, this is probably reading too much into the film, but I doubt someone with the intelligence of Frank Miller would over look this.The stories of the film, which I will spare you of, as no doubt everyone else on this site has written it out in great detail, are all very engrossing and told with Rodriguez's prodigious sense pacing and intensity. What really puts the film over the edge for me, and makes it one step beyond traditional action fare, is the sense of morality and the deeply nuanced characters, all brought to life well by the respective actors, standouts being Del Toro, Owen, Dawson, Rourke and the unfortunately underused Michael Clark Duncan and Brittany Murphy.And then there are the visuals: Rodriguez and Miller, working directly from the latter's source material, have created an amazing, multi-faceted and entirely original world on screen. There are some who might call this stylistic choice a concession of the medium, and others who would hail it as brilliant; I would simply say it's inspired. Unlike others films that have employed similar techniques, from Star Wars to Sky Captain, it is never distracting. Never do Rodriguez and Miller let the style take away from the substance, a very admirable feat.Could I write a review of this film without addressing the issue of violence? While this film is ultra violent, if you care to viddy, from start to finish, it's not really a violent film; it's all very cartoonist, and the style of the movie, with it's green screen scenery and lack of color, doesn't really allow the film to be oppressively violent. While some of the content-child molestation, rape, prostitution, drugs, etc. . .-is disturbing and horrifying, I would say that on a whole this film is not quite on par with Fight Club, Apocalypse Now, or Irreversible as far as actual, gruesome, psychological violence ins concerned. It just isn't realistic or believable enough.So all this praise, but why not five stars? Well, I'm judging this film on a scale not indigenous to Amazon, and so I won't quite give it classic status. While it is an entertaining, intense, and emotional involving film, it is lacking a certain something that would put in on par with films such as Pulp Fiction, Seven, and Taxi Driver in the annals of insane, violent, grotesque, pulpy Americana. Perhaps it is the comic books style, the lack of character development of back story (particularly in the case of Murphy, Owens's, and Dawson's characters-an extra 20 minutes could have easily remedied this problem)or perhaps it just requires another viewing, but Sin City does not haunt the viewer, does not stay with and torment you with it's dystopian visions; you leave the theater, and it's gone into the night nearly as quickly as it's come.Sin City, unlike Rodriguez's previous films, is one of gravitas. It carrier and emotional depth, a sense of morality, and a vision of its characters that has been crafted with great care by a master hand. The film is like a fractal-it is smooth until you get very close, at which point it becomes and infinitely unfolding canvas of smaller and smaller recesses. More than anything, this is a film that is striking in the obvious maturity and command of craft of its directors. Sin City proves that there is more to Rodriquez than met then eye.	4.0	A Nice Suprise - 4.5 Stars	2005-04-03	8	6	2

078886047X	Sin City	A2EFA8TUP4TF96	"Uhnghrid ""Grope"""	"Well, the appeal of this movie pretty much resides entirely in the coolness factor. You know, where gruesome things and unusual events are displayed to stimulate the viewer's gut reactions (such as excitement, disgust, arousal, awe, etc) in a very pornographic sort of way.This works wonders in certain segments. The story of the kid who murders prostitutes, for example, has quite the well-executed combination of excitement, disgust and awe-induction. It is disgusting, exciting, awe-inducing, exactly like it's supposed to be. Coolness achieved. Very cool.But the part about the prostitutes with guns killed it for me... it was so boring and so illogical and it took up probably 1/3 of the movie. Yes, they are prostitutes, they have guns, that's supposedly arousing... I get it. I got it after the first five seconds. You can't drag that out for what seems like an hour without an actual story, and the ""story"" in this case was an illogical hole-ridden mess, clearly just a sorry attempt at justifying the lengthy scenes of scantily clad prostitutes. I mean, I get that this movie is supposed to be glorifying the tacky and hormonal elements of the comic book/neo-noir genre... but that whole segment adds absolutely nothing to this idea, and was not one bit better than watching a random porn movie.In conclusion... I appreciate all of this movie, except for the 1/3 or so that was taken up by the prostitutes-with-guns segment, which I ferociously despise. So I'm not really sure what to think of this movie as a whole... I guess it all evens out to be sort of mediocre. It's an amazing film when I fast forward through the stupid part, but I can't really give this movie any credit for my own post-release editing."	3.0	2/3 awesomeness	2007-04-18	5	3	2

Here I wanna save all the technical details and stuff, since other people, among them-pro actors,have already done it in their reviews. I just want to point out at the reaction in the auditorium when I watched this stunning and breathtaking action. At first there were some laughs and jokes and giggling as the movie started-there are some episodes, unrealistic scenes-like ""Marv"", Mickey Rourke`s character, being hit by a car multiply,just stands up and keeps going as if nothing has happened-but you always keep in mind that that is a comic book movie version and it`s the way it`s supposed to be. And later on all laughs and jokes and stuff in the audience go down and then you can`t help but sence electricity in the air and tension all around-you yourself is a whole rack of nerves ready to explode...incredible feeling, I would even say there some emotions there not experienced by you before-probably that`s why there are so many dislikers out there-they`re just scared to death being dragged out of the ""BOX"" where they tend to live and function, and unfortunately, I hate to say that, in this country number of those people-who just ""live comfortably"" and see nothing but their narrow world around their eyes more and more increases in overwhelming tempo...I`m sorry, it can seem to have nothing to do with the movie itself, but I just tried to ground my theory about the audience that is far from being fans of this movie.So everybody-if you like to experience new things, explore new horizons and live-not to just exist-go to see the movie-you`ll be truly amazed and shaken.

078886047X	Sin City	A1TC4I1U6MSY02	Vincent Nero	I really wanted to see this movie... not because word of mouth said it was amazing. All word of mouth I heard said it was alright. I wanted to see it because it was something new. Making film into a comic book rather than movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman where the comic book is adapted to a movie. So my mind set was positive. However, this translation from page to celluloid gets annoying. True, some shots looked amazing with the black and white and bits of red. It really is cool in the beginning; however, the viewer becomes numb to it after a half hour and then you have to watch it like it's just another movie. And as far as movies go, it's not that hot. The film noir that the movie was going for seemed less like a movie of that genre than a spoof on it. The male leads were able to pull of some of the lines, but Frank Miller can't write a female character to save his life. I understand that Rodriguez and Miller wanted to stay rigidly true to the source material, but some of the lines should not have spoken. I'm glad Rodriguez was able to but together such good actors, because a group of less talented ones would not be able to control their giggles.Mickey Rourke shines as Marv, but his story is less entertaining than that of Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba. Clive Owen does a great job as Dwight, but the storyline is barely amusing.The greatest parts of the movie are the opening scene and Bruce Willis's final scene.

078886047X	Sin City	A31D8QKJXU93BT	"Vince Perrin ""Byline"""	"Computer graphic images that tell the tales in ""Sin City"" are not unique, as claimed by other reviewers, or even unusual. They've been used before, most recently in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."" But they have never been executed with the  sophistication that directors Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarentino (who directed one scene) display in this pastiche of Miller's comic books --- err, excuse me, ""graphic novels,"" in the parlance used today to elevate the stature of cartoonists by those unaware of the stature cartooning long ago achieved. The trilogy of Miller movies that Rodriguez plans must now be measured against this dazzling mosaic.It won't dazzle everyone, not with its dismemberments and disembowelments, castrations, misogyny (women are trashed or trashy), rampant immorality and corruption. But adventurers will sit transfixed by the three linked stories that pay tribute to film noir, the only way to film Miller. Violence, cynicism and outrageous behavior are his forte. All of the action, acting and direction are over the top and below the belt. ""Sin City"" is as sexual as anything likely to silence you in your seat this year.The stories are of an ailing cop (Bruce Willis) who rescues from a pervert (Nick Stahl) a pubescent girl who grows up to love him, an ugly ruffian (Mickey Rourke) who seeks the killer of a whore who loved him, and the protector (Clive Owen) of a whore (Rosario Dawson) whose gang is under attack by really bad guys. Plot points are resolved in a bath of brutality and bloodshed, exquisitely rendered in black-and-white CG images wed to live actors and accented with bright colors, mostly blood red.Heartthrob Josh Hartnet, a creepy Benecio del Toro and, as a cannibalistic killer, elfin Elijah Wood are in the remarkable cast. This is not an actor's movie. although Willis and Rourke give mature performances and the very British Owen is as hard-boiled as early Burt Lancaster. Rodriquez, who is inventing a genre here, has set casting, thematic and technical standards that heighten our expectations (Peter Jackson met them with his ""Rings"" cycle.)

078886047X	Sin City	A2CDMCG1Z84A51	Wanda B. Red	Rather than adapting the genre of cartoon to film, this movie adapts film to cartoon, as explained in the extra features part of the DVD. That's a helpful insight. What's best about the movie is the visual experience. The sparing use of color, the digital experimentation, the combination of human actors and cartoon backgrounds, the voice-overs, etc. All this is very interesting and seductive to watch -- and it distances the viewer from the appalling violence, making it much easier to take and much less genuinely threatening. I really don't think anyone will be inspired to take a gun to a mob from watching this film. It's ultimately a very sophisticated cartoon.Well, that's also its weakness. It's ultimately a cartoon, and there is only so far that genre can take you. Tarantino, Rodriguez, Miller -- they are all geniuses in their own milieus -- but none of these is the place where you might find an actor making you believe in his real emotion or his complicated conflict -- nowhere here do you find real, muddy, complicated love -- or even real revenge even though the fake version is all over the movie. It's a two-dimensional, comic send-up of a two-dimensional cartoon. So, well, there is a limit to the profundity.It's also (and maybe for those reasons) a boy's movie (not a man's, not a girl's, not a woman's). It's edgy, stylish, energetic, its voice is low and growly, all the things boys are. But it's not wise or serious or beautiful.

There are also featurettes on how Rodriguez convinced Miller to make the film, the vintage cars used in the film, the segment that Quentin Tarantino shot,""Booze Borads and Guns: The Props of City City"", ""Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make Up"" ""Trench coats and Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City"" as well as the teaser and theatrical trailer for the film (and an annoying Miramax promo at the beginning of the disc). The disc winds up with ""15 minute Flic School"" , ""Sin City: Live in Concert"", ""10 minute Cooking School"", ""The Long Take"" and an ""All Green Screen Version"". The last featurette shows how the film looked when they were shooting on the set running at ""800 times"" the normal speed accompanied by Rodriguez's score. Since almost the entire film was shot without any sets, it makes for a surreal almost theatrical experience. Rodriguez's jazzy score accompanies this version of the film (played at normal speed). It's an odd way to spend eight minutes.The stories--a hit man (Josh Hartnett)carries out his job in the beginning and ending segments of the film getting close to his subjects and then killing them almost and treating them with surprising tenderness.The second story concerns Marv (Mickey Rourke)a bull headed thug who decides he has to find out who set him up as a murderer killing the only girl (Jaime King) tht had really been nice to him.The third story takes us into a bad part of town dominated by hard boiled hookers led by Gail (Rosario Dawson). When a nasty, girl friend beating guy named Jackie (Benicio Del Toro)tries to force one of Gail's girls to do something she doesn't want to, Gail and her girls take revenge. Dwight (Clive Owen)who has already had his own run in with Jackie. He wants to take the guy out as well. Gail and Dwight combine forces to take out Jackie unleashing hell on the girl's side of town.The third story focuses on police detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis)as he saves a little girl named Nancy from a pedophile (Nick Stahl). The only problem--the pedophile is the son of a powerful, corrupt politician (Powers Boothe)and the nephew of an evil Catholic Cardinal (Rutger Haur). When Hartigan castrates the senator's son he vows revenge by setting up Hartigan for the rape of Nancy. During his time in prison Nancy (Jessica Alba)stayed in touch with Hartigan secretly writing him letters. Parole comes up and the pedophile wants revenge against Hartigan. He also wants the one girl that got away.A terrific film version of Miller's stories, ""Sin City"" looks brilliant in its Blu-ray debut with plenty of special features."	4.0	Welcome to a city filled with sin...and salvation for some	2009-04-25	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"While it's probably a total cliche to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year.  Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic-novel series, it's an energetic slab of neo-noir, complete with twisted characters, ambiguous morality, and deadly serious dialogue.  For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action-packed gift from guy-movie heaven.  It's filled with negativity, outrageously over the-top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.  I even managed to forgive the incessant voice-over narration, normally a rather lazy device, because it's so oddly poignant and poetic.  It's not really that big a deal anyway, because this movie is so impressive visually that the characters could speak in gibberish and I'd probably still be moved to give it at least three stars.It should be noted right off the bat that Sin City is not a movie for everyone, but if you're the type who would like it you presumably know who you are.  IF you like crime movies, especially those filled with action and atmosphere, you will almost certainly get a kick out of Sin City.  If you prefer lighter, more ""socially redeeming"" fare, you may still like it, or you may be overcome with bile filling your throat for most of its two-hour running time.  It's all a matter of how willing you are to accept what's going on without asking too many nagging questions like ""How exactly did Mickey Rourke just take out ten armed riot cops with nothing more than his fists and a hatchet?"" or ""is it really possible or even necessary to manually tear off a man's scrotum?"".  Everything about this movie is utterly outsized, from the themes to the characters to the action, but in the end it's a rousing success at what it intends to do, which is entertain.  It's precisely because this movie was so utterly entertaining that I found myself unwilling to nitpick; you'll probably be too busy having your senses assaulted to linger on any problems you may have with the movie.  Nothing is more key in movies (or TV, or novels for that matter) than getting the viewer to suspend disbelief, to simply let go and enjoy what's transpiring regardless of the plausibility level.  Some of my favorite movies are wildly unrealistic, but at some point when watching them I just decided to go with it.  Sin City is one such movie: I realized early on that the events unfolding onscreen bore little to no resemblance to reality as presently constituted; I just didn't care.  I went to see this movie with my wife (who is, to put it mildly, not a fan of dark or violent movies), and she may have summed up the experience of watching it the best when she said simply ""I was never bored.""  That, ultimately, is the secret to Sin City's success: it's so gripping to watch that it's hard to care about anything else.As everyone (and probably their brothers) knows by now, Sin City was filmed using real actors against a black-and-white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect.  It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly.  Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.  Weighty themes and over-the-top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting.  Consisting of three tangentially related stories occurring out of sequence, Sin City brings the viewer into an underworld populated by thieves, murderers, hookers, and dirty cops, and the morality is viewed entirely in shades of grey.  In the Basin City of the movie, where the good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse, violence is often a virtue, or at the very least a prerequisite for survival.  If there's one redeeming value to Sin City's cartoonish ultraviolence, it's that it's painfully clear that its recipients generally deserve it.Anyway, if there's one theme running through all of these stories, it's that of redemption.  The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done.  Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big-budget, sanitized Hollywood productions), one that comes from doing the right thing even when it's nowhere near being the easiest thing.  Rourke's Marv is probably the most memorable character, a hulking thug with a highly overdeveloped sense of vengeance who managed to arouse some of my sympathy even as he cut a swath of unimaginable destruction through his enemies on his way to avenging a murdered prostitute.  Out of the legions of other figures in the movie, the great Benicio Del Toro deserves some special mention as a comically malevolent crooked cop who won't shut up even after he meets his unfortunate end.Now, although I've gone on too long already, I'd feel remiss if I didn't talk about Sin City's staggering violence quotient.  Yes, this an extremely graphic movie, and much of the violence is downright disturbing to watch (Elijah Wood's character being cut up and fed to a wolf is a prominent example, even if much of the violence in that case was implied), but it's just as true that context is an important factor when considering just how offensive such bloodletting is.  Now, for one thing, Sin City is meant to be a piece of escapist cinema, so nothing that takes place onscreen should be taken too seriously anyway.  After all, no one got offended during the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when King Arthur cut off the Black Knight's arms and legs; that scene was meant to be funny and it was.  Perhaps more to the point, the violence here is so ludicrously over the top from the opening scene that it's hard to imagine any rational person getting too upset.  You have to just go with it; if you're the kind of person who makes it a point to be huffy and offended all the time you shouldn't be seeing this movie anyway.

""Sin City"" is a strange movie in many ways but it works very well.The film is made up of three interrelated stories that all take place in a corrupted, crime-ridden future. The stories are shown out of chronological order and in a kind of ""comic-book"" style.  The many female characters (one of which is played by Jessica Alba) are extremely attractive and worth the price of admission alone.Most reviewers seem to find the story about ""Marv"" (played by Mickey Rourke) to be the most interesting, but I was most impressed by the story of an aging cop, played by Bruce Willis, trying to protect a young, attractive teenage girl.Weird but excellent!"	5.0	One of the Best Films of the Year	2006-02-10	3	0	3

078886047X	Sin City	A1SPB225CVTRUU	"Wing Lee ""filmfan"""	"Frank Miller's Sin City is by far the best comic book adapted film in recent years. It's got very well written characters, and the often brutal and stylish actions is very unique and refreshing along with the mostly black and white cinematography. It's a very entertaining movie, but it's not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the graphic novels, because it's got three interconnecting stories that isn't neccessarily consistent in it's time frame. Also the over two hour long film is obviously heading for some sequels since the story didn't end when the movie was over.This is probably Mickey Rourke's career revival role since he has the juicest role that require him to looked semi-distorted, very muscular, endure various heavy-duty fight scenes, and he's got some very funny moments as well. With more screen time compared to other leads, it's unfortunate that he didn't even receive top billing like Willis, Alba, and Owen. He played Marv, and he's a street wise guy trying to track down the man who killed his hooker girlfriend Goldie(Jaime King). Kevin(Elijah Wood) is the scary and skillful hooker-eating mute that became Marv's relentless target. Elijah Wood had several scenes that consisted of fights with Marv, and he's so creepy different than his Frodo character.Bruce Willis is Hartigan, and he's the only good cop left when everyone else is corrupted. He was betrayed by his colleque Bob(played by the underused Michael Madsen) when he helped saved a little girl named Nancy Callahan, and ended up in jail for eight years. Nancy(Jessica Alba) grew up to become a pole dancer at a night club, and she eventually fell in love with Hartigan despite the age difference. Jessica Alba is very stunning on stage, and she was pretty convincing when she had to French kiss Willis.Clive Owen played the ""Babe Magnet""/Dwight, who had a thing for helping the local prostitutes through hard times. Rosario Dawson is Gail, the leader of a group of highly skilled prostitutes. She was in some serious trouble when Miho(Devon Aoki) mistakenly killed Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro) and his men. Jackie Boy is an abusive husband to Shellie(Britanny Murphy), and a corrupted cop. Since Dwight has a thing for Gail, he was willing to do anything to bail her out. Devon Aoki is very striking as the lethal assasin with great martial arts skills and works as Gail's top sidekick.Other secondary characters include Yellow Bastard/Rourk junior(Nick Stahl), Senator Rourk(Powers Boothe),and Lucille(Carla Gugino) are very well played even though they have limited screen time."	4.0	Mickey Rourke's Career Revival Role!	2005-04-11	4	3	1

Just about no one else is that easy to place.This movie is the best in a lot of different directions. For one, it's at the top of the new noir. Everything and everyone has a dark edge; the good guys have a bad edge, and the bad guys have a really bad edge, and some of them are just over over the edge. Just about every scene is night, a dark time for the dark businesses of murder and revenge. And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.It's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever. The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co-director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done. The actors put in some memorable performances, too - Elijah Wood's ""Kevin"" is no hobbit, not even a little. The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.This is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen. It's black and white, with the emphasis on the black - like the characters themselves, there's not a lot of gray in the middle. That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick. Goldie's hair, Cindy's eyes, that yellow b*st*rd, and blood. Lots of blood. Sometimes, though the blood turns black as death, or glows white like molten metal - the color (or lack) conveys the mood better than literality ever could.It's not for the squeamish, though. The hookers and strippers do their work out of sight, but the violence gets pretty raw. It's a raw story, though.And it's great. It's not at literate as the Maltese Falcon, maybe, but it's a comic book, and great within its kind.//wiredweird"	5.0	She's one of the good ones	2005-05-22	3	1	2

The Crow is my favorite comic and movie, so I was not afraid of the gore or violence, although it must be said that I hate Tarentino. I could barley sit through Kill Bill, and I vowed never to see another one of his films again.But the visuals! I wished ""The Crow"" could have been done like this! When Sin City came out I read a review that said the plot sucked and the acting was horrible and every woman was a whore. I said I wouldn't go to it in the theater.I watched it last night, and it was amazing. Some people only want to watch a film that is going to take them out of their lives - or make them feel better about them. Make no mistake, that is not the point of sin city. this movie is set in it's own world, in it's own time. I loved the plots, but I love revenge. One review said that the gore and killings seemed pointless at times. I did not find this to be true at all. Ever death in this movie served a purpose.The acting was awesome, which is something because I can't imagine how hard it must have been. I would have to say my favorite part of the film is when Jessica Alba jumps off the bar and kisses Bruce Willis, my heart lifted and I smiled. Love - in the midst of all that is evil and horrifying - was beautiful and believeable.I'm 24, and a woman. And I loved this movie."	4.0	New and different	2005-08-30	5	4	1

I'm not a cinema guy cause I can't watch a movie from beginning till the end without delay and I used to play back some scenes to watch them again and if I couldn't, It would sure made me rattle and nervous. but this movie is different. I just coudn't stop it even to use restroom! It was great, the only problem I noticed was the boold. In some scenes it was white, in some it was silver and in another some it was yellow and that made blood scenes less impressive. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, they should've shown the bood in black, not any other colors. and another problem of the movie was the Junior, at the end. they colored him and his stuff in yellow. that was inducing that the Junior is an alien not a human. but he was a maniac human and this movie was not star wars or star trek. we expected to see living dead & Unvulnarable Superhumans but not an alien like creature. and the third problem is not this movie's problem in particular! It's the next sequel's problem and the problem is, they'd gathered all suitable stars in this movie. Bruce willis, mickey rourke, Benecio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba and more but most of them died in the movie. so there is not much stars left for the sequel I hope they make it as soon as possible. Cast selection for this movie was extremely accurate and I'm afraid for the next sequel if they'll not do their job as good as this one. and at last it's not bad to mention that this movie was a big credit for Rodriguez after making some horrible movies like Spy Kids trilogy and I hope he continue to making movie with his original talent that we've previously seen in Desperado (1995).	4.0	Can't wait for a sequel!

078886047X	Sin City	A3POLV7GQ4AMJP	"Yael R. Dragwyla ""HydroDragon Enterprises:  W..."	A wonderful cinematic interpretation of Frank Miller's series SIN CITY, this movie sinks its fangs right in your heart.  It's a genre movie, one of the very best of its kind, worth having in your personal library.  The fascinating thing about Miller's graphic novel series -- and this movie -- is the way it mirrors the city and county of Los Angeles and all their corruption.  That I grew up there -- and have since learned enough about the politics of water, one of the major reasons for that corruption (for more on which, see Marc Reisner's in-depth tour de force on the subject, CADILLAC DESERT:  THE AMERICAN WEST AND ITS DISAPPEARING WATER [Penguin Books:  1986, ISBN 0014-010432-1];  it's enough to make your hair stand on end, and gives the perfect subtext for SIN CITY) to make me swear I'll never go back there.  Ever -- adds enormously to its power, but non-Angelenos, current or former, will find it just as overwhelming as I have.  Nobody does it better than Frank Miller -- except for the producer, director, and actors who together lifted SIN CITY, the movie, light-years above so much of the other current and past cinematic fare.

078886047X	Sin City	A26Z0YLA6H20VT	Y. Martinez	While there is plenty to find unfulfilling in this movie, Robert Rodriguez, has a unique vision that recreates the edge and darkness conveyed in Frank Miller's original graphic novels. The director's sparse use of color, intense violence, and narration, doesn't so much develop characters but establishes them in very specific roles. Three-dimensional these characters are not, but because of the world they inhabit, this should be no surprise. The main characters in each vignette are anti-heroes, not called forth to protect the innocent or week, but to seek out redemption for the wrongs that have slighted them or the ones they care for.Out of all the vignettes, it was Mickey Rourke's turn that is truly a stand-out. His career has always seen him take roles as anti-hero ne'er-do-wells but in this role, he clearly relishes the power his character possesses. The brutality and hunger for a fight come across genuine, with no attempt to endear the character to the audience. He is there for one thing and one thing only, to seek out those stacked against him and brings them all down to the hell he inhabits in his own mind.This movie, while gratuitous in its use of violence and sex, is breathtaking in its presentation of that violence and sex, giving each raw energy and focus that, in such a limited amount of time, captures so much of what was remarkable of Mr. Miller's work.	4.0	Something Unique	2005-09-21	0	0	0

078886047X	Sin City	ASN86FBII91HW	Zach	Sin City is a hyperstylized piece of greatness. Co-directed by Rodriguez and Miller, the film is action packed, highly stylized, and very riveting. It's also an anthology movie! The film consists of a prolouge, three short stories, and an epilogue. There are many many huge name actors in this movie, so watch it to catch them all but I don't want to list them all. The three leads of each story, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Bruce Willis give some of their best acting in their whole careers. Rourke especially! The first story focusing on Marv is definitely the best, but everything is great in this flick. I have come to detest Rodriguez's reliance on cheap digital effects in his current films (Machete, Once Upon a Time in Mexico) and feel they are missing what his older films had, pure raw unabashed bloody squibs and firey blanks flying left and right. This film however is easily Rodriguez's best work. This film had to be done the digital way, all with green screens and digital effects. It's completely appropriate because it blends with the film's style so well. This film is the kind of film that current day Rodriguez excels at.The Blu Ray looks amazing too. You get two cuts and a TON of bonus features. Seriously, no director's DVD releases are as in-depth as Rodriguez'. I got this for $5 on Black Friday and would definitely say it is a must own for any Blu Ray collector! I put this movie off for nearly a decade and am happy to say I have finally seen it. I look forward to the sequel and the TV series as well! I may read the graphic novels now too (I never read them but know other works by Miller, Batman, Ronin, Wolverine, etc.) I might have to say this release and movie gets a flawless: 10/10	5.0	Hyper Stylized Noir Greatness - A Must See for Action and Noir Fans!	2013-12-03	1	1	0

078886047X	Sin City	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"If anyone sees this movie thinking it'll be like a throw back to the old film noir films, then they're headed the wrong way with this film. The movie trailer gave it the ""film noir"" vibe. To me, even the Man Who Wasn't There (A Coen Bros. movie) is more of a film noir than this one. Film noir is a genre that spawned Double Indemnity, Touch of Evil, the Big Sleep, and etc. Not a film like Sin City. Countless voice-overs and the use of black and white via a green screen doesn't make a movie instantly a film noir. If people called it a comic book movie strictly, then I'd be fine. But it bugs the hell out of me when they bring the terms of film noir. Noirs have plots twists, backstabbing, shady characters, and a particular style to them that is different than other film genres, especially with their endings. Check out Chinatown (directed by Roman Polanski) or even The Big Heat (directed by Fritz Lang), and compare it Sin City.Why this movie gets 4 stars or above is beyond me. It had no social value nor was entertaining. It was basically sickening and in poor taste. Seeing the previews of this movie, I thought I'd go check it out, seeing as it had one of my all-time favorite action heroes in it: Bruce Willis. I figured it was going to be a bit weird, but I was unprepared for what I saw.No, this wasn't the gansteresque movie I saw in the previews, it was more of a movie geared towards the horny and moraless teenagers of today. This movie is nothing but sex, violence and nudity. No story. However, it had good acting and good effects.If you liked movies like Bully and Kill Bill, you'll most likely enjoy this film. Else, stay away and save your money for a better movie."	3.0	Not a film noir	2005-04-15	12	4	8
078886047X	Sin City	A20DB2NNXJ075J	Zen Master Steve	The movie follows the lives of multiple protagonists who all resort to violence to get what is necessary done. It's a cool flick. Really. I can't think of a better description than that. Rourke's performance was incredible, but Willis and others also pull off great work. And Alba is amaaaazing.	5.0	Gritty	2011-03-20	1	0	1

I am having directing and acting classes in the university of Rome for 3 years and all i can tell is that this movie is one of the best ever made . Perfect black and white shot with great use of technicolor and and color shot spits . The acting is breathtaking and the story represents perfect the society in which we live today . It has messeges against racism , nasism and the domination of church . It has messeges of fenism , because it shows how can women be strong in such situations . The (mainly)jazz music fits perfect and the movie is also full of tarantino - like black humour . The sceneries seem to be something between a movie and a comic book . There is too much violence but it is used in a way to seem like something odd and disgusting , rather than most hollywood movies which use like it is something natural . All the actors have done great job , and they fit perfect to they role . Especially mickey roork , benicio del toro , clive owen and all the girls in the movie (alexis bledel i think is the highlight) are amazing . A total must have (forgive for my poor english please)	5.0	EXCEPTIONAL	2005-08-29	6	4	2
078886047X	Sin City	A2A02OG3N42R38	Zeveck	It's kinda sad.In the theater this movie really struck me as having an amazing use of negative space and colors. When something on the screen was in color, be it red lipstick, white crosses, blue eyes, or whatever, the theater was bathed in that color and it really resonated from the screen. The use of black and white stood out with incredible contrast.At home it just looks like a black-and-white movie with random things in color. Most of the erie effect is lost.That said, I loved it in the theater and still like it okay at home, with some question of whether I should be reviewing my experience of the DVD itself or the movie.	4.0	Lost A Bit In Transition To Home Viewing	2005-09-04	3	1	2

Simon ""HarlotBug3"""	The dialogue can get damn cheesy.The actors can get canned hammy.For all the action/sci-fi movies that choke themselves on such things, Sin City tosses a salad and kisses with tongue.It will appeal to the juvenile and anti-social, but it will give them higher standards.	5.0	Stylish Violence Beats Fashionable Action Again...and Again	2005-04-14	7	1	6
