B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2BN3YSF6HXJ2	23 Charters	This movie is fairly simple to recommend when you consider that it's well known.  I consider it to be essential to my collection.  It's kind of like the story of a child who grows into a more mature understanding of life through a series of magical events.  She has to ask for a job in a bathhouse for spirits and the manager has to give her one.  A lot of it is kind of funny as well as profound.	4.0	high quality anime	2009-09-14	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AD8JQJ5KQGK1D	&#34;GOOD&#34; Movie Lover	Miyazaki's animated movie SPIRITED AWAY is an entertaining story about a modern day young Japanese girl who gets caught up by accident between the world of the living and the spirit world. This young girl learns how to grow up in a hurry and also learns to be able to stand up for herself.  The story includes lessons about trust friendship and using one's wit.  Some very imaginative spirits are found in this story-some from Japanese folklore. Very young children may find this story a bit too scary, but older children and adults (I'm an adult and I liked it!) should enjoy this animated feature. Lots of fun!	5.0	SPIRITED AWAY	2009-10-14	0	0	0

Maybe its meaning was lost in translation from Japanese to English, however, its the director's responsiblity to make sure that does not happen.I thought that maybe my presupposition was a little uncultivated, so I resorted to independent arguments from friends. They, for the most part, felt inebriated and uninterested in the first 15 minutes of the film. Even though they were the ones who labored through the entire insane, prosaic, and venal ""toon"", they felt that I should reimburse them for the time that they wasted when each one of them would have been better off shaving their hairy asses with toothpaste and a butter knife....  Anyways, I just glanced over some of the reviews and was dumbfounded at the rave reviews that people gave this movie. I still shiver when I see the front cover of this movie anywhere..... I keep telling myself ""Don't worry, go to your happy place.... You don't have to go through that again"".I am an addict when it comes to Anime. My favorite movies are Ghost in the Shell and Akira, so its not that I don't like Japanese animation, I just do not like to watch bogus fragments of someones feebleminded imagination."	1.0	This movie hurts	2005-03-02	72	5	67
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1RNLPUDOD5ZNG	A. Banaag	"This movie ROCKS A$$! I bought this for my B.F. as a B-day present this year and I loved it! The movie's about a young girl who is moving to a new house in a new city away from everything she's ever known. Not until her parents take an unexpected turn which was 'supposedly' supposed to lead them to their new home. Wrong. It actually leads them to an 'abandoned' train station next to an old theme park. The girl wants to go back, but he parents find an empty restaurant filled with delicious food, and insist to stay. While her parents eat, she explores Ther are empty buildings all around her, and she comes across a bath house. A boy sees her and tells her to take her parents and leave befor the sun sets. She does so, but not in time. She returns to the restaurant and finds that her parents turned into PIGS! They get taken away, and she runs back to the train station. Only she reaches a river that was not there when they first arrived. So she had to stay in this magical world she got shoved into, and takes a job at the bath house, where she tries to fet her parents back into humans. Not so easy.This movie is really great and really captures its viewers. It has a slight resemblance to 'Alice in Wonderland', and the ending is awesome. I really love the characters, especially the baby when it gets turned into a mouse. The movie has wonderful animation and music. Everyone should love this movie.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1OT7DSRMJ8PSK	ACD	It's difficult to write a review of a film that both confounds and enlightens. Hayao Miyazaki once again literally &#34;spirits&#34; us away in this fanciful tale. In stark contrast to most modern animated family flicks, our heroine is not a cheerful cookie cutter girl, but rather a somewhat sullen soul much unfit to be the lead character. But what we find is that Miyazaki finds true beauty in the details rather than the action. It is the little moving parts throughout the plot and animation of the movie that make it simply wonderful. In so many ways the story itself is too absurd to make sense, and yet it rests in your mind like it is perfectly meant to be. His diligence to every detail of the animation is so painstakingly absurd that it becomes it's own thing of beauty. Much like the heroine, Sen's, journey; she wins us over through her determination. Miyazaki proves that a movie can be so much more than a good plot, great action, or a good cast. The movie does contain all three, but in so many ways he strips away the focus of what we normally go to the movies to see and submits to us an opportunity to allow our own imagination get caught up in the small details the form together a beautiful scene that could have never created without the collected creativity of individual viewer. I would highly recommend this film, especially if you have any interest in iconic cinema.	5.0	Spectacularly Brilliant	2013-12-20	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3PCC8VFK0ML7L	achtung	"""Spirited Away"" is nothing short of a modern classic in a time when new true classics are hard to come by. It's very inspiring and ambitious, while being beautiful and touching at the same time. The movie centers around a little girl who has been forced to work in a bathhouse that serves spirits in order to save her parents from their awful fate that has been brought upon them. However, she makes plenty of new friends along the way, and these supporting characters are just as intriguing as the main character herself. Add upon this the beautiful score and theme song and you have a movie destined to last. The story takes many twists and turns, but it shouldn't be too hard to follow for most people.As for the special features on the DVD, they really give a fantastic insight into how much labor it required to produce this movie. The ""Making Of"" documentary is very satisfying and leaves very few aspects about the making of the movie untouched. The ""Behind the Microphone"" extra introduces you to the voice actors that took part in the English-translated version of the film, and ""The Art of Spirited Away"" displays the effort that was put forth in producing this movie for an American audience. There's also a feature where you can take a peak at the storyboards for the first scene of the film while the audio track plays underneath. The only feature that's not particularly worthwhile are the Japanese trailers. Admittingly, some of these are very very good. However, some are just too similar to each other and it becomes very tedious to watch these for 30 minutes straight. In any case, the special features are very informative and accomplish their task in giving insight to the making of the film.This movie is not just for kids, but I'd recommend this to families who might be looking for a new movie that they could watch together."	5.0	A DVD worthy of the movie.	2005-05-01	2	2	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A20P9G4ZXZRA7A	A Customer	This has got to be one of my favorite Miyazaki films. Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro, a young girl who gets trapped in bathhouse run by spirits and must rescue her parents (who in true Miyazaki fashion, have been transformed into pigs) before she can escape. The only one who can help her, Haku, is the one she cannot trust.This beautiful masterpiece is a reflection of Japan. Chihiro's relationship with her parents comments on the struggle between the upcoming generation and that of the 60's and 70's during a time of economic downturn. The film also explores greed and corruption, and the destruction that naturally results from it. The spirit No Face tries to seduce Chihiro into taking his gold, but she refuses because she is trying to save Haku. We see the importance of not relying on appearances to shape our understanding of someone. Yubaba's twin sister, although just as ugly as her mean-spirited sister, is kind and recognizes the importance of friendship and love. Although Chihiro's name has been stolen by Yubaba, she still finds her identity and succeeds in surviving the danger she has been thrust into, an unexpected commentary on Japan's identity.This film easily deserves the 2003 Academy Award it won for best animated film. Although sometimes strange and confusing, the story is worth watching and worth reflecting on, even if you have to watch it more than once to understand it.	5.0	A heartwarming film for the whole family	2011-05-10	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1GGDXLMQX196D	Adam D Clarke	I rented this movie on hearing that it was supposed to be good. I was a big fan of anime in my high school days and have kind oif gotten out of that loop. My general disappointment with most anime is that translation is bad and before DVD usually all you could get was the English dub. Then usually the English dubs are terrible. I was veryimpresed though with the ability to view the film in both english and japanese with english subtitles. Also, the English dub is rather impressive. It almost word for word matches the Japanese subtutles and takes a little bit of lisence making the language more natural. The subtitles are very cut and dry. The English language track on the DVD is one of the best I've heard. Disney really went all out on this one. The story is really an amazing one. It's very compelling. One would think that a 2 hour animated film is toomuch but this movie is well worth the 2 hours. It is really a great film. All i can say is wow. Though the second disc of the set is really kind of worthless. There are a couple neat little things but all in all there isn't too much to get excited about, but the movie makes up for it! It's awesome!	5.0	just wow!	2003-05-24	4	4	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AUZG6RLR58ZTG	Adam Dew	Hayao Miyazaki is a geneous in anime. This movie has beautiful graphics and a really well thought out storyline. Its about a little girl Chihiro and her parents move to a new town and get lost when trying to find thier new house. They think they see thier house on a hill top so they drive up there. They enter an abandoned town where food is cooking by itself, so the girls hungry parents run to go eat it. The food turns the girls parents to pigs, and the girl finds out she is not in a human town.Humans arent really excepted in this town, but Chihiro needs to get hers parents back. She ends up having to work in a bath house, while try to find a way to get her parents back to human before its too late. Ive had this movie since it first came out in April 2003 and probably watched it 25 times. I just love all of miyazaki's work epecially totoro. ive had totoro for a little over ten years and totoro never gets old either. I think this movie is enjoyable for everyone.The second disc has the making of this movie,which is really really interesting. I didnt really like special feature showing how the american dub was done though. This is an unbelievable movie, its hard to only watch once, i prefer buying it.	5.0	a masterpiece	2005-01-20	3	2	1

The only Miyazaki movies I have watched is this & Kiki's Delivery Service (Great movie also) and i am not disapointed with them. This movie is about Chihiro, a young whiny and normal bratty girl who changes very much from the beggining to the end from a bratty girl to a strong young women. When i watch this it feels like it is not even 2 hours but a joy ride i could enjoy over and over. The first time i watched this i could not take my eyes of the screen. Thank you Miyazaki for your beautiful work and i will enjoy this movie forever. I so want to watch the rest of the movies like Castle In The Sky, Princess Mononoke, & My Neighbor Totoro.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2A1B0FG40ZYYV	"""aeus"""	When I see al the negative reviews, I wonder what is it that people dislike about it so much? They say &quot;confusing and bizarre plot.&quot; Well, you want a confusing plot, go see Memento!(meant positively)Huh, go figure.Spirited Away is the latest installment by Hayao Miyazaki, master of anime. Seeing this really gave me the idea of what animation was supposed to be. Unlike recent failures, such as Treasure Planet and a lot of stuff by Disney, it had a spark that really pulled you in without anything but pure charm and intrigue. The lead, Chihiro, is somewhat whiny and a brat, but that all fits in. Characters fit in perfectly with their role, some selfish, some kind, and so on.The actual animation was a show of talent by Studio Ghibli, as most of the movie, I sat thinking, &quot;Wow. This beats computer animation any day.&quot; The amazing artwork and beautiful animations all add to the unique flavor. Just amazing.Now for the bad part. I originally saw Spirited Away in Japanese, so I could not rate the voice acting. (being not-Japanese) When I saw the American version with Daveigh Chase, I was appalled to see the voice and words butchered by Disney. (surprise, surprise) Very disappointing.Overall, Spirited Away is a magical movie worth seeing... and seeing... and eventually buying. A true masterpiece... and who says all animation is just for little kids.	4.0	Excellent!	2004-01-08	2	2	0

You can't possibly expect what's going to happen next and even the ending is a little different than you would think.  It's semi-scary for small children who might fear odd looking spirits/ghosts or find the idea of their parents turning into pigs with a possibility of being eaten somewhat disconcerting. The story follows Chihiro who learns to deal with her issues, shows that a lack of material greed can be quite beneficial, and who quickly builds the courage to save her parents.  This movie has the sweet flavor of a plot with good purpose.	4.0	Cute movie!	2012-04-04	1	1	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A32GCOTGFJ9XC3	"Alex Honda ""onyx575"""	"I love the movie SPIRITED AWAY by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's a breath taking anime film about a young girl, Chihiro, who is literally ""spirited away"" to a nether world full of magical beings and fantastic possibilities. She must stay and work at a bathhouse for spirits because a witch has turned her parents into pigs. With courage, hope, love, and the help of a boy named Haku, Chihiro must find a way to outsmart the witch and rescue herself and her parents from this realm and return to the human world.Just like another reviewer pointed out, beneath the surface this film is also about not judging people at face value because there's good and bad in all of the characters, and in us. Chihiro seems to understand that and therefore has compassion for even the most frightening and evil spirits/characters that pop up in the movie and helps them. And even though she might be afraid of them, she doesn't judge them. Perhaps that's the real message of the film and why people find it so endearing...The English dub is fantastic and Daveigh Chase as ""Chihiro,"" Jason Marsden as ""Haku,"" and the fabulous Suzanne Pleshette as evil witch ""Yubaba"" are terrific in their respective roles. But for those purists out there the original Japanese language track in 5.1 surround sound is available.=========== DVD 1 ===========** Spirited Away Movie ** (02:04:28-Minutes)= Intro by John Lasseter (Pixar)/Widescreen with English or Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround and French (not in 5.1).

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A9Z4C6SSRUL0E	A. Liu	"While Major Hollywood studios believe the audiences are tired of watching plain hand-drawn cartoons and began to incorporate more special effects into 2-D animation, yet with disappointing results (Titan A.E., Atlantis, and the most recent Treasure Planet), they have almost totally given up on traditional animation, and focus on producing 3-D computer animation. After a series of successful and charming CG cartoon, one could not help but to wonder: is this the end of hand-drawn cartoon artists? (some may argue that they could get the job as storyboard artists)The point that they are really missing is, what is missing from the recent 2-D animation features, is not the blasting visual effects, or floor cracking sounds. The real thing that is missing from them is a ""heart"".See ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", and ""Monsters, Inc."" (all produced by Pixar Studio, who is, in the writer's opinion, superior than their rival competitors), while they are indeed visually revolutionary, the focus is still on story telling - story that combines humor, excitement, and ultimately family-oriented heart-warming theme.""Spirited Away"" is simply magical, enchanting, funny, and genuinely touching. In the beginning of the film some may be distracted by the in comparison lower frame-rate (i.e. the character movements may not seem as smooth compare to the Hollywood animations), but you will not be able to help but to awe at each beautifully rendered frame. The artistic level and the use of colors in the drawing are all first class. Moreover, 30 minutes into the film, you will probably forget it is drawings that you are watching, because everything inside the screen all comes alive! (Perhaps because it reaches a certain realistic level, some of the scene may be too grizzly and scary)It did not become the highest grossing movie in Japan ever for no reason, and it certainly deserves more attention it received in the western world. The ballroom scene in ""Beauty and the Beast"" never fails to bring tears in my eyes, and it reminds us why we watch cartoon in the beginning. ""Spirited Away"" achieves in the same way, and it achieves it like a breeze among all these competitions today."	5.0	A Lesson For Disney	2003-03-13	97	89	8

I did not like tho how spoiled Chihiro is in the beginning, but i guess that is what this movie is kinda based around...changing her from a weak crybaby into a stronger more independant one...which does happen...the beginning just annoys me.  I also did not like how slow the beginning is....i remember how i was sitting there watching it and going...""would you please hurry it up?!?""  All this movie had going for it really is it's comedy...when it's funny...it's funny...end of story.  I believ this film to be more suited to children around the age of 12 and under i suppose. It is very cute, but i dont think people who are older and a bit more suphisticated will like it too much....the story is just plain weird.

Yes, it has some strange and wonderful imagery, but come on!  So has tons of other Japanese and Chinese animated features.  Plus, the story is so plodding, and at times confusing, that my partner started nodding off half way through the movie.  For a vastly superior and more entertaining animated feature in the same vein, I greatly recommend Tsui Hark's 1997 animated remake of &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;.  With its strange fantasy world of gods, demons, ghosts and timeless love, &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; is a great deal more engaging than the sleep-inducing &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.	3.0	Vastly Over-rated	2003-04-15	15	2	13

This is one that will stick with you days on end, long after you're done and returned it to the video store. It will have you lying awake in dreamless nights, thinking...thinking about everything...pollution...relationships...your family...Spirited Away grabs you right from the beginning: You see Chihiro, an annoying ten-year-old girl whining about having to leave her old house behind and transfer to a new school. Her parents, however, feel the exact opposite. In fact, the thought of starting a new life excites an adventuresome spirit in them. Chihiro's dad, therefore, decides to take an old, dusty road, hoping it will eventually lead to their new house.From this point on, it gets truly amazing. The moment the lights go down on the old abandoned amusement park, Miyazaki's art and storytelling advance to a whole new level. One instant that really stands out in my mind is when Chihiro discovers her parents have transformed into pigs. The look, the expression, the lighting, the mood, the scenery sincerely brought an extreme emotion to the viewer-- I felt as disgusted and afraid as Chihiro did.As the narrative continues, I was entirely absorbed in the wonderful cast; I can't choose a favorite! There was the mysterious Haku, the eccentric Lin, the treacherous Yubaba-- all made me want to squeal ""Oh! How delightful!""And everything I thought was wonderful before builds up the the astonishingly poignant ending. This is the tale of one girl's journey to maturity.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1ILS6Y1LKW9ZR	Amazon Customer	"This movie, the (deserving) winner of an Academy Award for Best Animated Film, got far less attention than it deserved in the fall of 2002 (when Disney famously botched its release--its peak theater count was somewhere around 151 at a time when even outright flops like ""Extreme Ops"" could muster up more screens for a week or two).  In fact, when it arrived in my town in the early part of November, there was almost no advertising, and the theater didn't even bother putting up a poster for it--and the place was packed.And it was packed each time I went back to see it... and packed again when it returned to theaters at the end of March.Make no mistake:  This is a movie that audiences love.  Don't be scared off by your preconceptions about anime, or comments like ""it's too frightening for my kids.""  Every kid over the age of five I've seen watching this movie ends up loving it--including boys (one of them, an eight year old, ended up bouncing up and down in his seat at the end, telling his Dad, ""I knew you'd like it!  I told you we should see it!""  How can you not like enthusiasm like that?).  This isn't some sort of hyper-violent pornography--it's a movie about people doing what people do, even when those people happen to be giant frogs begging for tips.  It's funny, smart, a little scary, and one of the few movies that can be called ""sweet"" without the added caveat ""May induce severe diabetes and tooth rot.""(As for you anime fans--well, doubtless you've all seen it, and you've got your opinions.  But I for one prefer this movie to ""Princess Mononoke,"" for the simple reason that ""Mononoke"" is an easier film to admire and be in awe of than to actually like.  ""Mononoke"" is more important, and definitely not a family film--but ""Spirited Away"" is more enjoyable.  Both are must-sees.)The only complaints that I have is that, first, Disney stuffed so many ...trailers onto the first disc (of which only three, the ones for ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle In The Sky,"" and ""Finding Nemo,"" were of any interest to me) is that the video quality is somewhat impaired--it's a good transfer, but with some edge enhancement.  Secondly, apart from the making-of special that aired on Japanese television (which gives us the rare treat of seeing Miyazaki-san at work), the extras on Disc 2 are definitely not worthy of something Disney calls ""a feature-packed deluxe special edition.""  Only in the dreams of Disney's marketing department.  There's barely more than ninety minutes of content on disc 2, and considering that 28 minutes of that is taken up entirely with trailers and commercials (which get very boring very quickly--like, say, after two or three minutes), and another 45 with the Japanese making-of special, what's left isn't really worth watching more than once.  Still, Disney did at least include subtitles and the original Japanese audio, if you prefer your animation subbed, and they also were nice enough to present the movie in anamorphic widescreen (where a lot of studios would have said, ""family film,"" and done a blah 4:3 transfer from flawed elements).

But even now being 28 years old, I am impressed.... So, what's special in this movie? Why everybody likes it?1) Well, first of all, there is a very unusual story. It's just not what you expect from fairytales or what you are accustomed to expect from fairytales. The story is intriguing and is absolutely unpredictable. Each next scene will make your eyes and mouth remain wide. That's why you'll be glued to the screen the whole 2-hour time while the movie goes. So, I am not going to tell you what's the story is about, as I want you to be excited in the same way I was when I watched it for the first time...2) Humour. There are plenty of moments there, which will make you laugh. The humour is very intelligent and that's why it's very pleasant and enjoyable. In the course of the movie you'll see various characters. Most of them will make you smile without saying a word!3) Main characters. I don't know whether you've seen already ""Tokyo Godfathers"". If yes, then you know how quality drawn characters can be. The 10-year old Chihiro is so real here. Well, actually, my favourite character there is not Chihiro, but wonderful granny Yubaba!!! Oh, she is so cool and witty! Quite a special character I must say, but so lovely! She is so smart and funny that I wish she could be my grand mother!!!4) Music. You know, with such an original score, you don't really need to watch anything. Just listen to this masterpiece of the famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi!!!! Splendid! You will not hear a single electronic sound, but what you'll hear are beautiful orchestral, piano and violin themes. This movie got rich and quality soundtrack.5) English dubbing. I compared both English and Japanese dialogues, and I must admit that the version with English dubbing is far better than the version in original language. I noticed that characters' emotions and intonations do properly sound  situation-wise in the English version of the movie. For example the loving caring voice of ""English"" Yubaba when she talks to her baby is much more convincing than the one of ""Japanese"" Yubaba...Conclusion: this movie is a masterpiece.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A8YDXMFXJ4R6X	Amber	Kiki's Delivery Service was good. My Neighbor Totoro was cute. Laputa, Castle In The Sky was great. Princess Mononoke is one of my favorite movies of all time--an absolute jaw-dropping achievement. Now, we come to Spirited Away.This is without question the best anime movie I have ever seen. It made me laugh (the soot balls are adorable! I want one! I want all of them!); it made me cry; it made me giddy (whenever Sen and her friends triumphed over Yubaba); it surprised me (can't say anything without giving stuff away); and it just moved me like no other anime has ever done.Sen is a real, believable character who acts like a ten-year-old WOULD act if put into this situation. She is lost, confused, sad, angry, sarcastic, beligerent, kind, innocent, and friendly, all at the same time. She doesn't flinch in front of Yubaba, but gives in to her emotions after seeing her parents in the pigpen. She deals with the Stink Spirit without having to be prodded, and faces the angry No Face knowing that he could attack. She is not particularly beautiful physically, but by the end of the movie she is beautiful in other ways, including that way. She is not brave or daring--she tries to stop her parents from exploring, and she doesn't partake of the food herself (which is a good thing).Lin is one of my favorite characters. Like Toki from Princess Mononoke, Lin has an attitude and a sharp tongue and is not afraid to use it. She is sarcastic, insulting, and borderline cruel to most, but to Chihiro/Sen she is almost like a big sister. I love what she tells No Face! (Those of you who have seen the movie should know what I am talking about.)Haku is too wonderful for words. And his other form is SO awesome! He's handsome, kind, and I love his voice!Anyway, Get the movie! Watch it! You'll love it!	5.0	This movie deserves a billion stars!	2003-05-02	4	4	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A4PBVAA3R3UBD	Andrew Alvarez	"I just returned from the theater where I saw Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" for the 17th time. It never gets old. I won't bother with a synopsis because most reviews can give you that. I will offer this: I have yet to see a kid in that theater who didn't absolutely love it. Every single one of them, around ages 4-10, never made a sound. No one did (except for the occasional laughter provoked by a midget bird carrying around a fat, purple mouse at its will). The character development and ideas expressed in this film are unrivaled by any other film I have ever seen. Miyazaki uses the character No Face to teach a lesson about the evils of greed, as well as the importance of love and friendship, hard work and perserverance, the necessity to keep our environment clean, and the will to uphold one's integrity and grow when faced with extreme challenges. If you have seen the movie, you can appreciate this: (if not, this won't ruin anything). At one point, Kamaji explains to Haku that only love can break Zeniba's spell. Honestly, and I'm not making this up, as soon as he said that, this little boy sitting behind me turned to his dad and said, ""I love you dad."" This is a powerful movie and is not to be missed. The scenes of vomiting and bleeding, while natural to most organisms, are somewhat graphic at times. I am sick and tired about parents complaining about how it was absolutely terrifying. The MPAA assigns a rating of PG for a reason. It means parental guidance (which means use your own judgement. If the kid gets scared, it's because it's your own freaking fault). There is in fact a difference between PG and G, believe it or not. If you would like to stick with traditional Disney fare, expect superficial and hackneyed plots with shallow character development and no touching moments in which the filmmaker uses his imagination to epitomize human behaviours and get them across to an audience both young and old. This is the most touching and inspiring movie I have ever seen and should not be missed.

The characters are detailed and the animation is gorgeous, and the plot is intriguing and well developed. It is an awesome portrayal of the supernatural spirit world, as well as a highlight against gluttony. If you consider yourself an anime fan, this is a must see movie.What's more, it must be awesome since it's the only Disney film (sponsored or no) that's ever won an Academy Award.	5.0	Yet another amazing Miyazaki...	2003-04-28	0	0	0

People who say this is too scary for children ought to remember the dementors or the character deaths in the Potter series and (as another reviewer has said) the older Disney movies before deciding that their children would be too frightened.  It tells a great story for kids, about growing up and accepting responsibility, and yet manages to be a great fun movie for adults, too.

The story, the scenery, the characters... and of course, Chihiro,  a little very brave girl. I grew up reading Andersen and Grimm - there are plenty of  brave kids who have to face scary world and powerfull evil forces to save their loved ones. Kids with good, innocent hearts &#34;armed&#34; with such a faith and bravery, humility and ability to adapt. And, of course, adults have no clue! Yet kids do not mind, do not look for rewards  and glory. They just are happy that everbody they love is OK. Chihiro is no different. She entered the scary world and overcame the evil. No fanfairs on the end. What a great lesson for our kids and for us!	5.0	No glory. Just keeping loved ones.	2014-01-12	0	0	0

Where every shot, every frame, is a surprise. Where you marvel at how someone could come up with such a complete universe where you never want to leave...My friend watched ""Spirited Away"" and then she called me and said in a reverent tone, ""you really have to watch this. I'm going to save the netflix DVD until you can see it."" I don't care for japanime, so two weeks went by before I finally got around to watching it. But from the moment the film started, the house could have burned down around me and I would not have stopped this movie.The story is about a ten year-old girl named Chihiro, who is traveling through the countryside with her parents on the way to their new home. Taking a shortcut, they get lost in the forest and ends up at a hillside tunnel. The parents decide to go exploring, but end up in a strange, deserted village. Chihiro is separated from her parents and left alone to discover that the world in which she now finds herself trapped is the spirit world. ""Spirited Away"" is about her journey home. Along the way, she meets a panapoly of fantastical creatures, must work as a slave in a bath house and battle the unknown evils of the spirit world - all the while struggling to retain the memory of her former life, her parents and her name, which she needs if she is ever to escape.I can't recommend this film highly enough.

That certainly speaks to the amazing detail in this film. One of my favorite parts is when the main character puts on her shoes in a rush and taps them against the floor to get them on, which is what a real child would do. Honestly, Miyazaki is a genius. This is one of the only films that I think is a great movie for people of all ages that actually want to be entertained.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A29Y34ALWJUGB5	"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment"""	Firstly, Spirited Away won an American Oscar for best animated film, not to mention other awards earned around the world. Secondly, there are few places where you can find a professional review that actually says something bad about this movie, and if you do it's because that reviewer obviously doesn't understand anime as its fans do. Spirited Away is one of the top films ever, in my book. It blends everything that makes a story great, including lovable characters, a magical world, and a story that will melt you from the inside it's so warm. Plus, it appeals to both adults and children.The story centers around a little girl named Chihiro who's in the middle of a move to another part of Japan, and she obviously isn't happy about it. But during the drive to her new home, her parents take a pit stop and they end up in a deserted city. Only this city isn't as deserted as they think, and they are suddenly drawn deeper into the city by the delights it offers. Chihiro, ever the pessimist, doesn't partake in all the delights her parents do, thus saving her from the curse placed upon them, but that also leaves her alone in this new world of magical monsters and spirits. All she can do to save herself, and hopefully her parents, is work for the master of a bathhouse. During her time in this world she meets a strange boy--who is also a dragon--that seems somehow familiar to her. It's her meeting with the dragon that ends up changing the place she made for herself in this world, and so starts her adventure to save the ones most dear to her.As is the wont of Miyazaki, he places a young girl at the head of the story, and kind of lets her tell it, only in this case Chihiro is by far the weakest of his female leads. It's fun to watch her grow and change into something she wasn't before. This story is filled with symbolism and themes, which means it must be paid attention to, as there is something to be learned in this film. That makes it ideal to both children and adults alike.Disney did an excellent job with the DVD as well, and the obvious love put into this film becomes apparent after watching the documentaries on the disc. The voice actors and those responsible for getting the rights to the film put everything they had into it, and it shows.This is an anime for everyone, and I'd recommend it just that way. Everyone should see this movie. If we could accept anime as easily as we do other types of entertainment, Spirited Away could become a film as legendary as the Wizard of Oz or Disney's classic Alice in Wonderland, as it shares traits from both.	5.0	The Greatest of Miyazaki's Greats	2005-12-22	4	4	0

Suddenly her father takes a detour that lead'em to an old building. They enter into the building, even Chihiro who was very upset. They pass over what was a river, and Chihiro's father starts to smell something in the air... food. The smell comes from a restaurant, an empty restaurant in an empty town. The parents sit in and start to eat but Chihiro wants to leave the town inmediatly. As you can see, the beginning of the movie takes places in the real world but then... all is gonna change. She will meet Haku in the bridge over the railroad, and this is the point when the real world get mixed with the fantasy.I usually see a movie a couple of time, but his one... i've seen it almos 6 times, a record to me.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2EL3990HXOMZB	Antonio Robert	This highly original and very entertaining film swept almost any award there was for animated feature films, including the Oscar and even Berlin Film Festival. (How refreshing, after too nihilistic and erotic &quot;Intimacy&quot;!)With a little discernment, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is suitable for children (although not too young, maybe from 8 years up) and for adults, too -- if they have not their sense of fantasy 'amputated' from their minds. Yes, it's that good!At the beginning, a little bit spoiled girl named Chihiro is moving with her parents to a new place, a new home. She does not seem too enthusiastic about that. But then the three stop their car and looking around, they find a deserted amusement park(?). From then on, a special string of events starts to unfold, and Chihiro -- now named Sen -- is first resented as a representative of human race, but later wins hearts of almost all inhabitants of the weirdly compelling world of various creatures, apparently based on Japanese mythology. In a way, the girl leaves her childhood behind her and becomes a young woman.Combining the improbable with the inevitable, the ancient and the modern, the films contains many societal references and especially in its second half becomes a 'spirited', at times utterly fascinating journey into fantasy (in my native Slovakia it ran under the title &quot;The Way to Fantasy&quot;).I can recommend this film to real movie connoisseurs. Although I liked &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; recently, I liked this one more! Indeed, few films in my adult life have appealed to the &quot;child&quot; in me more than &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.	4.0	&quot;Spirited Away&quot; Elevates SPIRIT and Takes You AWAY	2004-01-20	1	1	0

BIG mistake Disney!Anyway, this is one of the greatest films of all times! The characters are full of life and emotions, which is rare to see in an animated film. The artwork is flawless and beautiful and it has the most original story concepts of any movie from the past 50 years. I cannot emphasize how great this movie is. If you are a fan of classic films such as Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz then you will absolutely love this movie. This movie is a classic that will be enjoyed my children and adults.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1W3DQK1KPGZ92	"""articwolf87"""	"I will start with why I gave the movie 4 stars. It ended abruptly, I mean, I understood the whole part of her learning respect, and manners, and how to live life. I understood all the moral values of everything. But... The fact that everyone got to love her and was happy to see her go. That wierded me out, I mean, aren't they all evil and such. Don't they hate humans. That could have been explained better. I suppose. But, theres not more I can say than that.This movie was excellent...This movie for starters was rather graphic. There was blood, and references to death and a single cigarette but sorry conservative parents that doesn't mean its PG-13. It's PG. There is a difference between PG and G and I hope now all of you realize that you cannot take a 5-year-old to a PG movie. That lesson having been learned, the parents no longer need to put down the movie for showing blood. PG movies tend to have some references to death and in this day and age also have violence and blood.Next on my negative attacks is the fact that this movie wasn't up to Oscar status. Look, the artwork was excellent, the story was beautiful, the plot was great, the scenery and worlds were mystical and entertaining, the characters were unique and fun. Just because your son/daughter did not sit through it doesn't mean it isn't Oscar worthy. Notice the Oscar was for best Animation and not best Child's Movie. Thank you.The Artwork was so good on this movie. I would glance at my friend next to me and we could only laugh with glee at how beautiful it all was, or the similarities between this and the directors other famous filmed Princess Mononoke. I'm slightly disappointed that they felt the need to ad CG (computer generations) to the film. They disappointed me only because it shows they got lazy, they easily could have pulled those scenes off with mere animated art.This movie was not just a kid's movie, but if you aren't a fan of Anime and want to check it out because it's an Oscar winner, than don't get your hopes up. Anime is like Coffee to a kid, you just gotta get used to it before you love it. An acquired taste. It's really an excellent film, the dub wasn't horrible, I'm sure there were some edits, but it was chopped, it was beautiful the way I saw it in theatres. It was excellent and it is a must see for most Anime fans and Children over 8 sounds like a healthy age.Well, having purchased the movie today.  The day it has come out, I noticed something under ""The Art of Spirited Away"" featurette, that some people may find interesting.  Sadly this is what happens when the world thinks it knows everything about movies.  Sadly, some people don't quite understand the things that go on in the backround and just because it says Disney on it means its gonna [stink.]  I mean honestly, look at all the over protective and unimaginative parents that hate it!  That is one of the most appealing things to it that most defintely shows that it isn't Disney.  The featurette I watched explained the situation of Studio Ghibli (Miyazaki's laboratory for animation) on the distribution of their works in America.  Miyazaki refused to sell his work to anyone unless it came, and I quote ""fully uncut in it's entirety"".  No, this is not diet-Miyazaki.  This film was not Disney-fide.  What you saw was the true version of the film translated into English.  If that puts you in too much of a hard situation to listen to your own native language, I'm sorry, just go jump off a cliff.  I too enjoy the original language tracks, but trust me, nothing was changed.  And, guess what that means.  Mononoke wasn't changed either..."	4.0	I have been Spirited Away	2003-04-06	2	0	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3ATTCCO32ZXET	"A. Ryan ""Merribelle"""	I never counted myself among the fans of anime, and I still don't: but Spirited Away may have me looking into more quality anime titles as I try to locate outstanding films by Japan's reigning master director/animator, Miyazaki.The plot rehash:  a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, and her parents stumble upon a portal between our world and the realm of spirits (which strongly resembles a Japanese town of about 100 years ago).  The parents make the mistake of eating the food there and then pay the price by turning into pigs immediately.  Chihiro has to navigate her way through this weird alternate universe and put herself into the employ of a powerful sorceress in order to find a way of getting herself and her parents back to their home.  Along the way she learns to be stronger and discovers new resources within herself.Simply put, I believe this is the best animated film ever made.  Spirited Away not only has incredible visual detail and realism (with hardly any help from CGI), but takes the familiar plot of a fairytale-like story and transforms it into a journey enjoyable by kids and adults alike.  In fact, everything was so superbly and magically rendered that I was able to forget myself under its spell - as if I were re-entering childhood.  Yet on a note of caution to parents, there are some scenes that young children might find scary, involving spirits, monsters eating people and all sorts of strange beings.  Miyazaki never forgets his cultural roots in Animism even while creating a masterpiece that resonates with such universal power. This is no Disney film indeed (although Disney may have led many American consumers to believe that, Pixar was only responsible for the English dubbing and distribution within the U.S.A).I will end up owning this dvd for my private collection to enjoy time and again with my (elementary school-age or older) children. I suggest you treat your family to Spirited Away as well.  It's just brilliant!-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	5.0	Beautiful.	2003-05-07	6	5	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1WB5NZYY5XR8A	"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col..."	The other night, my girlfriend and I are heading to the theatre to see Spirited Away. Yes, it's still playing in some theatres. We saw the film when it first came out, and it was her first introduction to the worlds of Hayao Miyazaki. She had no idea what I was taking her to see at the time, she just had to trust me. In fact, I had no idea either; all I knew was that I saw there was a new Miyazaki film and it was playing in theatres. Of course she liked it. Is it possible to not like this film? But anyway, as we were going to see it again, I kept thinking to myself how you can never fully appreciate a Miyazaki film until you've seen it at least twice. Spirited Away was the only film of his I've seen once.I own this film on DVD, but I've only seen the special features because we just went to see it on the big screen. Funny thing is, it cost more for us to go to the theatre the other night than it did to buy the DVD. How many films would you do that for? It's that good!I'll spare you a synopsis as they are over abundant. Instead, let me just tell you this film is a bit bizaar. People compare this film to Alice in Wonderland because it has that same bizaar quality to the setting that could only seem to make sense in a dream. If you are unprepared, it can make the film harder to digest, but I assure you it doesn't take away from the story at all.The first time I saw this film, I thought it was good, but not the best of Miyazaki's films. Seeing it again, makes me doubt that assessment. Miyazaki's films are so full of details and nuances that you easily miss many of them the first time around especially as you are distracted by his wild imagination on screen. I wish I could put into words how magnificent this film is. You simply must see it, and see it again!Keep in mind the film's PG rating. It may not be suitable for young children. Disney may be the one distributing the film, but it is not a Disney film. In other words, don't just shop for this film for your kids. Get it for yourself.	5.0	See it again!	2003-04-22	3	3	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1B38S1YJR1PQD	A. S. Templeton	"(*****) Theoretically... But this is the Disney-ized USA release of the original Japanese version. For comparison I have viewed a probably gray-market DVD of the original Japanese version with English subtitles.Every time I watch the original, it transports me to a refreshingly different, non-Western, faraway mind-state; quite unexpected at first, but eerily enjoyable. The artwork is lush and layered with detail that emerges only with repeated viewings.BUT... After a second viewing of the US theatrical release, I found myself increasingly disliking Disney's treatment. Chihiro's blossoming strength and courage (the whole point of the movie!) becomes inexplicable, for Disney has her now constantly mooning over Haku, and being mother-henned by Lin.Entire plot elements and dialog are unnecessarily messed with, and cheap shots, insults and inappropriate humor are added. Disney is determined that Chihiro/Sen stay a dependent kid in the Bathhouse, rather than become a peer to her coworkers, and who can hold her own in a strange world.As for Disney's releasing it as ""Miyazaki's Spirited Away"", are Uncle Walt's kids humbly proclaiming the opportunity to present a work by animation's true Grand Master, or are they hastily disclaiming responsibility for such an alien, un-Disney oddity? Perhaps with Studio Ghibli breaking away (as of 2005) from Tokuma Shoten, future foreign releases of Miyazaki's works will get gentler, more respectful treatment.[comment Nov. 2012: I gather that John Lassiter, head honcho at Pixar, championed the whole Miyazaki initiative--possibly over objections & complaints from Disney management. Lassiter personally introduces each of the early Disney-Ghibli releases, showing his love for Miyazaki's art as well as his towering ego. But all media players have a Fast Forward feature, thank goodness.]I'd encourage viewers to stick to the Japanese track on this DVD, with directly translated subtitles, and compare for themselves.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3OHNKP6HX8C9K	balefireelegy	I feel that I should let it be known that I am a fan of  Hayao Miyazaki's work and might be a little biased.  My friends were upset that disney is putting out his films, but hearing the director talk about the stipulations in their contract with DIsney I feel that these fears are mostly unwarrented.This film is very enjoyable.  It is visually captivating and the main characters are all intresting.  Many of the themes presented are similar to those disney includes in their films.  It is a story of growth on the part of the main character, who overcomes various obstacles in her quest to save her parents and go home.  It is  Hayao Miyazaki's imagination in presenting this tale that makes it a worthwhile watch.THe DVD bonuses are also enjoyable.  It gives you insight into how and why DIsney brought these films to the US.  THe documentary of the making of the Japanese version is also worthwhile for the insight it gives you into the process of making such a film, but more importantly it gives you an insight into the culture and the cultural changes going on in Japan.  (when Miyazaki is trying to explain to his staff what he wants visually).It it worthwhile for those who are old enough and who can stand subtitles, to watch it in Japanese and then later to watch it again in english so you can absorb more of the visuals.	4.0	SPirited Away	2003-05-08	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A45Y0E15RCA2H	"""ballistic556"""	The lastest offering from Studio Ghibli - Spirited Away continues the unpararelled streak of hitting cinematic home runs. Apart from Disney's Lilo and Stitch (which incidently also features the voice work of Daveigh Chase), Disney's recent run of feature length animated films has yet to produce a film which could be compared with anything Studio Ghibli has made.Spirited Away has something for everyone: action, beautiful animation, great storyline and Bruce Lee-esque emotional content.Like Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service the main protagonist is a young girl who unlike nearly all girls in western animation has her own unique personality.I would like to recommend this film to anyone and everyone. Although there are some scenes that may frighten young children (like Chihiro's parents being turned into pigs) some parental supervision may be needed.But don't let the the scary scenes dissuade you from showing this film to kids as the themes of loyalty, hardwork, friendship and courage are worth the small scary scenes. Like Willy Wonka (but less scary).	5.0	Another Masterpiece	2003-06-07	1	0	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1XNXHTPQRACRO	Barry C. Chow	What a glorious, glorious labour of love. After watching it, I felt like hugging myself. Calling this film an 'animation' and thus lumping it together with the childish fantasies turned out by lesser talents doesn't do it justice, for this work of art deserves comparison to the best in any genre.This is a film that has complex imperfect heroes, no villains, trials more internal than external, a world more vibrant than our own, a spirituality so deep as to reach the metaphysical, and yet will delight a girl of ten as much as a lifelong moviegoer of ninety. It is also surreal in tone, lyrical in composition, invokes tension and suspense without malevolence, and the filmmaker achieves all of this in an animated cartoon. `Spirited Away' is a work of sheer genius.This film has pity and compassion, love and redemption, hidden strength and discovered courage, turbulence harnessed to an inner harmony; but it never strikes a false note nor succumbs to maudlin sentiment. Through gentle humour and understated dignity, it shows so much respect for the intelligence of its audience that I wanted to kiss the director's hand.Calling this film a fairy tale just won't do. Unlike western animation, its magic is deep down, at the very roots of its make-believe world, so deep that it is worked into the very fabric of the story. There is no faerie flying around sprinkling pixie dust, no bubbling cauldrons, no evil-incarnate stepmother and no goodness-personified prince charming; nothing so obvious or so crass. Instead, the world of spirits into which our little heroine lands is as natural as breathing. In this world, humans are the intruders, and as gross material entities, it is we who bring disorder and upset to their realm.It is not easy describing what makes this film so special, because the reasons range from the very small to the very large. At the small end, the film's eye for detail is simply marvellous. Even the act of a little girl putting on her shoes is given such character that we pause to admire the filmmakers' respect for children. At the large end, this film shares with us a journey of spiritual awakening. Our little heroine grows over the course of the film from a self-pitying self-absorbed little mouse into a loving openhearted daring soul.But a word of caution: this is not standard cartoon fare. It assumes an intelligent audience and therefore dispenses with a paint-by-numbers plotline. Indeed, it isn't even about plot but about character, places, feelings, moods, and most of all, themes. For example, a recurring theme is that of purging. Various characters throw up throughout the film and this may disturb the fainthearted. But, if one is familiar with oriental thought, expelling poison to cleanse oneself is a common cultural theme and does not provoke the same disgust that it does in occidental cultures. Indeed, after our little heroine replenishes the river spirit, his gift to her is the medicine of purging. Later in the story, she saves a number of her friends by putting it to good use.Obviously, this is a film that must be approached with some thought. Unlike most western animations, one cannot view it while idling in neutral. It has much that is beautiful and transcendent, but it also has terror and pain, and it demands our most careful consideration. Those unwilling to invest the required effort will get nothing out of it and had best stick with Bambi. Yet, for all its demands, this is a film that remains accessible even to children. Younger viewers may even have an advantage over their parents because they will approach it with open minds unconstrained by western styles and conventions. For them, the film's symbolism may not be apparent, but the filmmakers have applied such symbolism so gracefully that it will still be felt if not noticed, and this will be all that matters.This film rewards open minds. To fully appreciate it, one must cast away ones preconceptions about animation. Western practice and tradition has sadly fenced animation into a marginal niche by considering it children's fare that is incapable of higher artistic expression. 'Spirited Away' is Hayao Miyazaki's exuberant response. It deserves the same consideration and accolades that we habitually heap on 'real' films and is frankly so far above the excrement endlessly churned out by Hollywood that it inhabits a different plane. This film deserved the Oscar in 2001, not for 'Best Animated Film', but for 'Best Picture'. It really is that good.	5.0	Animation Embraced as High Art	2003-11-19	7	7	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1EI65WJC85U68	"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k"""	Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase of LILO AND STITCH) is a young girl holidaying with her parents when they come across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. But upon arriving and discovering a smorgasboard lined up. The only problem is this banquet is for the spirits, and them only. Naturally, Mum and Dad indulge in the deadly sin of gluttony and for their greed are literally turned into pigs. (But who wouldn't when there's free food on offer?).So on the advice of her new friend Haku, Chirhiro must travel into the spirit world in order to have her parents restored to human form. On her quest she encounters many interesting and imaginative characters such as The Radish Spirit and a giant baby. Chrihiro also runs afoul of the evil witch Yubabba and her kind twin  sister Zeniba (both voiced by Suzanne Pleshette).While at two hours it seems a bit too long, Writer/Director Hayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY is an original and imaginative animated feature that puts Hollywood made fodder to shame. Both kids and adults will enjoy it, though parental guidance is recommended for younger children who may find it scary. And as with LILO AND STITCH, the P.C police will find ammo (Or more aptly, blanks) to give them an excuse to get up on their pedestals and rant to like-minded people about how &quot;evil&quot; movies like this are. Which is of course utter poppycock. But parents should have a look at it first before deciding to let young kids view it. Personally I found the Oompa Loompas in WILLY WONKA to be more frightening than SPIRITED AWAY.  This is good rainy day viewing for kids of all ages- including 23 year old kids like me.	4.0	Imaginative and highly original anime feature	2003-07-07	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3SFU4OP9S11IR	Ben	Just wanted to throw in my 2-cents worth. This anime is everything evrybody else says it is: intriging, exciting, and wildly imaginative. I took my 7-yr old step-daughter to see this at the theatre with the hope it would fire her imagination and show her something ultimately different from the animated drivel that is produced here in the US (ironically by Disney, of whom distributed Spirited Away for American audiences).Just a few of the scenes/characters of note that displayed wild imagination:Kamaji the boiler-keeper of the many arms, Yubaba the witch as she transformed into her hunting persona, the mysterious No-Face, the stink god and his glorious transformation at the spa-house, the flying killer paper dolls, the radish spirit, the 3 rolling grunting green heads, the shadow-folk riding the train, and so many more that are too numerous to mention.This anime will ignite the imagination in a young mind like no other that I can think of.

It was typical Japanese fare, similar to the old 'Speed Racer' my children watched on t.v. It was an antimated GHOSTBUSTERS or similar to the Scooby-Doo movie.Village Roadshow Pictures are releasing some really strange productions such as the primitive prequel to DREAMCATCHER. It seemed to be based on a Japenese video game as in early Nintendo. It contained weird animation, artificial acting (no emotion), and bad voice overs. Even the skinny woman with superhuman strength sounded like a man. Bette Ford made a good ""old"" woman.  There were some subtle references to various classics, thus the fairy tale aspect. The male 'lead' had a Little Lord Faulteroy haircut and looked like Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra. He had a feminine hand (long, slender fingers) like that of the father in the famous painting of THE PRODIGAL SON. He was put under a spell and transformed into a weird dragon.After the hungry phantom swallowed the frog (WIND IN THE WILLOWS) whole, later he was regurgitated and revived -- as in the story of Jonah in the Whale.Even the ""Pillsbury doughboy"" baby of the incredibly old madame looked like Medulsa with snakes in his long swirling hair. He is transformed for awhile into a strange-looking mouse which is carried around by a real-sounding mosquito. He looked like a Sumari wrestler.Everyone had such wide big eyes and no noses. At first, I thought it was going to be just another ""eel"" story, but it was just as much a Japanese version of Spiderman.There was a court jester tempted by the gold, a skull phone of the 'old woman' gnome, poor Sin knee-deep in mire at the bathhouse where Sludge was a smelly guest. The music kept the atmosphere of a geisha instead of a pig farm.There was an abundance of exotic plants and a spectacular hawthorne bush. Other colorful flora abounded in this little paradise by day/Hell after dark.The rain clouds were symbolic of foreboding things to come. Other clouds and the night sky were somewhat realistic-looking, except for the moon.I've never before seen such industrious sootballs. And when they played charades, it was a sight to behold.Their elevators are faster even than those in the Sears Tower in Chicago. One final test (where is Sin?) was a ride on the ghost train to the Swamp on which the conductor shredded the tickets, for whatever reason.As in any fantasy, it takes awhile for memories to return, and only love could break the spell.The public t.v. series SAGWA, misadventures of the Siamese cats, is much more enjoyable than this academy award-winning feature."	3.0	Award-winning spirits for today's child	2003-03-31	4	0	4

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3AK614GW0TEIQ	Biblibio	"To put it simply, this movie is brilliant. If you take any part of this movie and separate it from the rest of the parts it would still be pretty good. The drawing and animation is wonderful here, the soundtrack is incredible (includes my favorite song ever), and the plot is exciting and even scary.The first thing I'd like to say is that if you know how to read, please throw away the dubbed listening choice. The voices are much worse and don't fit the characters as well. In the original Japanese everything flows much nicer, and the characters feel more real. Read the subtitles, because this is a Japanese movie, and not an American movie. In English it feels like Disney, which it is very clearly not.Many people, however, do compare Miyazaki to Disney. The two are very different. Some say that Spirited Away is scary. It's not more scary than my personal scariest movie, the Little Mermaid. But in reality, you can't compare the two. The drawing styles are so different, and where Disney is most often awkward, Miyazaki flows and is very pretty.The movie itself has a nice plot that's quite easy to follow. One thing leads to another, after all. Chihiro is trapped in this other world and wants her parents back. Now we ask the question, how? And this is precisely the movie.There are no boring parts. I mean it. Nothing. The one scene that someone might consider dull is one of the best, because it is just so beautiful. The plot glides smoothly, going from one thing to another. It is funny, exciting, sad, scary, and cute all at once.So I'm recommending. I mean, REALLY recommending. It's a wonderful movie that the first time I saw I fell in love with. It's not the kind of movie where with each viewing you discover something new, but it's brilliant nonetheless. It's an incredible film with incredible animation and an incredible plot. I can't recommend it more. Buy it, watch it... It's wonderful. Anybody who claims that this movie isn't a ""masterpiece"" may be right. It may not be, though I believe it is. But that doesn't mean it isn't amazing. Everyone can agree on that. Just use subtitles and don't watch it dubbed.Watch and enjoy."	5.0	"Worthy of the title ""Favorite Movie Ever"""	2006-11-17	12	9	3

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1JBD36TUFXUH7	"""black_rainbow14"""	This is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. After watching it, my breath was literally taken away.This movie is basically about a girl named Chihiro who ends up in a magical world of the spirits, trying to save her parents. In order to stay in the spirit world, she works in the bath house under Yu-Baba's contract. She slowly learns to become stronger and not give into temptation and to help all others in need.One of the first things I noticed in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; were the vibrant, rich colors. They were absolutely wonderful and helped the movie in so many levels. Each and every scene of the movie has great detail to it, transporting you directly into the film.Facial expressions and just normal character movements were amazing. I especially loved the way Yu-Baba's dress swirled around her. The intriguing creatures that were created proves that Miyazaki has a wonderful imagination.The only reason I didn't give &quot;Spirited Away&quot; five stars is because the end seemed somewhat rushed. Once Chihiro got to Swamp Bottom I felt like the end was all smashed together. There could have been a lot more depth to Haku (young man who helps Chihori) and even Kaonashi (No-Face in N.A.) who seemed to have absolutely no purpose. Also, I think there should have been more about her parents.All in all this is a great movie, despite the &quot;rushed ending.&quot; I would reccommend it to anyone who enjoys being transported to a magical world.	4.0	An Outstanding Display	2003-06-15	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3MQQS40FK2QAQ	"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle"""	"note: This is a new 2012 review of this filmHayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY is the best film of 2002!!! I picked it as my choice for that ten years ago, and it has not changed. I saw other films that were released that year, including the Oscar winner (CHICAGO), and another critic's top pick: MINORITY REPORT. (That movie is on my Ten Best list as well.) But neither of these films had the powerful effect for me as this amazing animated film. And if I were to meet that critic and say that SPIRITED AWAY was the best film of 2002 he wouldn't question it for a second. (He loved that movie, too.) If you know who I'm talking about, you're most likely right.There is a simple reason for my pick: No other film captured my imagination, astonished me with such incredible images, and hit me on an emotional level as this movie. Now add the statistics for SPIRITED AWAY: It is the most popular movie of all time in Japan (over $200 million before it ever came to the U.S.), the first animated film to win the Golden Bear award for Best Picture at the Berlin Film Festival, and the only Japanese animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated feature. Miyazaki has done one hell of an achievement. This film was the second movie in a row I declared Best Picture from Miyazaki. The previous film was PRINCESS MONONOKE in 1999. That one is a wonderful film that got me really interested in Japanese Anime.The story is clearly inspired by the classic, ALICE IN WONDERLAND. But it is only loosely inspired because every single frame you see is 100% Miyazaki. A moody young girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) is moving with her parents (Michael Chicklis and Lauren Holly) to a new house. The father makes a wrong turn and they find themselves in front of a strange building with a dark tunnel. The father is curious what's on the other end and convinces Chihiro and the mother to walk through it. They emerge to a large field and what looks like to be an old amusement park. One thing leads to another and the parents undergo an unbelievable change. Chihiro finds herself trapped in this strange world. She meets an unusual boy named Haku (Jason Marsden), who tells her the only way she can rescue her parents is to obtain a job at a bathhouse, run by an evil witch named Yubaba (Suzanne Pleschette). The bathhouse is a place where spirits go for personal pleasure. Humans are definitely not welcomed here, but Yubaba reluctantly agrees to give her a job. Chihiro is warned that it will not be easy work, but she would not suffer the same fate as her parents.If it sounds like the witch is the villain in this story, and Chihiro is the hero, it is not that simple. Although it is true that the witch is evil and unkind, this isn't a tale of good against evil. Miyazaki had the best explanation: The bathhouse is part of the spirit world where good and evil exist side by side. Among the characters are Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers): a part human-like character, a black figure with a mask for a face, a blob of smelly goo who comes to the place for a bath, and a twin sister of Yubaba. I will not reveal who is good or bad; you have to see the movie for yourself. Chihiro discovers something that has always been inside her. She is the Arc of the story, as they always teach in writing class: the one who undergoes the most change. And unlike some other stories, it isn't handled in an obvious and contrived way. It is done with intelligence and a sense of subtlety. I ended up caring so much for this character. She is caught in a situation she did not deserve to get into.It didn't take long before I felt myself so emerged into this that it became that Out-of-the-Body-Experience that I so rarely have. I feel like I am in this movie along with the characters. It comes not from any big action scenes, but from emotion and images. No wonder. SPIRITED AWAY has just one amazing image after another. Long before I discovered Miyazaki I knew about Japanese Anime. But I found a lot of it to have a rather jerky flow of movement. There is one scene where Chihiro walks through a huge flower garden, and everything is so incredibly smooth moving. This is also true in an early scene when Chihiro looks outside a car window. Miyazaki has always done his animation by hand. (Every single frame has passed through his personal drawing board.) Here, he uses digital technology for the movement and it actually adds to the effect instead of drawing attention to itself.So many Hollywood movies these days, even the so-called ""family films"" have all this non-stop action and fast cutting. But in SPIRITED AWAY, just like in PRINCESS MONONOKE and almost every other Miyazaki movie, there are scenes where everything goes quiet. A frame will actually remain still, or not cut to another frame for several seconds, and you will hear no music or dialogue. You can actually just look, listen to the silence, and drink the imagery that he has delivered. You can look at and spot something amazing in the corner that you would never expect. And the amazing detail that Miyazaki so painstakingly put in each frame becomes so incredibly clear. It is a joy just to look in the corner and see what he might have hidden there.When we do actually hear music in the film, it adds to the emotional power to the scenes. It was done by Miyazaki's longtime film composer: Joe Hisashi. Note that Miyazaki flawlessly combines this score with a lengthy scene involving Chihiro on a train. He doesn't cut corners by just showing the beginning and the end of the train ride, as a lesser director might do. He takes his own time, using so very little dialogue. The scene becomes more subtle and grabs your attention.If you've read my review of PRINCESS MONONOKE on Amazon.com you will remember how I really praised the ending and how it handles a romance. The hero doesn't so much get the girl. He just doesn't get the girl YET. But I finished it with the belief that a real romance would actually come out in time. Miyazaki ends SPIRITED AWAY almost exactly like that.  And as a result, the movie does another wonderful thing that is sadly uncommon for me. It made me think about what might have happened to these characters after the movie was over. And to add another icing on the cake the movie contains a powerful Japanese song heard over the end credits.What an amazing, beautiful, and powerful film. I hope that this review encourages you to seek out this movie on DVD. I'm still hoping for a Blu-Ray release in the future. Miyazaki claims the movie was for 10 year olds. There are some scenes that might be a little too scary for children younger than that. (For those children, I would strongly suggest MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). But if you have ten year old children, and their attention spans haven't been corrupted by the so-called entertainment being shoved down their throats show them this movie. Disney released it in the theaters in 2002 and on DVD with a perfectly dubbed English soundtrack. Ten year old's may have been Miyazaki's target audience. However, it has grown way beyond that.I quoted Howard Hawks in my review of PRINCESS MONONOKE for his definition of a good movie: ""Three great scenes, no bad scenes."" For SPIRITED AWAY, I would multiply that formula by five."	5.0	The best movie of 2002	2003-04-21	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A33V5HGY98WUHE	Brent S. Boswell	"This has got to be one of the best-animated children's movies I have ever seen. I was getting so tired of the typical animated children's movies. Musicals, or poorly drawn visuals, bad voice acting, with a plot that's visible from the start, is what our movie collection was comprised of. However this movie has sort of an Alice in wonderland approach to it, but the visuals and details that go into the scenes are just amazing. I saw this after watching My Neighbor Totoro. Now I am acquiring the entire studio Gibli collection. My children just adore the characters and it is a movie that really gets their attention and not just something they watch passively. I can put this in and time and time again we just can't get bored with it. If you like this movie then you will also like ""The Cat Returns""."	5.0	A MUST SEE	2005-10-07	9	9	0

I found the story to be minimal, with a lot of wasted time between the very beginning and the very end, which was entirely predictable.Clearly, Hayao Miyazaki is one of those opium writers, like the Alice in Wonderland guy. The whole movie is basically a shroom trip, just like Princess Mononoke. Lots of cool visuals.The best part is the beginning, where Dad is driving the family around in his Audi S4, aggressively tackling the dirt road and boasting of his Quattro IV all wheel drive system.  :-)	3.0	This movie is WAY overrated	2003-04-21	14	0	14

What's three seconds divided by three hours?  Answer:  the movie was .000277 fun.  That iota of satisfaction was dimmed by the resentment one of spending $25 on it, and two of all the glowing reviewers who are obviously unfamiliar with all the cool Anime that Japan has exported here for twenty-odd years.  The act of composing my review is dredging up unwelcome images so absurd and stilted that they're laughable amidst the Homeric tragedy that they may remain lodged in my subconscious in remission for some time, perhaps forever.	1.0	Kept waiting for the good part.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ATFXX7NGPHA7N	Bryant Phillips	The title is fitting: I was spirited away by this masterpiece.  I have never before seen a cartoon that swept me up in emotions and visuals so effortlessly.  Even the classic Disney movies are cheesy, immature, and incomplete in some parts.  This movie has a few flaws too, such as the rather unnecessarily gross and vicious scenes with No-Face, and while I understand the purpose for this, it's just not fitting with the rest of the movie.  My favorite parts are the following dreamy sequences: the meadow scene at the beginning, the furnace scene with the little soot balls, the rainy day when the stink spirit arrives, and far and away my favorite animated scene of all time: the train on the water.  These images will probably stick with me forever, they fulfill childhood fantasies I never knew I had, and utterly relax me.Enough rambling, this is the one to get, from the legendary Japanese director Miyazaki.  While other works of his are great, they just can't compare to Spirited Away.  As the head of Pixar states at the beginning: You are lucky, you get to see Spirited Away.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3ACYHAUVV94U5	Bryce Fingado	This is Miyazaki's newest masterpiece.  I think this movie is second only to Princess Mononoke.  It is about Chichiro and Haku.  Chichiro and her family are on a driving trip when they stumble into an abandoned old town.  Haku saves her and tells her to get a job there or she will be found out and killed. Yubaba the witch doesn't want her to keep her name and steals it.  A lot of interesting things happen but if I told you that would spoil the movie.  It is a must see.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A35VG5NCAWKUI	bz	Having seen the preious moives from Hayao Miyazaki, I think I know pretty much what will be happening in this movie. Some sort of man vs. nature kinda thing. To be suprise, this is not the case but rather it is kinda like Alice in Wonderland -- having the big headed motel owner being the queen, and the workers being the solders. I think this movie is just another version of Kiki's Delivery Service with the same theme. One goes in a strange place. One meets some friends. One gets into trouble. One gets excitement. One fights for something. One wins. One gets out the strange place and happy ever. This is not a boring movie but I constantly try to match the plot (if there is any) to the current event around my own life (my own strange place if I may say). This may be a better movie if it is released in the 80's. However, nowaday, we are mostly worrying about war and stuffs like this, this movie just doesn't suit.	3.0	Alice in Wonderland?	2003-07-21	12	0	12

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	I am not big on many of the Animation movies with their spin on  what I consider overacting heroes, however from time to time I find those films that rise above any cultural difference and truly inspire and illuminate something special (e.g. Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Princess Moanoke). This movie along with being nicely animated had an interesting way of telling the story. A family goes on a picnic and enters a strange world through a path into a walking tunnel. The lessons the young girl learns reminded me of another great story (Wizard of Oz). I don't mean it reminded me of it because they are alike, but because they have great and unusual settings and characters showing you very different perspectives. I think most the family will find this animated story entertaining and educational. Great quality DVD with plenty of replayability.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2FPDWTD9AENVK	Carl Manes	Prepare yourself for a magical journey in SPIRITED AWAY, the acclaimed Japanese animation by renown director Hayao Miyazaki. Chihiro finds herself lost in the spirit world after her parents are transformed into pigs by a malevolent witch, and she must gather her strength and courage if she hopes to save them! SPIRITED AWAY transports us to a fantasy world that is filled with strange and magnificent creatures who are brought to life through Miyazaki's captivating animated style. Chihiro's journey is a timeless story of self-discovery and the coming of age, where a young girl first discovers love and compassion by acting outside herself. Miyazaki uses traditional storytelling techniques to paint a unique new fairy tale that children of all ages can relate to, while keeping with its Japanese origins. The sometimes horrifying creatures that Chihiro encounters each represent a stage of childhood that she must overcome, and bring with them valuable lessons that she will use in her budding adolescence. SPIRITED AWAY provides childlike wonder for kids and adults alike, and is a masterpiece of modern animation.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies	5.0	Spirited Away	2013-02-01	0	0	0

I do not reccommend it for children under seven to eight years old, yet it is wonderful for every other age. I understood it perfectly and believe that the plot is at the perfect place between dramatic and simple. I have seen other Miyazaki films, but this one truly took my breath away and is amazing beyond amazing.

He goes through thinking its a lost fairground. Then he smells food and they start pigging out on it. they turn into pigs that the people use for food. she tries running and she runs into a  boy named haku. he helps her and says he'll help her get to her parents. HE tells her to do one thing remember her old name(yubaba will give her a new one)for he forgot his and the only way he can be set free is to remember.he was a slave and somhow controlled by yubaba. the girl Chihiro doesnt know he does dirty work for the master of the bath place. When he gets hurt stealing sumthing from the master of the bath place (yubaba) twin sister zeniba he has a curse put on him only love can brake. Chihiro brakes it and takes the stolen item back to zeniba. when he wakes up he relizes what chihiro did for him and talks to yubaba convincing her to let chihiro and her family go.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2E4XR9HCYC7EX	"Chalice ""Jessica"""	"First, I'd like to say that I'd probably give this 4.5 stars for only a couple reasons... Another reviewer made me realize something that had been lurking in my subconscious for awhile after I saw this movie when my sister got it for her b-day...#1. Why are we not allowed to care about anyone but Chichiro? And why do we still no virtually nothing about her?I'm not the first to notice that unlike other Miyazaki films, I really didn't see the character depth usually present... All we know about the main character we sob and smile over for 2 hours is that her name is Chichiro, she has a mother and father, she moved to a new house, and she once almost lost her shoe in a river... That's not much... And we get even less about the other characters... Like I was really curious about Kamaji and Lin... Lin seemed unhappy at the bathhouse ""Someday I'm getting on that train..."" How did she come to be at Yubaba's in the first place? Same with Kamaji who saved train tickets for FORTY years just to give them to a little kid, a mouse, a bird, and a no-face... And where did Yubaba get a baby?! I can't help but wonder that several times a minute while watching this film... It's a beautiful movie but we wanted more about the characters... If they had cut out parts at the beginning that got a bit tedious, they might have been able to explain a few things... We're supposed to care about Chihiro, which most of us do by the end of the picture, but we really don't know much about her... Why did her parents decide to move them into such a remote location? What did she like to do before life at the bathhouse? Where had she lived in the first place and what had she been like there? They spend a bit too much time in the scene before Haku tells her to get a job from Yubaba... I brought this over to the kids I was baby-sitting's house and they practically slept through that entire first part... It was artistic but not very entertaining... My dad kept asking, ""Have we gotten to the good part?"" In ""Mononoke"" they go into great detail about where the characters came from and why and their backgrounds... I didn't see that here...#2: The ending was somewhat unsatisfying... One minute, Chihiro is flying through the air, the next minute she's passed Yubaba's test, the next moment she's back in the human world going to her new house... I mean... Couldn't we have drawn that out a bit more? We just abandon every character we've grown to know except slightly Haku... Didn't stupid Chihiro have ANY desire to say goodbye to her other friends from the bathhouse like Lin and Kamaji??? WHERE'S THE APPRECIATION HERE?! Then at the end her dad does a nice job posing his comment about how moving to a new place was a little scary... I was expecting a dramatic pause and Chihiro to look out the window to see something that reminded her of the bathouse and then smile and say, ""I think I can handle it..."" We don't even get a final shot of her face and she says it so fast before the credits role my little sister completely missed it...But besides that, this is a wonderful movie... Although Chihiro's dubbed voice was a tad annoying at times, most of the voice actors were EXTREMELY well-selected which really surprised me since I've witnessed the horrible dubbings of many great Japanese films... I really liked Lin's voice... It seemed PERFECT for her part... Chihiro's voice in the subbed made me wish for ear plugs! She has this scratchy hoarse voice that sounds like some old dying woman! The French version was cool! (There aren't enough movies translated into French... What's the point of taking it if you never get to use it?) The music is beautiful and the message that by conquering her fears, Chihiro became a better person and was able to save the ones she loved was well put across...

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A120GIT50UISJP	"Channel KDK12 ""Channel KDK12 - Serious Horror"""	Chihiro is a whiny little girl, upset by moving to a new neighborhood, away from her best friend. When her parents get lost in a dark wood and find a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park, even a sullen little girl has better sense then they. But in they go, and make the mistake of staying after dark; they are turned into pigs and taken away; Chihiro must save them. To do so, she must surrmount increasingly difficult challenges, growing with each new puzzle and threat into a resilient, resourceful girl who survives on her wits, her kindness, and the integrity of her spirit. An excellent introduction to horror and dark fantasy for children who are old enough not to be too frightened by the spirits; probably try it when they get to about Chihiro's age (10).	5.0	A wonderful introduction to dark fantasy for children old enough not to be too frightened	2010-10-02	2	2	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A35Z5BLHL9CI8P	"Charlene ""divercity@interia.pl"""	"""Spirited Away"" is one of the most profound animated movies ever made. It's simple enough to attract the youngest viewers, yet deep enough to be read between the lines by the adult audience. As many of the reviewers noticed, the movie characters are non-cliched and multi-dimensional, which makes the Japanese feature stand out from the other animated ones. Also I'd like to mention the English dubbing is extremely well done - it perfectly reflects the soul of the original. Daveigh Chase (of ""Lilo and Stitch"") voicing Chihiro gives a very moving and memorable performance, so does Suzanne Pleshette as a perfectly rough witch Yubaba. I also loved Susan Egan (Broadway B&B's Belle and Megara of Disney's ""Hercules"") as Lin - she was just wonderful. Flawless voice acting plus the amazing animation and original story really stand for the movie's brilliance. Anyone, no matter the age, should see ""Spirited Away"" - it will truly inspire you."	5.0	Get spirited away	2006-01-01	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1L220BNTP6WYZ	Charles Hugh Smith	Spirited Away is a beautifully realized animated (anime) film on spiritual decay and renewal set in modern-day Japan. The subtexts are rather bluntly stated: the uber-bourgeois Dad and Mom (driving an Audi, we note, a very expensive proposition in Japan) stumble upon a feast prepared for the spirits. Gorging themselves on the feast, they are transformed into huge pigs for their trespass. (Humans, by the way, smell bad to the spirits; the spiritual rot of humanity fills the very air.)Their young daughter, Chihiro, refuses to eat, and is thus spared. She is the pure-hearted heroine of the movie, the one who refuses the blandishments of greed and excess. When a spirit causes a free-for-all in the spirits' huge bath house (furo) by scattering gold from his fingertips, only Chihiro has no interest in scrambling for the material wealth. When the gold is revealed later to be nothing but dirt, her wisdom and purity of spirit stands in stark contrast to the wild greed of everyone else.When a truly repulsive spirit enters the bath house, it falls to Chihiro to lead the stinking mass of oozing filth to a large tub. She discovers a sword embedded deep in the repulsive spirit's body, and with the combined efforts of the entire bath house workforce, she succeeds in removing the weapon. But the sword is not a single blade; out of the wound pours rusty bicycles and a mountain of industrial and consumer crud. This avalanche of waste spews out, filling the entire cavernous room; for the spirit is a river spirit, and this mountain of metal [...] is everything that has been thrown into the river by humans.This is a story of a whiny, self-centered girl who grows through confronting enormous challenges into a powerful force for love and renewal. But more pointedly, it is also a story of the spiritual corruption of modern Japan: greedy and wasteful beyond measure, gorging on consumerist trash which is thoughtlessly dumped into the landscape.That is to say, the film could have easily been made by a sharp-penned filmmaker in the U.S. about the very same spiritual rot and consumerist greed which similarly afflicts our culture. If you haven't seen this remarkable and interesting film, do so; you will not be disappointed in its visual and thematic wealth.	5.0	Spiritual Decay and Renewal	2006-06-01	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT	Charlie Brooks	For those unfamiliar with Hayao Miyazaki, he is one of the best animators and directors in Japanese cinema. In addition to his gorgeous artwork, landscapes, and character designs, he is incredibly imaginative and can weave a tapestry of story that no one else would even think of. So when I say that this film is one of his best, I mean it as incredibly high praise, because everything the man has done seems to turn to gold.The easiest comparison to make between Spirited Away and anything in the western world is to the works of Lewis Caroll and the adventures he wrote about Alice in Wonderland. That is not to say that Spirited Away is some sort of Japanese adaptation of Carroll's work; it merely shares similar themes and sense of imagination. The story focuses around Chihiro, whose parents become enchanted and turn into pigs, leaving her to interact with a strange fantasy world of witches and spirits as she tries to save them. Describing the details of the story is a waste of time, because they need to be experienced in order to really understand their charming brilliance.Fans of Miyazaki's other works will find similarities to his previous films here, but also steps forward in terms of both art and story. For newcomers or people unfamiliar with Japanese anime, this is one of the best first steps you can take into the medium. It shows off one of the best creators of all time in top form. The animation is beautiful, the humor charming, and the story engrossing. You will not regret owning this movie.	5.0	One of Miyazaki's best.	2010-10-05	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A22QC9F0YS6CVT	Chibi Purin	Spirited away is about a girl named Chihiro whos mom and dad decided to move. When they are on there car trip they find a weird tunnel. So they get out of the car and go into the tunnel. Chihiro's dad and mom smell some  thing good and follow there noses which leaves them of into a place that looks like a million resturants. Chihiro's mother and father start earing the food. Chihiro stays smart and starts to wander away from her parents. Then she finds a huge building that looks like a bathhouse. Then she sees a boy there who starts to tell her to leave or that she will become nothing. So she runs of trying to find her parents changed into pigs.So she runs of and sees a weird bout with spirits in it! She relized the spirits were going to the bathhouse. Then the boy,Hiku, finds her and gives her a berry that will maintain her strenght.The Hiku takes her to tha bathhouse and Chihiro starts to tell Hiku what happend to her parents. Hiku tells her to meet Kamaji the boiler man and to ask Kamaji if you can get a job so that she can't be turned into an animal like what happend to her parents.So she asks Kamaji. Kamsji then answers no then one of the girl/spirit comes to feed Kamaji when she sees Chihiro and starts to freak out because shes a human. Then Kamaji tells the girl/spirit that Chihiro's his grandaughter (that's a lie) and that Chihiro wants took talk to Yubaba the head of the bath house. So the spirit girl takes Chihiro to Yubaba (Who's a witch) . Chihro trys over and over agian with Yubaba until Yubaba finally lets her work at the bath house. But then Yubaba steels Chihiro's name and turns it into Sen (you will see why that's bad if you buy the movie).So Chihiro must remember what her real name is and get her parents and get out of the spirit world.It may seem like a weird movie but it gets a lot better tourds the end. Over all Highly recomended! You must buy it now! How ever I recomend it for some one 12 and up for some suggesteve themes.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AJ8D133ATDPJE	Chris Jones	Miyazaki is a genius of animation: this is undeniable. Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Mononoke Hime, and Nausicaa are all masterworks of their various genres (anime is NOT a genre unto itself), or so I've been led to believe for Kiki's and Nausicaa. Spirited Away is another film in Miyazaki's spendidly grand tradition, mixing broad appeal in the design elements with Ghibli's always-beautiful animation style. I really can't gush about this movie enough, so I won't: just go see it.

We watched this movie together with no issues (other than assuring her that nothing bad would happen), and I'm very happy to sit down & watch the movie with her at a moment's notice.This movie is a joy -- positive messages, nothing objectionable, and no unnecessary hype (which nowadays is difficult to find).

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AAOMG1YP0VNP9	Chris 'raging bill' Burton	Outside of Family Guy and South Park, I'm not exactly hot on animation. My favourite films are usually adult in content, be it the philosophical ramblings of Fight Club, the surreal film noir of Mulholland Drive or the intense yet touching Irreversible. So naturally I was sceptical when my friend asked if I wanted to watch Spirited Away, a Japanese Anime that I assumed was for kids. It looked like something to watch with your girlfriend or something.How wrong I was, because Spirited Away isn't just the best animated film I've ever seen, it has quikcly risen to being one of my favourite feature films ever. Gorgeous animation, drenched with mood swings (from happy to sad to angry to confused) and filled with subtle details, Spirited Away captures the beauty of love, the frustration of being misunderstood, how frightening it is to be thrown into a new situation, the greed of humankind as well as showing how a little human kindness goes a long, long way.Spirited Away follows Shihiro (aka Sen) as her family unwittingly wander into a spirit world and treat it with utmost disrespect. Her parents are held captive by the head honcho Yubabba while Sen must learn the ways of the spirit world in order to win them back and return the real world. I won't give anything awy, but she starts of a frightened and pathetic little girl and finishes a strong, intuitive young woman.This isn't a kids films with enough charm to win over the rest of us, its a genuinely wondorful piece of work with messages that apply to everyone. Leave reality at the door and get lost in this fascinating world of the spirits.	5.0	I'm at a loss for words...	2005-05-14	6	6	0

It certainly did me.'Spirited Away' is such a rare treat in today's world with little new been done with conventional cartoons in the world of cinema. Instead, all the major studios are opting for CGI-driven movies that may please visually, but tend to lack in everything else. 'Spirited Away' is lavishly beautiful too the eye, yet is also a strongly structured tale that has the heart missing out of most modern-day animation making this movie really stand out from the crowd and a definite must-see.The story focuses around a little girl named Chihiro who becomes deserted from her parents, only to return and find that they have been turned into pigs. Here she befriends the magically talented and graceful Haku, who safely guides her through, what the place she has found herself in, becomes after nightfall - a spa hotel for thousands of Japan's gods and spirits. Haku tells her that she must find work in there if she is to stay and find a way to break the spell on her parents before they become dinner for some of the hotel's demanding guests.I could find little wrong with 'Spirited Away', which is a lot coming from someone who is always trying to find something wrong with everything. I was utterly captivated in this movie from start to finish. It has everything. Fantasy, the supernatural, comedy, drama... You name it, this movie has it. I've never found that I could recommend an animated movie as highly as I can with this luxurious tale.The character design is fabulous meaning you're guaranteed to meet many kinds of gods, spirits, and creatures that you won't come across anywhere else. Some of the characters literally made me say ""wow!"" as they really are outstanding'Spirited Away' is absolutely spellbinding throughout and worthy of all the praise it has, and will receive in the present and near future.See it now!"	5.0	Swept away by 'Spirited Away'...	2004-10-05	3	2	1

And then I also love all the creative spirits at the bathhouse! I definitely pick-up on a different one every time I see this movie. There are so many!

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3B3MVWF769LNY	Cindy Shugart	Spirited away is yet another masterpiece by hayao miyazaki. I honestly don't think he ever forgot what it is like to be a child. This allows him to create believable characters. The story of spirited away is about a little ten-year-old girl named chihiro. The story begins when her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of a large red building. After further investigation, the family guesses that it is an abandoned amusement park. The family begins to explore and discover a little strip of restaurants. One of the restaurants has a lot of delicious food set out (freshly cooked I might add). Chihiro's parents begin to gorge themselves on the food saying that they will pay whoever made the food when they return. Chihiro, afraid they might get in trouble eats none of the food. Instead, she begins to explore the park. She finds a bridge with a train running under it. As she looks down over the bridge, a young boy appears out of no where. He tells her to hurry and get out of the park before the sun sets. Chihiro runs back to her parents and finds that they have been turned into pigs. She runs away to hide but the same young boy (named haku) finds her. He tells her that the park is a vacationing resort for the spirit world and that the only way she may survive and get her parents true form back is to get a job at the park. Chihiro ends up getting a job at a bath house run by the witch Yubaba. Chihiro has to learn responsibility and bravery before she can ever get home. It is an amazing movie and I rcommend itto anybody who loves anime and even those who don't. I loved it so much that I bought it with my babysitting money. If you like this movie, some others you may enjoy are Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo, or Princess Mononoke.	5.0	yet another masterpiece by hayao miyazaki	2013-03-28	1	1	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1S0VBB2HQ6IXR	C. Johnson	"Many people feel (including myself) that ""Spirited Away"" is Miyazaki's best work.  It's easily worth seeing more than once, more than twice, putting it in a very special category of work. This is possibly because Miyazaki does so much of his movies himself, giving a purity of purpose that most movies, made by committee, cannot possibly match if the single creator is so gifted, which Miyazaki absolutely is.The plot is surprisingly complex, with numerous characters who don't fit into stereotyped ""good or evil"" roles. Just watching the first 10 minutes reveals Miyazaki's almost unlimited imagination in action. ""Spirited Away"" is a bit over 2 hours long, considerably longer than most US animated works. So you get plenty of value, considering you will very likely end up watching multiple times over the years.""Spirited Away"" focuses on a girl who faces all sorts of challenges, and is forced to grow up in order to save her parents, after they all became trapped in a completely different world they are sucked into after they lose their way. One involving aspect of the movie is that people and other beings in this other world are simply going to work, trying to make money, eating etc- their motives aren't different from ours. Magic is part of their lives, instead of facing, say, a corporate framework every day at work in our world. This makes their actions much more believable, enabling us to suspend our disbelief and enjoy the movie.The artwork is gorgeous, a visual feast if there ever was one. Some viewers feel that the movie is too dark, but is this different from old Bugs Bunny cartoons? In these you'll see exaggerated cartoon violence, involving blowing each other up with dynamite, falling off cliffs and so forth. In a nation that can't seem to detach from the the 9/11 terror attacks over 10 years ago, these cartoons actually might inadvertently remind some of the unthinkable. Miyazaki's work can't be any worse than these unintentional cartoon events and no kids should be prevented from seeing the movie. I myself had nightmares for years after seeing a Disney cartoon (Fantasia) many years ago, and since ""Spirited Away"" resolves very positively, I don't think children should be prevented from having such a rich experience.I don't know why Miyazaki makes his animes: is it to make an environmental statement? Because his talents must be exercised? Or maybe just because he can? Whatever the reasons, we are lucky to have the chance to see his work. His worlds are so strongly conceived, so complete, that they seem to somehow be ""more real"" than our mundane daily lives. For someone able to evoke such powerful imagery, it's not far from a definition of magic.  Something timeless and wonderful exists in ""Spirited Away"", something there isn't nearly enough of. If you haven't seen ""Spirited Away"", as the introduction says, you are in for a very rare treat."	5.0	Superlative work	2011-01-16	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess"""	"""Spirited Away"" was my welcome into anime, and a good one at that. Japanese animation is sometimes hard to follow and often confusing but this is very easy to understand. The creative works of Hayao Miyazaki previously include classics such as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Castle In The Sky"" and ""Princess Mononoke"", but ""Spirited Away"" is his latest and most acclaimed to date, winning countless awards and deservedly so. There's always been a certain magic to his movies and this is no exception.As a family becomes lost while looking for their new home, they stumble upon a train station that leads them to an old, abandoned theme park. The young girl Chihiro has an eerie feel about the place so she's reluctant to explore and begs to go back, but as her Mom and Dad become enticed with the smell of delicious food cooking from a distance, they ignore her pleas and venture further into the shops, leaving poor, frightened Chihiro with no choice but to follow.Her parents eventually come across plates stacked of tasty eateries and indulge themselves in it. As they try to persuade Chihiro to join them, she briskly shakes her head and, frustrated, wanders off on her own. It's then when she notices a bath house and comes to meet a mysterious boy named Haku who warns her to get out of there. As he pushes her away, darkness descends and the place no longer seems abandoned as the lights flicker on and the night comes alive with black ghosts (or spirits). As she runs back to her parents, what she finds instead are her Mom and Dad transformed into pigs. Confused and scared, she races back to the entrance only to realize that it's covered with deep waters now as a boat arrives with masked figures cloaked in drapes. As she tries to convince herself that this is all just a dream as she struggles to wake up, Haku (an oddly familiar soul) returns to her side, giving her substance so she doesn't fade and become invisible. In time she learns to trust him and he promises to assist in getting her parents back so she can leave this place and return home. But first she must blend in and demand work from the boilerman, whom happens to have legs and arms like a spider, to escape the greed that could trap her in this strange world forever. Through a series of events she eventually becomes suspicious of Haku's motives but has no other options in saving her parents. Along the way she makes new friends, becomes a stronger person, and faces challenges that help unearth the courage from within herself.""Spirited Away"" has everything you'd expect from a fantasy movie, such as a dragon that reminds me of ""A Neverending Story"" and a witch named Yubaba (with a very big head and an even bigger baby, mind you), but the imagination and storytelling are truly original and you never know what's going to happen next. It's a real joy to watch and the dreamy animation is beautifully realized as it's brought to life."	5.0	An epic adventure of finding one's courage	2003-11-11	15	13	2
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"The other day I ran into a friend of mine at a gas station/video store. She was asking me whether a certain family movie was appropriate for her 3-4 year old daughter. I said yeah(even though it's not the greatest movie) and I got to thinking whether to suggest a Ghibli film. Problem is is that most of them aren't exactly ""for all ages"" since there's no dance-y numbers, obvious comic relief and easy to follow plots. So we have Spirited Away, which despite being an excellent film, might not be the first one you should use to test your kid(s) on Studio Ghibli films.Chihiro and her parents are travelling when they come across a tunnel. They go through it to end up in an abandoned town which has a lot of food. Everyone except Chihiro eats only for them to turn into pigs. Eventually, she ends up in a bath house which caters to gods and they're not particularly interested in humans. She has to somehow manage to escape the bath house and get home with the help of some friends.Now just to clarify what I meant in the first paragraph, this is a 2 hour film and its quite packed with information and characters. Not to mention it's pretty much a talky film with no songs, or gags and jokes a la Shrek or even Toy Story. In many ways, you can consider this more a film for 8-13 year olds than 3-4. They'd probably like how colorful it is but this isn't like Dora the Explorer or Spongebob where the accessibility for a child is instant. As for the scary scenes mentioned, it's not really a big deal, depending on their tolerance. Let's put it this way: did they survive the dwarves hunting the Witch in Snow White or the Ursula fight in Little Mermaid? Yes? Then they'll handle it.There's plenty to like here. First, the animation is of course great, largely hand-drawn which is certainly even more impressive watching it. And like Miyazaki characters, there's no black and white/good and evil characters which makes them all the more human and likable. Although some might not like Yubaba which qualifies has one of the more instantly unlikable characters. The voice acting like the other dubs is likable but I usually click the Japanese option right away. Not that I'm against English dubs, in fact that's how I watched Fullmetal Alchemist, it's just I tend to prefer the original.What should you watch first? Well Totoro is probably likely as well as Kiki's Delivery Service but oddly, the most kid friendly is probably the Cat Returns since there's very little scary parts and it's not plot-heavy. But Spirited Away is rightly an animated classic you should watch."	5.0	A great family film	2006-09-20	9	8	1

Elsten	Hayao Miyazaki is my 7-year-old daughter's favorite director, but the first time we watched this (about a year ago) she was creeped out by it and didn't want to finish.  I let it rest for about a year then tried it again.  This time I explained a bit to her ahead of time about the Shinto traditions and how the spirits in the movie should be viewed not as monsters but as the essence of the things they are believed to inhabit (rivers, radishes, etc.)  I watched it with her and tried to answer questions as they came up.  Now it's one of her favorites, and we've viewed it several times.	5.0	A Classic (but you may want to prep your kids)	2006-07-03	5	2	3
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	Anime has grown into a popular genre for many people, both young and old, across the world. In some western universities, a striving undergraduate can now take it as a major, even taking the subject further as a research project in the attainment of a Masters degree. One of the more popular anime film features is `Spirited Away'. In fact, in my opinion, it is a good introduction to the genre, as it is a work of pure art, made with compassion and detail, a beautiful film in every respect.At first glance, the story echoes other well known stories, such as `Alice Through the Looking Glass' and `The Wizard of Oz.' Although similar on the surface, in terms of a little girl finding herself in a fantastic land, searching for a way out, `Spirited Away' has it own unique signature. The cast of strange characters are legion, the strangest being `No Face', a black hooded, masked demon-like phantom who, in more ways than one, is the central character, who reveals that greed is within all of us, contrasting the lead, Chihiro, the brave and compassionate little girl, who must pass a series of tests in order to free her parents from the clutches of a terrible spell, brought on, by the way, through their own greed.The story begins with Chihiro and her parents driving through the countryside. They stumble upon a peculiar structure and walk through a tunnel into what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro, of course, is reluctant to enter the place, but her parent's curiosity wins out. In the park they come across shelves upon shelves of delicious food. Mother and father cannot help themselves and begin gorging the food until they're transformed into massive pigs. This is our first clue as to one of the film's central themes: greed. Thus begins Chihiro's journey into a fantastic land of creatures, spirits and evil witches.What I found astounding about this film was the care and attention to detail in every scene. All too often we take for granted just how much work in involved in creating an animated film. There are indeed some astonishing scenes in this film that would of taken days, weeks or even months to create. When viewing this film with this in mind, my appreciation for anime and animation in general, moved straight to the top. Anime is certainly a burgeoning art form in many ways.`Spirited Away' is a film for all ages; a wonderful example of anime and perhaps a good introduction to the study of the genre itself - absolutely five stars.	5.0	A Spirited Example of the Genre	2004-10-12	3	2	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A13IJWE0PHDGRR	"C. MILLIGAN ""Zaarin2006"""	Occasionally, just occasionally, a film becomes a culture in its own right, and everything it is related to falls away around it to leave it standing on its own. Spirited Away is such a film. It has taken over box office records in Japan, and not done too badly in the western hemisphere, widely being cited as one of, or even the, best animated film ever produced.But Miyazaki's epic is not just a brilliant animated film. It is a brilliant film. All too often, animated features are great because of the animation, that is the technical dazzle and sheer fantasy nature that the animated medium allows for. And that's great. Spirited Away, however, goes further. The themes it touches on - greed, emotional attachment and the imperfection complex that blights every human being; as well as presenting the importance of traditional values - can be found nestled in the scripts of the deepest live action films.We quickly become immunised to the sheer weirdness of the world presented to us in this film, and that helps us identify with the characters that we might otherwise struggle with.The plot is summarised well above, but to give a brief outline (which falls massively short of doing the film's complexity justice); I don't want to ruin the sheer surprise of the exotic, and downright bizarre nature of the spirit world; suffice to say it'll leave you dumbstruck and inspired by the attention to detail that has gone into it. Essentially, the film follows Chihiro, a ten year old girl, who, along with her parents, is transported magically into a world of spirits and sorcery. When her parents are turned into pigs by a cruel spell, she must battle her way through the politics and intrigue of the society she has been stranded in. Helping and hindering her along the way are the friendly but icy spirit Haku, and the greedy sorceress Yubaba. Chihiro must find her way out of the spirit world alive, and with her parents restored to human form. Confused? You will be, so the trick is to let go for two hours and allow yourself to become immersed in the fantasy of this spirit world.You come away from this film feeling like you've learnt something, feeling like you've had a good time, and absolutely certain that you're going to watch it again. This is the hallmark of a good film - shelf life - and in this respect Spirited Away is timeless. Like all truly brilliant motion pictures (e.g. Where Eagles Dare, The Sting, Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon), you come away with a substantial number of questions, and a need to have a repeat viewing to start to answer some of them.Purists will prefer the original Japanese version, but the dubbed English version has made the film accessible to many more; and, as it's an animated film, the dubbing is considerably less obvious than with live action films. As an animator, I have found a repetitive draw to this film for inspiration and ideas; but as a regular movie-goer, I simply find it a truly excellent, must-see flick.	5.0	More than an animated masterpiece...	2006-12-09	12	11	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A7CA9SKY69YT8	"Colin Smith ""ice_maniac"""	Ok, so I'm slightly biased about this movie because I went to see it on my first date with my now fiancee, but honestly, it was just...magical!Ok, it's not geared towards kids exactly. Well, it is and it isn't. Miyazaki is enthralled with childhood, and has managed to capture that feeling of being 10 years old like no one else in my experience.While the english dub is excellent, the japanese version is just that much better. And the subject matter is pretty heavy for most young children, as it deals with growth from innocence to a more adult, yet not-quite-adult stage of development. Some concepts may be a bit too advanced for young children, but most kids 10+ should have no trouble understanding the movie's plot. And they may even identify with it.What made this movie truly excellent was the score. Leave it to Joe Hisaishi to write a score that makes me, a full grown man who'se never cried at any movie ever, weep like a little girl! Hauntingly beautiful music adds so much to the overal presentation. If you are a fan of Miyazaki, or not, you should definitely check this out.	5.0	Lovely movie	2003-10-12	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AZ9N53LAUMWES	Commish	"""You're called Chihiro? That name is too long and hard to pronounce. From now on, you'll be called Sen. You got that? You're Sen."" - Yu-BaabaSoon after the family car carrying an insecure little girl moving to a new town is stopped at the end of a mysterious road in the forest, she and her parents are thrown into a world of magic, danger, and tests, and emerges a strong, assertive young lady. Her name is Chihiro, and she is able to accomplish this successful journey to maturity because she does not lose her own identity to the name-stealing witch, Yu-Baaba. Sen evolves into a true heroine because she never loses the memory of her name, Chihiro, even though she is constantly surrounded by strange characters who have long-forgotten their own names and the importance of being who they were intended to become.The newest installment in Studio Ghibli's unparalleled collection of animation movies, ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" (AKA: ""Spirited Away"", and ""Sen or Chihiro in the Land of the Gods"") accomplishes everything its predecessors did - seamless animation, an engaging story, and a brilliant soundtrack. Spirited Away is a story about a girl who is stuck in a mythical world of gods, ghosts, and witches - Chihiro must overcome adversity and fear in order to save her parents (who have come pigs) and escape the world that has enslaved her. Director Miyazaki Hayao, head of Studio Ghibli, has managed to craft a cinematic masterpiece, one that will doubtless be considered a classic. Spirited Away takes on an extra level of significance, as Miyazaki has announced that it will be his last film. In retrospect, it can be seen that Spirited Away has amalgamated the best elements of previous Ghibli-Miyazaki movies into one spectacular film about a lost little girl named Chihiro. One of these elements is strong character development, which is evident in the character of Chihiro throughout the course of the movie, and becomes the central focus of the movie itself. As the Japanese title suggests, Chihiro undergoes a significant change of character in the movie under the persona of Sen, but she is still able to retain her own identity, unlike the other characters of the story. As Sen, Chihiro is able to bring out the strength and courage that was deep inside her, becoming more independent and accepting of circumstances. In a mythical world that causes people to lose virtue and become greedy, Chihiro is able to remain innocent because she remembers who she was. Through her unclouded perspectives she is able to grow into a courageous, independent, and adaptable individual.The masked ghost is probably the most enigmatic character of the movie, and serves to illuminate Chihiro's shining presence. The ghost is essentially an empty shell - his thoughts and actions are tailored to the desires of those around him. Upon entering the bathhouse, he notices that the sight of gold makes the bathhouse workers squirm in greedy ecstasy, and so he seeks to please them with gifts of gold. By successfully ensnaring the giant frog and eating him, he assumes the shape of a frog, which suggests that the ghost takes on the personality and voice of his prey. The frog was probably eaten first because of its non-humanoid features, to show a physical, and implied mental change, which would not be as obvious when the ghost eats a person. The ghost can never manage to tempt Sen, however. Offering her valuable items such as the bathhouse cards and a handful of gold nuggets, she always politely refuses him. A subtle detail about the ghost is what tells the viewer the environment the bathhouse has - every time that Sen refuses the ghost, the ghost turns increasingly transparent. It is almost as if in order to solidify in the bathhouse, one has to be greedy and desire riches (unless one had eaten the bitter dumpling as her parents did before turning into pigs). This idea of solidification is also shown with the arrival of Zeniiba at the bathhouse, where she cannot assume an opaque state. This is probably due to the virtuous intentions of Zeniiba, Yu-Baaba's older twin sister, who is not driven by greed. Although the two sisters look, dress, and talk the same way, the personalities are wildly different. While Yu-Baaba is the owner of an extravagant bathhouse for the gods, the centerpiece of a festive town, Zeniiba lives by herself in a small, isolated cottage with flowers on the doorframe. While Yu-Baaba's world may be one of forgetfulness and stolen identities, Zeniiba's is one of recovered old memories and a strong sense of self. Chihiro is told to treasure her name, and to be assertive of her identity. The masked ghost is also asked to stay at Zeniiba's house to serve as her assistant - in this peaceful and humble environment, the ghost has nothing but kindness to learn from Zeniiba.Throughout the film, Haku, an intelligent boy who befriends Sen soon after she is left by her parents who have tranformed into gluttonous pigs, unknowlingly guides her back on her strange journey to her former self. When Haku in not outside the bathhouse, he is a tormented flying white dragon, constantly searching for relevance to the reason for his being. Eventually we learn the bond between Sen and Haku, but not before a wild ride through this animated feast for the eyes first.This film may be too intense for little ones as there are scenes of horror, violence, and blood (including bloody vomitus). Young teens will certainly have a level of maturity to be able to see it and ask questions, and hopefully engage in ""spirited"" conversation about all things Sen. I've viewed it half a dozen times, and I still get more out of it each time. I'm am certain you will too."	5.0	Move Over Disney, Japanese Anime Raises the Bar	2009-02-01	2	1	1

A friend lent it to me and I hesitated to watch it for about 2 months, until I finally decided ""why not?"" I am truly very happy that I decided to watch this film. It is nothing short of a masterpiece. The film is about a young girl who gets lost in a world of spirits after her greedy parents get turned into pigs. During the film she learns many things about herself. Writing from an artists' point of view, the music and art in this movie are absolutely stunning. The animation is very realistic and captivating, allowing the viewer to enter an imaginary world which seems to be filled with surprises for both the protagonist and the viewer. The music adds to the beauty of this animated world. Even more wonderful than this is the story. At first it may seem trivial, but as the film progresses you will notice that it is in fact very deep. The protagonist encounters many tempting things through her journey but refuses them and there are several references to greed in the film. Younger children may not pick up on this, but older ones will most certainly understand the moral of the story. However, this deep side to the film does not by any means overpower the more magical, fun side of it. You will be captivated by the adventure and won't want to stop watching!

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	"To begin with I can't help but agree with all the accolades for this movie.  English version or not, this plays as well as any picture I've ever experienced.  Over 40 years ago as a boy, I was enchanted by a special animated film (of who's name I can't remember, and I've never found again). The film was about a young boy learning to be a man. He was taught by a wise man, wizard, sensei or something like that, in ways that changed his view of the world and his perception of himself.  The challenges he faced were very ""Eastern"", (yet still universal) and the philosophy learned has carried through my life to this day. Spirited Away is the type of movie that can have this kind of effect on young viewers.  The positive experience we can draw from movies like this, can't be compared to banal animation films with dancing tea cups, and weak lessons in PC morality.Unfortunately Disney wants to control the animation market for young children.  Its pathetic efforts in the releasing of Spirited Away, and the previous Ghibli Studio movie Princess Mononoke, provide compelling evidence that Disney fears the intrusion of quality competition into its US marketplace.  I had to drive over 100 miles to see Spirited Away because Disneys maximum release was 151 theaters, and that was only for a week.  I would encourage any anime fan or any discerning parent to buy the DVD or video when it is released.  If you should get the chance to see the movie on the big screen, don't miss it, its a real treat for the eyes and the mind."	5.0	Greedy to Disney no Distributor	2002-11-27	30	29	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1R9QZWD4W8QTK	"C. Quinn ""totality denier"""	There was certainly a hype around 'Spirited Away', the way there is about a lot of anim&eacute;; you're supposed to think it's superior because it's not American. I don't agree with that -- 'Shrek', 'A Bug's Life' and 'Toy Story' are all masterpieces, to name but three fairly recent US offerings.But here the hype is justified. I saw 'Spirited Away' at the cinema, but have to say I enjoyed it more on DVD. This kind of (basically hand-drawn, though computer-enhanced) animation needs sharpness of focus that you rarely get with film projection and I found myself enjoying the images and noticing detail much more at home.Miyazaki and co. strike very good balances here -- imagination is strong, often grotesque, but never so bizarre that it becomes just a 'trip'; there is morality, but it never veers into the didactic or sentimental; there is awe and humour, the sublime and the terrifying and the comical.Above all, there is simply beautiful drawing and colouring, and character animation that's both minutely observed and economical. I particularly like the range of complexity: from the Haku-dragon's elaborate, undulating curves, right down to the soot-creatures, which are like telephone doodles come to life. The computer enhancement adds stunning backgrounds and transparency effects to create some striking images.Finally, it's nice to have both language versions. I tend to be a subtitle-snob; I walked out at the start of a screening of the English-language version (it had been billed as in Japanese) and haven't seen it yet, but will give it a go. To me the original voices are even more important in animation, because they're the main 'real' element, but I guess it's a matter of taste and the English version has been widely approved. And I have to admit to watching the dub of 'Princess Mononoke' one day when I wasn't feeling well enough to follow subtitles, and it was excellent.	5.0	The best animated feature ever made?	2005-07-23	1	1	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	This is an amazingly beautiful movie.  The story captures the flavor of a ten year old's life with its use of fantasy blended into reality.  Chihiro doesn't want to move, feels her parents don't understand or pay attention, and wishes she were somewhere else.  She ends up in a magical world full of strange and fantastic beings.  Of course, she ends up facing dangers and has an opportunity to become the hero, which teaches her more about herself and amazes everyone else.  It is a well done story.  I don't want to trivialize it by saying the plot points we know.  It is how those plot points are worked out that is fresh and inspiring.  The movie is peopled by characters that range from beautiful to frightening, from mundane to so weird you wonder about the mind that could conceive of such a thing.The animation is the best yet from Studio Ghibli.  I simply was stunned by what I was seeing on the screen.  Where do you come up with creatures like these?  And where do you get the time and patience to draw such detailed and beautiful things.  I wish I could get prints of some of the images and hang them on my walls.And while I love the movie a great deal, my kids loved it even more.  My own ten year old says it is the best movie ever.  What better endorsement is there than that?There is also a very nice short on the making of the movie - especially bringing it to America including some of the cultural difficulties in translation. And I also enjoyed turning on the Japanese original voices and reading the English subtitles, which have some subtle differences in the dialogue from the dubbed English.Just a great movie and a great disk.	5.0	A faulous story and a crowning achievement in animation	2003-11-07	4	3	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	For many years, Hayao Miyazaki has been regarded throughout the world as a visionary on par with Walt Disney. It is rather ironic that his presence in North America consists of a devoted cult following because his films have barely been shown here because of Disney. The studio has the distribution rights to all of Miyazaki's films on this continent and has sat on them for years or released them direct to video with little to no fanfare. This changed with Princess Mononoke which generated such a critical buzz that Disney ended up releasing it in a few theatres.It paved the way for Miyazaki's next effort, Spirited Away, which is the most successful film in Japanese history (it grossed over $200 million before it was shown in North America!). Despite Pixar's John Lasseter championing the film, Disney still gave it a limited theatrical release (compared to their own titles) here in North America. This made its surprise win at the 2002 Academy Awards for Best Animated Film all the more of an upset. Now, Spirited Away is out on DVD on a two-disc set.From the haunting image of a riverboat full of lights that drifts along the water at night to the amusing sight of little balls of soot dancing along the floor and carrying tiny lumps of coal, Spirited Away is full of images that are as stunning as anything this side of Disney. Characters flying gracefully through the air is but one of the many flights of fancy that populates Miyazaki's movie. It is this sense of wonderment and the feeling of experiencing a waking dream that recalls the original Fantasia.One of the most refreshing aspects about Spirited Away is its to appeal to people of all ages. It stresses character and story over merchandising, which is such a novel concept in this day and age. One really gets the feeling that this movie was made by a true artist who has something personal to say.Aside from the movie itself, the first disc also contains a superficial featurette entitled, &quot;The Art of Spirited Away.&quot; John Lasseter and some of the American voice actors are interviewed and praise Miyazaki, however too much emphasis is placed on the English translation and not enough is spent examining the film.Disc two begins with &quot;Behind the Microphone,&quot; a featurette on the American actors who provided the voices for the dubbed version of Spirited Away. This extra feels like Disney is patting itself on the back a little too much. &quot;Select Storyboard-to-Scene Comparison&quot; takes a few scenes and allows the viewer to go back forth from the storyboards to the final product. While this is a nice feature you cannot have both on screen at the same time for a true comparison. The strongest supplement is &quot;Nippon Television Special,&quot; a fascinating look at Miyazaki and his crew making Spirited Away. It clocks in at 40 minutes and almost makes up for the superficiality of the other extras.The extras on these DVDs are obviously targeted towards newcomers to Miyazaki's world. This is fine but in the process, Disney is alienating his more devote fans. However, the stunning transfer and the option to enjoy the movie in its original Japanese with English subtitles, more than makes up for the lack of substantial supplemental material. This movie is required viewing not just for fans of animation but for film buffs in general.

I think Disney realized how popular anime was getting here in the States, and decided to try to make some cash off of it by putting their name on the product.DO NOT USE THIS MOVIE AS A JUDGEMENT FOR OTHER ANIME!Traditional anime, produced by companies like ADV Films, Pioneer, Bandai, and Anime Works (Which I'm doubting any of you have heard of if you consider SA to be ""great anime.""), is what you really should be looking for if you want to try anime.There are great anime titles out there, for all ages... if your kids really want to watch anime, there's Pokemon and the like.  But parents turning into pigs and a vomiting... thing... is really more suitable for kids a little older than what this movie was targeted at.But since I doubt any of you care... then by all means, watch it.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A854E5FCL8X1I	customer	"Spirited Away (2001) is Hayao Miyazaki's eighth film in which he not only animated, but directed and wrote the screenplay for it, as well. It is a true gem made in the tradition of his previous classics like Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke.Although the animation created by Miyazaki and his team at Studio Ghibli is fantastically beautiful, as always, but I also enjoyed the story:It is about a spoiled young girl named Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase in the English dub) who is moving to a new home. When her parents decide to take a short cut, they stumble upon a supposedly abandoned theme park. As Chihiro explores, her parents stop to eat. She returns to find them transformed into pigs. She meets a boy named Haku (Jason Marsden) who leads her to a mysterious bathhouse for spirits in order to avoid Chihiro suffering the same fate as her parents. Chihiro is put to work by Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette) the greedy witch who is the boss of the bathhouse. As Chihiro adjusts to her new life, she becomes a kinder, more accountable, and caring person. However, Chihiro still hopes that she will one day be reunited with her parents.One aspect of the film that I admired is that the characters are not flat. It is a problem that I think is typical in many films (Disney in particular). The characters are nearly always categorized as either ""Heroes"" or ""Villains"". Miyazaki creates characters with deep emotions and meaningful actions that don't always fit the cookie-cutter mold for shallow characters, thus making them more human.Additionally, I thought the film was very creative. The movie is bursting with imagination everywhere. It's like the Harry Potter of animated films. What I love is that most of it goes into the little background details.This is a truly magnificent film! I highly recommend it! 5 stars."	5.0	A truly great movie	2009-06-18	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1HCBQ6XFZ7E6I	Cutsceneaddict	"Spirited AwayDisney/MiyazakiPlot:Moving away from everyone and everything you've ever known is bad enough, but when your parents decide to stop and check out an abandoned ruin in the middle of nowhere and you have that feeling that something really bad just might happen, you know you're in for a long day...This is the dilemma that 10-year old Chihiro faces as she drives to her new home, and things go from bad to worse when her parents stumble across an abandoned bathhouse and amusement park and begin consuming some tempting foods placed so precisely on the counter of a stall...As night falls, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs and she finds the streets crawling with dark specters. What's worse, the way out of the area has completely disappeared, with miles of water separating her from land like an island.Under the guidance of a young boy, Haku, who claims to have known her since she was very small, Chihiro is instructed to enter the bathhouse and demand work of the arachnid-like boiler man named Kamaji if she ever hopes to save her parents and escape the island.But getting a job at the spirit bathhouse proves to be the easiest task that Chihiro must fulfill. Saving her parents will require her to deal with the most bizarre of guests, face the slander of her fellow workers, grow from a spoiled child to a responsible young woman, and discover the motivations of Haku, who appears to be bound and brainwashed to the malicious manager of the bathhouse, Yubaba...My thoughts:I'll just confess it now: I didn't expect to like this movie, but the truth is, I did end up enjoying way more than I ever thought I would.Spirited Away is reminiscent of Lewis Carol's Alice in Wonderland with its unexplained happenings and weird, often frightening, circumstances, and deserves more than one watch in order to catch everything. It certainly has some bizarre moments that don't seem to make sense, but you have to understand that Spirited Away is meant to be just that--fantastical, weird, and mythology-oriented. If you try to understand this film in terms of logic, instead of focusing on the circumstances involved, you'll miss a lot of the enjoyment.The cast of characters is very original, often in the wackiest sense of the word. From the multi-armed Kamaji (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Eggman's grandfather, Gerald) to the giant-headed Yubaba, this film has a lot to offer in terms of unique characters. Chihiro is a very dynamic character in that you don't exactly respect her spoiled ways, but understand her realistic fears, at the beginning of the film; by the end of the film, Chihiro is tackling dangerous situations and even putting her life on the line to save her friends. She's a heroine that impresses and appeals to the audience.If the weirdness doesn't turn you off too much, you'll find a very immersive and original story about a young girl's maturing to adulthood, a love story with a unique spin, and a world reminiscent of Alice and Wonderland... only with a Japanese, Miyazaki twist.Artistry is off-the-charts, with a beautiful blend of breath-taking backgrounds, animations, and action/peril moments. Once again, Miyazaki does not disappoint visually! Humor is, as always, present and clever. I laughed heartily.The cool stuff:Artistry is incredibleOriginal plotInteresting and dynamic heroineUnique supporting charactersGood humorBeautiful musical scoreThe ""meh"" stuff:Centers on the weird and unusualSome drawn-out scenesA few points that were entertaining, but not entirely necessaryFinal Verdict:As I said before, I didn't expect to enjoy Spirited Away, but I really found that I enjoyed it more than I thought, even the parts that were too weird for me to grasp. The humor kept me laughing contentedly, and the connection of Chihiro and the guardian-like Haku, coupled with each advancing episode in Chihiro's quest to save her parents, kept me interested to know how it would all end...As for the end itself, well... I won't spoil it for you, but it was, in its own way, unique and open-ended--a satisfactory ending for such a bizarre film.If you don't like anime, then you may want to let Spirited Away go, but if you enjoy this type of animation, it's certainly a must-see if, for no other reason, than just to say you've seen it."	4.0	A must-see if, for no other reason, than just to say you've seen it	2013-05-30	1	0	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A23SJEV8RMLTHH	"DaelRa ""DaelRa"""	I really enjoyed this movie. I won't go into the story or plot as others here have done it so well.With the exception of Princess Mononoke this is the best animated movie I've ever seen. Aside from the most beautifully drawn animation and a great imagination, this movie is free of the schmaltz, sentimentality and ram down your throat morality that most US animated movies have. The morality is there in buckets but it's so subtle that it sneaks up on you from behind. There are no good or evil characters in this movie. Most have a good and bad side to them. To me this is a far better way of explaining to kids the real world out there than the black & white mentality that most US movies portray. Most kids' movies I've seen talk down to kids. Miyazaki's movies tell stories that kids understand at their own level, whether they're 10, 15, 25 or 80.Whilst I'm in total praise of the Japanese movie, the US DVD does have its faults. The American dubbing is truly awful to my English ears and I can only watch it in its Japanese/English subtitled version. They tried far too hard to make it sound 'natural' to American kids but everything about the movie screams 'Japanese' so why bother to go to all that effort! Another minus was that I had two copies of the DVD version seriously skip on two different players.If I were giving stars for the original Japanese movie, I have to give it 5. The DVD however could have been a lot better. The US dubbed version knocks at least a star off it and two dodgy DVD's out of three isn't good for the physical media.	4.0	Would have given if 5 if it weren't for the terrible US dub	2003-04-28	3	2	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1J4ME8XRJDQOR	D. A Flory	Sprited Away is an impressive movie.  It has a coherent plot, a well-developed main character, and supurb animation.It definitely succeeds as a story about a modern girl who winds up as a bathhouse attendant for kami, and has to grow up fast in order to deal with the bizarre situations you'd expect in such a place.However, I think I liked the concept better than the execution.  The idea of an abandoned theme park taken over by kami is really inspired, as is the kami commuter train, where the tracks and stations are all partly covered by water.For me, the eerie situation and atmosphere kept getting buried by the action and dialogue, which often seemed random and pointless.  Slimy blubbery things with tentacles show up, puke lots of slime, eat other slimy creatures, puke them up, and everyone screams a lot.For some reason (too much H.P. Lovecraft?) nearly all kami in Miyazaki movies are kind of shapeless and blubbery, and spew slime and tentacles everywhere at the slightest provocation.More importantly, none of the kami are developed enough as characters for the viewer to get much insight into their motivations.  Yubaba/Zenziba can switch from being manipulative or murderous soul-stealers to kindly grandmothers in the blink of an eye, and like the rest of the cast, always seem to push Chihiro in the direction she needs to go to finish the story.  I had the frustrating impression that the whole story simply existed for the sake of Chihiro's psychological growth.  That may well be the director's intention, but certainly makes for a less interesting movie.	3.0	A good movie...but a bit disappointing	2007-05-29	6	2	4

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	&quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a masterpiece, there's no other way to describe it. Miyzaki has created a unique, bizarre, slightly disturbing, always charming and fascinating animated world unlike any you've ever seen.I'm not much into Japanese anime, and I haven't seen any of Miyazaki's other films, but &quot;Spirited Away&quot; puts to shame many of Disney's more recent movies ... as a matter of fact, I like it more than &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; which is saying something.What a magical movie. It is completely unpredictable, but once you get started watching it, I challenge you to walk away. The animation is at once startlingly realistic and beautifully surreal. You are inside an environment that feels both ancient and brand-new. It tells the classic hero story, populating it with characters that are fresh and interesting, and there's no shortage of insight into human behavior, something the very best &quot;cartoons&quot; are careful to include.My favorite characters are, of course Chihiro, the little girl who changes from a whiney, self-centered, materialistic brat into a more mature person capable of caring for others and taking responsibility for herself; Yubaba, the amusingly large-headed witch who runs a bathhouse for disembodied spirits and is by turns villainous and sympathetic; and No-Face, the mysterious apparition whose timid behavior masks a monsterous appetite for affection. I also love Yubaba's &quot;bodyguards,&quot; three freakish green heads that literally tumble about muttering &quot;oy, oy,&quot; and ... well, all of the characters are wonderful. See the movie and you'll understand.&quot;Spirited Away&quot; overflows with glorious imagination, rivaling &quot;Lion King&quot; for the top spot as my favorite animated film. My point is this: see this movie! You'll be glad you did.	5.0	You must see this	2003-10-13	3	2	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	If Mononokehime got Miyazaki Hayao to a pinnacle in Japan, Sento No Chihiro takes him to even higher peaks.  Clearly Miyazaki's masterpiece, it's wins in the Berlin Film Festival and the Oscars is very much deserved, as it shows that anime can be imaginative, intelligent, and inspiring at the same time.Chihiro is a whiny and petulant spoiled pre-teen brat who is clearly not looking forward to moving to a new city, a far cry from the responsible Satsuki in Tonari No Totoro.A presumed shortcut takes Chihiro and her parents to a tunnel, through which they pass into an amusement resort that the father presumes went bust when the bubble economy collapsed.  The adventure begins when in a moment recalling Circe and Odysseus's sailors, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs, and she finds herself stranded in the spirit world.  Her only help seems to be Haku, a boy sporting a Prince Valiant coif and is valiant.  Humans are forbidden here and in order to survive, she must work for Yubaba, the giant-headed sorceress crone who runs the establishment.  Chihiro survives, but at the cost of losing her name, which becomes Sen.  Yubaba owns every employee here, body and soul.  Nevertheless, Chihiro/Sen still must get her parents restored to human form and return to their car by the tunnel.She is also befriended by Lin, one of the serving wenches initially reluctant to work with her, and from her, Chihiro/Sen learns good manners, such as saying thank you, and how to work hard.  The way Lin and the other girls' eyes are drawn may be a reference to Chinese immigrants working unrewarding menial jobs in Japan, especially judging Lin's name.  Haku though becomes the focus of her attention at one point, to which she risks her job and safety when he's injured and close to death.The bathhouse is a posh and decadent establishment, a Las Vegas for spirits who relax in baths and eat lots of good food.  Compared to other creature menageries seen in Star Wars or Return Of The Jedi, Sento No Chihiro features some imaginative, ghostly, and at times cuter creatures than anything from Jabba's palace.  They range in form, shape, and size, such as the giant radish god who nearly takes up an entire elevator cubicle, down to the cute soot sprites who lug the coal nuggets to stoke the boilers that keep the hot water coming.A high point comes when a stink demon enters the bathhouse and its true identity revealed when first a bicycle and then other kinds of metal garbage is pulled from its side, also recalling the fable of Androcles and the Lion, but serving as a sad reminder of how rivers are used for dumping.As for Kaonashi, the transparent and mysterious black creature who mutters &quot;uh&quot;, he seems to embody someone who wants to be useful or wanted to an impersonal and capitalist world.  He is able to produce the herbal tags Chihiro needs for a tub, and all he wants in return is friendship.  Chihiro recognizes that the bathhouse, with its greedy employees who abuse his powers, is bad for him and helps him get out.The striking scene of the train filled with faceless spirit salarymen is the testament to the soulless and unrewarding corporate world.  These spirits could be anybody, but does anyone care or think they are real individuals?Joe Hisaishi's trademark melodic and swelling piano score is put to good use as he did in the films Kikujiro and Parasite Eve among others.  And the soot sprites came out in Tonari No Totoro, but Yubaba and Kamaji are evolved characters from Castle In The Sky, where they were the sky pirates.Miyazaki's masterpiece, in terms of story and animation, and with a character who really grows up to be a more responsible and loving person.  A recent favourite of mine!	5.0	Magical and imaginative tale will spirit you away	2004-05-16	5	2	3
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1JGY1Q4Y8ZXRW	Daniel Lee	"There is already much being said about this film that, and I may not be able to say anything that hasn't already been said before. Many give it praise for being a well animated ""Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass"" tale. It's good for children that can count their age on two hands because in Miyazaki movies, children are heroes. Kids will like Spirited Away and others such as Totoro for that. As for anyone who ever ""was 10 years old"" as Miyazaki says, be more wary. It is at heart a children's film that could have easily been produced by Disney. It's popularity perpetuates the myth that cartoons are for children, thereby making it difficult to take seriously (for most of the general public) to take as ""higher art."""	1.0	WAY OVERRATED.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2OMOO9PDZEVOG	Darryl Fabia	"The latest of Miyazaki's works ported over to the U.S. via Disney's funding is probably one of the best animated films to hit American shores to date, even going so far as to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Picture of 2002, and it certainly deserves it.Set at first in modern-day Japan, the movie begins with a ten-year old girl named Chihiro moving to a new house with her parents. After a wrong turn, her father decides to make a shortcut through the woods, which leads the three to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, where her parents find food sitting out and begin to stuff themselves like pigs. Chihiro refuses to eat and goes exploring, and as nightfall approaches, it becomes clear that this is not an abandoned amusement park, but a place thriving with activity. When she tries to find her parents to escape, she discovers that they have transformed into pigs after gorging themselves on the food of the spirits.To survive in this new world, Chihiro is befriended by a boy named Haku, who helps her hide from the spirits until she can reach the bath house, where she must get a job from Yu-baba or be turned into an animal like her parents.""Sprited Away"" takes a different path than the conventional Disney film that so many are used to in animated films. For one, there aren't any musical numbers, which is almost always a plus (the only animated films I can think of where the the musical numbers set well were ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which had but two that worked while the rest interrupted the plot, and ""Lilo & Stitch,"" where the songs and story seamed together flawlessly.) The animation is also very different, consisting of Japanese animation (anime) to create characters and settings that flow very smoothly.There's more to the difference than simple audio and visual flavor, though. Chihiro is not the standard hero. She's a whiny, immature brat (as Yu-baba puts well) and won't stop complaining at first. It isn't until she's pressed with incredible odds and responsibilites (some of which force her to break down) that she can begin to grow up and face the strange world around her.That strangeness is yet another difference. The world that Miyazaki has created here is nothing short of odd, tossing in plenty of spirits and gods of Japanese folklore, and even poking fun at some of them, such as the Radish Spirit.Yu-baba isn't a clean ""villain"" either. In fact, she's more of an antagonist than a true villain, as she really is protecting her property and her ability to earn profit, while Chihiro is an invader, even if she is innocent, and threatens the spirits' way of life. Some may call this evil, but they would do the same thing when put in a position of defending what they hold dear, as petty as it may seem.There are themes and subtle symbolisms riding in ""Spirited Away"" as well. Much of it involves the effect of humans on the enviroment, as clearly evidenced when Chihiro's parents are eating the food that belongs to the spirits, or the endearing scene with the Stink Spirit. There are also things that I have yet to decipher, such as the separation between adults and children, but I really don't know. The shadow people of the train harks some sort of symbolism, but I don't know it yet (if anyone has any theories, contact me.)Everything about the plot and characters will take in children, adolescents, and adults. The visuals are stunning and look wonderful, only catching off when we some of the CG takes place when the train passes a house later in the movie. And then, there's the music, an absolutely wonderful score by Joe Hisaishi, who's composed scores for other Miyazaki films. ""Reprise,"" when matched with its scene, is enough to bring tears.The DVD isn't all that great, but it has a nice animation on the menu. There are a couple features, as well as some Disney trailers. The second disc has a few extras, but much is in Japanese. The trailers for ""Spirited Away"" will seem like poor advertising for those used to American-made trailers.The DVD features aren't important though. I wasn't even expecting a 2nd disc when picking this up, so it was really just a nice bonus. The real gem is the movie, in all it's wonder and glory, and it begs multiple viewing (which you'd do anyway, right? Why buy it otherwise?) If any movie deserves credit and attention, it's this one. All in all, ""Spirited Away,"" simply put, is beautiful..."	5.0	Beautiful...	2003-09-15	11	11	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A34JAXR0W215IP	Das Book	"Normally I wouldn't have bothered writing this review; after all, Spirited Away has close to 700 5-star reviews on Amazon already, so who would ever bother to read mine, even if they dug it out from beneath all the others?  But having just rewatched this movie for the bazillionth time--I've honestly lost count by now--I found myself motivated to sit down and write a review that may never be read, simply because I love the movie so much.  (If you're reading this, thanks!)Let me start by pointing out that I'm a huge fan of all of Hayao Miyazaki's works, but Spirited Away is easily the best of them all (at least until his next movie, which is scheduled to be released in Japan in the summer of 2008).  Let me also point out that you don't have to be a fan of anime to enjoy this film.  To be sure, the plot does draw very heavily on the Shinto faith and its associated stories and legends; but even those who have never heard of Shinto can watch and enjoy Spirited Away.  The reason is simple: In spite of its religious trappings, the movie is at its core a story of love, sacrifice, and growing up.  In the beginning, Chihiro is whiny, depressed at having to move to a new home, and generally incapable of seeing anything beyond the tip of her nose; she complains a lot, doesn't do much of what she's told, and generally seems determined to make the worst of everything.  Of course, she's learned her lesson by the time the credits roll, but the movie never feels the need to hammer that lesson home for the viewer; like the best of storytellers, Miyazaki-san is a master at delivering the medicine with just the right amount of sugar.  The universe itself, as fantastic and whimsical as it is, is so beautifully presented that even the unbelievable seems completely plausible; CGI is used in a few instances, but only in small amounts, and even then the computer graphics blend with the traditional animation almost seamlessly.Which brings me to the movie's other major selling point.  Spirited Away is truly a sight to behold, full of colors and movement that would have made Walt Disney lock himself in his bedroom and never speak to anyone again; light and shadow and colors are used with impeccable skill, and when combined with the work of what has to be the most talented foley team in history and music by the unparallelled Joe Hisaishi, the result is a movie that you can quite literally lose yourself in.It's hard for me to say which voice track I recommend more; on one hand, the original Japanese with subtitles is a little bit closer to Miyazaki-san's original intent, but on the other hand, the voice acting on the English track is so spot-on that, if such a thing as ""perfection"" could be said to exist, it would be fair to just go ahead and call it perfect.  (The English vocal track also fills in some of the gaps for American viewers who aren't familiar with the customs and trappings of Shinto.)  Since the movie was released in the US by the Walt Disney Company, the vocal cast is star-studded, a rarity for an anime release; John Ratzenberger's brief poetic interlude near the middle of the movie (improvised on the fly in the recording studio) is particularly noteworthy, and hilarious to boot, as is David Ogden Stiers' performance as Kamaji.  Of course, the Japanese voice acting is beautiful too, so you really can't go wrong either way.In the end, there's very little that could be said against Spirited Away.  There is violence and bloodshed, to be sure, but it's of such a fantastical quality that I honestly don't see most viewers over six years old having a problem with it.  Plus, the main character, for all of her initial flaws, turns out in the end to be incredibly bright and resourceful; this is a hallmark of the works of Hayao Miyazaki, an avowed femininst who believes that women and girls are every bit as capable as any male.  Since I happen to agree with him, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  To anyone who's sick of the sort of cookie-cutter garbage that's marketed as good family viewing nowadays, Spirited Away will provide all the relief you'll ever need."	5.0	You literally cannot go wrong with this one!	2007-11-04	3	3	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A14E9I0FO6EVBT	dave-o	Hayao Mayazaki's stunning work takes the boundaries of traditional cel animation and stretches it to a point no Western animated movie has in quite some time now. The film owes a lot to Lewis Carroll as much as it does Osama Tezuka. Chihiro is a reserved apprehensive girl who is transported to a world of large fuzzy gods and old Japan-style theme-parks turned marketplaces and bathhouses. Transformation is a large theme in the film: river gods transformed by human pollution; humans transformed into pigs; Chihiro transformed by her domineering employer into 'Sen'.Like Mayazaki's eco-fable 'Princess Mononoke', this film's Romanticism allows for morals to play through in very clever ways. Characters are more complex than first glance and each has a redeeming side no matter how grotesque. The imagery is stunning at times. Rich Mannerist color schemes with elaborate set designs unfold for the nearly flawless animation to take place in.Having said that, the only flaw in this DVD package is the credit Disney tries to take for some of it in the Bonus Footage. As usual, the Mouse talks down to their audience in their sophmoric and superfluous explainations. English-Version Producer John Lassater comes off like a big dope that (thankfully) Mayazaki can see through. Who cares about Kirk Wise or any of the other Disney directors that had almost nothing to do with the film itself? Skip instead to the Nippon Television documentary that takes you through Studio Ghibli and the final tense months of production. This segment where the animators and staff work round the clock offers a candid view of the animation film process. The film itself transcends its Western distributor and shines as something very distinct and touching.	5.0	Animation Tour-de-Force	2003-09-01	6	6	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	&quot;Spirited Away&quot; is one of the best japanese animated movie released.  It rightfully won the Oscar for Best Animated Film for 2002.  The plot was written very creatively.  It combines adventure, drama, and fantasy, offering the audience a unique theme that no one will forget.  This begins when the family car stalls, and the little girl walks into a maze of unknown fantasy.  She must escape this dangerous territory before it's too late.  If she fails, her parents and her sanity will have disasterous results.  Her struggles through her mission offer many twists and turns, keeping the audience's eyes wide open.  The acting is wonderful, whether speaking english or japanese.  The animation is amazing.  The combination of elaborate colors and features give the movie the added viewing pleasure.  Such quality keeps &quot;Spirited Away&quot; ahead of its time.  This movie answers why it's the highest grossing japanese movie of all time.  This will keep its audiences entertained during and after viewing.  This will be a classic in the near following years.	5.0	Japanese Animation At Its Best	2003-11-22	1	1	0

Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is fine art.  Disney's marketing strategy worked just fine, as far as I can tell -- that is, limited release, followed by limited release even unto Des Moines, Iowa, rewarding expected behavior by animeniacs, followed by release to DVD.  Excellent.  This is literally like owning an original Picasso, and as the shelf life of Disney's chosen DVD surface media gradually erodes over the next 0.5 decades or so, the few surviving copies may even accumulate fiduciary, as well as superbly aesthetic, value.  The plot is typical Miyazaki ecology maunderings; if you could stand it in Mononoke Hime, you can stand it in Sen to Chihiro.

Nagy ""eldamahj"""	One of the most original and beautiful films to come out of Japan, Spirited Away suffers in English-speaking countries from the poor dubbing forced upon it by the Disney distributors. I could say so much about this film, but the other reviewers have said it all, apart from the fact that this film (like all films) is diminished in quality once an overdub track has been laid over the original language. The three stars is for the English over-dubbed version. I saw this film in the original Japanese and couldn't watch more than five minutes of the English dubbing without wanting to switch it off. (Obvious) American over-dubbing (which not only translates the language, but changes the content of what is spoken)is the reason so many foreign films fare poorly when released outside of their native lands.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	"""Spirited Away"" could never be confused with a traditional Disney flick.  After taking a wrong turn on the way to their new house, Chihiro and her parents stumble upon what they believe is a deserted theme park. In a terrifying scene, they are ripped apart  - the parents transformed into obscenely greedy pigs and Chihiro literally fading away. Rescued by Haku, the apprentice to the witch Yubaba, Chihiro soon discovers she is trapped in a bathhouse for spirits and gods.  Many hilarious, other frighteningly evil, these spirits give the bathhouse an eery surreality that Chihiro comes to embrace.Using his considerable talent, Miyazaki has once again created an inspired, stunningly animated film.  Those raised on Disney might find themselves off-balance without the moralistic overtones, but Miyazaki does not create his films for young children.  As with ?Princess Mononoke,? this film is far too intense and complex for those under eight.  Miyazaki's films are about story and visual delights - and ?Spirited Away? is no exception.  His characters are well-defined and multi-dimensional, often charming in an off-beat way.  Chihiro makes an irresistible heroine, and Haku is a magnetic, appropriately mysterious hero.  Even the comedic giant baby (I laugh as I think of him) fills the screen with life.The dubbed version of this movie is actually better than most dubbed versions of Japanese movies, with added lines to help those not familiar with Japanese culture orient themselves. For example, the Sumo-like radish god is named in the English, but not in the subtitled version.  Also in the English, the parents grunt like pigs before they morph, foreshadowing their fate in a way the Japanese language edition does not.  Although I?m a purist and always prefer the original language version, those watching the dubbed will still be rewarded.I highly recommend this film for everyone over eight years old.  Don't confuse animation with simplicity because ""Spirited Away"" is anything but two-dimensional.  Treat yourself to this remarkable film.  I doubt you'll regret the entry into Miyazaki's fantastical world."	5.0	Don't pass up this remarkable film!	2003-06-13	25	19	6

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AD2RDUL0YR8R0	D. Edwards	"I have been Miyazaki's fan since when Nausicaa came out in 1986. I have enjoyed many of his works but I must say that Spirited Away is ranked low among ""Cat returns"" and ""Heisei Tanuki Ponpoko"".It has almost become a ""politically correct"" thing to praise whenever Miyazaki releases his movies. When Princess Mononoke came out in Japan, he has vaguely announced that that was going to be his last big movie with Studio Gibli. There are many long stance fans for Miyazaki who went to watch the movie in theatre to witness his masterpiece. ""Princess Mononoke"" although is ranked third in his works, deserved all the praises that it went to. I however feel that this work does not deserve full praises that has been echoed internationally.The story is not spectacular. It is good but it is just okay. The character setting is rather poor and storyline is rather brand compared to his standards. Some may consider this movie culturally significant but if you dig into Japanese animation you will soon recognize that this is not the case. Story told in the movie is original as far as script goes but not original as it follows some of the classical folktales in Japan.If this movie came out under other's author's name, I gurantee this movie would not have been famous. I would have given 3 stars as if this had been the case but gives 2 as warning to those who expects true Japanese animation masterpiece."	2.0	Not his best. Good but overrated.	2004-11-24	35	9	26

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3S7WU6DIH71CC	Denny Vu Quach	Released on July 20th, in 2001 in Japan, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; stayed in theaters for almost 10 months, breaking all the previous box-office records in Japan, including that of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; by the same director Hayao Miyazaki. With this astonishing film about a girl's spiritual journey, Mr. Miyazaki again showed that he is one of the best directors living in the world. This animation film was also awarded prestageous Golden Bear Prize in Berlin Film Festival, and that is not a surprise at all, after you see this movie.The story quickly is established, so don't ever be late for the show. It traces a girl's strange and fascinating life in another world, where her parents are accidentally magically transformed, and she has to survice herself and return to her own world. To do so, this pudgy-faced little girl Chihiro, now deprived of her name by a greedy witch Yu-baba, has to work at the baths where gods and sprites all over Japan come to take a rest. Chihiro's life is full of wonderful (and often hard, even terrifying) things, and through her experiences she learns how to live, gaining the true will and power, changing from a sulky girl languidly lying on the backseat of a car, into a lively and truely courageous girl.That's all you have to know: you don't need to see its trailer (English version trailer is a bit misleading), and just watch this masterpiece. Though there is a character called &quot;Kao-nashi&quot; (meaning &quot;Faceless&quot;), who out of loneliness does something harmful to the place; and there is an episode about a very stinking monster who turns out something very different, there are no villains, no heroes, and no so-called actions. And another strength of the film comes from its designs of the baths. It is based on a mosaic of Japanese and Western traditions (the witch's office looks obviously Western while Chihiro and other female workers room is inspired from the texitle factory girls' residence 100 years ago) Incredibly, some part are even from Chinese style.The story, some say probably rightly, goes slower in the latter half (of the film that runs more than 2 hours), but &quot;Spirited Away&quot; never lets you down. It's time for any American audience to know Miyazaki's name, and that animation films are not meant for only kids, but for adults.[The following might hopefully help understand some part of the film. No spoilers contained, but you might read them after watching them. Al the names referred to are from Japanese original print.][1] The name &quot;Chihiro&quot; is, when written in Chinese letters, divided into two parts: &quot;Chi-hiro.&quot; The first part &quot;Chi&quot; has another way of pronounciation, &quot;Sen,&quot; which becomes her temporary name.[2] Chihiro's real name is &quot;Chihiro Ogino&quot; which is briefly seen on the contract paper she signs.[3] The handsome boy who offers a help to Chihio is called &quot;Haku&quot; which means in Japanese, &quot;white.&quot;[4] Haku's real name is &quot;Migihayami Kohakusui.&quot; All the Japanese audience, as Chihiro in fact was, would be surprised to hear this long and old-fashioned name, which clearly suggests his ancient and aristocratic origin.[5] The witch's spoiled baby is called &quot;Bou&quot; (and his name is written prominently in a Chinese letter on his clothes). This is shrewd naming because the word &quot;bou-ya&quot; (which is used to call, affectinately, to baby boys) implies too much fondness to the babies on mother's side.[6] Chihiro's father, at the diapidated red gate, talks knowingly about the posibility of a disused theme park. It is true that Japan saw economic depression after the boom of the 80s, and his remarks, though half telling of his too much confidence, have some ring of truth.[7] For Miyazaki's fans, there are some extra fun: see, for example, the re-appearance of &quot;Susuwatari&quot;s, tiny black speck-like creatures that carry coal in a boiler room. As fans know, they are also seen in Miyazaki's delightful film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro.&quot; And check out one of the &quot;guests&quot; at the spa who looks and moves exactly like Totoro.[8] And those harmless &quot;Susuwatri&quot;s eat Japanese traditional, very sweet confectionary called &quot;Konpeitou&quot; made from sugar. This is the part Japanese viewers smile because of the unexpected combination.[9] In the same boiler room, the spider-like veteran master gives Chihiro &quot;Kaisuu-ken,&quot; coupon-style tickets for train. This is also the part we would smile because we all somehow share the same experience of giving them to children who go somewhere by train or bus, or of finding very old ones somewhere in the desk.[10] That same kind master, seeing Chihiro step on the crawling worm, makes a gesture of a knife with his hand, and touches Chihiro's hands in a unique way. This is a (now out-of-fashion) custom when touching something very dirty, symbolizing the total safety from the object in case, often accompanied with Japanese word &quot;Engacho&quot; (no more connection). This part is also funny to us.[11] In the opening scene. behind the back of Chihiro, you can see the glimpse of half-hidden, red-colored package of chocolate bar, which looks like one famous brand. Probably, this is a small token of thanks for the company (famous for coffee, too), which joined in the tie-in campagin for the film's promotion in Japan.[12] Finally, director Miyazaki says that the film is originally made for unnamed 10-year-old girls he and the movieproducer are both acquainted with, and hope that those girls are delighted to see the film. No doubt they are.	5.0	Tips For Non-Japanese Speaking Fans: This Is A Masterpiece	2004-04-12	25	24	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AZXFMHSH6VSTS	DesignManiac	Most modern cartoons are stilted, with unnatural motion, poor plot development, and lack of attention to detail. In contrast, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of pacing, imagination, and beautiful artistry. The plot may seem strange to Western sensibilities, but it needs to be viewed on its own terms - possibly as a fantasy in the mind of a (very imaginitive) child. Parts of the film show images of buildings and landscapes in beautiful, sharp color. When the spirits &quot;come out&quot; - the mood changes to a ghosteliness, but then clarity resumes, as if we accept this is as the new &quot;normal&quot;. Some of the characters are wierd caricatures, while others have grace and are oddly sympathetic. I'm not sure this film will appeal to all - it's strangeness may put off some, but those willing to open their minds will be rewarded. This is wonderful stuff.	5.0	An amazing film.	2003-06-06	1	0	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A39OFZXG66L7G3	Devilfish	Although I enjoy Miyazaki's work, I cannot say that this is his best in my opinion. I believe that those who have problems with this movie are limited to being Disney-fied throughout their childhood. Spirited Away doesn't have a traditional U.S. plot progression and that will throw some people off from what they are used to. Good! Storytelling shouldn't be confined to Hollywood's predictable timing and blaring plot points. Miyazaki is a great director that will take you on a true adventure where you DON'T know what's going to happen next.I could continue on with the many good points of the movie: the animation, imagination, and plot. However, I find that critiques are only valuable for the criticisms (we all know this movie isn't going to fall below 4 stars on Amazon). The main problem I have with this movie is that there are so many imaginative plot points, they become forgetable. It seems to plateau rather than build. It's great to see it revealed layer by layer in an Alice in Wonderland fashion, but people have their favorite parts and forget other parts of that story as well.Next criticism is the spiritual/environmental message. To me it feels trite and somewhat crammed down the viewers' throat. You might argue that it is only a cartoon and it is meant for children anyway, but let's face it, Miyazaki knows that his audience is primarily adults--which is true. The premise wears thin by the end.For this reason I give it 4 stars, only in relation to his other movies. Compared to many Hollywood flicks, this rates a 5. Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service are still two of my favorites.	4.0	Not the best Miyazaki	2003-11-17	0	0	0

The story is incredible with amazing creatures and spirits and witches. The character development for Chihiro is very well done, with her starting out as a shy, scared little child thrown into the realm of spirits and into a courageous young girl. This is also the first Studio Ghibli film I ever saw and shown me how awesome their films are.	5.0	This is my review from TV.com	2014-04-03	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A6YK7TEYVSSA3	DJ_Bitter	I had went into this movie with some apprehention. I am not an anime fan. I honestly detest the genre with a passion but this movie was nothing less than stunning. The art was still in the traditional anime style but it was so lush. This was one of the most surreal movies I have ever seen.The characters were wonderful and were filled with a certain kind of depth. Daveigh Chase was amazing as the voice of Chihiro; the main protagonist.But there were so many visuals that left an impression. I loved seeing trains that runned on water and flying oriental dragons. I like seeing babies as giants and a ghost that ate everything and became what he ate. Complete eye candy.	4.0	An Anime Film For Those Who Normally Hate Anime..	2004-05-25	4	1	3
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2FXFGP5JMLM2B	djrhimes	First of i would join the ongoing hordes of fans that will tell you this is a MUST HAVE film. You will no doubt have heard how utterly beautiful this is,that its a delightful story and you will marvel at the small tiny details that,on most animation films wouldnt have been added or even thought about, you WILL watch this over and over and notice more and more.I cannot rave about this film enough BUT...and heres the kick, it HAS been ruined by Disneys awful western dubbing-im sorry but it has! Disney/Pixar may rave about how they painfully tried to keep it true to Miyu's eastern version but thats the point IT IS AN EASTERN FILM!!its full of Asian characters and culture it should never have been dubbed.So i implore you,beg you,plead with you to watch this in THE BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN with the subtitles that way you will really appreciate the wonderful world of Spirited Away.	4.0	A plea to future viewers.	2004-01-22	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	"4.5 stars.  This film is so incredibly original and the characters are so overwhelming and striking that my first impression was:  ""This is like watching a Japanese 'Alice in Wonderland.'""  This film is equally confusing and exhilerating.  The plot could, and often does, go anywhere.  The characters are capable of magic and/or amazing strangeness that made me blink: ""Did I just see that?""  I got ""Spirited Away"" and was enthralled with the unusual animation techniques and completely Eastern story-telling which, in my humble opinion, is more free-wheeling and experimental than Western studios who are more interested in making money than making art.  This film, from the director of ""Princess Mononoke,"" I consider wholeheartedly, to be of the latter ilk.  That is to say, I think it is ""Art.""  It is dynamic and original, with a strong female child as its centerpiece (another rarity these days), and the images linger long after the film has ended.  This film won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.  Deservedly so."	4.0	"The New ""Alice in Wonderland."""	2004-03-02	1	0	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2NHD7LUXVGTD3	doc peterson	After viewing _Princess Mononoke_ and reading the rave reviews by Amazon customers, I purchased _Spirited Away_.  The incredible artistic detail, the magnificent characterization, and the riveting, detailed and complex storyline that I expected from a Miyazaki film were all there.In _Sprited Away_, young Chihiro and her family accidently arrive at an onsen (bathouse) for spirits.  The parallels to _Alice in Wonderland_ are many, as Chihiro seeks to rescue her parents and find her way back to her own world.  Along the way she learns self-reliance, the value of hard work, and the importance of family.  It is a rich and marvelous film.  As I am coming to expect, there are also shinto undertones to the story, as rivers spirits, radish spirits and other assorted fantastic creatures play a role in the story and its message.Of the three Miyazaki films I have seen, this is my favorite by far - the characters are memorable, the animation is visually stunning, and the story is entertaining.  For those who, like me, are new to the genre and  to Miyazaki, this is the film to begin with.  Highly recommended.	5.0	a masterpiece of film	2009-01-17	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3N330UYMFML9L	DoctoressOctopus	Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of Anime--I've watched Kiki's Delivery Service and Digimon: The Movie so many times, I can recite several scenes from each.But believe me: this is crap. The first 15 minutes of the movie were fine, but after that, the director must have been on something; the story was totally robbed of any plot or explanation as to *why* what was happening was happening. Follow me?There's strong emotion in the movie, no doubt, but that fails to make up for the rest of this film.I made two major mistakes in watching this: 1) I convinced my two 10-year-old sisters to watch it with me, and 2) we watched it at night.I for one am perplexed as to how this movie got away with a PG rating simply for &quot;scary moments.&quot; Coming from the mind of a 15 year old who's used to battle and war movies: this thing is SCARY. My sisters and I actually screamed aloud during one scene, and it takes a lot for a movie to make me scream, you know?So parents, watch it before you let your kiddies see it.The only part I enjoyed was the end, which I reached only because I was determined that things would look up by then. Needless to say, they didn't. I can only be extremely thankful that we rented the movie instead of buying it.So if you're looking for a good film with scenes to make you jump, but is less intense than this work, I highly recommend Van Helsing or The Lord of the Rings. I'm sure your kids will have a much less chance of developing a fear of the dark.Or if you wanna stick with the Anime theme, get Kiki's Delivery Service or Digimon.	1.0	Emotionally disturbing	2004-07-24	131	20	111

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1UDDJFOOI495T	Dorie	Chihiro is a ten year old girl who, along with her parents, are moving and are on their way to their new home. Needless to say, she is very unhappy about it.Along the way they cross over into the spirit world, via an abandoned theme park, and Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. She has somehow landed in this strange world, a world invisible to humans.The only way that Chihiro can change them back, and not be transformed into an animal herself, is if she gets work from Yubaba. Yubaba is the mistress of the bathhouse and is very strict, though not as bad as she seems.Chihiro gets a job at the bathhouse and her name changed to Sen. She is helped by a boy named Haku and an old man that works in the boiler room named Kamajii.I loved all the characters and all the Japanese Gods that Miyazaki created. The animation is eye-catching and beautiful. I especially loved the little susuwatari (or dust bunnies) and the cute creature that Bou is transformed into.The story is also captivating as you get drawn into Chihiro's struggle and her blossoming relationship with Haku. Chihiro's character grows as she must learn to rely on herself and her own strengths. Eventually she must come up against Yubaba to reclaim her name and return her parents to their human form.I loved Spirited Away, as you can tell, as well as Miyazaki's other movie's like, My Neighbor Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service. He knows how to bring a story to life and make an animated movie for ten year olds-to people of any age.	5.0	A World Only Miyazaki Can Create...	2003-11-07	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3ADLKJRLBUG14	drewsta42	From the legendary Studio Ghibli and anime director Hayao Miyazaki (of &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;Castle in the Sky,&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service,&quot; among others) comes a new favorite among otaku (anime fans) world-wide. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is the story of a young Japanese girl named Chihiro (literally, &quot;heroine&quot;) who is, as the title implies, taken from her normal life and deposited reluctantly in a small town built around a bathhouse for spirits. Chihiro overcomes fear and other obstacles, including a large, faceless monster and a black-hearted witch named Yubaba (literally, &quot;old hag&quot;) to save her parents from a rather unpleasant fate. The story is exciting, well-paced, and thoughtful, with a good mix of humor, symbolism, emotion, traditional Japanese legend, and moral.From an animation standpoint, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is astounding. The sheer amount of movement and energy in Hayao Miyazaki's most recent work is quite impressive. Combined with the beautiful scenery (including several awe-inspiring and detailed shots of the bathhouse that can by themselves be regarded as masterpieces), and the realistic textures of the grass blowing in the wind, the flower gardens around the bathhouse, and the interior of the bathhouse, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is truly a work of art.The only flaw in the otherwise near-perfect film is the dialogue. A few lines sound a little forced, and some intended to be funny simply aren't. Fortunately, these slip-ups are few and far between.Already, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; has earned several prestigous distinctions, including the 2003 Oscar award for Best Animated Feature. Also, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; was anime released in movie theaters, which is rare in the United States. Ever rarer, it became the top-grossing film in America for several weekends in a row. Not surprisingly, it was also popular in Japan, where it became the top-grossing film in that nation's history.Most people I have talked to have been very impressed with the quality of &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; Many of these have been adults, mislead by the films &quot;Disney&quot; tag. When they sat down to watch it with their kids, they simply expected another children's movie, but instead found a film they could enjoy and appreciate as well. On the face, the plot is simple enough for younger kids to understand, but the symbolism and artwork is so complicated and intricate that it can be enjoyed by adults and older kids as well. In other words, however clich&eacute; those words may be, this film really does have something for everyone, and is well worth your time and your twenty-five dollars.	5.0	Hayao Miyazaki's Latest Masterpiece	2003-12-25	4	3	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A30R199VCZKE4Q	Dr Fox	Whilst I agree with the reviewer who claims that the Disney dub of this movie is rather insipid compared to the original story, he fails to mention that the original soundtrack is available also with a decent subtitle translation.  I would reccomend all adult viewers and children of a sufficient reading ability to stick with the original Japanese soundtrack, it is vastly superior in terms of mood and storytelling.The extras on this DVD are a mixed bag, but there are many of them.'Behind the Microphone' and 'The Art of Spirited Away' are both Disney efforts and lay on the cheese rather thick. There are a few points of interest in these documentaries regarding the process of translation, but at the end of the day they are both rather mundane fillers. Most annoying is the assertion in,'The Art of Spirited Away', that:&quot;People have said that the characters in Spirited Away are based on Japanese Myth, but they are actually based on people Miyazaki has met.&quot;Whilst it may be true that the personalities and characteristics of the characters are based on real people, the characters themselves are 100% based on Shinto Buddhist mythology. Disney seem to be distancing themselves from this fact, perhaps in order to deter religious extremists who may look upon Buddhism in a negative light and give Disney a hard time.The Nippon TV special is excellent. It provides a remarkable view into the workings of Ghibli Studios and the creation of the movie itself. It shows a corporate animation giant being run like a family business with remarkable success. I wonder if any Disney staff are jealous?Stroyboard to Scene comparisons are another welcome addition. The only extra I would have like to see added would have been a commentary by Miyazaki. The TV special more than compensates though.On the whole Disney are to be congratulated on presenting Spirited Away ('Sen to Chihiro' in Japan)  letterboxed and in its entireity, unlike Fox's apalling treatment of 'My Neighbour Totoro' . Just stick with the original soundtrack and you're in for a great time.Oh yeah, the film itself....It's an absolute classic.	5.0	Excellent, but stick with the Japanese soundtrack.	2003-05-11	3	3	0

I just watched it again with the original Japanese language track, English subtitles, and loved it.  You have no idea what a difference it makes hearing the characters speak as originally intended.This is a fantastic film, filled with wonderfully bizarre characters and a truly original story (allusions to Alice in Wonderland notwithstanding).  The main character Chihiro/Sen goes from sullen to spunky in a believable fashion, surviving one obstacle after another, as she slowly matures.  The story is in turns delightful and menacing, and yes, spiritual.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1Q253FVZZ1FH5	E. J.	If you haven't seen this movie, you are in for a treat. It transports you into a magical world created by world class animators. The story is simple: a little girl is lost in a magical land and it takes courage for her to rescue her parents and return. But that's not the most important part. The strength of the movie is in the breathtaking animation, scenery, and music. If you haven't been to Japan, you'll want to after seeing this movie. If you have children, they will especially enjoy visiting the Studio Ghibli museum near Tokyo. This movie is Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece, in my opinion.	5.0	A treat	2011-02-07	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1TOH8S8I1VT9R	"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real"""	"A better question might be; should it get better?  ""Spirited Away"" has been accepted as a masterpiece by the film industry, anime fans and those who blindly believe what they are told.  It sure sounds like I'm about to pick a fight, but actually I'm getting a little introspective and asking you to do the same.  I could easily write a 10 page essay about anime, this film and the state of the art of animation.  I'll try to avoid that here.  However, after watching this film with my family, a big pile of question appeared.  This is both a testament to this films power and to the fact that many people just don't like or understand this style of film art.  I am once again divided on my opinion of a film.  The only way to cut through the fog in my brain is to (once again) break my thoughts into pieces.-WHAT I THINK OF THIS FILMArtistically speaking, this film is brilliant.  My family was divided about this film.  My wife had problems with the jerky animation style.  My 10 year old daughter loved it.  My 6 year old son did not like it.  We all thought it was a bit too long (especially near the end).  I don't know what you would take out.  I think there might be some scenes that could have been removed to little negative affect if we never knew they existed.  But knowing they exist precludes the idea of removing them.  The one thing we all agreed on was the whole river spirit revelation.  We gave out a collective ""HUH?""  This is pretty typical in anime; if the story doesn't get you there, take a shortcut.  That was probably the only unexpected thing I could criticize.  The other thing I found myself criticizing was the actual animation.  I know what anime is and I know why it is, and I sort of expected it, but this film really got me thinking about the state of anime and why it hasn't moved to another level.-A QUICK EDUCATIONDisney style animation is what is known as ""Full"" animation.  Simply put; for every 24 frames in a second, there are 24 unique drawings to complete the required motion.  By this, you get a very smooth, natural feeling motion.  In anime, which uses mostly limited animation, in the 24 frames of one second there might be 12 drawings or less in some cases.  Anime will actually use a static image with a moving camera to imply motion. The result is a somewhat choppy or jerky motion.  This is all done to save money due to tight budget constraints.  Though financially cheap, these techniques have been mastered to a very high level.-WHAT I THINK OF ANIMEI think that good anime challenges how animation looks (see ""Animatrix"" for a compilation of great examples).  Bad anime is pure trash.  Good anime artists really have a knack for capturing the essence of the human form even more so than Disney.  Characters seam to develop effortlessly in anime; one little act or a short phrase or a telling reaction immediately establishes character.  In ""Spirited Away"" even minor characters have strong presence.  The best anime has characters we can all identify with very quickly.  This film produces that in spades.  Western animation is not so adept at this.  I find the limited animation distracting at times.  It is because of this that I don't watch a lot of it.  I enjoy artistic as well as technical achievements.  Sometime anime is fully animated (almost by accident).  It's at these times I realize how much more brilliant anime could be.-WEST V EAST; THE $275,000,000 GORILLA IN THE CORNERI've actually read debates that compared Western ""Disney"" style animation to ""anime"" ([...]  I would argue this was like debating the merits of chocolate ice cream vs. vanilla ice cream; fairly pointless.  However, things have changed enough in recent years that the debate can not be so easily dismissed anymore; not if you are being honest with yourself.  ""Spirited Away"" cost $17MM to produce.  Its global box office receipts totaled $275,000,000.  Who knows what the DVD sales total is?  The same year this film was released, Disney's ""Brother Bear"" made $250,000,000.  Disney has not released budget information, but I'm certain it cost more than $17 million.  This begs the question; is it time for anime to take the next step into full animation?-WOULD MONEY KILL FREEDOMLike life in general, the more money there is at stake, the more pressure there is to succeed.  Some might argue that the really cool stories and audacious subject matter that anime produces would not happen if a big budget were put on the line.  I would argue that $17 million is a big risk; in for a penny, in for a pound.  That's why I limit the idea of fully animated anime to feature films.  It's worth the risk.  People revere anime for what Disney does not provide; fearless, unsafe stories and edgy visuals.  Is it such a stretch to think we won't pay to see what everyone complains we don't get?  I think the market place has spoken.-EXCUSES OR REASONS?Given the financial success of the anime feature films in the past decade or so, is the use of limited animation an excuse?  Or, is the art form known as anime inherently tied to the use of limited animation and the ""moving Manga"" traditions?  I'm not expert enough about anime to provide the answer, but I think it's a question worth asking.  Some in the anime business talk about how they use creative techniques and limited animation to save money, as if this is how it should always be.  Personally, I think anime features are ready for full animation.  Doubling the budget for ""Spirited Away"" (basically drawing twice as much art) would still make it a huge financial success. So money can no longer be an excuse.  Many people are wowed by this film in its current form.  Imagine what it would be like fully animated; mind boggling.  It probably would have made even more money.-WHAT AM I GETTING AT?""Spirited Away"" has an ambitious story, great human characters (even the spirits are human at their core) and incredible artistic vision.  Anime has set new standards for what animated films should explore and this film has kept up that trend.  However, as animation, anime has stayed a step behind.  Though many have come to accept limited animation as an inherent part of anime, I think it's time to raise the bar on these gloriously conceived feature films.  I know these artists can take animation to levels only imagined.  They have the skill and the vision to set new standards.  Yet, we get excuses of low budgets.  Maybe for the serials and Saturday morning fare, but not these ""masterpiece"" feature films.  If ""Triplets of Belleview"" can be made fully animated, why not ""Spirited Away""?If you are an artist, a fan of anime, a student of animation or a fan of fantasy I'd have to recommend this DVD.  If you are a traditionalist Disney fan, then you might have a problem with the unique story telling and less than smooth animation style.  I recognize and enjoy it for what it is, but I'm not going to let it off the hook for what it could have been either.  The real question is; is it still anime if it's fully animated?  I say yes.  Anime isn't just about the animation techniques, but also the visual and story style."	5.0	I'm Looking for Some Help Here; Can Anime Get Better?	2008-07-11	3	3	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A27603N78DBW73	Elbereth_the_fair	First of all,don't listen to people who give this masterpiece bad reviews... they probably think disney movies are the only animations worth watching!This anime is fantastic... Miyazaki is truly a genius. Everything about it blew me away, from the animation and characters to its storyline! The characters have depth, and they show real emotion, and unlike disney movies, there are no annoying sidekicks or crappy songs... in fact, the music is very beautiful and heightens the feel of the movie.Even the dub is pretty good(at least in my opinion), but of course the original japanese with subtitles is best(as always)!I HIGHLY recommend this one to everyone, anime fan or not!This is definitely worth your money! Don't hesitate!	5.0	A work of art!	2004-07-19	7	5	2
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1TZDTEULS0618	"Elianna Greenleaf ""PokeManiac"""	One of Hayao Miyazaki's newest movies, Spirited Away is one of his most engrossing movies. It features a whiny, bratty, and generally dislikable girl named Chihiro. While she and her parents are traveling to their new home, they take the wrong turn and end up faced by a large underpass of sorts, which seems old and decrepit. However, Chihiro's boisterous father insists on barging through the tunnel to the other side. This other side turns out to be a road lined with countless restaurants! Her parents start pigging out at one, and the next time Chihiro looks, Dad and Mom ARE pigs!This is the beginning of a very, very creative story. Chihiro finds herself in a world of incredibly strange creatures and ends up working at a bathhouse for said creatures. Miyazaki obviously takes inspiration from the traditional Japanese religion of Shinto-ism--at one point we encounter a river spirit--and due to this creates a story quite unlike anything American.However, it can get a slightly creepy tone at times. The No-Face creature, which seems to take on the personality of anyone he swallows, ends up running around the bathhouse giving chunks of gold to whoever serves him food. The workers of the bathhouse practically swarm him, yelling with greed and scooping up the gold he scatters. No-Face himself is a rippling hunk of ebony with a white mask for a face and a large gaping mouth directly underneath this emotionless mask. This creates a slightly disturbing visage.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this for children under 12, but for everyone else it's quite enjoyable. We see Chihiro change from a brat to a confident young woman and this, added to the circumstances which cause such changes in her personality, makes Spirited Away a great adventure.	5.0	A very interesting experience, but slightly creepy at times	2007-04-04	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1M6O89WIPA13F	Eli Karney	The only word for this film is magical. I've seen all of the Miyazaki films and his newest effort will not disappoint. The craziest imagination of the most creative mind in anime produces yet another world of fantasy and magic, with his own views on the world woven subtly in to create a great visual piece of animation, as well as a strong story. Even if you've never given anime a try this is for you. Everyone should get a chance to see this film.The English sound track looks like it has been well put together, but the only way to watch any anime is in its original Japanese language format, and this one is great with a predictably solid sound track from Jo Hisaishi, and some memorable voice acting. The DVD also boasts the original trailers, storyboards, interviews with the English speaking voice actors and an interesting &quot;Making of&quot; piece (from Japanese TV with subtitles) that follows Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli team through the production of the film.Whether you're young or old, into cartoons or not check this film out. No one could be disappointed.	5.0	A must see for EVERYONE!	2003-07-08	3	2	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3VXJOA77GDF1T	"Elizabeth Batchelder ""Elizabeth Batchelder"""	I can't say anything about Spirited Away that hasn't already been said.  I saw the film three times in the theater and absolutely adored it, and I purchased the DVD as soon as it was available Stateside.However, I was deeply disappointed by the English subtitles.  Rather than subtitling the original subtle Japanese dialog, the English dubbed dialog is subtitled.  This creates a strange disconnect when viewing the film with Japanese voices and English subtitles, because subtitles appear when nothing is being said.  Worse, the English dialog apparently gives away certain details that are left ambiguous or delayed in the Japanese version (such as Haku's true nature).I am currently searching for an alternate version of the film on DVD which is not similarly flawed, but I found this peculiarity disappointing and would not have bought the DVD if I had known about it in advance.	4.0	Amazing film... flawed DVD.	2005-08-15	3	1	2

It really envelops you and lose track of reality to a degree.  The animation is silky smooth and some of the effects (moving images reflecting off car windows) really impressed me.  But this movie isn't about uber computer generated effects, it's about the characters which all have such a believable personality, and the twisted Alice-in-Wonderland like plot.  Don't think this is a happy feel-good Disney flick though.  Some of the scenes may not be appropriate for young children.This truly is a masterpiece, and has given me a respect for jap-anime.	5.0	Absolutely Amazing	2003-04-13	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"After seeing ""Howl's Moving Castle"" a few weekends ago and loving every second of it, I thought it would be a good idea to check Hayao Miyazaki's other animated films. I recently rented ""Spirted Away"" and viewed it for the first time.A young girl named Chihiro and her parents are traveling to their new  home. Along the way, the father decides to take a detour. Big mistake. He comes across what he thinks is an abandoned amusement park. When Chihiro's father and mother sees food, they begin to stuff their faces. It turns out that the food is for the gods and spirits who have travelled to this spa for them. As punishment for eating the food, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs. Chihiro meets a mysterious boy named Haku who gives her instructions to go to see about getting a job at the spa from a witch named Yubaba so she can stay and try to help her parents. At first Yubaba was reluctant but eventually she allows Chihiro to stay but at a cost, her name. Chihiro has to go by the name Sen. Over time Chihiro/Sen slowly gains confidence in herself and realizes her full potential.In the beginning, I found Chihiro annoying. She was shrill and obnoxious but as the film went on, her character quickly evolved and became more mature. The writing was excellent. The animation was a delight to watch. Like ""Howl's Moving Castle"", I would have liked to have been able to watch this film in its original language. What Disney should have done was to include the option to view the film in Japanese on the dvd version. Otherwise I loved ""Spirited Away"". It is perfect for anyone of any age."	4.0	Fun for all ages	2005-06-30	1	0	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ARWC5JKV1NP1F	"Eric M. Bernando ""eric8"""	I wanted to give this movie 100000 stars but I know that many people only read the bad reviews (myself Included) I had to give it one star just so you might read this film review... The reason most people dislik the film is that they are too Americanized (or Westernized). There are so many aspects of Japanese culture in the film that many &quot;outsiders&quot; just don't understand. To say that the story line is bizarre is just like saying I don't get Don Quixote. But you'd never bad-mouth Don Quixote. Maybe you should get off your high horse and take a Japanese Culture class and watch the movie again. It is a magical Movie. I have not been this enthrawled in years. Its not my favorite movie (Spirited Away is my 8th favorite) But its worth every penny and worth the praise it got. If you don't understand a movie then don't condemm it. And lastly, in responce to the comments about this movie being too scary for children, my cousins (6 and 10 girls and 5 and 8 Boys) all loved this film and were not scared. They loved the raddish God (so did I) and they thought that the story was very good. (they understood most but not all of it) This film takes me too a place I yearn to go and brings be home with the joy and hopefullness that are lacking in todays world... thank you Miyzazki	1.0	Spirited to Japanese Culture	2003-09-01	208	69	139
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	Anime is always stereotyped as nothing but ADD-indused action, annoying music, characters that surprisingly look the same, and a bad example of style-over-substance. This isn't the case with Miyazaki's Spirited Away. This is a very distinct anime film. Not only is it devoid of many stereotypes that anime in general is associated with, but it's a highly imaginative tale, with some fascinating details that you regularly don't see in Naruto or Bleach (both of which I dislike, by the way). Here's the story: a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro and her parents are moving into a new residence, and she's the only one who condemns the decision. Once they get lost by taking a shortcut through the forest, they come across a mysterious bathhouse. Things start to get worse as Chihiro's parents transform into pigs as they indulge themselves with food, and the way back to their car has been blocked. There is only one way out of this: get a job at the bathhouse that is now up and running again, and hopefully her parents will turn back into their normal selves.With a length of just over two hours, Spirited Away is a visual spectacle of fantasy, drama, and comedy. Miyazaki brings his vivid imagination to life with memorable characters, gorgeous settings, and sequences that feel like they've come straight out of a dream (the train station is one example). I did have a couple of problems with this movie, however. The main character, Chihiro, got on my nerves a few times. She is a third-dimensional character, yes, but can't she PLEASE stop crying and screaming whenever she feels sad and scared?! The other problem I have with this movie is the music. I don't why, but sometimes the music doesn't sound very melodic. It's not the sort of music that you would remember for all time.Well, despite those two flaws, this is still an excellent animated film. It may not be one of my favorites, but I can still acknowledge that this is one of the finest films to have ever been created since the beginning of this new millennium. Everyone should have a chance to watch it.Grade: A-	5.0	It's really hard not to love it	2009-12-11	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2UU3I9VAGNVRB	Erik E. Byberg	This is the kind of film one should come to expect from the Grand Master of Animation.

Along with the adventerous spirit of Kiki's Delevery Service. As with Kiki, Chihiro's/Sen's discovery of a new and unfiamilar world is somewhat frightening at first. But as she adjusts to her new suroundings, Sen begins to see her new world in all its intracasess.The films PG rating is right on the money. It is not for real young kids.

The kind you don't want to dissect and over-analyze? Well, this is one of those type of films, rare indeed, in which you just allow your suspension-of-disbelief to take hold of you and carry  you off on that magic carpet ride in your imagination. Hayao Miyazaki is just this person that did this for me when I viewed this film. I know there are hundreds of reviews here, and one more is not going to matter as far as those who have not seen it, but this is truly a fantastic, magical and genuine masterpiece!""Grave of the Fireflies"" will probably always be my favorite animated film, however, this is my favorite 'happy' anime. Truly a pure joy to watch. I am glad that there are creative artist's such as Hayao Miyazaki in the world, and I sure know that when I first saw this film four-years-ago, my two daughters were glad too. I do not wish to spoil this film for any of you who have not seen this delightfully enchanting film. This is a film that you need to watch if you have not already. I don't want to put any spoilers in here you might see. I would just add, go out and buy it, I am sure you will enjoy the film. And it's not just for children either. Adults like it too!

Lots of life lessons are camouflaged within storyline of this beautifully animated Japanese children's story - messages about standing by your friends, helping other people, being brave in the face of your greatest fears, and the dangers of over-consumption (people literally turning into pigs from overeating - and demons who regurgitate endless streams of flotsam and jetsam of their lives).I especially like the fact that the hero is a little girl who starts the film as a very frightened, possibly over-frightened kid, worried about moving to a new school, but it ends up with her outwitting witches and demons of various kinds, and sticking by her friends regardless of the peril.It might be a bit dark and/or scary for little kids, and it will make even older kids stretch their minds a little, but it's well worth it.	5.0	Wonderful story about a little girl or learns to have courage	2012-04-16	1	1	0

For children AND adults with a taste for something new, different and even genuinely scary - sit back, dim the lights, and get ready to take a journey the likes of which Disney animated features never quite reach.This is not a typical Western-oriented story. It is, almost literally, the work of one man. Miyazaki is a Master of storytelling, and injects a sense of realism in this fantastical world that makes it all the more entertaining and even more memorable than some ""classics"".Over two hours long, there is much more story development and true scariness than many young children can stand, so take heed. Even for those who are fed up with the steady stream of anime, this is nothing like what is bombarding the airwaves. There are real characters here - some good and some bad - but no one to hate. Also, some characters that are quite scary, yet turn out to be not so bad after all. Morality even children can appreciate.Japanese animation has come far in 40 years, when ""Alakazam"" was first Westernized for American viewing. Whomever ordered that the Disney studios were not permitted to change a single frame of this movie deserves a great deal of gratitude. This is truly a classic to enjoy over and over."	5.0	Not for the average Disney fan	2003-04-30	8	8	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A97Q71MM5N4NW	"Everett ""Future Raptured"""	"I can't believe I didn't get this sooner! I would see the promotions for it on television when I was eleven when it first came out, and I could kick myself for not getting before I became a teenager. A lot of my imagination has deteriorated within that time, but I'm really glad I ended up buying. Being a fan of ""My Neighbor Tortoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" as a kid (which both inspired me majorly) I was wondering if Hayao Mayazaki was same one who created ""Sprited Away"". Doing a little research, I found out it was the same man, so I got the DVD expecting a fantasy, and got something out of my own imagination that got me back to remembering how I used to have so much fun with my own imagination back then.Chihiro (american voiced by Daveigh Chase from The Ring) isn't too thrilled moving away to another town. New school, new friends, and a new house. It's not easy for someone who's just entering into her pre-teens. But when her parents accidentally take a wrong turn, the three find themselves in a seemingly abandoned amusement park. Her parents find some food left out in a restaurant, and when you see food you know someone has to be there. But when Chihiro comes back, she finds her parents have undergone a transformation, and strange shadows going up and down the sidewalks of the once abandoned place. Yet now that darkness has fallen, Chihiro knows something about the place is different, and if she wants to save her parents and herself, the only way out of the place is going straight through it.I don't want to give away too much because if you give away something, you give it all away. Hayao Mayazaki must take these own ideas from his own childhood imagination, because his artwork, and where the plot goes is too amazing to be anywhere else. Being a wannabe author, Mayazaki's work has inspired, and I'm sure for any child who sees Spirited Away or any of his other breathtaking movies will be swept out of the world, and back into their own imagination.Sprited Away is one of the more detailed and well thought out movies of his. Some of them are very easy to figure out, and some of them take a little while, but they deliver just as they always have. This one brings in a little bit of everything, and doesn't really need all explained, but as the story goes on, things fall together, and as a fantasy, you shouldn't think logical. When something comes out of the imagination, nothing is ever logical again.The voice talents are amazing. I was surprised to find out that the highly acclaimed horror remake of a japanese thriller The Ring would have the same voice of Samara (for those of you who have seen it) in another remake. Coincidental? Daveigh Chase did good as little Chihiro, but of course the original is always better. I didn't listen to the japanese voice, but just in case I didn't like the new american voices, it's always good to switch on the subtitles, and change to the original japanese voices. That's what I really like about DVD's.Spirited Away definitely has a good many laughs, but for kids who don't understand them it may be good, but for the adults, they'll be laughing until they can't breathe with the inside jokes all throughout the movie. The DVD also has a good variety of things to choose from unlike the sad DVD for my neighbor Totoro. I hope Mayazaki comes out with more like this, though. He's so highly underrated it's not even funny. At least there's a good number of us who appreciate him."	5.0	I got spirited away!	2005-02-02	10	9	1

The first time I watched this, I was about 8 and it made me cry so  much, it scared me but I fell in love with it. This film, in my opinion, is one of Mizaki's greatest masterpieces. I cannot find the words to describe how this movie leaves me breathless after every single time I watch it. The characters are absolutely lovable (even the mean ones) and the plot is fascinating.  Hayao Miyazaki really outdid himself in this one. I think Spirited away touched me a little more than his other movies. His films take me to another world. I also highly recommend the movie ""Howl's Moving Castle"" it is astonishing. Spirited Away AND Howl's Moving Castle are totally worth the time and money if you are willing. My biggest thanks to Hayao Miyazaki for creating such a heart-stirring and warming adventure. Absolutely astounding."	5.0	Absolutely astounding!	2012-12-31	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1IQV6AI7L9NOK	Feelah the tigress	"Spirited Away is an imaginative tale about a little girl named Chihiro who becomes trapped in the spirit world after her parents are turned into pigs for eating the spirit's food.  There, she must work in a bath house for the spirits until she can think of a way to escape.In many ways, this film is excellent.  The animation is beautiful, the setting is strange and entertaining, the story is full of twists, and the characters posess alot of depth.  What I love most about this movie is the depth of the characters- no one is one dimensionally ""evil"" or ""good"".  Every character posesses good and bad qualities to varying degrees.  Even Chihiro starts off as an unlikeably whiny girl at the beginning, but by the end, has developed courage and self-reliance.  I just love the departure from black-and-white moral categories to a more morally ambigous characters, because the real world is morally ambigous.On another note, the setting of Spirited Away is strange and colorful.  I was very entertained by the bizarre array of bath-house guests, the strange twisting layout of the bath-house itself, and the haunting and beatiful scenery viewed from the train.  Also, anyone who's seen Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro might recognize the return of the soot gremlins.  I had actually seen Spirited Away first, then My Neighbor Totoro a year later, so imagine my surprise when I recently rewatched Spirited Away and saw them.  Soot gremlins!Compared to his other films, this is one of Miyazaki's more energetic and action-packed films.  So, if you've seen some of his other films and couldn't stand the slow pacing of the story, then Spirited Away may be just the thing for you.  Well anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough!  Please watch it at least once!P.S. There's some excellent bonus features available on this dvd.  First of all, there's a nice ""making-of"" feature, a feature on the art of Spirited Away, and an interview with some of the voice actors.  There's also an introduction by John Lasseter (pretty pointless), alot of trailers (seriously?!), and the storyboards (who watches those?).  Overall, though, the making-of is quite lengthy and excellent.  So, enjoy!"	5.0	A fantastical movie!	2008-09-07	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" will be a revelation -- and a test -- for mainstream U.S. audiences. It is, indeed, a foreign film. While made for children, its parade of surreal and often disturbing images seem worlds apart from Disney's usual fare. At times, the film appears better suited for the Ecstasy crowd than the Nickelodeon generation.Disney, to its credit, presents ""Spirited Away"" with no cuts or alterations, an essential provision in the deal with Miyazaki.  The film is presented in widescreen (2.00:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound on its English-language track. Those preferring the original Japanese voice talent must settle for Dolby 2.0. Visuals and audio are up to studio standards.The DVD set's extras work well as an introduction to Miyazaki. A Nippon TV making-of follows Miyazaki and his team of young animators as they create ""Spirited Away."" The docu slips into ""Iron Chef"" territory as it chronicles the team's deadline pressures -- ""Something's wrong with the copier!"" -- but it's a peek at Miyazaki's working life that should intrigue pros and ani fans. Of particular interest are the extended scenes of the director, 62, coaxing performances from his young vocal talent.A second making-of piece -- standard Disney issue -- covers the U.S. team's work on translation and dubbing. English-language writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt tell how they struggled to translate concepts such as the Japanese kids' sign for a shot that guards against cooties.This is masterpiece, but it's also a seriously weird movie that runs long. The director's ""Castle in the Sky"" (1986) and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (1989) are more conventional anime adventures better suited for younger children."	4.0	Weird and wonderful	2003-05-05	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2T25EZICAR6H6	folder	"Perhaps one has to be Japanese to understand this movie.  It is hardly worth reviewing, but after we rented it last night (having heard good things about it in the media - first mistake) I couldn't resist taking a look at what kind of reviews it received.  Imagine my astonishment to find that this highly forgettable movie received an overall rating of 4-1/2 stars.  Of course, the book Eragon also seems to be well-received by the on-line audience which reviews books and movies; perhaps there is a selection bias here as well.Anyway, my husband and I watched with growing horror as a film with no recognizable plot and almost no stable characters unfolded before us.  I think it was morbid fascination that held us to the screen until the lame but anxiously awaited ending.  Granted, there were some lovely scenes that would make great stills, and a few chuckles here and there.  I will admit that I found the combination of sickly-sweet cuteness and frightening grotesqueness unique, if nothing else.  The ""monster"" spirits eating people (although they were regurgitated whole later), and the prominence of nightmarish chases and scary situations made me wonder that this was PG - the rating seemed too low.  Perhaps what disturbed me more (besides lack of plot) was that there were no characters who seemed to be consistent.  For example, the ""witch,"" although supposedly evil, congratulates the heroine (Chihiro)  at one point for a job well done and tells her other ""employees"" to try to be like Chihiro.  The character of ""no-face"" seems to be a helpful spirit, becomes a terrifying monster, and then returns to passivity for no real reason that is explained.  These are just two examples of many that pervade this movie.We did have fun afterwards imagining what the TV-guide blurb for this would be if it were shown on TV.  It was stranger than any strange movie I've seen (Escanaba in Da Moonlight, Dune, the Point, and Buckaroo Banzai for a few samples, although most of those had some semblance of plot), although I don't go in for weirdness as a rule, preferring to be entertained.  I can't say that this movie entertained me at all.  After I have written this review, I will forget all about Spirited Away, except to tell anyone who asks me about it not to waste his money or time on watching it."	1.0	extremely forgettable	2005-01-30	129	19	110

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ACVNA57PI4DLV	Francois Tremblay	One-sentence description : a children's movie pumped with mythical steroids and top-rate animation.From the king of animation, Hayao Miyazaki, comes this wonderful movie based around the story of a girl lost in a strange world of spirits. As she tries to save her parents from a terrible curse, she must work at the bathhouse of the spirits. She must befriend the odd spirits around her, and regain her identity, in order to be able to break the curse and leave.While it follows the standard plot of children's movies (child must fend for him/herself in a strange world and befriend allies in order to achieve success), Spirited Away is about as far as you can get from a normal children's movie. It has haunting characters, a profound story, incredible animation and music, and Miyazaki's imagination and sense of how children feel is really set loose here.The American version only has english dialogue, but since this is an animation, and Disney did the dubbing, there is little to complain about here. If you have a child and/or any sense of wonder at all, go see this movie : if you don't, I'm afraid you have more problems than I can help.	4.0	Pumped with mythical steroids and top-rate animation	2003-05-07	2	2	0

From all of the movies that I have seen, mind you I have only seen four of them (Princess Mononoke, Castle In The Sky, Kiki's Delievery Service and Spirited Away, they are all great, awesome, incredible. Spirited Away is basically about a girl named Chihido who stumbles into a world over taken by different types of spirits when going to her new house. When her parents undergo a transformation she must find a way to get them back to the way they were. In order to do that she must find work at the bathhouse and soon befriends a mysterious boy named Haku. Haku tells Chihiro that he will help her return her parents back to normal.

Read above the rest of the reviews.I do have some comments regarding this two DVD's set, I disliked the fact that so much importance was given to the people at Disney for their translation and distribution efforts: don't get me wrong here, I think the lipsync work is great and the english version came out very good, but I do feel that Miyazaki and the studio should have had more relevance in this DVD release. I would have liked to see so much more instead of the interviews to the people at Disney! There is a great Japanese program showing the making of the film, but few images of the procces, aside from the storyboard. I would've liked to see thumbnails, the conceptual paintings, more on the digital aspects of the production (the 3d effects are stunning, but nothing was said about them) information on the design of the characters....

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"I don't know anime but I know what I like. I liked Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and a lot of other people must have too, because this particular anime won an Academy Award.Chihiro is moving a to a new house, and soon she'll have to start a new school too. She is not happy about this at all. On the way to their new house in their car, her father decides to take a shortcut through a forest full of strange shrines and statues. The road they take ends all of a sudden at a tunnel, which they follow through to what appears to be an abandoned village full of restaurants. They find one of these restaurants filled with delicious food, which Chihiro's parents sit down and begin to eat. Chihiro tries to get them to stop but they don't, and soon turn into pigs. Night falls on the town, and the restaurants become filled with spirits, come to feast and to relax. It turns out that this place is part of a bathhouse complex for spirits, run by a very large headed woman.  Chihiro doesn't want to be turned into a little piglet girl, so she is forced to get a job at the bathhouse. While she works in this thriving colourful place, she will meet many strange and interesting beings, make all sorts of friends, and uncover several mysteries. Changing schools is easy compared to all this business!It seems to be a trend in Japanese films I've noticed that they don't really explain what's going on in great detail. The ins and outs of things are really only divulged on a need to know basis. They expect you to catch up as you go, which is basically what Chihiro, our main character has to do too in this strange world. There are stacks and stacks of ideas here. It's a very colourful, very imaginative place, with full of weird and fascinating creatures and beings. They don't only look interesting, but many of them have a very interesting motion, if that makes sense. They move in a unique way, thanks to some clever animation. Check out the ""Stink Spirit"" and the mud and gas flowing from his mucky body. Check out how the boiler man uses his ""four-arm"" strength without batting an eyelid (not that you'd be able to see his eyelids, he's wearing glasses). The score is good too, orchestral, though unlike some recent Western films, doesn't get in the way and does actually enchance what's going on.I've been going through Miyazaki's back catalog of films lately, and I'm noticing a few themes and motifs going through his work. Here in Spirited Away we have a dramatic scene around a simple flight of stairs, just like in ""Howl's Moving Castle"", which he'd do later. Also like he'd go on to do in Howl's, there are curses that transform people and people who can turn into flying creatures. There's a lot of flying in his films, actually (""Nausicaa"",""Porco Rosso""). I kind of thought ""Porco Rosso"" too when I saw the parents turned into pigs. What an odd world the man must have going on in his head. Got a few more to hunt down and watch of his, and I very much wonder what I'll see next.Anyone interested in a good fantasy, interesting animations or some fresh imagination, I recommend you check this film out."	5.0	A Good Bath for Ghosts	2006-08-14	13	11	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ATFNT456Z3N64	Geno	"Predictably, Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" won for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, and since then has become more popular. I have wanted to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters first, but haven't been able to since this weekend, when it was released into over 700 theaters (the highest theater count yet). The theater was packed, and, judging from the audiences reactions, they all enjoyed the film as much as I did. It is the story of a little girl who gets lost in a spirit world. She has to get a job and seeks help in trying to turn her parents back into humans, for they were turned into pigs. Along her adventure, she (don't remember the name, it was unfamiliar to me) makes friends, learns lessons about trust and greed, and overall becomes a stronger person because of her adventure. She goes into the world as a whiny, complaining, sort of a brat, and leaves as a strong individual who is now ready to handle anything. It is a truly charming story. Some other recommendations to go along with this are KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE (you can buy a 3 DVD set with this film, Kiki's, and another animated feature), MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, and PRINCESS MONONOKE. If you can, try to go out and see this movie while it's still in theaters (by the time my review is published, it still will be, and buy the DVD while you're at it.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A34TQF07QBCTED	"""georhino"""	"I'm writing this after having seen Spirited Away for the second time.  It is simply a wonderful movie.  For the moviegoing viewers that get their dose of anime from Dragonball Z, this movie may be disappointing.  There are no transforming robots, no busty, big-eyed heroines, or letcherous schoolboys being hit with giant hyperdimensional hammers.  For parents looking for something to take their kids to, this movie requires a little consideration.  I've heard many parents complain that it's too scary for their kids.  Indeed, it may be a bit visually dynamic for your average preschooler, but it's no worse than the kind of stuff you're letting them watch in Ren & Stimpy or the aforementioned Dragonball Z.  I've seen more parents buying kids the 8-Mile DVD than taking their kids to see Spirited Away.  Bear in mind that PG is not the new G.  PG still implies there are things in the movie that may require parental guidance.  Parents should keep in mind that animation is viewed as an art form in Japan, and that not all animated movies are kiddie fodder such as Disney fare and Pokemon.  On the whole, I would say Spirited Away is no scarier than Disney's early Snow White, or their adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  This, however, definitely is not Bambi.Many folks may also be put off by the talk of Spirited Away being a ""weird"" movie.  IMO, Spirited Away is kind of a Japanese version of Alice in Wonderland.  I won't go into the details of the movie, which you can easily find other places online.  One must keep in mind that this is a **Japanese** film, and what is weird to Western moviegoers is not so to Eastern viewers.  The film draws heavily on its Japanese roots, incorporating storytelling elements from Japanese literature, theatre, folklore, and even Shinto and Buddhist elements.Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes.  Even if you don't care much for the story, the backgrounds are breathtaking.  This is not a cartoon that is cranked out for the purpose of merchandising, but an animated feast that is lovingly crafted to convey a story.  To say this movie is a mere cartoon is like saying the original Mona Lisa is a suitable placemat for a TV tray.Spirited Away is a breath of fresh air among animated movies that are little more than FX extravaganzas.  It is a movie that tells a story about the power of the human heart to prevail in even the most inhuman of situations.  Conflicts are not resolved with swords and scorcery, but with compassion and insight.  This is a movie that demonstrates that the knowledge of who you are as a person is more valuable than mad kung-fu skills or ""catching them all.""To sum up, Spirited Away is, as I have come to refer to it, an ""animated hiaku."""	5.0	Spirited Away has me blown away	2003-04-02	4	4	0

The animation is simply beautiful, the music is fantastic, and the story is completely unlike anything you will have ever seen before -Personally I recommend the Japanese speech version as I found it less childish, but nevertheless the English dubbing is very well done. Also the 2 disc set with special features is a much more complete package and well worth the extra few quid.Go on, give it a go!

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ANX8CRPUXIXMR	G. Hadley	All of the movies by this director are wonderfully imaginative. Spirited Away was our first introduction to studio ghibli and since then we've watched (and eventually bought) almost all of the titles available in English. Some of this movie may be a bit scary for very young or sensitive children, but with parents to explain what's happening and to remind that it's pretend, it should be fine.	5.0	One of Miyazaki's Best	2007-12-31	2	2	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3TDWQ9QZSKQBD	GlowWorm	This is my favorite of all the Miyazaki movies.  I don't know about all fo the philosophy  behind this but I love the artist expression and the journey the main character takes.  I think the characters in this are the best and most creative of all the Miyazaki movies I've seen.  And I DO get some of the philosophy behind some of them like the river dragon of pollution. I love the idea of other hidden realms and how we might get trapped in them.  This is one of those movies I think that doesn't have what I call slow spots.  It keeps going and you are just as interested in watching the middle and end as the beginning.  I plan to watch this again and look for things I missed.  I just got a book as a gift that is a perfect companion to this.  I love it too.The Art of Spirited AwayIt has really beautiful art.	5.0	My Favorite	2011-06-04	1	1	0

Music is beautiful and accents the story further.  Story line and characters are amazing, you really feel for them.  The end leaves you BEGGING for more, not wanting to believe that it's over already!!This story takes you on a fantastic adventure into a world of spirits, magic, dragons, and on a journey with a little girl who's lost, scared, and is trying to save her parents.  You watch as the girl, (Chihiro, or Sen), transforms into a strong character who is willing to overcome her fears and do whatever it takes to save the ones that she loves.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ABLGEP9R8L5ET	Gonzalo G. Braschi	I'm a huge fan of Miyazaki &amp; Studio Ghibli, but I'm sorry this one is not as good (by far) as others he's done.Animation is feeble and clunky at times, and the story... well, the story is not only mostly pointless (in the sense of not having a point) but also gets lost easily along the way with too many stuff going on. Most people won't even get what the movie is about.I'm glad that he finally got some recognition, but it's a shame it had to be with this movie. You're far better off watching some of the older movies from Miyazaki. Laputa, Kiki, Totoro, Princess Mononoke or my personal favourite Porco Rosso...

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1M8JMW2145W84	greatkingrat	This movie is amazing.  Incredible.  It is worthy of endless superlatives.  I rented the DVD for my daughter and wound up sitting transfixed at what I was witnessing.  Maybe the creator got hold of some slightly toxic puffer fish, because the concepts in this film are so bizarre and wonderful that I think they MUST have been hallucinogenically induced.This is now on my Must-Buy list, but not for my kids- for me.  Had this film been available to me when I was twenty years younger, and still experimenting with mind-altering substances, I may have watched it every single day.  It is transforming.  I love movies that transport me to another realm, and few are able to do that.The spirit baths, the herbal soap tokens, No-Face, the tiny fuzzy black ball creatures that bring Sen her shoes, the wonderfully creative and strange characters, all of it combines for an experience I won't ever forget.If you don't like this film, you were ripped off.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2E7KC0EI7QT8	"Greg Pauletti ""gdpetti"""	Another Ghibli anime film, so it is very good, if not excellent as this one is IMO. This one takes on a more mythic nature as it includes those myths of the area and people affecting the daily life of the awakening child who is starting to see the world around her in a different light of possibilities. Hard work getting out of the seeming trap life has thrown her into, like so many of us, she has to learn that she is in fact in a trap to begin with before figuring out a way out of this trap/prison/maze/matrix.It is life's lessons presented to her as she learns to truly see the reality around her. Things aren't always as they seem. It always depends upon how much we can see, how much life and society confines our innate abilities, how it dumbs us down until we become blind unless we grip hard to reality and ride out the storm of challenges presented along the way as the river flows through our life.Another artistic triumph.	5.0	Spirited Away, anime film	2012-07-31	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A11AZG938XL5UU	Greg Polansky	In a world where alternate realities are just a bridge away, but that are hidden away by the Gods, Chihiro Ogino finds herself and her parents transported to a bathhouse frequented by those Gods. Here Chihiro must take a job at a bathhouse in order to not be transformed into an animal like her parents already have been turned into. And it here in this alternate reality that Chihuro finds herself succeeding against all odds and against the wishes of Yubaba - owner of the establishment. Yubaba is a capricious witch who enslaves those around her by taking away their names. And if they forget their names, then Yubaba can keep them enslaved forever. Now Chihiro is beginning to forget her name. And when she does forget her name, she will be trapped forever.Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away's is probably the most famous of Studio Ghibli films. It is a beautiful, lush film that takes you fully into Japanese culture and mythology. The visuals are always stunning and the story is fast-tracked and a roller coaster of fun and enchantment. The characters are all interesting in their own ways. And the plot line reaches a satisfactory conclusion.This movie represents the 14th consecutive Studio Ghibli film (click my name for those reviews of the first 13) that I have now seen and represents the pinnacle of the fantasy side of Studio Ghibli. Though there is no environmental message here like there is in some of the other Studio Ghibli fantasy films, it is still an accessible film about the alienation we feel when we are young and how that leads us along the path from childhood to adulthood.	5.0	Hidden Away By the Gods	2012-11-17	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2ZQ9JZSG2XCUL	Gudel Fratari	Well, I'd like to start this review by making a parallel beetwen this movie and traditional chinese legends, but I don't know any chinese legends, so I can't really do that. So let's just talk about the film itself.Spirited Away is sort of an oriental version of Alice in Wonderland (with the major difference that Alice's tears where generally smaller than her face). But at it's core it is about the dreams and courage of children. Most of my friends wouldn't be able to survive a whole day at the strange magic hotel where Chihiro, the protagonist, finds herself after the sun sets and her parents become enourmous, fat pigs. However, not only does she manage to survive she also ends up helping a bunch of people and eventually freeing her parents.All children are brave, much more so than adults. Maybe that's becouse they have a more optimistic view of the world, or it could just be that they are really stupid.	4.0	A journey into the magic world whose name I can't remember	2003-12-14	7	3	4

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1VZA7V8HJ2SZ6	"Gwenn Cosmis ""cardcaptor moon"""	This is definately my favorite movie of all times and will probely remain that way. It has beautiful animation, characters, a nice plot, and more.In this, a girl named Chihiro and her family accidently end up in the spirit world where Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs. Now Chihiro must face different obstacles in the world of spirits and save herself and her parents.However, it is rated PG for some good reasons. It has some scary moments, mild blood in a particular part{however, the blood doesn't come from any violence}, and the look of the spirits could scare some little kids.The animation is A++ 110%Hayao Miyazaki really emphasized what spirits should look like, and he drew the characters really well.The music is A 100%The music goes with the parts well. Too bad the ending song is in Japanese though.Voices A+ 105%The voices fit the characters well {unlike in Cardcraptors} and don't make them sound too young or too old.Plot A 100%It's a movie that has a simple yet nice plot that doesn't involve anything mean that teenagers would watch, which is why parents would like it.If you like movies about the girl being tha main character, helping to save others in a strange world with obsticles to overcome, then this movie is for you.If you are 8 and under, you should be supervised with an adult.Overall, a VERY great movie.Highly Recommended.	5.0	A great film...

I was fooled by the shady opening scenes, but there after, the story seemed to be more interesting. The story of a girl, Sen, as she is named in the spirit world, and her parents, barged in and started eating up all the food, then as the sun was setting, they were meant to leave before they change into pigs, but because they were hypnotized by the appetizing food, they stayed, then turing into pigs. Now Sen has to rescue her parents and change them back before the Spirit World figures out she's a human and kill her.There are lots of colorful, weird and supporting characters in this first ever Oscar winning anime, and the way this anime was presented, with it's out of this world animation and great voice overs, it's the only anime worth watching, trust me!	4.0	Great Animation, complicated story	2004-08-28	3	1	2

It freezes at the same spot on multiple dvd machines.  We can not watch the whole thing.  Upon closer inspection the disc appears to have been resurfaced.  It has wavy buffing marks.  We didn't think to inspect the disc and test it out since the seller said it was ""like new"".  We will next time.  Learned this lesson the hard way. When I emailed the seller they had a real snotty attitude and said ""its been too long, you should have inspected it right away.  But how about a coupon for 10% off of your next purchase?""

It's not a gushy Disney cartoon, for sure.  It has themes of courage in the face of crisis, friendship, hard work, and empathizing with others, even if they're not exactly pleasant to be around.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A16KRCLLTHSB5F	Henry Platte	When this movie was released, in a perfect world, the entire board of directors of the Disney corporation should have sunk on their knees and committed seppuku. This is what innovation looks like, and, in spite (or because of) of its unrelenting weirdness, it's the sort of thing kids can really enjoy - I think, although not being a kid anymore myself, I can't be sure.Spirited Away is a classic fable, mixing the conventions of European and Russian fairy tales with elements of Japanese folklore and contemporary culture. A young girl, Chihiro, somewhat bored and spoiled to begin with, loses her parents to a curse and is trapped in a world of gods and spirits, and undergoes a self-transformative journey which is rarely trite or dully moralizing. What sets it above many similiar animated fables is the sense of danger that is generated - things in this world are so drastic and bizzare that you actually find yourself wondering if the expected happy ending will result.The grotesquery in the film is extreme, and I guess parents should be warned about it; the most striking things include a spirit which devours people (not fatally) and later vomits copiously, a scene in which the male lead in dragon form is badly wounded and bleeds from the mouth, and a scene that actually distrubed me in which a giant baby threatens to break Chihiro's arm. That giant baby is just plain creepy. I don't think kids, who are often more bloodthirsty than they are given credit for, would object to any of this; parents might be more effected.The message - touching on the standard themes of true love and courage - is more convincing than usual, possibly because so much of what Chihiro accomplishes really does result from her own courage, and is not handed to her on a silver platter by a fairy godmother. A minor scene where she sprints down the length of a rickety bridge is especially effective. The romance, also, is not the overly sanitized kind you usually find in fairy tales; the male lead, Hako, has a dark side, and seems like an actual being rather than an impossible abstract.Even those Americans who are hip enough to call Japanese animation 'anime' probably have a somewhat limited view of it. Most of these people (and I hope I don't offend anyone with this generalization) are male, between fourteen and thirty years of age, and addicted to stylized sex and violence (this is me). The anime which has been released in this country is generally targeted at them, and many of them seem to assume because of this that all anime is of that type. While I can't overstate by admiration for series like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Spirited Away is proof that the minds of contemporary Japan are capable of very different things. The most striking difference between this and other modern anime is in the character design - Chihiro is not particularly attractive. Hako tends more toward the classic bishounen, but many of the other characters are completley grotesque. This has always been Miyazaki's style, and makes the story much easier to believe.The only way in which I believe I could have enjoyed this film more is if I had been fifteen years or so younger when I saw it. It's the quintessential family film, and far from being a Japanese oddity, deserves to be the staple of a new generation of American youth.	5.0	Where was this when I was growing up?	2004-04-25	5	3	2

The multiple adventures lived by Shijiro will work out as a frame and will show us some little details, but profoundly revealing such as the awful spelling of her parents on pigs when they have not obeyed certain rules of the game inside this weird world.Excellent work, innovative, fresh that reflects a deep artistic commitment.

As the movie went on I along with my daughter became mesmerized. As soon as it was over my daughter says Lets watch it again!I said ok. She started to refer to is as the pig movie as i do to this day.I recomment it to everyone young and old. It is just fantastic.I also recently watched castle in the sky and i will not let my daughter watch that one. It is too violent in theme and action. It also took me a while to get into it too but i really do not care to much for it.When Spirited away is refered to as Miyazakis masterpeice it truly is.Enjoy.	5.0	Simply Amazing!	2010-04-16	3	3	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A151GQPJQI7AR9	Hurley Goodall	I enjoy some Japanese animation, but I think I do a pretty good job of remaining unbiased--it's not always good just because it comes from Japan.  I must say that this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time.The story is dream-like as it progresses; we're introduced to many memorable characters, it's heartwarming, it doesn't take itself too seriously (a pitfall of many anime films), and it's pretty to look at!  You can't ask for much more in a film.A word of warning: Be prepared to suspend your disbelief.  Don't start off with the &quot;that doesn't make sense&quot; mentality.  Sure it doesn't make sense for Chihiro's (the main character) parents to walk into an abandoned amusement park and eat food hapharzardly laying on a counter.  Sure it's kinda silly for spirits and gods to be obsessed with gold (where would they spend it?).  Just go with the flow.  You'll enjoy it a lot more.	5.0	Beautiful.	2003-04-18	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2TO2RTVQYPTDX	"""hyperchicagurl"""	I really didn't want to see this movie at first, but I forced to as it was my brother's birthday, and he is an animation fanatic.Even though I'm fifteen and like to think of myself as above cartoon movies, this has quickly turned into one of my favorite movies, prompting a fifth visit to my local theater to see it. Everytime I see it, I notice something different about it, that I didn't before.It has a fantastic plot, and really transports you to a different world where not everything is as it seems on the surface. It really absorbs you. There are sad parts, and well as funny parts, and you feel the emotions of the charachters.Despite the PG rating, this movie may scare little kids, as there is some pretty weird stuff going on in the movie, such as people beng transformed into pigs, several monsters, dragons, and some animated blood.This is definitely one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a really long time.	5.0	Great Movie!	2003-04-05	50	46	4
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AVKX581LUE6B3	icjlcsag	"Spirited Away is an excellent animated Japanese film released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios. I believe it was awarded the Golden Bear for ""Best Picture"" at the Berlin Film Festival. If you are a parent with a young child or two I recomend you have them watch this movie. The imagination, animation and attention to detail are stunning. It's cute, it's fun and it will captivate the whole family.The movie starts with a young girl, Chihiro, who moves to a new town with her parents. When the father takes a wrong turn they end up stumbling on an abandoned amusement park. The entire place is deserted except for one booth that is open, but no employees are to be found. As the sun goes down and the veil between the mortal world and the spirit world begins to thin, Chihiro finds that the park is not abandoned, but full of life! From when she was dragged into the Bath House to the moment she was able to return to the mortal world I was glued to the screen, watching as each scene unfolded, waiting to see what creature from Miyazaki's imagination would show up next.Not only is it cute enough to entertain your children, it's strong enough to hold your attention to the screen as well. The struggle of one girls work to keep out of trouble in the spirit world and the team work the spirits show her to try to rescue her parents will also inspire a ""fire"" in your child's heart to fight for what they care about. This is definately a film EVERYONE should see before they turn 12. Watching this movie made me feel like I was ""spirited away"" (pun intended)."	5.0	An Excellent Adventure	2010-10-01	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3QMSKG3WTAQ5N	"""ishcar3"""	Spirited Away is a story about Chihiro, who at first seem to be a lazy and spoiled 10-year-old girl. But when faced with life or death, she found tremendous strength within herself. Along her path to save her friend's life and her parents' redemption, she was able to befriend everyone and every spirit. She does it so easily because she has a generous heart, and nonjudgmental mind of a child.Hayao Miyazaki takes you into a magical world full of animal spirits, gods, and demons. Miyazaki's unique culture perceptive fills the pages of Spirited Away with visual delights and humor. Spirited Away is a story of love, friendship, and inner strength.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2QYLOGLHAVK96	jackyreviews	Spirited Away is one of the best children's movies out there. Other reviewers have compared the film to other great animated children's films such as Pinocchio and Snow White, but I would argue that Spirited Away blows away the competition. Yes, it can be slightly scary and intense, and it deals with maturity and coming of age, but these themes really only scratch the surface of what Spirited Away has to offer the viewer.Firstly, every single major character (with the exception, perhaps, of Chihiro's parents) is extremely dynamic. Characters develop, change, and fall victim to mood swings, propriety and other personality-modifying factors. This both makes Spirited Away unique and realistic. In the real world there isn't a black-and-white picture of good and evil, and Spirited Away makes sure to challenge the viewer's first impression of every character. Seemingly evil or mean characters turn out to be less heartless than they initially seemed. Such character development shows the viewer that there are different perspectives on each issue.Spirited Away also deals with important themes/lessons, especially for children. I won't get into the specifics, but time and time again, the characters learn that love and friendship are far more valuable than material goods. Additionally, one theme of the film is environmental conservation/ending pollution--as evidenced by the cleansing of the river spirit as well as Haku's story. This is just a sampling of some of the important themes in Spirited Away.Finally, Spirited Away does, like other children's films, ultimately present a coming of age story. Chihiro learns the importance of standing and speaking up for herself. She also realizes both her privilege and the value of her identity.I would recommend this film for ALL children age 7+; it's at that age that you can really start to appreciate everything it has to offer. Please don't deprive your child of this wonderful movie, and, as an adult, don't deprive yourself either. I'm grown and I can appreciate it on SO many levels.	5.0	Wonderful, but NOT like other children's movies	2012-04-24	5	5	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A30LHZV6VMM900	jadedromantic	"I just saw this movie on the big screen yesterday, and learned while skimming Amazon today that it's due on DVD in about 2 weeks! Well, let me tell you, I'm so glad I saw it on the big screen, because a large part of the amazing film ""Spirited Away"" is its absolute beauty; the color, animation, the look and feel of the movie SCREAM for the big screen, and I'm only sorry I saw it dubbed and not in its original Japanese. But for sure, this is one movie I will be buying the very day of its release.The plot is nominal -- a young girl is moving to a new city with her parents, feeling isolated and a little afraid at this new venture in her young life. On the way to their new home, her father takes what he believes to be a shortcut to their house, but instead they wind up in front of an entrance to a bizarre-looking tunnel. In front of the entrance sits a stone statue that is too big for the car to go around so, curious, the parents decide to check out the strange-looking building with the tunnel on foot. Their little girl, immediately fearing something is wrong here, has to be cajoled into going -- and this sets off a bizarre adventure for Chihiro (the girl) that you have to see to believe; she soon ends up all alone in a VERY strange land.Saying more would be giving stuff away, so let me just say that Chichiro is indeed ""spirited away"" to a world where she must learn to be strong in order to save herself -- and her parents -- from being stuck there forever. On the way she meets both friends and enemies of all shapes, sizes . . . and worlds.This is one heck of a movie, one of my favorites and candy for the eye as well as the mind. Beautifully made and well-crafted, anyone meeting Chihiro will immediately love her, and root 150% for her success.My ONLY negative in seeing this fine film comes from the actual theatergoing experience itself -- because the film is being distributed by Disney in the USA, there were MANY children in the audience, from babies to early teens. PLEASE NOTE: this is NOT a movie for very young children, by any means -- some images might disturb them, some ""monsters"" in the film may be too intense for kids under, say, 7 years of age. One woman down the aisle from me walked out with her four daughters less than ten minutes into the film.This is NOT a ""Disney movie"" by any means, it's Japanimation -- some of the finest I've seen, and -- as much as I also love ""Lilo and Stitch"" -- I can see completely why ""Spirited Away"" won the Oscar a week ago for Best Animated Film. A brilliant movie, it would be an honor to have it in any movie-lover's DVD collection."	5.0	AMAZING to look at, especially on the big screen . . .	2003-03-30	10	10	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AOWXVAKWPA7SD	"Jae H. Yu ""Lost Notes"""	This movie begins with a girl and her parents moving to a new home.  Right from the beginning, the movie brought out events many of us went through as a child.  It's interesting to see how Hayao Miyazaki used this simple scene to portray a hidden layer of emotions that Chihiro (the main character) is enduring.  Miyazaki also used this scene to foreshadow the events that were to come later in the movie.  This idea of adventure and mystery resonates throughout the entire film as Chihiro finds herself in a colorful world of spirits and magic.Throughout the movie, her courage, her strength, and her own spirit are tested as she embarks on a journey to save her parents.  This idea of being a hero also brings back many nostalgic childhood memories.  Miyazaki often tends to provoke a collage of emotions from his audience through his intricate emphasis on tiny details.  The train scene, for example, is filled with this artistic approach.  When Chihiro sits down on an empty seat, Miyazaki focuses all the attention to this; and even after she sits, he pauses for a moment to capture this image of her sitting before moving on to the next scene.  Another instance of this can be seen when the two little animal friends of hers are looking out the window, bouncing up and down.  This image immediately reminded me of my childhood and how I used to stand on the seat with my hands on the windows, gazing at the passing images outside.  I also remember how I used to bounce up and down on the seats for no reason at all.  But these are the very things that make children, children; and Miyazaki celebrates this through this and many of his other films.The beautifully drawn images, attention to details, and the myriad of bursting colors truly embraces all the qualities of an elaborate painting.  This movie is indeed a painting which will indulge viewers into Miyazaki's free spirited world.	5.0	A gem that celebrates the spirit of children	2005-02-17	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A13L8GETXPQC2Z	james bien	This movie reminded me of a slightly more manic version of Alice in Wonderland. The viewer is introduced to a world that is devoid of logic. As I watched on, I felt like a child entering a circus for the first time. Everything was new, colourful, bizarre and exciting. This is probabily the reason why I liked this movie so much. It's as if I had kalidoscope eyes. I like movies that take me away from reality and this one did it for me. To their credit, the animators were able to capitalize on the medium by creating scenes and elements that would be difficult if not impossibe to create with real actors. Saying that, I thought &quot;The adventures of baron munchausen&quot; was quite successful in acheiving that. I have a feeling that this movie would appeal more to adults than kids because it restores some sense of imagination that we lost while we grew up.	4.0	A superior version of Alice in wonderland	2003-06-17	1	0	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2UONLYIFN6ZS3	"James G ""J.M.G."""	Words cannot express what an incredible film this is. I love that Miyazaki has included so much  Japanese mythology and culture into this film. The film can be slightly confusing if you only watch it once, but I think this has more to do with the English translation being confusing rather than the actual plot. The film is visually stunning and the musical score accomodates it with perfect harmony. This is by far Miyazaki's greatest work in my opinion. In fact, this was the first film that I've ever seen my Miyazaki and I had the pleasure of seeing it in the theater when it was released in the United States.

While all of the ones I saw were wonderful, this one sticks out the most in my mind. The storyline is very original, as it is for all ages to enjoy. It's not kiddy while not adult-oriented at the same time. It's very neutral in the way it presents itself. The animation is crisp and fresh as you get a good view of Japan's countryside and every detail goes into the backgrounds and characters. Every detail and action seems very realistic. The music is also a very nice addition to sum up the way the scenes are being presented.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1C08KLFIHSJMZ	Jason G.	Anime often remains a mysterious artform to many not familiar with it, often thinking that cartoons are merely for children. However, the Japanese have made anime for both adults and children, sometimes combined into one.While Spritied Away is a children's story at heart, adults will recognize the moral values and life lessons woven into the plot, as the narrative is both emotionally turbulent and ultimately triumphant in its progression. Imagery and symbolism is rampant througout, with the settings, characters and revelations often having deeper meaning than their initial apperances.The film starts out with a whiny girl named Chihiro moving to her new home with her parents. As they stop at what seems to be an abdandoned theme park, they are pleased to see that it appears to still be in operation. After Chihiro's parents pig out (literally) on the food set out for guests, the theme park's true nature is revealed and Chihiro is plunged into a world that only tbe brilliant mind of Miyasaki could produce.The theme park is actually a gateway into a Japanese bath house for the spirit world, and a mortal girl like Chihiro is not welcome. After being given a pity job by Zeniba, the witch over ruling the establishment, she seeks to earn her freedom back as well as rescue her parents from certain death in the pig pen.While adjusting to life at the bath house Chihiro meets a boy about her age who serves as Zeniba's personal assistant of sorts, though his true identity is ultimately what sets the both of them free.This film is visually stunning, combining both traditional animation with computer aided graphics. The DVD picture is both pristine and vivid; audio content is much of the same. While the film's running time is over two hours this film went by in what seemed like an instant, fading away like a pleasant dream on a warm summer night towards the end, and we are left with the unpleasant reality of real life--but with the promise of a better tomorrow if we always rememebr to stay true to ourselves.	5.0	Better than anything Hollywood has produced in decades	2006-06-12	9	6	3
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A19N0I6QOL3J3E	jason	OK, if you're looking for a Disney movie, forget it.  This movie is better than the last ten Disney flicks put together (although Lilo and Stich is fun, I admit).Spirited Away is a film, not a movie.  It has sequences in it that are as beautiful as anything ever shown on the screen, and I'm counting the masterpieces of Kurosawa, Fellini and Bergman in this mix.  You think I'm joking, but I'm not.  The visuals are gorgeous, the music entrancing, the detailed sound perfect.  The scene where our little heroine rides the train across what seems like an endless ocean, as ghosts commuted to whatever dreary lives they might live, drove me to tears for the first time since &quot;our song&quot; in Moulin Rouge.  Man, it's been a long time since a movie struck me emotionally like this.  Absolutely fantastic stuff.Whether kids will like it is another question.  It can be pretty scary, but no worse than &quot;Atlantis&quot; or the such.  Parents will find it scarier (maybe more morbid) than the kids.  If your child likes to stick with the Disney type stuff, try My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service first.  They're almost as good and not as challenging to the beginner.  But it doesn't hurt to try - I know I would have LOVED &quot;Sprited Away&quot; as a kid.I know this will be the first &quot;kids&quot; film I ever buy, and maybe the only one.	5.0	The most beautiful animated film ever made	2003-04-14	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AI1XT1ESQWSQW	Jason Rabin	Spirited Away is yet another masterpiece from Japan's undisputed master of animation. Although I did not enjoy it as much as Princess Mononoke, I was more entertained by this film than by any Disney movie made in the past five years. Speaking of Disney, I thought I would clear up a few misconceptions that some people have concerning this film. Firstly, for those people who complain that Miyazaki's films (as well as other anime) are for adults, and not children, I should point out that Miyazaki has explicitly stated that Spirited was made for young girls. (in other words, Chihiro's age) This doesn't mean that the film can only be enjoyed by pre-pubescant girls (I myself am a 22 year old male); it just means that you should not go into this film expecting something geared towards adults, the way Mononoke was.Now I have noticed several people on this site comparing Spirited to Disney. Everyone seems to agree that it is nothing like Disney, because it is scary. Some parents even go so far to say that Spirited is inappropriate for children. Let me just say that you are all both right and wrong on this issue. Spirited Away is nothing like Disney as it is NOW. However, if you look at classics like Snow White, and especially Pinocchio, you'll see that these films have much more in common with Spirited Away than with, say, Hercules, or Tarzan. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who claims that Spirited is too scary for children ought to remember what Disney used to be like. In Snow White, the wicked Queen ordered the huntsman to cut out Snow White's heart. Even more telling, in Pinocchio, the main character ends up on an island for wicked children, who are mercilessly transformed into beasts and sold into slavery. Can you honestly say that this is somehow more wholesome or less nightmarish than what goes on in Spirited? Anyone who remembers these films recognizes that Spirited Away's often nightmarish sense of morality and justice (parents being turned into pigs for their greed) is not novel to the American imagination, but something old, something many of us have clearly forgotten, even though we saw these very films as children! This harkens back to a time when Americans had a much clearer sense of morality, a much greater willingness to recognize an absolute line between right and wrong. For me, this is refreshing, for you it may not be. As for your children being scared, I agree it is a possibility. I was scared when I saw Snow White and Pinocchio, yet I enjoyed those two films immensely. Moreover, they are both considered to be undisputed classics of American animation. So to all those parents who think they can comfortably dismiss Spirited Away as some alien abomination, you had better look closer to home, because it may not be quite as alien as you thought.	4.0	An outstanding breath of fresh air	2003-03-15	507	473	34
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A20D9J0ZG1UXW4	Jason Verenski	Spirited Away is not related to the thousands of other anime films out there. Miyazaki is a storyteller first and foremost, weaving dramatic, comedic tales. Spirited Away, and most of the other Studio Ghibli films, are made pretty much - for everyone. If you're between 8 and 100 years old, you'll probably enjoy this film.  Depending on your age, you'll see a slightly different film.  Spirited away combines traditional Japanese culture, post war culture, 90s culture, magic, spirits...  no robots or space creatures in this one and although Miyazaki touches on Steampunk in some of his other films, there's not really any in this film.  Everyone I've ever shared this film with, young and old, has absolutely loved it.  Miyazaki's use of children (or childlike characters) in the lead roles - and the fact that his films are animated, leads a lot of people to assume that these are films for children, and while they are great for children, they are certainly not kid movies.  Highly suggested.	5.0	Miyazaki - not for anime lovers (only)	2009-11-08	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A106016KSI0YQ	Jay Dickson	The genius of this film is its utter narrative originality: while it seems indisputably like Japanese fairy tales (in its particulars of spiritual machinery) and may even remind you of Northern European fairy tales (in its setting and the tribulations the heroine must go through), it also seems like nothing else you've ever seen. Best of all, while its exceptionally intelligent and offers a profound allegory about class (in its heroine's need to work to survive, and the greedy system she works under), it never seems moralistic or preachy in the least. And nothing is never what it seems to be: eschewing the easy good and evil dualities of American cartoons, the characters the heroine encounters are complex and ambiguous in their morality. No one is a clear villain or hero, and someone who can give her her greatest aid at one minute can suddenly become a threat to her life.The young heroine, Chihiro, matures in the course of the film from a clingy and even irritatingly whining young girl to someone more mature and self-reliant, but her transformation is gradual and believable. When her parents are transformed into pigs by the magics of a mysterious recreational village for spirits that they stumble across, Chihiro must work from the literal bottom of a spooky and mysterious tower which functions as a bathing house for spirits and demons. The bathhouse tower is a kind of Gothic miracle, populated by all kinds of creatures that you've never seen before and remind you of nothing else (such as the enchanted furnace smudges required to carry inidivual coals). And the film is replete with great moments of beauty that the director, Miyazaki, is not afraid to linger on: a train gliding over a flooded empty landscape, or seagulls circling far below the heroine's feet (yet over a beautiful blue sea) as she climbs to the top of the mysterious tower. This isn't like anything else you've ever seen before.	5.0	Lasts in your memory like a happy dream	2003-04-26	6	4	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AXW444VIV75UF	J. Brian Watkins	It is the rare work that can transport one to a completely new world both familiar and strange.  It is an even rarer work that speaks to both children and adults.  In my personal opinion, the American public does not demand quality from its artists--sure, there is the occasional serendipitous work that manages to find financing and an audience; however, in large part it takes an artist of great perserverance and no small amount of luck to reach the audience.Based on this work alone, Mr. Miyazaki's movies are on my instant purchase list.  Other reviews adequately treat a summary of the story and the various strengths of the work--I would like to just state that it is our responsibility to demand and support art of this magnificent quality.  This is art that affirms life and teaches that virtue is its own reward, that moderation and patience can conquer difficult problems and that sometimes we need to have terrible experiences in order to discover our inner strength.  (And, it is a fun movie to watch.)I can't think of a better family movie.  At once entertaining and instructive, its only negative for me was that this work exposes most other movies as utterly worthless dreck.	5.0	Inner Strength and Worthy Art	2005-08-15	3	3	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AQ2RL6HTVI86T	"J. Bridell ""Lost Johnny"""	"Wow.  I have just seen this masterpiece a second time at the theater and was more blown away then the first time.  I cannot recommend seeing it on the big screen enough, I will buy the DVD to be sure, but one must see the grand scope of this to appreciate it in full.  It is not so much what it is as what it is not.  It is not a pretentious ""adult cartoon"" relying on kinky sex and violence to pass itself off as highbrow entertainment.  It is not that bad ""anime"" (spelling)? that I would hope we would have seen the last of by now.  This is original, heartfelt, funny and simply dazzling to look at.  How rare is it these days to see a good story told in an interesting way that is coherent and funny as well as dead serious and never heavy handed or depressing?  There are so many ways Japanese animation can go wrong (at least to American audiences) and this film steers well clear of all of them.  A child's journey of self discovery, of learning timeless lessons about friendship and family, and it is never politicized, never used as an excuse to push some religious or sociological agenda.  Small children might be scared at parts of this, the pigs in particular were disturbing (I was more scared then any of the children in attendance, which is usually the case anyway) but they will be won over by the happy but never sappy ending.  How sad that so many films feel it is necessary to have a depressing and downbeat story to be taken seriously, how sad that so many small minded producers cannot see past short term profits and commercialization, how delightful and fortunate that someone still cares about art for arts sake and takes the effort and expense to bring this wonderful tale to the screen, like all great art this film enhances life, one cannot help but feel better after having seen this, you really owe it to yourself to spend two hours in this magic place where good can overcome evil and everyone can solve there problems the right way.

Until she saw this film, she couldn't understand my enthusiasm over anime.She sighed through the first 10 minutes, but once the parents turned into pigs - she couldn't even blink.  On the way home from the film, she couldn't stop talking about all of the hidden meanings within the film, the characters, the animation, the way that it makes Alice in Wonderland look like Barney in comparison.If you want to introduce an incredibly cynical person to anime - this is the film to introduce them to.  You really can't go wrong with it, no matter how old they are.

I don't think it's fair to keep calling it a Japanese version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; though. To be honest, I think this is much, much better than Alice in Wonderland, but also I think that the two movies just have too many differences between them--Spirited Away is more of an adventure movie grounded in certain rules of logic (even if those rules may be very silly). Anyway, read all the other rave reviews here if you want to know how great this move is. Pure magic, great fun for any age, a good movie that you can watch and lose yourself inside.I'm writing this review as a warning to parents. Although this movie is sure to be enjoyed by children, there are several scenes that you may want to approach with caution. Although much of the movie is beautiful, some of it is also very grotesque, including some scenes in which vomit and sludge spew forth in floods. While that might just be dismissed as childish gross-out stuff, there's another scene that could be very difficult for some children to handle.At one point, Sen wakes up and sees a dragon flying around, being chased by thousands of flying paper things. When she rescues it, she finds that the dragon is covered in (and coughing up) blood. Although there aren't any graphic, gory scenes of violence, there is a lot of blood splashed around on the walls. There are also several close-ups of the blood dripping out of the dragon's mouth. If you have very sensitive children, or if you just do not want them to see this, then be prepared for this scene (it lasts for several minutes, but once it is over there is no more blood).No matter whether or not you may view this as a &quot;child's&quot; movie, it is still an absolute treat. Even if you are a parent and do not want to show it to your kids, then buy it just for yourself!	5.0	Great, but parents should be warned.	2004-03-05	9	7	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ADEETJWRKD6OA	"J. Moran ""aralim"""	"After seeing Princess Mononoke on DVD, I became an instant fan of Miyazaki's films and style of animation. I saw this movie when it was released to theaters here in the US, having seen the ads for it and knowing it was going to be good.It wasn't good, it was great! So many fables in the U.S. have been told to death that to see this movie was a literal breath of fresh air. It is such a wonderful new take on the old story of the hero being required to grow up and mature in order to ""get out"" of whatever situation he/she has been thrust into.Chihiro/Sen is someone that any young girl can relate to. While she starts off seeming bratty, it's not because she's really a brat. Her family has moved, something that's all too familiar to many young children, and what young girl wouldn't be angry at her parents after being yanked away from her friends without so much as a ""how do you feel about this""? She just wants to stay where she's comfortable and safe.From the outset, Chihiro is required to act in ways that would be difficult for anyone, never mind a young girl! How well would you react to the sight of a ""boiler keeper"" who looks like a cross between a man and a spider, with little puffs of soot scurrying about as his helpers? And in the same night, find yourself having to face down a foul-tempered witch to ensure you don't suffer the same fate as your parents?Every girl (and boy) has to learn to ""grow up"" -- to come to grips with the fact that the world can sometimes be a harsh place, and that you still have to live in it and do the best that you can; to learn to stand up for yourself with no one there to help you; to be responsible for what you (or those with you) do; to come to understand that other people besides yourself matter. Chihiro learns all of these things and more, and changes from a timid, somewhat self-absorbed person into one who has a deep inner strength and faith in herself and who cares deeply about the people she has come to know. This is a story that sends a powerful message, one that will stay with the people who watch it.I have a four year-old daughter, and I can't wait to show this DVD to her when she's a little older. Her younger sister will see it, too, when she's old enough. I'm betting that this will become one of their favorite movies, and that they'll want to watch it over and over again."	5.0	A great story for young girls and their parents!	2004-10-29	9	8	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"Considered Miyazaki's masterpiece, Spirited Away is one of the better animated movies that I've seen.  The only other Miyazaki film I've seen is Castle in the Sky, and this Spirited Away blows Castle away.  This is a superior film.  Much of today's American animation is grounded in reality (even if you have talking lions and space aliens).  Nothing feels foreign or truly magical.  Miyazaki truly has a sense of the fantastic.  Images and characters in his work are truly foreign and magical.  Spirited Away is perhaps the best example of this.  There is a No-Face character (a mostly fluid black shape with a mask) that has no characteristics that we can identify as human (as a contrast, Stich from ""Lilo and Stich"" is a space alien but isn't too far off from human emotions and motivations).  No-Face is an interesting, and occasionally frightening, character.The story follows Chihiro, a young girl whose family is just moving to a new city.  On the way to the house the father takes a shortcut.  The short cut is a dead end, but there is a pathway through some buildings.  The parents decide to investigate (over the objections of Chihiro).  After passing through a tunnel they come to what they believe is an abandoned amusement park....with the smells of cooking food.  Hungrily, the parents chase down the smell and see a large amount of food laid out on a countertop.  The parents sit down and eat, cajoling Chihiro to do the same.  She runs away, and is warned by Haku (a more important character later) to get out before nightfall.  She runs back to her parents but only see two large pigs gorging on food....right where her parents were.  She runs, frightened, but ends up not being able to get out.  She finds herself in a magical world where there are very few humans (who work nearly like slaves for a bath house).  Haku helps her get a job in the bath house, saving Chihiro from being turned to a pig like her parents.  The movie is her experience in the bathhouse and how she tries to rescue herself and her parents.This is a fantastic movie, and deservedly won the Best Animated Film Oscar at the Academy Awards."	4.0	outstanding	2003-05-06	4	4	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1YBDRXLJ1ECSF	Johannes Labusch	While this artist's work was made popular in the States by Pixar mastermind John Lassiter, there is a genuine quirkyness and so much creative courage in Miyazaki's work that you would be hard pressed to find in any Pixar or Disney movie. These films, while often sweet and melancholy, are not afraid to explore the dark side of childhood, fears and obsessions that children have to come to terms with. In this case, it's the first hint of discovering your own identity, independent from your parents, that you have to form and embrace. Spirited Away is empowering to kids and miraculous for all ages.	5.0	One of the most inspiring children's movies ever	2012-12-29	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"A magnificent tale from perhaps the world's greatest living animator, Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" finds a bewildered young girl plunged into an alternate world a la ""Alice in Wonderland"". But Miyazaki's humanistic spin on this kind of through-the-looking-glass fable makes love the most powerful spell of all. With his gallery of fantastic creatures--a sludge-heap river god, a lonely No-Face monster, an octopus-armed boiler-room attendant--Miyazaki wrings magic, humor, and endless delights from every scene. ""Spirited Away"" will captivate anyone with a sense of wonder and a love for flights of fancy."	5.0	Spirited Away	2007-07-25	2	2	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	While lacking the sheer epic sweep and grandeur of Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away carves itself a more personal, contained, lushness.  An apathetic, depressed 10 year girl must save her parents when they all unknowingly stumble into a gateway to the Japanese spirit world.  Working her [their] debt off in a spirit bath house she enlists the aid of a disparate group of denizens of this strange world.  Like an erstwhile Pollyanna she makes friends and endears herself while learning to care about more than herself and even to love at her young age.  Beautifully animated and vibrant, its appeal stretches across a wide age range as it went on to set box office records in Japan and abroad.  Highly recommended.	4.0	Beautiful, Child-like Redemption Tale	2003-08-03	2	0	2
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AGPJA4TLSTI7F	Johnny B. Good	What is so great about the last 5 Miyazaki movies? I'd say not much. There's certainly a lot of good stuff, unparalleled animation, and more unparalleled animation. But once you get past the novelty of the weirdness, the strange creatures, what do you have? Not much. There isn't really much of a plot here. C'mon, to those who talk about the symbolism or the deeper meaning, do you really think you know what goes on in Miyazaki's mind? The guy keeps getting pulled out of retirement, maybe in there is some statement that he just wants to stay retired.And to those who say Miyazaki is their 7 year old's favorite director, c'mon! OK, maybe they like Totoro (and Barney), but don't let them see Spirited Away, otherwise they'll be so scared they'll end up sleeping in your bed until they're 13. His last 5 movies should never be allowed to be watched by any 7 year old by any responsible parent.Look at it this way, Miyazaki is only revered now because he's only done 1/2 dozen such movies, if he'd done 30 movies like this we'd all be yawning. People are highly rating this stuff because it's novel and chic to rate it high.Miyazaki cannot be pigeonholed. He doesn't want to be your kid's favorite director, nor does he want to be the chic director of the year only to be tossed like dirty laundry by the next Tom Cruise movie that comes out.This movie has serious animation, period. Miyazaki gets a 5 star for the breadth of his work. This movie gets a solid 3.	4.0	Wow, 600 people have reviewed this!	2006-06-06	15	0	15
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3OBBN3WRL28VZ	"John Scott Sutherland ""banterspiral"""	"i originally saw this film in the theatre.  i was amazed by the originality of the storyline and the visuals.  it was so refreshing to be in a non-western mindset for a change.  unfortunately, chihiro opened her mouth and out came ""lilo's"" voice.  as i listened more carefully, i suddenly heard ""meg"" on loan from hercules.  from this moment on in viewing the film, i became apprehensive; i kept waiting for a musical number.  don't get me wrong.  disney has made some of the most amazing musicals ever, in my opinion.  in the age of ashman/menken, they really knew what they were doing.  but watching 'spirited away' in the disney-dub version seemed wrong somehow, and musical numbers, which would be very ill-fitting to the style and magic of this particular film, could be felt lurking in the shadows though thankfully they never emerged.i think that miyazaki's work could be much more appreciated with subtitles.  there is a poetry to the japanese language that, while at times a bit 'fluffy' to read in subtitles, is much easier to take when read as opposed to hearing it spoken in an american accent.  (i wish i could explain this more clearly, but that's as close as i can get to it...sigh). ...that said, endure the american disney dub and allow the magic of spirited away to take you to places in animated movie-making that you may not have known existed.  it's delightful, intelligent, beautiful, and clearly made to be enjoyed by everyone in the audience as a MOVIE, which is why you won't see chihiro or any of her friends in a happy meal or at target--though i'm sure the disney store is already trying to work out a deal to take care of this.  sigh."	4.0	"5 stars, were it not ""disney-fied""..."	2003-03-28	21	10	11

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AA3EC3LKOBD80	Jonathan Cohen	"""Spirited Away"", the first Japanese anime movie to win both an Oscar and other worldwide awards, is also one of the most unique and beautifully made animated movies you'll ever see.The acknowledged masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's most successful director (animated or live) ever, it's a novel fantasy about the unusual and spiritual journey of a tiny, shy girl.Miyazaki, who draws, writes and oversees every single detail of this and his other films, always creates a small but strong girl as his central character. Chihiro, withdrawn and poker-faced, has that role here, as she wanders away from her suburban parents when they discover a lavish buffet in what looks to be an abandoned temple. Within minutes, she's swept inside by a mysterious, master-type boy named Haku and discovers a wondrous but creepy bathhouse crawling with strange spiritual creatures- a place where humans are not welcome. Inside, she encounters everything from tiny moving ash particles with eyes toa truly repulsive sludge monster emerging from a dirty tub. Chihiro also has her name stolen by Yubaba, the weird, wacky sorceress who runs the place, and must be known as ""Sen"" until she meets one test after another, the better to eventually escape and become a girl again. It's this journey that the movie centers on- not unlike a Japanese take on ""Alice In Wonderland"".But it's also much more.Unlike the average American animated feature, ""Spirited Away"" runs two hours, yet it unfolds like origami. The few human characters are drawn and speak like real, frightened kids, yet with dignity as well. The unusual spirits, resembling everything from mutant kabuki to- of all things- ""Looney Tunes""' Michigan J. Frog, usually don't speak yet say as much, if not more, as those gabby scare-factory things from ""Monsters Inc."" Miyazaki doesn't believe in drowning the screen- or the audience- in rat-a-tat dialogue; instead, he draws simple, family-minded morals in a most appealing, visually stunning way. He also has a gifted composer-conductor, Joe Hisaishi, who backs the movie with both his own meditative piano solos and some exotic, Martin Denny-style orchestration. The visual, character, and musical elements all meld into an atmosphere that's both simple and sophisticated,uniquely Japanese yet welcoming to all.For this American release, Disney took special care to keep the entire movie untouched yet create an English soundtrack that fit in perfectly- not an easy thing to do when dubbing over Japanese-speaking mouths. Two bonus features show this process quite well, a tribute to the fine work of both the couple who translated the Miyazaki script into clear English and the gifted voice cast. The best of the latter are Daveigh Chase (from ""Lilo and Stitch""), the youngster who captures Chihiro with the heartfelt shyness she was drawn with, and Suzanne Pleshette, who gave Yubaba- and her ""good witch"" sister- a charming, gravelly cackle that does Margaret Hamilton proud.There's also a documentary from Nippon TV (in Japanese with subtitles) that follows Miyazaki- an avuncular, chain-smoking patriarch- and his team of animators, sound men, musicians and actors as they create ""Spirited Away"" from the director's original sketchbook to the screen. Even with no English, the process at Ghibli is as fascinating as the movie itself- old-school, hand-drawn animation all the way with a distinct flavor, a wonderful craft in this computer-driven age.If, like me, you're a serious animation buff, or if you're younger and like classic Disney or ""Harry Potter"" but aren't sure about anime, or even if you like ""Lord of the Rings"" but won't go near a ""cartoon"", you'll really like ""Spirited Away""- truly a product of the magical mind of Miyazaki."	5.0	FROM THE MAGICAL MIND OF MIYAZAKI...	2006-03-26	0	0	0

Check out Naussica: Of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky, or even Howl's Moving Castle for better Miyazaki.That said, this movie is still better than just about anything produced by American animation in the past, well, ever.  If you're one of those people like me who grew up thinking that The Lion King was the standard for animation, then prepare to be amazed.This Academy Award winning film tells the story of a young girl who's family wanders into an abandoned amusement park that has be re-purpoused as a bath-house for shinto spirits.  Her parents are cursed for eating the spirit's food, and she spends the rest of the film trying to free them.Along the way she meets a colorful cast of characters and finds that the world is more full of wonder than could possibly be imagined in your philosophy.	4.0	Good, but not great	2007-02-20	7	2	5
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2AQ0YCTYN1L1J	Jonathan Walz	Spirited Away isn't the greatest movie of all time. That said, its shortcomings (namely the somewhat disjointed plot and abrupt transformation of the protagonist's personality) are inherent to most Miyazaki films and to fairy-tales in general. This doesn't concern many of us simply because Spirited Away isn't a movie about its story. It's a movie about a young girl's experiences in a magical world and how they teach her the courage necessary to live a fulfilling life. Even if you don't appreciate that, Spirited Away is more than worth watching for the gorgeous animation and the brilliant soundtrack (possibly my favorite film score ever), which are therapeutic to me in a way that little else is. One final note, I mildly recommend watching this movie subtitled. The dub, while far from terrible, isn't quite up to the quality of Howl's Moving Castle or other Disney releases of Studio Ghibli films. Mostly, though, I make this suggestion because some of the translated dialog also simply reads better than it speaks.	5.0	Delightful	2009-08-10	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AUS2EQT4NU3BF	"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner"""	"This overwhelmingly gorgeous animated feature from Hayao Miyazaki begins when an unhappy young girl, Chihiro, is moving with her parents to a new town.  Along the way, the family is drawn to a mysterious tunnel which leads to an exotic new world.  Spotting delicious-looking food on the table of an old restaurant, Chihiro's parents gobble it down gluttonously--and are transformed into squealing pigs.  A distraught Chihiro discovers that this new world is actually a haven for spirits and creatures and panics.  Then an enigmatic youth, Haku, informs her that she must take a job at the central bath house in order to break the curse on her parents.  But the bath house's greedy enchantress, the cackling witch Yubaba, isn't going to make things easy for her.  Fortunately, with the help of a spider-like boiler man, Kamaji, and a tough, yet secretly softhearted maiden named Lin, Chihiro might find the key to save her parents from becoming bacon.What is truly unique about SPIRITED AWAY is its acquisition of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2002.  It was a triumph that no one could have anticipated.  Hayao Miyazaki's films have been well-known for many years in Japan and by a small underground band of fans, but up until that time, not one animated feature made in Japan has achieved such an honorary award.  It's a wonder, too, because the film, despite receiving enthusiastic reviews from almost every critic across the board, was only playing in select theaters.  Yet acclaim was so strong that its success took everyone (including Disney, who nonetheless translated and released SPIRITED AWAY theatrically) by surprise.  Consequently, America is now receiving more exposure to Miyazaki's works through brand-new, professional translations from Disney.  If it weren't for SPIRITED AWAY's success, these films (owned by Disney for several years) probably never would have seen the light of day in America.That said, I feel that SPIRITED AWAY gets more ballyhooing and hype than it really deserves.  Don't get me wrong, I like the film and it certainly deserves the Oscar it won (not to mention my highest rating), but SPIRITED AWAY is NOT the ""mother of all Japanese animation"", nor is it the ""only Miyazaki movie worth watching.""  The reason I say this is because Miyazaki has made so many other wonderful movies in his lifetime that I feel it is unfair to single out one of his works as a standard for all animation.  Especially when there are other animated features which are every bit as worthy of the ""masterpiece"" status.Personal gripes aside, SPIRITED AWAY is worth watching for many reasons.  The animated atmosphere that Miyazaki creates literally springs to life with imagination and beauty--watching this movie is almost like watching Japanese art paintings moving.  The spirits who inhabit the world are a bizarre, yet appealing bunch--including a shadowy, white-masked specter called No Face, who reacts to how people treat him.  In addition to which there are lots of bravura sequences which really showcase how beautiful hand-drawn animation can be--my favorite of which is a surreal train journey across a pond of water.If Chihiro is sometimes a bit too whiney, then her supporting cast of co-stars provide for some interesting character development.  Haku, for example, appears to be calm and kind for the most part, but we soon learn that this is only one facet of his character--yet Chihiro seems to believe, no matter what anyone tells her, that Haku is indeed a good soul.  Likewise, Lin acts gruff and somewhat mean to Chihiro when they first meet, but she eventually comes to look after Chihiro like a parent.  Interestingly, while Yubaba may be greedy and selfish, she's not a one-dimensional villainess; one senses that she secretly admires Chihiro's determination yet won't admit it to herself.  Her twin sister, Zeniba, is the total opposite; she lives a simple, pleasant life in a humble cottage yet is totally content with her way of living--although it is hard to tell that at first because she initially appears vowing vengeance on Haku.  Characters as interesting as this has always been a trait of Miyazaki's productions, and arguably what ultimately gives SPIRITED AWAY its heart rather than its jawdroppingly gorgeous visuals... although the film's occasional shades of symbolism are a definite plus as well.It is also interesting to note that for the English language production of the movie, PIXAR guru John Lasseter oversaw the casting of the voices and the scripting.  His efforts, as well as director Kirk Wise and script writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt, are very commendable and pay off handsomely.  Of the voices Suzanne Pleshette stands out above the rest with her bang-on performance as Yubaba and Zeniba, and is well supported by Susan Egan (Lin), Jason Marsden (Haku), and David Ogden Stiers (Kamaji).However, I have two issues with the dub--the first of which is Daveigh Chase's voicing of the lead, Chihiro.  While she does an absolutely excellent job with her acting, her sometimes shrill screeching is a bit off-putting.  The second of these issues is another personal gripe; some folks act as though this is the only dub of the Disney-Ghibli English tracks that is worth watching and that the rest are inferior.  This is unjust; each of the Disney-Ghibli dubs have been special and different in their own way and to single one out over any of them just doesn't make sense.  As such, SPIRITED AWAY is not the ultimate Disney-Ghibli dub; it's yet another top-class dub.Disney's DVD release presents the movie in a stunning transfer as well as the English and Japanese audio tracks in 5.1 Surround Sound.  And, for a change, there are more extras; although one of them is tedious (an intro with John Lasseter), the others, (especially the Nippon TV special), are fabulous.All in all, while sometimes overhyped to an extreme these days, SPIRITED AWAY nonetheless qualifies as yet another Miyazaki treat."	5.0	Overrated, yet undeniably amazing artistic achievement from Miyazaki.	2003-03-09	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1A3BDZ7AJM640	Josh Miller	Disney for the past years, has botched the releases of Miyazaki movies. Princess Mononoke is a prime example of a botched Disney Release. But what most anti-dub anime purists don't realize is that, even though disney practically ignores this owned publishing right, when it comes to dubs they are excellent. The entire thing is very well casted an on par with the original japanese voice overs. Each voice fits the characer acurately. The Dubs story is also very well and acurately translated, my compliments to disney writers. Another smart move for disney was to keep the original Japanese track with which has created the movies original buzz. My only hope is that the purists would for once actually ...listen to the dub. As for the Subtitles they are a direct translation, and actually stray from the dub version a bit to acurately portray all the chinese mythology which didnt completely transition in the english version.The movie itself is worthy of an Academy Award. it tells the story of a young girl on a quest for in a words knowledge. She meets many allies as well as enemies along the way. The whole thing wraps this somewhat simple story into a more complex arc with the addition of classic oriental mythology. It uses a very well-done orchestral track by Joe Hisaishi, as well as the classic animation of Ghibli Studios to top of this excellent story. This is definately a must-have for any family, anime-fan, or people in search of the perfect movie.	5.0	Even The Purists should Be happy	2003-03-08	6	5	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	More than a good animation movie, &quot;Spirited away&quot; is a good movie, period. It's the fantastic story about Chihiro, a little girl that discovers a wonderful and fabled, yet dangerous, world, and her quest to go back unharmed to her own world. It seems to me unappropriate to try to tell something of the plot of the story here, because it would be inaccurate and, most of all, this movie is to be watched, not explained. It has to be watched because it's one of the most sensitive and immaginative works of fiction in recent years.My only complaint (a complaint to myself, of course) is that, while watching the movie, I felt I couldn't absorb (or fully understand) most of what I was seeing simply because I'm not that much acquainted with japanese culture. Every scene, every character, every situation, every color, every setting has an specific and aproppriate meaning, both within the story and within japanese culture, and that misterious aura was, to me, one of the best features of the film.Great entertainment, and well-deserved praises.Grade 9.3/10	5.0	Instant classic in animation	2003-12-23	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1GQW68O9NCLF9	J. Saenz	"Chihiro is a ""typical"" pre-teen that is moving with her parents to a new town. After taking some short cut they find a tunnel where ""the wind is blowing in"". The first thing that I noticed is that Chihiro doesn't want to go trough, but her parents have no problem going inside. They eventually find a deserted town alla Japan circa 1800's that only has restaurants. They find one with lots of food and her parents eat and eat. Again, Chihiro doesn't want to try the food. Everything happens with beautiful ambiance and incidental music by Joe Hisaishi.Chihiro wonders off and realizes that this town only comes to life at night. A boat arrives with lots of wonderful characters. This also caught my attention. The character design is completely original. This is a clear example of the cultural differences preset in the general direction of Miyazaki. For instance, look at Yubaba, the sorceress that owns the bath house that serves nearly ""8 million gods"". We all know that this design could hardly be ever approved in a American made animated film.During this part Chihiro is always afraid until she meets Haku, a 13 year old or so boy that takes her inside the bath house. Haku tells Chihiro to ask Kamaji, an old man with six long arms, for work. Kamaji operates the baths furnace. Kamaji does not have work for her and sends her to Yubaba. In Yubaba's office she meets three green-bald-bearded-bouncing heads. She signs a contract to work for Yubaba as a servant in the bath house and Yubaba literally takes her name and calls her Sen. To me this is a reflection on how one's profession sometimes takes hold of us. With her new job, Sen learns responsability and gains independence.On night a Stink God arrives to the baths. He brings his eye-opening hair-raising stink along and it's Sen's responsability to lead him in. She learns that it's not the stink outside what counts, but the junk inside, figuratively and literally speaking.More things happen. There's more characters and situations I won't mention here just in case you have not seen the movie yet. By the end of her journey Chihiro has changed. You can see it in her face. To me the whole experience is a look into her past, present and future life."	5.0	A wonderful metaphorical coming of age	2010-07-23	1	1	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2G90WQA7KTE1L	Just Some 16 year old	Spirited away, is most certainly the best animation i have seen, and quite possibly, the best movie aswell. No one other animation producer/directors can even hold a candle to Miyazaki. Miyazaki's films use about 100 animators hand drawing each frame of the film, the result is the inevitability of a magical, strange, and most certainly beautiful visual. Not only is the film a wonderful feast for the eyes, it is also a quite amazing story, which is a 12 course meal for the mind. You may think what does this sixteen year old know about good movies, and maybe i dont know anything, but i can give reference to other movies i would put at the top with Spirited Away:Donnie Darko, Happy Accidents, Office Space, Requium For A  Dream, and Pulf Fiction.I consider these all very good movies, and if you havent seen them you could consider them good rentals next time you take a trip to the movie rental place. Any way Spirited Away is definatly a great movie, and i am confused how anyone could say otherwise,even if 2 or 3 of the scenes gave their little four year old a shutter.	5.0	Nothing short of the best	2003-04-04	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1NUETFPRHFSE8	"Jw Heaton Armstrong ""jh_a"""	I went to see this in the cinema last night, and although the style was very much that of Japanese Anime, the plot means that this really doesn't matter. Miyazaki has filled this with wonderful and exciting characters, who are all multi-faceted.The central theme of the film is the emotional growth of a young girl. To begin with, she is the Japanese stereotype of a single child; weak, demanding and completely dependent on her parents. Throughout the film, she grows up to become effectively the strongest and most stoical figure among the characters of the story.What is particularly refreshing about the plot is that none of the characters conform to the way one as a westerner would stereotype them - whether that is the result of differing traditions in Japanese writing or simply the skill of the director do not really matter. The result is a film which works on many different levels and so will appeal to both children and adults alike.The reason I would reccomend this as a DVD is the splendid animation and story board drawing in it. It really is a feast for the eyes, and something that, if you are in any way interested in animation, you would defintitely want to come back to. Unlike regular anime, where all faces are based on a similar construct and use the same contortions for expressions, in this film the drawing of every character in some way describes them as an individual. Only the central character Chichiro / Sen displays the characteristics of regular anime figures, and this is actually very appropriate since she is the only one able to maintain consistently the her human identity.All in all a good film and one that I would watch again - Buy it!!	5.0	Not your usual anime	2004-04-09	3	1	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3P7XVY9H5VRRP	KACENAID	OK, I'm not one of the people that had the honor of seeing Spirited Away in it's original Japaneze language before the English dub release. But I definitely bought the DVD after seeing the English dub version. This is most definitely one of the finest animated films I've ever seen, and it's quite groundbreaking, along the lines of Snow White and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Being the most popular film of all time in Japan, Disney had a chance to get the film to a wide audience here in the states with the English dub theatrical release, and the film only opened in 26 theaters, and expanded to just 151. It's been treated as if it's a piece of junk, but it's truly a very fine film. They had a chance to have an easy home run, and they blew it. However, if you're lucky enough to catch this film in the theaters, it's really a wonder to behold, and definitely worth the buy on DVD. I myself already bought the Japan version and will very likely buy the US version when it comes out as well...it's that good.	5.0	5 for the film, 1 for Disney's marketing campaign	2002-11-11	4	3	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AWKP2OZY4WB8M	Kalika	Ok, funny title, I'll admit!!Miyazaki has to be the anime giant of all time. He is a God of anime. If you haven't seen any of his movies, drop everything at once, and go to the nearest video rental to get them.Spirited Away is the story of a little girl who finds herself in the land of the spirits. To save her parents, she must work at the bathhouse, owned by the sorceress Yubabba. Disney fans will recegnize some familiar voices in this movie. Chihiro is played by the voice actress of Lilo, in Lilo and Stitch, and Kamajii, the boiler man, was Belle's father in Beauty and the Beast.Typical of Miyazaki's movies, Spirited Away sucks you into the beautiful story before you even realize it. The scenes are gorgeous, the music whimsical, the characters realistic. This is a classic, one that can be watched by the whole family. Disney did a smart thing choosing to release these films in North America.This movie only gets a 4 out of 5 on my rating, because, though I loved it and have watched it repeatedly, it's not my favourite. Princess Mononoke is, an older movie, for an older audience. If I could have rated it as a 4.5, I would have.

And, kind, devoted sister that I am, I watched with him.Well, to say the least I was surprised. Although a little slow to capture my interest, Spirited Away proved to be interesting and unique. The main character was likable and interesting, and we watched as she matured from a scared little girl ( her entire dialogue throughout the first 20 minutes of the film is basically &quot;whine&quot; &quot;whimper&quot; and &quot;exclaim!&quot;) to a brave, mature little girl. Another plus was that Spirited Away didn't have the classic Disney ending, and in fact I thought the ending was bittersweet, something that doesn't often happen in children's movies.A unique plot, if not an especially well-developed one, and good supporting characters (especially Haku) help set this movie above other anime.	4.0	Not like other anime	2003-07-16	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3JAIZQ5RS064X	"Ken Miller ""kenmiller32"""	I finally saw SPIRITED AWAY.  What a fantastic and marvelous film it is.  The story is about Chihiro, a young girl who becomes lost in a surreal wonderland.  She must find inner and physical strength in order to save her parents and return to the natural world.Hiyao Miyazaki's film resembles Alice in Wonderland, as well as Terry Gilliam's film Brazil.  Of course it reminds a viewer of his earlier movies, like Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.  Amazing creatures appear and surprising scenarios arise throughout the movie, as we watch Chihiro evolve from a weak, spoiled brat into a strong, determined young girl, intent on saving herself and her family.The movie simply looks beautiful.  No Disney movie has ever looked this good.  I planned on watching it in two sittings, and found myself unable to tear myself away.  I think it suitable to all but the youngest viewers-- some of the magical creatures are gruesome and disgusting monsters-- perhaps too scary for the very young!I highly recommend SPIRITED AWAY.Ken32	5.0	I join the crowd	2003-10-28	4	2	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2DPM99KBSAR6	"Kevin Ferguson ""Kevin Ferguson"""	First things first - if you haven't heard or seen any of this director's work - Miyazaki - you are in for a real treat. His movies are always a delicate mix of fascinating artistry including colors, scenery and characters. The story in itself is amazing. It's a little Bizarre but seeing that this is based off of a Japanese book, some of the story gets lost in translation. In my opinion, it just means that its great to watch again and again. The voice cast in all of Miyazaki's movies are top notch, which helps give the characters that extra something making them all the more likable. All I can say is, this movie is absolutely amazing. It's freaky, it's funny, it's bizarre but beautiful. Even if you don't like Anime per say, whether its the look, the stereo types or whatever, don't judge a book by its cover - same goes for these movies. For one thing, they are backed by Disney, so they have to be quality - but these aren't your standard Disney Flicks. They are also highly praised by the producers at Pixar Studio's. Why? Because as said many times already, they are amazing - this movie in particular is a crown jewel. I won't go into the the story in this review, it's solely to let you know that this, and all of Miyazaki's movies are top notch and are just as memorable, incredible, and humorous for adults (if not more) than kids. See it, believe it - this is not to be missed.	5.0	So detailed, So Captivating, So Amazing	2013-08-19	0	0	0

The maturing and progression of Chihiro is tangible and real as she learns that action speaks louder than words. Struggling to free her parents, Chihiro stands out like a beacon amongst characters more concerned with their own wellbeing.Spirited Away is a truly special because it makes the impossible seem impossibly real. Experiencing childlike wonder as an adult is a rare experience, seemingly limited to this movie and little else.Animation, storytelling and Miyazaki at their very finest.	5.0	Overwhelmed by a Dream	2003-08-04	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1CD7WZDHD0XNT	Kevin Wilson	Spirited Away is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Hayao Miyazaki creates a world of amazing characters and imagery that when put together by a master of animation create an amazing film.A young girl named Chihiro is moving to a new home away from all her friends and her old life when her parents take a wrong turn and they all end up at a supposedly abandoned amusement park which is really a spa for Japanese Gods and spirits.  Unknowingly her parents eat too much and get turned into pigs.  Chihiro must get a job working at the spa in order to have her parents turned back into their human form again.It's tough to find a movie that can convey true emotion through it's characters, but Spirited Away pulls this off with flying colors.  By the end of the movie you feel as if you've known the characters in it forever and can truly relate to them and their emotions.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3G6XDKM530NK6	"""kevsdsu"""	I saw this new release at early April, since then, I've decided to put it into my personal DVD collection...As a long term Hayao Miyazaki fan, this new film didn't let me down; a warm humanity emits throughout the movie, the vivid protrait of every characters, well organized plots, mixed with exotic Japanese mythology, and universal understandable humours...the young girl's spirited away is the Japanese equivalent of ours &quot;Alice's wonderland&quot;.A good pick for adult audience, and even better choice for those who want to have imtimate, quality good times with their kids, a good material to teach kids to learn about integrity and good behaviors.For those who have extra budget allowance, you should consider put these titles into your collections:Excellent for kids (with cheerful aura, happy endings, and of course the nice humanity, and genius imaginations - trademarks of Miyazaki's films...)1. My neighbor Totoro,  2. Kiki's delivery service, 3. The castle in the sky.For adult or more matured audience: Grave of the Fireflies (an great anti-war epic, through the eyes of two Japanese kids-a boy and his young sister- at the close of the WW II with a sad, sad ending.)Trust me, these are masterpieces; and if I were you, I will choice original Japanese soundtracks with English captions. (of course,  this recommendation is for adult audience.)	5.0	Definitely another masterpiece from Hayao Miyazaki	2003-05-17	0	0	0

And I was very, very surprised to find out that a DVD from Amazon could be a bootleg. I filed a claim and returned this DVD.The movie itself is great; I've seen it a long time a go and wanted to have a copy, legitimate copy, for my collection. But this DVD is a bootleg copy. Here is why:1. The plastic wrapping stuck to the DVD case -- unprofessional2. The cover is not as vivid and detailed and does not match up to the images online -- this a bit harder to tell3. The disc, on the back side, bears the name of the film. Legitimate DVDs usually has a bar code and a serial.4. REAL DVDs will have commercials and advertisements and self-endorsements. This copy DVD goes straight to the movie.Plus, I'm willing to bet that the real DVD will play smoother and have higher quality.This may not be the fault of the seller, but just beware. Stick to Amazon's store if you care about these things. $20 some bucks for a bootleg is a big ripoff by the way.	3.0	Bootleg alert, beware!	2012-09-19	3	2	1

Hemphill ""oldtimer"""	My 8 and 12 year old are anime fans, but because of their age had rather been limited to Dragon Ball Z (so much anime is R-rated)and needless to say I haven't gotten interested in DBZ. But then we discovered Miyazaki! Spirited Away is even better than Princess Monokoke in my opinion - with a richer storyline and the artwork even more amazing. My kids and I still discuss the movie's themes of overcoming your fears, the power of love, that beauty and/or good can be found within almost anyone, etc. Yes, there are some scary parts (pig parents and No-Face)but I think any kid over 8 would be fine - and some younger (Lord of the Rings is MUCH scarier and certainly more violent). AND, this is absolutely a movie that you will love to watch with your child - in case they are scared, to discuss the sophisticated themes, and HECK just cause its a GREAT movie!

Well, here's one voice to say loud and clear that this emperor isn't wearing anything!! I had never really watched a full length anime feature before, though I always felt the human images were rather disturbingly robotic. Yet I was prepared for greatness after reading all the gushing reviews. What a disappointment! Yes, the animation is attractive and the characters visually original and bizarre. But the narrative is just so weak. One strange, disconnected  occurrence after another, some completely inexplicable (at least to the Western mind), odd gaps in logic and continuity, characters who switch pointlessly from brusque to warm, from irritable to hospitable. What in heaven's name is the point of it all? (I suppose you could also say there is no point to the string of adventures and characters that comprise Alice in Wonderland, but at least they are clever and funny, and the wordsmithing is a joy.) My 11-year-old daughter and I kept giggling at the dopiness and arbitrariness of ""Spirited Away"", and I nearly fell asleep as it dragged into the second hour. I don't recall this being a hit in the theaters, and I think its audience in the DVD arena will be limited to anime [fans].

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	A young girl, Chihiro, is sad over leaving her old home and friends when her parents move to a new town.  On their way to their new house Chihiro and her parents get lost and by accident find a temple of some sort.  They enter the temple, which has a tunnel that leads to a huge pasture and as the family walks around on the field to find a small town.  Their noses also  find a restaurant with tons of food waiting on the counters.  Chihiro is very hesitant to everything that her parents do, and she does not eat the food, which her parents gobble up.  It seems like there is something wrong which is confirmed when a mysterious young boy insists that she must leave in order to save herself.  Spirited Away is a wonderful film that deals with multiple issues that Chihiro faces through her adventure in the town.  These issues are left for the audience to ponder while traveling with Chihiro through this amazing journey.  The audience is left with a simply brilliant cinematic experience that offers high repeated viewing value.	5.0	Brilliant film for young as old...	2003-12-28	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A356TJCTCLDN89	Kimberley Wilson	The first rule of watching this movie is simple: Just because something is animated it doesn't mean it's always for kids. Spirited Away is best for adults and older teens. Little ones will be disturbed. The best way to describe is that it's sort of like Wizard of OZ without music and set in fantasy Japan with ugly monsters.Instead of just getting home to Kansas the heroine has to save her parents and then make it back to the world of humans.  Except for one moment of stupidity and greed that gets the show started there is nothing interesting about the parents. This is a pretty good idea because their blandness is a huge contrast from the spirit world that Sen must go to to save them.Sen is a spunky kid with a kind heart. She's brave, resourceful and eventually wins over the cranky employees of the spirit world bathhouse. The bathhouse is a vacation spot for some incredible creatures. The huge radish spirit, silent and semi nude but wearing a juanty hat, was a standout. I've never liked raishes and now I definitely don't want any.  Most of the creatures are grotesque. I mean really disgusting, really creepy and that's one reason why the little kids should be put to bed before you watch the movie. There's also a great deal of chunky  vomit all over the place.The villianess witch is fantastic. She's cruel, funny and ugly. She's that nasty teacher who made your fifth grade absolute hell. She's that spiteful old biddy down the street who used to threaten to call the police if you walked to close to her lawn. She's that babysitter who didn't let you watch TV and sent you to your room until your parents came back. In short, she's a classic childhood fear figure. The witch does have one virtue. She loves her giant baby and that will be a huge help to Sen and her quest.I liked Spirited Away but I did think it's way too long and the ending where Sen FINALLY leaves with her boring and ungrateful parents (because they have no memory of ever being pigs under a spell) is an emotional let down.	4.0	interesting	2006-03-19	5	1	4
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2DDM7V4HZX54V	"Kindle Customer ""media junkie"""	"""Spirited Away"" is the only Miyazaki film I've had the good fortune to see in the theaters. After winning an Academy Award, the movie enjoyed a re-run. I hadn't heard much about it, other than the occasional television ad, where even the briefest snippet of the film convinced me this was something I had to see.Sitting in the theater, I felt like a child. The animation is superlative. Every bit of color and texture jumps out at one. The care which which this film was made is absolutely astounding!Miyazaki's dream-like story follows a young girl, Chihiro, moving to a new town with her parents. Her father, on the way to their new home, mis-directs them, and the family finds themselves at a failed amusement park, where the parents decide to explore, much to Chihiro's dismay.After wandering a bit, the parents find a food stall filled to overflowing with freshly cooked delicacies. They tuck in immediately, but Chihiro won't have anything to do with it. As the sun sets, a startling thing happens, and Chihiro finds herself in a world populated by spirits. She alone can save her parents and return them - along with herself - to the world she is used to.Miyazaki's movies tend to have a dream-like quality to them, with the possible exception of ""Princess Mononoke"" (at least, the Miyazaki films I have seen so far). ""Spirited Away"" is definitely no exception, being the most dream-like of them all. While all the occurrences in the story don't always make sense in an everyday sort of way, Chihiro's experiences in the spirit world are easy enough to relate to.There is just so much going on in this film: Chihiro's sense of loneliness, the unpredictable nature of the spirits she meets, the different laws that apply to the spirit world. ""Spirited Away"" is an assault on the senses from start to finish.I highly recommend watching the film both in the dubbed English and then in the subtitled Japanese. The differences that the characters' tone of voice convey are delightful. This is most notable in the character of Yubaba, voiced beautifully in the English by Suzanne Pleshette (and by Nina Hagen in the German version....her daughter, Cosma Shiva, plays Lin, Chihiro's boss at the bathhouse).A must see for all fans of Miyazaki's work."	5.0	Miyazaki's Masterpiece	2004-09-26	5	4	1

There are at least a dozen wonderfully weird characters that just get weirder and weirder--one character more original than the one before.It's also the funniest animation I've seen. That little frog is unforgettably funny. Chihiro, the 10 year-old girl, is clumsy and cute. I fell in love with her.I hope Disney releases this film in America so everyone (and yes, you can take your kids to this one) can fall in love with it as I have.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2002-08-11	4	3	1

But when you press Play on the DVD you don't get opening credits, but instead John Lasseter - creator of Pixar Studios - laying it on a bit thick about how fortunate you are that Disney has brought you this wonderful film. Thanks, John. Just shut up and let's get on with the show.It certainly is a wonderful film. It's no surprise that the animation and storyline are fantastic - that's been well documented here. It is surprising that the rest of the experience - the voices and music - are so weak. They are too Western to fit well with the visuals, and I assume that's attributable to the Disney production team. (Another reviewer - &quot;from Seattle, WA USA&quot; - wrote more about this.) The one extra meta-feature that I watched was so self-congratulatory that I couldn't finish it. Yes, we all recognize that we owe the Disney Corporation a huge debt of gratitude for bringing us this masterpiece of animation. I'd like to get ahold of a non-Disnified version, though. Maybe I could give that one the full five star rating.	4.0	great, except...	2003-08-01	2	2	0

Like Sarah, Chihiro, initially sullen and refusing to accept change (a move to a new city), must rescue loved ones, in this case her parents, from a mysterious all-powerful magician and shape-shifter, the demon Yubaba (who would get along famously with Aku from ""Samurai Jack."")  Like Jareth in ""Labyrinth,"" Yubaba takes the form of a bird and seems obsessed with babies, in this case her own.  Chihiro must find a way to disenchant her parents after they eat the sacred offerings for the spirits and turn into pigs a la THE ODYSSEY.  While Chihiro's parents blithely muck about in the pigpen unaware that they may be turned into bacon, Chihiro gets work at the bathhouse with a boy named Haku and a girl named Lin, who makes Chihiro seem like Little Miss Sunshine.  Clearly, Yubaba's never heard of child labor laws.  She doesn't mind torturing frog- and slug-people who work at her ""high-class"" bathhouse for spirits and dmeons.  But Yubaba's own baby...ah, that's a different story.  But Yubaba's baby seems to like Chihiro...Chihiro doesn't know who to trust--the boiler-man Kamaji?  Lin?  Haku, who Lin says is ""Yubaba's henchman""?  Chihiro is forced to confront a world outside her own small existence, and in doing so releases the true beauty of her spirit, particularly when she helps the wounded Haku in dragon form.  ""What's going on here?"" Lin asks.  Kamaji replies, ""Something you wouldn't recognize.  It's called love.""  But even Lin begins to come around, scolding a mysterious spirit called No-Face: ""You lay one finger on that girl, you're in big trouble!""The visuals of the bathhouse transport the audience to a truly wondrous world.

Taylor	"After hearing a lot of hype about this from the media and friends alike, another friend and I drove the hour and a half trip to see this movie in a packed theater.I knew only the very basic plot and the beginning started innocently enough. About twenty minutes in I started going ""Huh?""As I've been studying Japanese for about three years, I am no stranger to their culture. There were several references I did get, though the rest could have been lost in translation with the pathetic dub. I haven't wanted to find a non-Disney subtitled version and see if it's actually as good as some people think.The story jumped erratically, and before you could understand the names of most of the supporting cast you were in a completely different scene. If they were reintroduced (and a lot weren't) you were left thinking, ""Oh, right, that's that girl...What's her name again?""It was an unmemorable experience and I found myself wishing for a watch to check the time. The rest of the audience seemed as glazed over as I did. I don't remember any particular parts where I or anyone eles laughed out loud and the only time that I think made me smile was that I could translate some of their names. (Even with the horrible accents. Lynn is certainly not the way you pronounce it!) I knew the money I paid for my classes was actually paying off.If you enjoyed this, then great. More power to you. But if you want something enjoyable to watch, I urge you to find other Ghibli/Miyazaki films. For kids, Kiki's Delivery Service or The Cat Returns is fun, and if you do want deeper films you need turn no further than Nausicaa, Princess Mononoke or Grave of Fireflies."	1.0	Apparently I'm not the only one who is confused.	2005-05-16	142	22	120

Miyazaki has now become a ""Living National Treasure"" for Japan. This film is The Winner at the Berlin Film Festival and the all time, top Grossing film in Japan. This has to be the pinnacle of achievement in a lifetime of producing masterworks. I can only pray Miyazaki Sama is well aware of this and will banish any thought of retirement.I watched the Japanese region 2 DVD in both Japanese and French with the English Subtitles.The Animation is wonderful, the facial expressions and body language of Chihero/Sen, are exceptional. The Color is outstanding, the scenery is as usual captivating. The music and sound track are wonderful. The ""camera work"" rivals Kurosawa's. The ""Sets"" are filled with astonishing detail; each re-viewing allowing new delightful discoveries, such as a framed picture in the cottage at the end of the film which is obviously ""Kiki"" in the style of a Whitman sampler box. (or the credits of the film Nausica) The film seems much shorter than it is, the dubbed version should be well tolerated by youngsters.The whole effect is Fanciful and should be amazing to all viewers; even Japanese have told me that the ""Bathhouse of the Gods "" looked strangely Korean to them. The inhabitants of the bathhouse however, look to be straight from Hokusai's Manga. You see? I am spellbound.Miyazaki has remained true to himself, this is again, a film which delights and warms the heart of both adults and children.BTW: The Male lead is a ""River Boy"" or Kappa, so well known, he is hardly viewed as mythological.Update/Edit: I have since viewed this Film at the Baxter Ave. CiniPlex in Louisville. This is a very nice ""Art House"" theater complex. Viewing Spirited Away in this theater was in itself a treat.Acting: I have to give credit to the voice acting for Chihiro and ""big sister"" Lin; it is very well done. I found the ""little girl"" voice of sen charming. The music was excellent, and matched the mood and action well for my sensibilities.  Viewing on a large screen was another treat. See if you can spot the zipper in the father's fly! Also watch Chihiro's fluid movements as she skips down the last three steps to the door of the Boiler room, and her movements on inside to see Kamaji, the boiler man.The name of the Bath House seems to be Abura-ya as stated over the main door. This, I am told, is a reference to old time places of entertainment identified by the paper oil lanterns hanging outside.The shops in the street have names ... one, passed by the ""stink monster"" is called ""Fairy Soup Counter"" The characters on the ground floor elevator door reads ""Upper"" the next one ""second heaven"" and the top floor reads ""Heaven""I viewed the film twice, once alone and then with my elevenyear old Niece; for full enjoyment always view a Miyazaki film with a child in accompaniment.DEVI****"	5.0	Spellbinding	2002-09-04	0	0	0

However, if you have a decent fansub, you'll probably be happier sticking with it and passing on the Disney version. The translation is not true to the original - I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and guess they had an inexperienced translator working on it. Better that than the alternative of purposely trying to dumb things down/be PC for the American audience. Words were dropped, nonexistent dialog was added and typos abound. The Japanese version ends with the American-version's cast list. I guess Disney figures Americans don't care about the real actors, even though the voices have more emotion than their English-speaking counterparts. Most of what's written here applies, as well, to Disney's two other recent Ghibli releases.

Spirited Away is the story of the young girl Chihiro, obviously (if you can read, you'd know this!), but she didn't turn out to be my favorite character.  It was Haku (especially in his dragon form!).  It's basically the story between 10 year old, whiny Chihiro who gets trapped in a spirit world and she ends up falling in love with the Kouhaku River (Haku). It teaches the value of friendship, courage, and hard work.  I was glad to learn that when Miyazaki-san (the creator) went to Disney and they said they wouldn't edit any of it out, it was a good thing to hear. I can't stand when producers do that--if the creator wanted those scenes out, he/she would've never put them in it! If you don't like seeing a little bit of blood, don't buy it! Miyazaki likes to emphasis blood in all of his anime that I've seen (this and Princess Mononoke). All in all, this anime is a good anime that many people are sure to enjoy (I'm 15 and I did, my sister-in-law is 20 and she did).	5.0	This is great and I'm glad I bought it!	2003-05-21	0	0	0

The literary reference is intended to emphasize the overwhelming creativity of creator Hayao Miyazaki (""Princess Mononoke,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle in the Sky"") and is not to suggest that this film is some sort of Japanese allegory of Lewis Carroll's surreal children's classic (not to say that you cannot find some intriguing parralels between the two). What I am and everybody else who makes this comparison is trying to convey to you is that the world to which 10-year-old Chirho (voiced by Rumi Hiiragi & Daveigh Chase) is as much a wonderland as what confronted Alice down the rabbit hole, even if it is just a bathhouse in this case.The story begins with a sullen Chirho moping about in the back of the family car as her parents take her to their new home in a new city. Then her father takes a fateful wrong turn and they discover what appears to be an abandoned theme park. But then her parents discover mountains of food, which they start greedily consuming. As Chirho explores the park things start to change and the spirits start to come out. Before she knows what has happened, her parents have been changed into pigs and Chirho finds herself in the land of the spirits. Her quest to rescue her parents and find her way home has begun.""Spirited Away"" is not as rich of a visual feast as some classic examples of anime such as ""Akira"" and ""Metropolis,"" in part because Miyazaki disdains resorting to computer animation in favor of traditional animated cels. Even if there is not the overwhelming visual display of these other films there is still the attention to detail. But ultimately the reason why this is the biggest money making film in the history of Japan is because of the story, which has almost as much emotional impact on the audience as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (that is a mondo compliment from my perspective because ""Grave"" is the one anime that I decided to own and not just rent, although I did buy a copy of ""Spirited Away"" for my daughter, so I can borrow it when I want). Consequently, it is not surprising that this film took over the top spot in Japanese history from ""Titanic,"" because they both combine emotional stories with compelling visuals. I waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD (What? An anime film come to the Zenith City? Are you joking?), and it was every bit as good as I could have ever hoped.The Japanese title ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" literally translates as ""The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro,"" which will make only partial sense to you after you see the film. I was not surprised that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, but I was surprised, and gratified, that it won. I have been wondering what the current state of animated art would be in the world today if they had started giving this particular Oscar out a decade earlier and anime like ""Akira,"" ""Metropolis,"" and ""Grave of the Fireflies"" were receiving wider attention if not flat out winning the award. ""Spirited Away"" is just the latest opportunity to open the door to the wonders of anime for an even wider audience."	5.0	Miyazaki's Oscar winning anime is every bit as wonderful as we heard that it was	2005-09-01	2	2	0

The animation is breathtaking, not with splashy razzle dazzle, but with the simple depiction of gentle ocean waves, or the way things look when submerged under shallow water while one moves over them, or the way a human face reacts and registers emotions.  Miyazaki's love for his craft shines through bright and  clear in this film.  Anyon, of any age, can enjoy this film.	5.0	Spirited Away	2003-01-01	1	1	0

I love anime, but can't quite understand why this one has become quite so popular.  The backline (with family) is a great story, but the whole spirit storyline gets very farfetched and downright creepy.

I love Disney but I hate that all their movies except for Mulan and Mulan and...forgot teach you that the man is your goal.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2K97HCY2OLW61	Lee Buchenau	"Spirited Away is another great Miyazaki film and has brought his name and his art to attention of the world. Disney's DVD release of the picture is an all around excellent DVD with some insightful extras.Personally I don't find Spirited Away to be the top of Miyazaki's game. I found Laputa, Nausicaa, Mononoke, and Kiki to be better works. Had Spirited Away been created by another artist I would have hailed higher, but Miyazaki has such a stunning catalogue that comparisons have to be made. The reason for my lower opinion of Spirited Away is the way Miyazaki's absolutely breathtaking and stunning imagination tends to overwhelm the narrative. Spirited Away is a masterpiece in visual design and is a truly one of a kind fantasy world, but the story didn't captivate me as much as other Miyazaki pictures. The grand narratives of Mononoke, Laputa, and Nausicaa dwarf Spirited Away while still thriving in the visual department. The simpler films: Kiki and Totoro captivated me more sucessfully on an emotional level then Spirited Away. Still the film is amazing, a wonder of animation, although I was a little bothered with a few uses of digital work for motion. Integration is still sketchy at this stage, but not as bad as in live action films. The movie is a marvel, but younger children might find some scenes a little disturbing. The dragon bleds alot leaving some heavy blood smears and the No Face eats some people and grossly vomits out brown liquid. When I saw it in the theater several young children started to cry and even as a college student found the scenes pretty intense for real young ones.Picture quality is excellent. A great tranfer that highlights Miyazaki's amazing animation. Colors didn't seem as bright as the Kiki DVD, but still a flawless print with stunning sharpness and color. Image is nn 2:0:1 to perserve aspect ratio and good for small tvs. Sound is excellent, the Japanese and English tracks are in 5.1. I only have stereo speakers so I can't say much on that. The English track is fine, but always go for the Japanese, although the ending song is in Japanese on both tracks. Making up for the problems on Kiki and Castle is an on the fly audio/subtitle change option. There is French too. Subtitles are yellow and in frame, good for 16x9 tvs, bad for small tvs because it covers up more of the image.Extras have the standard Lasseter intro, which starts if you change to Japanese and ""resume film"" even if you don't want it to play. The English production is documented in ""Art of Spirited Away"". It is a good documentary on the English production, shades of Disney specials. Worth watching for the explanation of the finger chop that Chihiro is given. The behind the microphone section is not interesting. The Japanese Trailers run back to back and give away most of the story. The highlight of the extras is the fabulous Nippon Special on the film. This Japanese documentary gives Miyazaki fans a dream come true, an indepth look at Miyazaki's creative process. We are actually taken into the studio for over half and hour to watch step by step how Miyazaki's team created Spirited Away. From planning to intensive drawing sessions, to recording voices and sound, to the story behind the stunning closing song, the documentary is a wonder. Anyone interested in the process of animation will be amazed at the limited resources Miyazaki has in comparison to American animators. The recording room is a converted movie theater without a soundproof window, so a laugh from a crew member will spoil a take. Miyazaki own dedication and involvement with every detail is made extremely clear with his late night working binges and supervision of everything. We even see him cook dinner for the team. The most fascinating aspect comes in the planning stage where Miyazaki can on the drop of a hat explain the every detail of a single real life movement or action that he wants in the film. Miyazaki is shocked when he discovers his team hasn't seen lizards fall from trees and haven't held open the jaws of a dog. He sighed and laments on the end of Japanese culture. The documentary is a true wonder and an absolute must for any Miyazaki fan. The second disc is the storyboard of the film with complete language tracks. It has what Castle in the Sky and Kiki didn't, an angle switch option with the animated film making it worth something.Spirited Away is a great animated film a stunning work of imagination and fantasy, but by my taste not Miyazaki's best. Disney's DVD release has the stunning picture and sound of all its Miyazaki release and fixes the angle switch and on the fly audio/subtitle problems in previous the dvds. The extras are amazing with a good English documentary and a fascinating and one of a kind Japanese documentary that takes you into Studio Ghibli to showcase Miyazaki's production process.The film I'd give 4 out of 5.The DVD 5 out of 5."	5.0	DVD Review	2003-12-28	3	2	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AH54XRMJZ5KCF	"""lee_scoresby"""	When I first got this movie I thought that it was going to be some kiddy movie (as it is a cartoon) but after watching this movie my opinion had been completly changed. This is one of my all-time favourites if not THE all-time favourite. The story to Spirited Away is the most original idea for a movie that I have ever seen, nothing can even begin to compare with it. The movie is about a girl named Chihiro who, with her mother and father are moving to a new home. they get lost along the way and discover an abandoned theme park. While Chihiro's parents eat the food at an abandoned restaurant Chihiro discovers a bath-house. When she returns to her parents they have been turned into pigs! So if Chihiro ever wants to see her parents in their normal state again she must get a job at the spirits bath-house. A place where spirits come to relax... If you're considering getting this movie I strongly suggest that you do.	5.0	Spirited Away	2003-05-06	0	0	0

To my disappointment,I really didn't think it was that engaging in terms of thestory and characters.  Sure it was creative (no-face, yubaba)but for me it just didn't drive the story at all.  Its about a two hour movie, but for me it felt more like 4 or 5 hours...it was THAT bad.  Anyway I really would not recommend thisto anyone who is a fan of Miyazaki's work or loves animebecause they'll probably be disappointed..big time.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1EEG7YJIYN60B	Lesley Aeschliman	Spirited Away is a film directed by renowned anime director Hayao Miyazaki.  This was a critically acclaimed film, and even won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.This coming-of-age story revolves around a spoiled 10-year-old girl named Chihiro.  She is unhappy about having to move to a new home and going to a new school.  While heading to their new home, the family takes a detour and end up in another world, one that is populated by spirits.  Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, and she must find a way to survive in that world until she can rescue her parents.  This is a very well-done story, and the animation is simply exquisite.This DVD release includes a documentary about the film, the Nippon television special about the making of the film, a storyboard-to-scene comparison, a short documentary about dubbing in the English voices, and a collection of the original Japanese trailers for the film.Spirited Away is an anime masterpiece, and it will definitely continue to be an anime classic well into the future.	4.0	A Miyazaki Masterpiece	2007-11-15	1	1	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A12GGY79HHE7TX	Levviathan	The first Anime movie I ever saw was Princess Mononoke, when my friend forced me to watch it at her tenth b-day sleepover.  I loved that so much, that when SPirited Away came out, I made my mom see it at the  first show that wasn't sold out-9:30 PM at the Pavilion in Prospect PArk.  I was completely blown away.This movie tells the story of an whiny, slightly spoiled girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase, Lilo and Stitch) who is extremely unhappy about moving to a new place.  On the way there, her father gets the family lost on a detour.  The family finds themself at the entrance to a tunnel. Upon walking through, the come out in a train station.  But when Chihiro's father follows his nose to an apparently abandoned but full concession stand at an abandoned amusement park, he and Chihiro's mother start stuffing their faces.  When Chihiro, apparently not hungry, goes to explore she meets a young man who warns her to go go back through the tunnel before it gets dark.  Then, when Chihiro returns to get her parents, she finds they have been horrifically transformed-into pigs!  Chihiro then goes to the same young man-Master Haku, for help.  She gets a job working in a bathhouse in the spirit world!  While there, Chihiro must use her own brilliance to outwit the wonderfully nasty witch, Yubaba who owns the bath house, defeat the clever, lonely monster, No-Face, and think back to her childhood to help haku find his name, all in a brilliantly crafty, beautifully drawn and voiced, and expertly told.Susan Egan does a remarkable job as Lin, Chihiro's (Sen)caretaker and advisor, while Jason Marsden ultimately brings life into Haku.  Suzanne Pleshette makes the devilish Yubaba and the motherly Zeniba seem real, while David Ogsen Stiers, voices the spider-like boiler man Kamaji.  But by far, the best voice in this film was that of Chihiro (Daveigh Chase)  her adorable, high pitched tone fits Chihiro perfectly.If you like anime, this film is a must-see.  Better by far than Princess Mononoke (even though that was really good)  By the way, if you think that Haku's voice sounds familiar, he sounds like Riku from Kingdom Hearts	5.0	Wicked cool Anime!	2003-12-13	8	7	1

The storyline is terrific and the animation is spectacular. Miyazaki intended for this film to be aimed towards young girls, but people of all ages and gender will surely fall in love with it.This movie is about a girl named Chihiro. She and her parents have just moved, and the story starts as the family is driving to their new home. However, Chihiro's father has taken a wrong turn and they up near this tunnel. Of course, they go through the tunnel and end up in this place. Little does she know, this is where Chihiro will experience the greatest adventure of her life. She will grow tremendously, from that little whiny girl to a courageous young woman.I highly recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. So go out and buy it!	5.0	spirited away	2003-06-19	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2AVSKPLMDEBJT	"LILyte Review ""Mercy"""	Hayao Miyazaki is the grand master when it comes to creating animation at its best. I love all of his movies but this one is truely his best work to date. I am not going to tell you what 'Spirited Away' is about since many reviews below has already gone thru that which is kinda bad since part of why this is such a great movie is the suspense as well as the breathtaking visual. His movies are much better than any other Disney counterpart that i have seen including Mulan. There is something about Spirited Away that goes beyond the norm when it comes to animation. It has a human aspect that you can relate to by seeing the reaction in the character faces and you know its not forced or contrived. Its feel so genuine that one cannot describe but enjoyed even long after one has seen it...myself included and i am a tough critic. Anyone who seen 'My Neighbor Totoro', also created by Miyazaki, knows what im talking. Powerful is the word that associate to this movie.Oh i have to warn you that his movies will make you cry and this one is a tear jerker for sure so have a box of tissues available for those touching moments cause you will need it as you journey into aa unforgettable place of enchantment.The musical score is beauty to my ears...i just close my eyes and enjoy.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	Released in 2001, Spirited Away has become an instant classic in animation, bringing classic anime to a much wider audience.In its roots, this is a classic coming-of-age story like thousands before it. A young girl begins the story afraid of her own shadow, cranky, timid and clingy. The family is moving to a new town and Chihiro doesn't like any of it. Her mother is clearly tired of this behavior and her father tries to push her into being stronger.Then, just as the girl feared, something went wrong. A little trip into a strange area suddenly has her parents turned into pigs, herself trapped in a servant's contract, and no sign of escape. She's put to hard work and sees no way of escaping. It's the opposite of the Wizard of Oz - instead of a gorgeous world where she has friends, she's a scullery maid with people snarling at every turn. And like in Pinocchio, it was their own boorish behavior that had the parents turn into farm animals.But slowly Chihiro realizes that things aren't as bad as she first though, once she gives it a fair try. Her fellow maids are actually quite friendly and helpful. The bathhouse in which she works appreciates the things she's able to do. The creatures and monsters that inhabit her new world, once quite fearsome to her, are now friends.Most especially, Chihiro is taken care of by a boy, Haku, who both works for the witch overlord of the bathhouse and also seems quite familiar to Chihiro. As the story moves along, Chihiro matures quite a bit, of course. The whole story is about her growing and learning and discovering her strengths. Her friends band together to help her out, and the requisite happy ending results.I understand why this is the highest grossing movie in Japanese history, and also why it was nominated for an Academy award. The general tale is one all people can relate to - the difficulties of change when you're a child, the wonder and strength that comes from realizing you can overcome those difficulties. The characters all have dimension - there aren't &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;. Characters start out harsh and annoying, but you get to like them when you get to know them. Even the 'mean' characters have understandable reasons for being that way.And yet, despite being an avid student of the Japanese culture and understanding a lot of the underlying themes, the movie just wasn't quite &quot;finished&quot;. Themes were started and not completed. Things mentioned with importance are later forgotten. There are characters that she meets for 5 minutes and is petrified of, and others that she knows for 8 minutes and is crying when she leaves them. Her roller-coaster emotions are inconsistant, even as she is maturing.The same is seen in the animation. There were many sequences in the animation where it became jerky and rough. Yes, some scenes (the entrance to the boss' office for one) obviously were labors of love, with exquisite detail. But there were other scenes that should have been breathtaking - the dragon flying near the end, for example - that looked clumsy. And then only a few moments later, the two faces as they fell were again extremely well done. It's as if someone chose key parts that had to stand out, and really worked on those - but left the other scenes to middlemen. When I hold the animation of Spirited Away up to many of my other favorite animated classics, I'm afraid that Spirited Away just isn't as consistant or smooth across the film.Also, with the theme being so timeless, I'm afraid that much of the movie was incredibly predictable. Even one of the key secrets wasn't much of a great moment when it was revealed, because there was no 'story meaning' to it. I won't give away the ending section, but while much of the middle of the movie sung with innovations and interesting, fascinating twists, at the end it dissoved back down into just about every other coming-of-age story written, and some extremely tired cliches finish the movie off. I truly felt let down.It sort of indicates the general tone of the movie when my favorite scene here doesn't hold a candle to my favorite scenes in other animated classics, either from a drawing, a plot, or a character point of view. It was simply funny. It was the soot-dust scene, where Chihiro has first entered the scary bathhouse. She sees a poor little soot-dust creature struggling to carry a lump of coal, and it gets crushed by the coal. Aghast, she tries to help out the creature by lifting its coal lump and then carries the coal herself to the furnace.The other soot creatures all crowd around her and it almost appears they're thanking her for saving their friend. One of the soot creatures lifts his own lump above his head ... and then THUMP, he drops it on himself, wiggling his little arms and legs and shrieking for help. Suddenly every little soot creature is dropping its coal on its head, hoping to get out of some work. It had me hooting in laughter.So in the end, while other aspects of the movie were lovely but not excellent, I loved Spirited Away for those little spots of laughter in the story. Those little details are where it shone.	5.0	Great humor for all ages	2003-06-02	6	3	3

I laughed out loud when I heard him say that.  But you know what?  He's right.Young Chihiro wanders into an alternate world where her parents are turned into pigs and she must save them.  Does this sound ridiculous?  Yes, and in fact, the person I watched it with read the synopsis and said, Do I really want to see this?  He was very hesitant.  (And the cheesy guy at the beginning telling us how lucky we were added to the pressure...)  But it was fantastic.  The story is beautiful and moving, the animation incredible.I've since watched some other Miyazaki movies and not been quite so in love with them.  As far as I can tell, this is his masterpiece.I wouldn't show it to a young child though.  Even though it's animated, the story is quite complicated and the monsters can be pretty scary.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	This film is my second favorite movie.  Director Hayao Miyazake has truly reached his zenith with this classic.  Whether you are an anime/animated film fan or not, this film will stir parts of your heart you thought were long jaded.  It is enchanting and enthralling.  There are important lessons about love, courage, and respect for nature, for people of any age.  Chihiro, a typical ten year-old girl, is riding with her parents to their new home.  She is pouting in the backseat.  The parents are sidetracked and the family gets lost in the spirit world.  Her parents are turned into swine.  Chihiro must find a way to set her parents free from the spell.Spirited Away made more money than the Titanic in Japan.  That goes to show how Japanese people were moved by this tribute to their culture. I saw this film twice with a Japanese friend, once with subtitles, once in English.  The dubbed version is just as good as the subtitled one.There are certain aspects of Japanese culture one should know in order to fully appreciate this movie.  The bathhouse Chihiro is employed in is for the kami, or gods, to rest and rejuvenate in.  Bathing is an important part of Japanese culture, much more than it is in the U.S.  Japanese Shinto beliefs believe there is a spirit in everything in nature.  So trooping into the bathhouse and relaxing in the hot tubs are all kinds of spirits: chick kami, radish kami, and many more I couldn't make out.  Spirited Away seeks to point out that though Japan is an ultra-modern culture, it is also ancient, with deep roots in the spiritual world that although Japanese may forget, the spirits remember you.  Anyone from any culture can relate to this movie.  Unfortunately, disrespect of nature is present in all cultures of the Western world.But, as this film shows, nature has a way of finding YOU.	5.0	Spirited Away recaptures lost magic of childhood	2004-05-25	2	1	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"When you allow your imagination free reign the creation that comes from it can be startling and so bizarre that it takes time for your brain to realign itself to the created reality.  ""Spirited Away"" is a fantastic vision of a world close to ours, and yet invisible to our eye, reached only by a portal lost and forgotten.  Spirits served by a host of creatures, including witches, all out to make a living, inhabit this world.  This world has its own set of rules and past, with sufficient familiarity with our world that you are not completely lost.Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new home.  As with many children her age, Chihiro is not especially happy to be moving away from her friends and the home she has always known.  When her father takes a wrong turn and encounters a mysterious building in the deep woods, Chihiro is immediately afraid and tries to warn her parents that they should turn around.  Her father and mother press on through the building, believing they have entered an abandoned theme park.  When they enter an area filled with restaurants and discover no one around, they pig out to the point where they pork out.As night falls, Chihiro discovers that she is trapped in this world.  The intervention of Haku saves her life and enables her to survive in this new world.  As Chihiro befriends those she encounters a number of characters in this world come to love and help her in her goal of turning her parents back to people and escaping back to the world she knows.The world Hiyao Miyazaki has created is a fantastic alternate reality.  There are demons that eat beings whole.  There are bizarre spirit creatures whose purpose can not be guessed, and yet intuitively you have some vague idea of what that purpose might be.  There are talking frogs and a giant baby.  There are bouncing heads with minimal intelligence.  There is an incredible, beautiful and fragile dragon.  There is a pair of witches, sisters, whose motivations are typically difficult to understand.The vision of this movie ranks with the best animation I have ever seen.  This movie became the highest grossing film in Japanese history, and for good reason.  Few movies have attempted and been successful at achieving the scope of this movie.  A required film for fantasy film buffs."	5.0	Brilliant Fantasy Animation	2003-11-20	2	0	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1DMSKBLQTIFH6	Lorraine M. Smith	"When the movie released at the Japanese theater years ago, it broke chart records and won awards. We know a masterpiece when we see one. I still enjoy this film after eight times of viewing.Chihiro and her parents were moving, on the way Chihiro's father was drawn by curiosity towards a mysterious cave, which leads (on the other side) to Chihiro's adventure. Her parents turned into pigs by eating the food meant for others, and to rescue them, Chihiro gets guided by Haku to find a job at the Onsen (Hot Spring) hotel.This movie is not only an entertainment about Chihiro (or ""Sen"", ""Chi""'s other Japanese pronounciation)'s adventure, but it also has educational means. At first all we see are monsters, (Notice Yubaba's three grotesque green head heplers?) but behind that, we take in from this film most naturally, that you have to work hard to get to a decent place. And, the memorable period when Chihiro pulled the bicycle out of the River God to release all the trash people have been dumping inside him, it cries out for saving our enviornment. Oh, and if you eat like pigs, you'll really become pigs.This film is so good, I still want to watch it. By her kind heart, Chihiro befriends all people, rescues Haku, and helps him find out his real name. Chihiro remembers herself, through her short period in the enchanted land she still does. The ending is happy, she gets to go back to her own world. If Chihiro wasn't sorry to leave the world at the end of the cave, I sure was!!! There is so much to the ending! Thus is Chihiro's spiritual adventure. Enjoy Spirited Away!"	5.0	Best Miyazaki, Definitely!	2006-04-16	4	2	2

If you can willingly suspend your disbelief, the strange and wonderful things that the young heroine encounters in the spirit world are unbelievably cool: There's a weird old man who works ceaselessly in a boiler room with his hundreds of legs; an entire flock of fluttering paper birds; and an endless parade of ""spirits"" of every type. There is a small problem, though, which prevents me from giving Spirited Away a perfect score: a lot of things don't make much sense. Some loose ends are never tied up, and some story elements are never explained. Overall, watching this feels like having a really good dream; you'll get wrapped up in its wonder, but you awake a bit disoriented."	4.0	Gorgeous, exciting, and...confusing	2005-06-14	5	1	4
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A29O6OINLR1W1W	maisa	I've been a fan of Miyazaki films long before I became a fan of Japanese animation. Miyazaki always seems to be able to tap into the themes we all recognize and while weaving into it surprise and the sense of the fantastic, grounds it firmly in the way life really works.When Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) came out in 2000 and blew me away, it seemed to be the culmination of all the excellent work Studio Ghibli had come out with over the years, such as My Neighbor Totoro, and Nausicaa, Valley of the Wind, seamlessly merging new technology with traditional animation methods and of course, a wonderful, haunting soundtrack. I was wondering how long it would be til the next Miyazaki masterpiece came out, and how it would up the ante again on animated features and storytelling.This year Miyazaki pulls through again with his gift of adding truth to fiction in the way he really cares about how little girls really behave, and gives many of his characters unique subtle mannerisms that round them out and make them much more real to us. However he also breaks the Ghibli heroine's mold with 10-year old Chihiro, who is pouty, whiny, scared and having difficulty adjusting to moving to a new place.  Not a tough, self-sufficient girl like Nausicaa, or San from Mononoke Hime, nor is she sweet or pretty like Sheeta in Castle in the Sky.However. Miyazaki proves to us that even snub-nosed, spoiled 10-year old girls can grow up to be rather likeable people, and Chihiro, despite the odds, manages to wade through her fears and selfishness to come out much wiser and a little less selfish and afraid in the end.  While it seems nothing else has changed and life goes on, Chihiro keeps for herself the gifts she gets from the experience, even if no one else knows about Yubaba, the bath house, or Haku.I believe it's worth getting the DVD because apart from the merits of the film itself, the DVD allows us to look into the work that went into the creation of Spirited Away inside both Disney and Studio Ghibli, from the English Dubbing to the sleepless nights the animation crew worked through to meet their deadline, to the creation of the soundtrack.  Disney did a good job dubbing this film in English but I am particularly grateful for the fact that they added in the option to watch the film in the original Japanese track with English subtitles.	5.0	excellent output from Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli	2003-04-29	3	3	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	Historically I've had a bit of a hard time digesting Japanese anime movies. At times I can't quite make what it is they're trying to convey, with a whole mithology and a world of its own that I have a hard time relating with. Therefore, though I'd only heard great things said about &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (and read about the many awards it had won) I was still worried that it'd have that I-don't-know-what that had characterized most animes I'd seen.I was gladly surprised, and fortunately I was wrong. With its exquisite art direction and brilliant storyline, this animated movie falls in a category somewhere between &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The similarity to &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; is because of the fantastic elements (actually there's a dragon, not unlike the eighties' classic!), the story of a brave little kid (a girl, Chihiro, in this case) battling courageously, though is somewhat more &quot;terrestrial&quot; conditions (working hard in bathhouse to to maintain her integrity, and be able to save her parents) and the abundance of spells and magic in the story. As for the parallel I see with &quot;The Matrix&quot;, it has to do with the parallel &quot;world&quot; in which the spirits of the movie inhabit, by night: a supra-world, you might call it; one where they rule and admit no actual humans (I guess it's not the best comparison, but you get the idea... I hope!)The movie as a whole is not a typical Sunday afternoon popcorn-in-the-couch flic: it is a story that departs from conventions. But it constantly rewars you with a clever and adorable storyline that is not short of funny moments. In the end, you get a very refreshing feeling deep inside. I, for one, have become very interested in Miyasaki's work. Will continue to check out his other movies.	5.0	Exquisite art direction and brilliant storyline	2003-11-09	5	3	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	In yet another proof of Hiyao Miyazaki's genius at anime and story telling, the director creates a story written about one 10 year old for yet another, and demonstrates that we all are never immune to stories that come from the heart.  The story is layered, ostensibly the tale of young Chihiro, a whining, self-centered girl who finds herself catapulted into a magical world where her parents are turned into pigs.  However, Chihiro demonstrates she is far more than a clumsy unpleasant child, as events bring her into contact with the denizens of the spirit bathhouse where she must work until she can free her parents.From everyone she meets, Haku the dragon magician, Lin the serving woman,  terrifying Yubaba, and all the others Chihiro discovers part of an important lesson in the value of determination and love.  Even from No Face, a lonely spirit who causes chaos, even though he really only wants to be cared about, there is much to absorb.  Funny, sad, frightening, and encouraging, the experience is something akin to looking into a chest full of gems.  Chihiro passes her tests, and the girl who walks away from the bathhouse is miles away from the one who arrived.One of the remarkable things about 'Spirited Away' is that Hiyao Miyazaki has chosen to go well beyond the constraints of Japanese mythology is a setting where one would expect stories straight out of the Kojiki legends.  Instead, he spins out of universal cloth, borrowing from the stories of many heritages.  Right at the beginning, the magic that entraps Chihiro's parents echoes stories of human trips to Faerie, where on is ordered to 'never eat the food.'  Even more precious are his outright inventions such as No Face, Miyazaki's stand-in for himself.  Thus, the mythic appeal of the film touches roots everywhere, explaining much of its appeal.On watching the film for the second time, I spent some time with the pause button studying the individual frames.  When you are moving with the action, it is difficult to pay attention to the artistic particulars.  When these stand revealed, the film's beauty is undeniable - thousands of frames of artistic gems.  Myazaki is known for his tight artistic control of all factors of production and his use of talented people.  'Spirited Away' sets a higher standard and never falls away from it.  It is no surprise that Walt Disney Studios went to great lengths to get the US rights for Miyazaki's films.  If you watch this once, be prepared to watch it many times.  If we are lucky, perhaps it will be 'Always with Us.'	5.0	&quot;Itsumo Nando-Demo&quot;	2003-05-23	4	3	1

This film is brilliant in so many ways that it leaves me speechless when I try to mull over it. The art direction is fanciful and elegant, such that you feel totally engrossed in Chihiro's fantastic world. The landscapes are portrayed beautifully and they enchantingly compliment the nature of the scenes they are juxtaposing. The music is utterly fantastic as well; just listen to One Summer's Day and you'll see what I'm talking about. The soundtrack only helps to pull you into the world that Hayao Miyazaki has created. And lastly.. the characters are all captivating and charming in their own unique ways. From the stout frog employees of the bath house who are constantly filled with urgency to the body-less shadowy masked figure No-Face, every character has something to contribute to the story.I'm not even going to touch on the plot, because it is so amazing and unbelievable that it can't be accurately described in words.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1O80O69LI4Q51	MarkS	"I noticed there're so many reviews here for my favorite, and want to add the one of mine.Though I'm a Japanese, I think English version is much better than Japanese. Some says there is a bit misleading in English version. I agree there're some ""differences"", but these are not misleading. For example, in the last scene, Chihiro says ""Deal is a deal"" to Yubaba and receives the final test. In Japanese version, Chihiro says that she heard from Haku and understands there's some strict rule to remove a curse on her parents so she will receive the final test. That's quite different. However, I love English interpretation. If the world of English version is unified and active as art, it is natural to accept such differences. English version is the original art instance/object created from the same art ""class"", from that Japanese instance was created. Each instance has the different original art fulfillment. English voices by Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden and all other actresses and actors are great! I have to say I'm a little disappointed by Japanese version at this point. And I'm sorry I cannot understand French though this DVD includes French instance.I'd like to call attentions that Lewis Carroll's Alice lives in Spirited Away. There is a cultural tradition in Japan that has received this great art in UK since Kenji Miyazawa expressed Alice's impact into his literature published in 1924. In 1970s and 80s, Alice was discussed enthusiastically in Japan with the relationship in tradition of UK; Shakespeare to John Lennon and with the context of cultural anthropology. I'm sure that Hayao Miyazaki had been in this cultural movement in those days in Japan.I watched and enjoyed this movie more than about 50 times now, and I will still continue this experience a little more. Don't worry, that's my normal attitude to the favorite movies of DVD and video. In these experiences, I had been keeping one question in my mind. It is Chihiro's traveling scene in the mysterious train like Kenji Miyazawa's ""Night on the Galactic Railroad"". People in the train are all no-face except Chihiro's group. I was wondering why. There's no explanation from the author. And then, I noticed ""No-Face"" of Chihiro's group is the same kind as the other no-face people in the train. Then I realized that no-face people are not spirits or gods like guests in the spa house, but human. Both of the human and spirits worlds shares this train. From spirits side, human looks like shadow. Chihiro stopped changing to the shadow with the help of Haku in the first scene, by the way. And finally I discovered No-Face, an important character in this movie, is a monster and also a symbol of human. That's a wonderful art expression and message. I think I will still discover something new for me by continuing to enjoy Spirited Away. It's really a very rich movie."	5.0	No-face people in the train	2006-02-04	3	2	1

Details on the plot have already been discussed elsewhere so I won't go into the story. All I wanna say is the animation is gorgeous, so rich in detail that you can pick up new things each time you see it. The characters are believable and charismatic (even the so-called ""villain"") because they aren't devided into good and bad but rather one great big colorful mass of interesting creatures each with their own motives and personality traits. And all these elements come together to form one of the most insanely charming fairytales ever. It feels a bit like Alice in wonderland (the book) and I guess parents should be warned that some scenes are a bit intense, but some truly important and valuable moral lessons are discretely spread around along the way, so I believe that this film is a great and healthy experience that children everywhere should be able to enjoy.

From children learning to be polite, to adults respecting private property, and youth's need to overcome their fears and take responsibility for themselves and others.  The plot can be confusing, but take the time to get into it and it will make sense.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ	maskedgamer	"Spirited Away is one of those films that's targeted at people who have no idea what a great anime should look like. They confuse good animation, with a few cultural references, and complete lack of direction and plot development with a masterpiece. Spirited Away has received rave reviews by just about everyone that doesn't watch Anime on a normal basis. Being someone that enjoys watching Japanese animation there are two things that I look for an any piece of work that I view. The first thing would be a well developed plot, and the second being well developed characters (good artwork doesn't make a great movie so it's a throw away). Spirited Away has neither of those two. It's simply weird scenario after weird scenario. If there is a way that any of the events are to have a deep symbolic meaning, or were meant to connect somehow it is lost. The target audience for this film is young children. I would not show a movie of this nature to anyone under the age of 18. That is the legal age of comprehension for this film (if there is anything to make sense of about it). It somewhat has that feeling of Alice in wonderland, but unlike Alice's adventure this film isn't always clear as of the direction it's going in or what each characters purpose is. The movie starts out going somewhere then goes absolutely no where. If the purpose of this animation was to be as abstract and confusing as possible Miyazaki has succeeded. I have viewed many abstract and out of the ordinary animes, but those are always mirrored by an intricate story line and a deep underlying meaning that in the end actually makes its awkwardness sensible. That is what makes a great anime feature. I know many people place this movie on a pedestal, but those same people have very limited knowledge about what great anime is. For its art style Spirited Away is great, however like I said earlier great art does not necessarily make a great film. I wish I could feel as passionate about this film the way other people do, but there is absolutely nothing to be passionate about. If your looking for a fairytale with a dark atmosphere with an abstractness that actually makes sense I highly recommend ""Pan's Labyrinth"". It's sophisticated, beautiful, clever, has left many critics clapping, and deserves every word of praise it receives, because that is was a masterpiece is. Spirited Away...is best used to describe the developers behind this anime.I give this film 1 star. Because beauty does not hide the beast that this story truly is."	1.0	"Go watch ""Pan's Labyrinth"" if you want a masterpiece!"	2009-07-31	77	7	70

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"""Spirited Away"" won the Oscar for 2002's Best Animated Film. It richly deserved this award, for it is by far the best movie of its type in years. It may not be funny like `Monsters Inc."" or entertaining like ""Shrek"", but for sheer beauty and artistic integrity, it's almost impossible to top. Since words, like any other medium, have built-in limits, you will have to experience it for yourself to see what I am saying.Imagine this: A little girl is riding in a car with her parents. They are headed to their new house. Dad makes a wrong turn, and they wind up traveling along a dirt road which ends at what appears to be a deserted train station. Dad decides that it's really the entrance to a failed amusement park. He and Mom decide to go exploring, and the little girl, filled with trepidation, has no choice but to go along. After awhile, the little family discovers a restaurant that is still operating. The parents gorge themselves until they are turned into pigs. Suddenly alone, the child finds herself in a place full of witches, ghosts, goblins and other assorted spirits. Aided only by an unearthly boy, she must now save her parents and find her way out of this surreal place.The movie was made in Japan by animation master Hayao Miyazaki and his crew. It became the highest grossing movie of all time in that country. The people at Disney bought the American rights and lovingly added an excellent English soundtrack. The company's marketing department apparently was at a loss as to how to sell such an unusual animated movie. It was seen by relatively few Americans in theaters. I suspect that this masterpiece will find its audience here via video and DVD."	5.0	An incredible animated movie	2003-04-20	1	1	0

Miyazaki consistently delivers the most beautifully animated and written stories you can imagine.  To me, Spirited Away is his masterpiece.  Full of heart and warmth while mixing in a little bit of suspense and humor, Spirited Away manages to capture your interest immediately and never let go.  What can I say about the DVD itself.  It's a dvd.  Quality transfer with good sound and a decent amount of extras.  Since I have no idea if we'll ever see it on Blu-Ray I decided to get the dvd while I still could.  Definitely worth purchasing and watching over and over again.	5.0	Great alternative to Disney/Pixar films	2013-05-22	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A14ZCJDY5MK3XT	Matthew Kuemmerlein	Spirited Away is a delightful movie about a fantastic world and a lazy little girl who gets her first job in a bathhouse for spirits. Hiyao Miyazaki, praised as the Walt Disney of Japan, has created a wonderful story, rich with  magical logic and unforgettable characters, that is sure to please younger and older viewers, and told it through hand-drawn animation abounding with loving detail and living backgrounds.Chihiro starts the movie as a listless girl lazing in the backseat of her parents' car as they move to the Japanese countryside. A shortcut through the woods brings them to a decaying theme park that mysteriously draws them in and leads them to a market stall laden with platters of delicious food, where her parents gorge themselves and turn into pigs. Chihiro ends up employed at a majestic bathhouse, run by a greedy old witch named Yubaba, where spirits come to refresh themselves. She makes friends with a dragon boy named Haku, a six-armed boiler room operator, and a mess of soot balls (remember these from My Neighbor Totoro) while figuring out a way to save her parents and return home. In the course of this, she discovers that she's a tough, resourceful little girl.Every plot development in Spirited Away is a surprise, and the characters are more subtly drawn than the characters in a Disney feature. Yubaba's a nasty witch, but first she is the strict boss of the bathhouse. The monster No-Face can be destructive, but is shy and awkward in his crush on Chihiro.. Haku is a good person, contrary to what the employees say, but is mixed up with Yubaba, which complicates things. The Japanese feel of the movie, in the beautiful styles and textures, kimonos, bowing, and disgusted faces characters make when something icky or smelly enters the scene, also contributes to the Spirited Away experience. The soundtrack is a treat too, especially the melancholy music that plays during the dreamlike sequence when Chihiro rides the train off into the horizon formed by the sea and the sky.Spirited Away is a lot of fun and has real heart. Regardless of whether animated movies are your thing or not, you will enjoy this one.	5.0	highly recommended	2009-11-02	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2F8R40Z2OMIJM	"Matt Howe ""outloud98"""	"I'd heard all the buzz surrounding SPIRITED AWAY and finally got around to watching it this weekend.Wow.Miyazaki, Japan's animated film auteur, has created a film with a new, amazing vision -- coupled with an ageless story.Young Chihiro is a timid, scared girl. When her family explores an abandoned theme park, Chihiro is magically ""spirited away"" to another realm where gods, monsters and spirits live. A mysterious character named Haku befriends her and teaches her the ropes of this new spirit world. Soon, Chihiro is working in Yubaba's bath house -- a spa for the gods! All along, though, she just wants to see her parents again and return to the human world (""there's no place like home""). Chihiro, like Dorothy (Oz) or Frodo (Rings), must learn to find her strength and courage and does so by telling the truth, doing kind acts, and, ultimately, following her heart.As an American, used to seeing the Disney films, SPIRITED AWAY's style is at first a little different. The animation is not fluid and realistic like Disney. However, the colors, direction, and story-telling transport you into Miyazaki's world. Some of the images are downright surrealistic -- oversized chicks, bouncing heads, the ""stink monster"". Miyazaki's imagination never ceases to impress and entertain. Some of his creative ideas are very funny, as well (Yubaba's baby!).I'm an adult and enjoyed SPIRITED AWAY very much. I couldn't see anything in the film that would be offensive to young kids or families. Some of the film might be scary to them -- but, heck, so is THE WIZARD OF OZ (flying monkeys! Ahh!).By the way, I watched SPIRITED AWAY with its original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.  Knowing that the film originated in Japan made me not want to hear the dubbed American voices and translation.  The subtitles allowed me to hear the film in its original language.  Of course, the DVD provides both options, so to each his own!Mostly, though, SPIRITED AWAY has an amazing new vision that I'd never seen before.

The animation is better than Princess Mononoke, but I think it falls short in terms of action.You can read the plot synopsis anywhere. A girl gets trapped in a magical land after moving and such. For those of you who haven't seen it... Don't expect an action movie like Princess Mononoke. This movie barely has any action(mabye a dragon scene for 2 seconds), and it is more of a kid film.

This movie is too beautiful to watch to waste my time reading sub-titles. And then there are all the people who say the over-dubbing was horrible. I thought it was pretty good myself. You can get away with alot more in an animated film than one that is live-action. And personally, I don't ever want to hear another actress do Chihiro besides Daveigh Chase. For me, Daveigh's voice was one of the things that endeared me to Chihiro. (I was a little taken aback to learn that she played the creepy Samara in &quot;The Ring&quot;.) I thought all of the voices were great. For those of you who don't like sub-titles, don't worry about the dubbing. The English language version is great.	5.0	Only Daveigh	2003-08-04	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"Like ""Princess Mononoke"", director Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated film, ""Spirited Away"", was inspired greatly by animistic Shinto beliefs.  The story begins with a young girl named Chihiro riding in a car with her parents.  While driving to their new home, they take a turn onto a dirt road that leads them to an old building.  In spite of Chihiro's objections, she follows her parents into the building's entrance.  They emerge on the other side into daylight and walk towards a set of buildings.  The buildings appear abandoned, but when Chihiro's parents smell food cooking, they follow it to a well-stocked restaurant and begin to gorge themselves.  Chihiro refuses to eat and wanders away to investigate on her own.  When she returns, she finds that her parents have turned into two fat pigs.  When night suddenly falls, Chihiro is further terrified by the unexpected appearance of an assortment of strange spiritual beings; but one boy, Haku, helps Chihiro and tells her that there may be a way to restore her parents.  Will Chihiro, who is later renamed Sen, be able to restore her parents and survive in the strange world or spirits and magic?As in ""Princess Mononoke"", the animation in ""Spirited Away"" is intricate, amazing and beautiful. Other very interesting characters include the witch Yubaba, Sen's coworker Lin, boiler manager Kamaji, the little black creatures that assist Kamaji, and No-Face.  Western viewers may find the story strange since the story contains no battles between good & evil, and also since many of the characters are inherently neither good nor evil for the most part either.  Overall, I found the plot to be very engaging, as well as the cinematography and animation, and I rate the film with 5 out of 5 stars.  The DVD version can be watched in its original Japanese with English subtitles, or dubbed in English, which was done well.  ""Spirited Away"" is a film that children and adults alike can both enjoy and watch repeatedly without becoming tiresome."	5.0	Another Great Animated Adventure from Hayao Miyazaki	2003-04-17	21	18	3

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	There's a reason why so many people are in awe of this animated film, and it is because it's SPECTACULAR. I had no idea what I was in for when I picked up &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; I only knew that it was loved by so many different people, including my friends. So, I decided to take the trip and see what it was all about. I have to say that this is a stunning Anime that is larger-than-life.This fantasy epic is about a little girl named, Chihiro. She gets separated from her parents when they visit a strange place that turns out to be a spirit world; a world that doesn't take too kindly to humans. When her parents transforms into pigs as punishment, Chihiro is forced to take a journey into the unknown and find the courage that is buried deep within herself. As she meets strange and magical creatures, both good and bad, Chihiro starts to realize all of the things she had once taken for granted. The lessons she learns will determine the success of her accomplishments--and will also determine the fate of her parents and herself.It's hard to put into words of what I experienced when I was watching this breath-taking film, but I can tell you that taking the ride is well worth it. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a pure and energetic example of how powerful the art of animation can be when it comes to story-telling. This movie is everything a mystical journey should consist of. There's danger, and yet, there is also heart--and a lot of it. This would not have been as successful had it been filmed in a live-action movie. The art and scenery that we are presented with really goes beyond imagination. The creative mind of Hayao Miyazaki really snaps into action as he brings this powerful and unique story to life. The film also has some magnificent characters and themes.There are some cool things that this 2-disc DVD set has to offer. First of all, the picture and sound quality is really superb. You can either watch it with an English audio track or the original Japanese track. They did a really good job of dubbing it in English, as I have a hard time trying to read subtitles and keeping up with what's going on at the same time; so there, I benefited a great deal. Others might prefer the original Japanese track, which is why it's great that the DVD offers both. Extras include numerous featurettes on the making of the movie and the thought process behind it.I really loved &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; It surprised me so many times throughout, and I was never once disappointed with the results. If you're looking for a great journey to take in the world of Anime, then this is the ride to take. It's breath-taking, imaginative, and stunningly beautiful. Do not be turned off by the fact that this is an animated feature, otherwise you might end up missing the trip of a lifetime.

In this reviewers opinion, Miyazaki is the greatest animated storyteller and visionary since the late Walter Elias Disney.  This film is justifiably considered his greatest.  It won the Academy Award for best animated feature the year of it's release.Chihiro is an 11 year old brat.  Her family is moving and she doesn't like it one bit.  To make things worse, her father makes the wrong turn.  He then insists on investigating what appears to be an abandoned theme park.  However things aren't what they seem, with the setting of the sun, things begin to transform including her parents.  Aided by a mysterious boy, Haku, Chihiro learns to survive in this spirit word.  She gets a job at a bath house for the spirits run by the witch Yubaba.In the process of adapting to her new situation, Chihiro grows tremendously. In order to save herself and her family, she going to display reservoirs of strength and resourcefulness she didn't know she had.  Miyazaki handles this realistically.  As Chihiro adapts to her situation, her emotions range from confusion to terror to resignation through bouts of depression.  Nonetheless she prevails and even finds friendship, loyalty and love.She also bumps her head a lot......literally.The detail of Miyagi's work is incredible.  Look at the details of the boiler room where Chihiro meets Komagi, Yubaba's office, the details of bathhouse operation etc.  Miyagi bases his characters on actual people.  `Chihiro' is based on the daughter of a close friend.  Her parents had no idea he had been studying her so closely.The DVD includes extras primarily about the making of the film including it dubbing in English.  There is also a Japanese documentary about Studio Ghibli.  It's interesting a work of such beauty can be produced under such crowded, cluttered working conditions"	5.0	Miyazaki's Best	2008-06-14	1	1	0

This is an amazing and breathtaking Japanese animation. It puts Disney formulaic cartoons to shame. The art work is utterly charming with attention to detail. Spirited Away is nothing but charming without shamaltz or mushy sentimentality. From beginning to end, feels like a bizarre dream, never dull and always entertaining. I love it!

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	APL7KHB0KKPA3	Michael H. Siegel	I am gratified to see that Spirited Away is finally getting the attention in this country that it has long deserved.  Buried by Disney until the Academy Awards, the latest creation of Japan's animation guru is simply stunning -- the best animated feature since Snow White.You've read the plot summaries and perhaps the idea of a Japanese film about a 10-year old girl who gets trapped in the spirit world sounds strange.  But this picture has universal appeal.  I'm an 30-year old white American male and I love this movie.  The (mostly) hand-drawn animation is lush, gorgeous and incredibly dynamic.  And how nice is it to see 3-dimensional characters in a complex touching story that goes in unexpected directions every chance it gets?  It leaves anything produced by Disney/Pixar in the dust.Disney has done an excellent job of bringing this movie to America.  The copy is crisp and clear -- although obviously not as magnificent as on the big screen.  The voice-dubbing is very good, matching the character's mouths without losing content.  I had a slight problem with Princess Mononoke's dubbing because some of the celebrity voices (especially Thornton and Anderson) were distracting.  That's not the case here.  The english voices are perfectly cast (especially Suzanne Pleshette as Yubaba/Zeniba).A few notes on the DVD.  The extras are OK with the exception of an outstanding Japanese TV special on the making of Spirited Away.  Rather than focus on the technical aspects, it focuses on Miyazaki himself and his uber-talented group of artists at Studio Ghibli.  It's definitely worth your time.Also, some comments have unfavorably compared this version to the Japanese version.  For the record, Disney is contractually forbidden from changing a single frame of the movie -- not one frame.  Period.  There *are* some differences in dialogue but you can watch in Japanese with more literally translated subtitles (subtitle track 2) if you prefer.Final comment:  this movie may not be suitable for very young children as it has some scary sequences and is over two hours long.  But for everyone else, this is an incredible movie.  And for animation fans, it's a must-have.	5.0	Miyazaki's Masterpiece	2003-04-22	43	41	2
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	First, Spirited Away is about a little girl, but it is NOT A MOVIE FOR LITTLE KIDS.This is something I feel should be stated up front for all the folks (*cough*mundanes*cough*) who think that anything that's animated is for kiddies. It ain't. Welcome to the world of anime.Actually, let me amend that. There seems to be some anime apologists who are afraid the film will get a bad rap if parents are told that it's not for children. Well foo on them too. This is not a movie suitable for young children. I'll explain more in a moment.And what a world it is. A young girl named Chihiro travels with her parents to their new home and on the way, take a short cut to what looks like an abandoned theme park. Her parents wander heedlessly into the grounds and find some delicious-smelling food, which they consume.Then they turn into pigs. It's not a blink-and-you-miss-it special effect. It's a slow, terrifying effect. Chihiro's parents turn into big, fat, squealing pigs. It's horrible -- it's meant to be. Remember the not for kids warning? This is one reason why.Chihiro is not without her allies. She meets Haku, a river dragon who appears to her in boy form (most of the time). With his help and guidance, Chihiro manages to survive her transition into what turns out to be the spirit world. She makes friends with a moustached, goggled spider-like being who runs the boilerroom and finds employment with Yubaba, the domineering old crone who runs the bathhouse.Being that I've written a few fantasy books set in Russian fairytales (see Tsar Rising and The Dancing Hut), words like &quot;bathhouse,&quot; &quot;crone,&quot; and &quot;Yubaba&quot; ring bells. I'm saddened that very few reviewers picked up on the movie's inspiration.The movie takes many of its cues from Russian myth. Yubaba = Baba Yaga, the infamous hag. Just as Yubaba has a baby she fawns over, Baba Yaga alternately menaces and cares for children. She has a host of young girls working for her in some stories -- in others, she is a cannibal. The parallels are all there.There's more: Yubaba has a twin sister, Zeniba. In Russian myth, there's typically three hags (all sisters), but the similarity is unmistakable. And of course there's the bathhouse itself. In both Russian and Japanese myth, the bathhouse is a magical place where the spirits take over at midnight. Which is precisely what happens in Spirited Away.And oh yeah, there's a two-headed eagle (a symbol of old Russia) on Yubaba's tapestry. Of course, nobody pays attention to Russia these days for reasons I can only ascribe to the Cold War.There are plenty of elements that aren't from Russian myth. No-Face, a strange demon that leeches off of other people's personalities, changes from a benevolent ally to a monstrous thing that tries to eat everyone in the bathhouse. It moans and wails, it eats people, it's really quite gross and scary -- not for kids.What the movie does have is charm. Love, friendship, trust -- all these things help Chichiro to survive. Her good-hearted actions save her (just like in Russian myth...most of the time) and help her defeat Yubaba at her own game.The animation is superb. The voice acting (including the dub) is excellent. Disney is giving Japanese anime the respect it deserves. See it.This movie IS worth seeing with your tween daughter. As in, 10 years old and up.	5.0	A movie worth seeing with your tween daughter	2004-03-22	9	6	3
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AYT4YLB36MY4J	Michael Kluge	"In my opinion this doesn't necessarily make the movie better.  I supposed I was expecting to see this movie and be utterly blown away a la ""Princess Mononoke,"" and in some ways I was.  It moved me and made me think, and the movie's artistry let my imagination soar free just as with ""Mononoke.""However, my first impression is that the coherency in that earlier Miyazaki film is missing here.  Being that this and ""Mononoke"" are the only two films of his I have seen, maybe this kind of movie is really more of his style and he isn't usually as lucid or accessible as he was with ""Mononoke,"" yet I still think that film set a standard for storytelling, emotion, and beauty that few, if any, movies have matched since.  The plot progressed at a thrilling pace, and the conclusion was perfect and utterly satisfying.""Spirited Away,"" on the other hand, doesn't progress nearly as smoothly.  In fact, the only real (coherent) plot development occurs in the first 45 minutes or so of the movie, with the changing of Chihiro's parents to pigs, her introduction to the bath house, her meeting with Haku and Yubaba, and her meeting with No Face.  After that, to a certain degree, the movie seems to meander plot-wise.  Though characters are put into dilemnas here and there, you never really get the feeling that they're in true danger, or that any of the plot elements really are that crucial.  Despite the fact that I admire the gray-area nature of good and evil in Miyazaki's films, I think it would've served the movie's plot and development better if Yubaba had been more maliciously cast.  Might be fault of the translation, but I don't know...There are some elements that make little sense with the overarching themes and plot line of the movie, as well.  No Face is possibly the biggest example of this.  He/she/it just seems to be thrown in to add meat to the plot, and little more.  It's an interesting diversion, but it makes little sense with the story, besides highlighting the theme of greed, possibly.  Which brings me to another aspect I didn't like so much: themes of maturation and love were (pretty) well dealt with, but the theme of greed was probably too overdone, especially with Chihiro's parents turning into pigs and No Face's handing out of gold to everyone.Being as I've viewed it all the way through only once, it might need some time, but so far I just don't see the coherency of ""Mononoke"" here."	4.0	"More subtle, oblique than ""Mononoke"""	2003-04-19	6	5	1

Beautiful movie...all the wood grain, flowers, bugs flying. Miyazaki is a genius. So much different than American cartoons or stories. I do not look at these as cartoons. The stories and artistry are very detailed. I never watch these movies with the English soundtrack. Always the Japanese with English subtitles. I checked this out from the library and it had two discs with really good special features. The Japanese speaking people are just more dramatic in their speaking which really melds with the story. I love the background music that is played in almost all of his movies. I don't want to give anything away so I just want to comment on how good this is. Amazing that the animation is hand drawn and not computer-generated. This is probably the best movie by Miyazaki. Over two hours long but it goes fast.	5.0	Amazing movie	2013-03-13	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3OIMJX9L2FCET	"Michael May ""mi3ke"""	I must admit that I have not been a devoted fan of Anime. After seeing SPIRITIED AWAY, this could change!Hayao Miyazaki must be a mad genius.  Many consider him to be Anime's greatest artist.  Having seen some of his work, I am fascinated by Innocence standing firm in the face of Great Evil, and horrendous creatures defeated by cute little unarmed girls without irises!  Love wins over all!How does he do it?  Where do these images come from?  The Spirits of Bushido and the Spectre of Hiroshima combine in occassionaly confusing dialogue and violently grotesque action sequences, as mutant creatures and masterful scenery whirl by with tornadic intensity, in which no detail is too small.Master Miyazaki, I admire your work.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L	Michael Valdivielso	Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' is about a little girl who learns about friednship, courage and her own inner strength.  She learns to use her brain and her heart to save her parents and get back to the normal world, her world.But within the movie are messages for adults too.  The bath house, the main setting for much of what happens within the movie, is a strange weird place, a mixture of greed and mediation.  Spirits and Gods come to the bath house to relax and renew themselves, but the staff seems more interested in getting all the gold they can, even begging for tips.  The higher you go in the bath house the more riches and greed you see.There are also other messages, such as how mankind treats the Earth and each other.  The movie is a strong one, powerful in theme and beautiful in its nature with a touch of humor.  IT is not just a simple story about good or evil.  This goes beyond that.I also found that I liked the soot creatures.  ;-)	5.0	Not just for kids...	2003-10-25	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	My first introduction to Spirited Away was a tape at the Chicago Comic Convention.  Having heard the hype for the film, and finding the tape for sale there, I took it home and watched it at 2 in the morning.  Well, let me say that even though the quality was off a bit, I was hooked!  I watched it probably every other day for the next month.Within a few weeks, I became the lead editor for the film at Countdown to Spirited Away on the site Countingdown.com, and soon had obtained a DVD from overseas.But wait you say, you bought an overseas copy yet you're reviewing the American DVD?  Yes I am, for I have both in my collection now.  And let me say that the work that John Lasseter and his crew did for the English dub makes it one of the best English dubs I have ever heard (eclipsing the work done for Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke).The film is a very simple story.  Chihiro, a listless and spoiled 10-year-old girl is moving with her parents.  taking a wrong turn, they find themselves in a world of spirits where Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs.  Chihiro must brave her way through this strange world and survive, but can she return her parents to normal and find her way home?That premise is all I will say, as anymore would destroy the story.  Nowadays, there is literal fluff available for children.  i've seen parents nod off and wish the world would end before most films, but I've sat through countless showings of this film, and everytime, I've seen people enthralled by what was on that screen.  I heard no crying children, no children squirming in their seats.  I attended a sneak preview with 19 of my animation friends and they all loved it (my friend's mother has a habit of nodding off through films, but she stayed awake through all 2 hours of Spirited Away).The DVD contains the original Japanese dialogue, as well as the French and English dubs.  There are subtitles included as well as a few specials.  PIXAR studios' John Lasseter (a close personal friend to director Hayao Miyazaki) has a 2 minute opening monologue about his love for the film.There is also a segment called 'The Art of Spirited Away,' a very 'weak' segment hosted by Jason Marsden (the voice of Haku in the English dub), that explains bringing the film to the US.On the second disc, there are selected storyboards (images drawn by Miyazaki to explain the film in visual form), as well as a 50 minute special from Japanese TV that is the most in depth making of for this film you will find. Watch as the staff finds themselves under pressure, and you can see the tension building in Miyazaki's face.  There is even 30 minutes of movie trailers from Japan (while most of tehm follow a repetitive manner, it would have been nice to put in trailers from the French release and the wonderful English trailer).The disc is lacking in a few areas for features (my overseas copy has the full storyboards instead of selected storyboard sequences), but I'm just glad that the film will finally be seen by people.  After the lackluster ad campaign that Disney did for this filmback in September, the DVD release will probably prove to them that kids can go just as wild over Miyazaki's films as they do for Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.	5.0	I can't say enough about this incredible film!	2003-04-18	1	0	1

I turned on the television and saw that this movie called ""Spirited Away"" was playing. It was at the opening credits, and I was about to change the channel when the beautiful score set a mesmerizing and serene atmosphere, and I couldn't help but continue to watch out of the score alone. I soon found out that this movie would hit me again and again with one amazing feature after another. I was never a fan of manga or anime, but this was a HUGE exception. I ended up watching the whole 2 hour movie, and when it had ended, I just sat there amazed at the fact that I had never heard of this movie before.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1WX42M589VAMQ	Mir	You certainly don't have to be Japanese to enjoy this marvel of animated film-making. (Although thanks to the reviewer who gave explanations for some of the details. I really appreciate knowing what those candy things are that so delight the soot ball creatures.)As with all the Miyazaki films I've seen--and much loved--you start with some time in the protagonist's normal, non-magical world (whether a long time or short, depending on the film.) Here, we are in a car with Chigiro and her parents, as they are on their way to a new home. Chigiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, but her parents tell her she should look at it as an adventure, as all new places are adventures.Oh, how prophetic.They pass a plot of grassy land by the side of the road cluttered with tiny shrines to a host of spirits. Another bit of foreshadowing. The parents are skeptical as they explain to Chigiro what they are.Then they park the car at a dead-end in the road, and enter a tunnel which takes them to an unusual, seemingly deserted place. Chigiro's papa says it's an abandoned amusement park. They explore this place that has echoes of Easter Island, with these partly toppled, partly buried  huge stone faces. Then they find colorful streets crammed with restaurants, all empty. All but one. While no people are in sight, the restaurant brims with tempting delicacies (though, er, fishheads aren't my thing). Chigiro's parents begin to feast. She does not. She wanders...And the adventure officially BEGINS!This is no abandoned, mundane amusement park. This is the land of spirits, and a central point of action turns out to be a bathhouse where non-human creatures of all manner (some dreadful, some mysterious, some hilarious, all interesting) come to clean up and relax and feast.Chigiro receives the help of some of these non-humans, and is challenged and threatened by others, but there is no obvious villain, for, as in other Miyazaki works, characters are complex, with both good and not-so-good in their characters, whether it's self-indulgence or abuse of power or greed or gluttony or grudge-holding or whatever. And even good or well-meaning deeds can go all wrong. But, as with other Miyazaki works, compassion and bravery and hard work and sacrifice go a long, long way. And helping hands come when need is greatest. And a sort of benevolent providence watches over the world. This is what gives such magic to this work--as it does Princess Mononoke or My Neighbor Totoro, etc. Fine characterization, extraordinary visions of the magical, magnificent artistry, and a gentle heart that runs throughout.And there is always the too-too-too adorable or cute for words critter. In Totoro, it was the beasts themselves (especially chibi) and the cute soot critters. In Mononoke it was the tree spirits that made me laugh and laugh. Here, it's, yes, the cute little soot things again, but also the hilarious tiny bird with the mosquito-buzzing wings and the chubby, bouncy mouse with attitude. And even the radish monster was a hoot.I love the manifestations of gentleness and generosity and goodness in Miyazaki's works. Here, Chigiro helps a Faceless Spirit whose loneliness is a palpable things. The ride in the train at night is evocative and blends a sort of sadness and hope and resolve. The music chosen for this exceptional sequence is perfect--a haunting piano piece. The scene with the Stink monster who is not what he seems is at first remarkably amusing, then remarkably surprising--and yes, again, magical.This is not a film you want to miss. It has strong family values (as does My Neighbor Totoro and Howl's Moving Castle), and hopefulness.It's just a total, utter treat for the eyes and ears and spirit of children and adults alike. But I especially recommend it for adults who've forgotten what it was like to be young and see wonders all around.	5.0	My favorite Miyazaki, humane and magical and fun-fun-fun!	2007-02-01	3	2	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	"This is one of my favorite anime movies.  Its extremely charming, appropriate for everyone, and has a good lesson involved.  What's not to love in a movie?In this animated movie, Chihiro, a young girl, is traveling to her new home with her mother and father when they get lost.  They find themselves in an abandoned town that is filled with some good food.  Her mother and father start eating while Chihiro explores and when she gets back they have been turned to pigs.  With the help of Hoku, a young boy who mysteriously appears, Chihiro learns that she is in the spirt world, most specifically at a bathhouse run by a devious witch.At the bathhouse Chihiro learns what hard work and kindness is as she seeks a cure for her parents.  She also becomes friends with Hoku and has to help him and the bathhouse when trouble is afoot.  Its an awful lot for a young girl though, specially one that isn't used to hard work.  Sometimes Chihiro wonders if she'll ever get home.Even though Chihiro is supposed to be annoying I never really get that from her.  She just seems like a young timid girl to me that faces a lot and has slightly mean parents.  All of the people of the bathhouse are interesting; they're unique spirits to be sure.  And Chihiro finds some good friends there as well.  There are a couple of ""scary"" characters in this that might frighten younger children, but they add a lot to the plot and it is interesting to see Chihiro interacting with them.  Hoku especially is a hard character to read but even so, the viewer has to trust Chihiro in regards to him.There are some unusual plot elements to this movie and rituals that I don't quite understand.  I judge them to be either the makings of a child's mind or something exclusive to the writer's country that they would understand there.  Regardless, it makes it whimsical and doesn't detract from the story at all.  And it is a good story about growing.  Chihiro does a marvelous job and really develops some loyalty to her friends.  While the ending does rush a bit, it still is very nice and finishes out the story well.  I was pleased with it anyway.For cinematography, since it is a cartoon type film there's not special effects per say.  But the animation is done really well, there's a lot of neat scenes in this movie.  Most especially the train ride is very poignant to me.  Combined with the great music in this film, it just really speaks to you.  A lot of the other scenes are touching as well.A really touching movie and good for the whole family.  Even if you aren't a fan of anime, this is one you should see.Review by M. Reynard 2011"	5.0	Spirited Away	2011-03-27	1	1	0

I had seen Kiki's Delivery Service in the past.  I like that one fine...Spirited Away beats that out a thousand times over.  The story is much more sophisticated (as animation anyway).  It was nothing like I expected and I was in total awe of  it.  I loved his take on the spirit world.  The main character was very likeable and enchanting.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AYBL30P5NXNZ4	"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a"""	Writing as someone who has never watched anime before, this animated feature is an incredibly imaginative superior production with an intelligent story.Chihiro is on her way with her parents to a new home - on the way they stop to explore a strange tunnel, which takes them into another world.  In this world, through gluttony, her parents are turned into pigs, and Chihiro is rescued by Haku, a young boy.  She finds work in the centrepiece of this world, the bathhouse for spirits, in which she has many adventures which gradually change her from sullen and spoiled to helpful and kind.The ideas are complex, and the animation suitably layered as well.  The bathhouse creatures are weird and wonderful creations - neither heroes nor bad guys, good nor bad - just fascinating multilayered characters.  All of the main storylines involve layers of identity, nothing being what it first seems, and the animation style lends itself to this incredibly well. There is the slime monster who everyone cannot bear the smell of, who, with a little kindness reveals a more benevolent and powerful spirit.  Or the `No-face', sort of a walking `Scream' portrait, who changes his identity through loneliness, but returns once kindness and friendship are given.  And of course Haku, who takes many forms before being redeemed when reminded of his true identity.Though the animation on one level may appear simplified compared to modern cgi `toons', in fact the colours and rhythm of events are richer than most, and although I am writing this after one viewing, one suspects that there is much more to be seen on multiple viewings.Amongst the almost universally glowing reviews however, it is worth remembering that this is a Japanese film.  This is both an asset and a detraction.  The asset is clear - this movie has more imagination in one scene than any current animated Western feature has in its whole length, both in animation and story.  However, while Hollywood sometimes falls prey to too much schmaltz, the absence of a sweetener to the tale here means that it is difficult to be absorbed on more than an intellectual level.  Animated features work because you become passionate about the characters or the outcome - not easy when all you are doing is thinking how wonderful all the ideas are.The DVD comes in two disc form, with the first showing the film in both English dubbed (by John Lasseter of Toy Story / Pixar boss fame) and the original Japanese with subtitles.  There is also an option to watch the whole movie in its original storyboard form, but hard to imagine anyone would watch the whole movie this way - though it is fascinating to see this embryonic stage of the movie for a minute or two in places.The second disc contains a range of material educating the non-Japanese and anime fans amongst us of Miyazaki's output, amongst other generally interesting bits and pieces.Having said that, the tale is a complete one, the experience rich, and the moral positive.  Perhaps younger children will find this a little scary in places, and perhaps a little complicated, but it's a small quibble with so much to warrant the Oscar (Best Animated Feature, 2002) it won.  Recommended, as long as you are comfortable with something a little bit different, and prepared for not so much sugar with your dessert.	4.0	Intelligent and imaginative Japanese animation	2007-02-18	2	1	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1S5B32WYMEE44	"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words"""	Take the Ghost of Walt Disney sit him down in a Tokyo bar paired up with Roger Waters, a couple of Saki's, and a night on the town and you have mish-mashed together Fantasia and The Wall.  That would about sum up Hayao Miyazaki's visionary work in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;Though it does trace elements of Alice and Wonderland, it left me wondering, who the audience really is...the child or the adult?  Like great works of animation, I believe &quot;Spirited Away&quot; transcends age and crosses over to both audiences.  It may be too deep and too dark in parts to truly appeal to the younger of age but there are fantastical threads all the way through that may not connect with those too far removed from childhood.  There may be some cultural perspectives that some of those in American audiences may find unfamiliar, but for those willing to expand boundaries, &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; is worth the stretching.  Keep an open mind and imagination and you may find yourself caught up in the beautifully hand-drawn animation.  It is the work of an artisan.The story is centered around a young girl Chihiro, who is moving to a new house with her mother and father.  Along the way they get spirited away to an alternate reality world in which Chihiro is renamed Sen, her parents are turned to pigs, and her redeemers are a river god and a six-armed curmudgeon that stokes the furnace.  Sound unusual to you?  Well it is.  If you give it a chance, the story mixed with the animation will draw you in and enable you to celebrate the creativity that went into such a unique work.I would say if you are a fan of anime or just animation in general, this is a movie you wouldn't want to miss.  If you are a general movie fan, it's a good watch, but I wouldn't call it a &quot;must watch.&quot;  If you are looking for something different, liked Fantasia, The Wall, Heavy Metal, get &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;--MMW	4.0	Into Another World	2004-06-05	6	2	4

I bet those people don't even know themselves why they didn't like it. I don't guarantee you will love it but if you don't understand it don't negatively criticize it. Those with unimaginative minds have no right to criticize the works of those with artistic and creative minds. If you think Spirited Away is crap then maybe you should go out and make a movie yourself and see how difficult it is!

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1YHP7XXSTXSGT	nagisa	Spirited Away is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and deserves its place as one of the greatest films to ever be made. The story and characters are not spectacular (above par yes, but not spectacular), it's the way the director Hayao Miyazaki presents the story that makes Spirited Away so special. Miyazaki's colour pallet for the film gives it a certain edge over other animated movies, the film is truly art caught on film, the animation is spectacular and beyond Walt Disney's dreams.The detail in the surroundings is astounding from the architecture of the bath house to the costume designs, that takes an interesting but quite simplistic story to something truly magical. There is so much feeling enveloped in every scene of this movie that it easily draws you into Chihiro's quest to escape the bath house and save her parents.One thing that may deter people from this film is that it is very Japanese, and gives an insightful view into their culture. Certain cultural references may leave people misreading certain aspects of the film. Such as one magazine critic who thought that the bath house was similar to the red-light district. Even though bath houses are extremely common throughout Japan, have been so for hundreds of years and are very much an ordinary part of Japanese life. Even though some cultural references may cause some misunderstandings, the story of Chihiro is truly universal and can be understood by everyone, as this is a childrens film afterall.There are a few scary bits in the film that may scare the kids, so Parental Guidance is advised. But this is a true gem, and gives the new slur of CG effects movies a good kicking, and shows what makes a good film. Disney may have forgotten how to make animated movies over the past thirty years (with a few exceptions) but Studio Ghibli is here to show that you can put all the money you want into making more realistic looking CG movies, but a great story and artful direction will win out overall.	5.0	Quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.	2004-08-29	4	3	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3H43RUOMP62E6	Natalie Lomoriello	In the animated film Spirited Away directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the epic tale of one girl's experience in a mystical and fantasy-driven world is told. This world manifests itself within a bathhouse for spirits, thus becoming the dynamic through which Chihiro (the lonesome and courageous heroine) experiences all of her conflicts and resolutions. Marked by an overriding imagery that is not only picturesque, but creatively and artfully composed, the surroundings that Chihiro is placed within are anything but bleak. While Spirited Away does indeed center around a more serious conflict, one involving Chihiro's struggle to survive within the bathhouse successfully so as to eventually rescue her parents who were formerly turned into pigs, the magical embodiment of the bathhouse and its residents balance this. In many scenes the bright and hopeful hues blue and whit are blended to create an unremitting sky. This, contrasted with the bold and dark colors that boastfully exist within the night-life of the bathhouse, is supportive of a film that is nothing less than a masterpiece of artful animation. Transcending the accepted norms of other contemporary animation pieces, Spirited Away does not only exude a magnificent and mystical story of triumph when in the depths of hopelessness, but also a certain skilled mastery of artistic feats not originally thought possible in the world of animation. Relying on the universal themes of love and friendship, Spirited Away is a film that shatters the preconceived notions regarding the superficiality of most animated films. The fact that most scenes are set against a backdrop that is both intricate and fluent in expressive color and detail only strengthens its impact.	4.0	"""Spirited Away"": a Supreme Feat of Animation"	2005-02-18	3	1	2
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A23FXW3H8FR789	Nathan D. Ludwig	Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' is without a doubt his best work, which is no small feat when looking at the man's filmography. 'Castle In The Sky,' 'Kiki's Delivery Service,' etc...All of Hayao's films emanate with a sense of sheer wonder and pure magic, as if the master animator has secret powers no one else has been able to tap into....The plot in brief: Chihiro is a somewhat bratty young girl moving to another house with her mom and dad. They get sidetracked and end up wandering into a mystical resort/spa for Japanese gods and spirits and the like. Hijinks do not ensue. Instead, we get a captivating and hypnotizing journey into a very weird otherworld as Chihiro fights to save her parents and along the way becomes a better person through the unshakable morals that she never knew she had.The animation in 'Spirited Away' is fluid and disjointed all at once, making for a hypnotizing and captivating film experience. Colors and shadows frequently intermix, leaving us with a feeling that this world (odd as it is) seems somewhat more realistic than even ours. There are so many strange and wonderful creatures and characters in the film that you'll be scratching your head as to how they even thought some of them up. Three bouncing green heads that only speak in grunts, a gigantic, fat talking baby, a spider-like old man with impossibly long arms, living coal dust, and the list goes on and on...There is one scene towards the end of the film featuring Chihiro and some of her 'companions' on a lonely train headed to an unknown destination in that forgotten alternate world that comes off as so haunting and touching that I felt it was one of the most memorable sequences in recent film memory; nothing major happens and no words are even spoken, it's just an example of why Miyazaki is the greatest animation storyteller ever.Bottom Line: 'Spirited Away' is arguably the best animated film of all time. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the narrative lags here and there in a few parts, which may turn the average moviegoer off. With that aside, this is a marvelous and wonderfully sentimental adventure/fantasy that will be remembered as long we walk this earth. Maybe even beyond that...	4.0	An Unforgettable And Quietly Haunting Adventure...	2003-05-15	1	1	0

It doesn't have a story in which every detail is explained away until there is no mystery or wonder left in it, which would be tragic, this being a story about wonder and mystery.  It presents itself in simple, elegant and poetic form and allows you to simply accept everything as it comes.The characters are strange but well-balanced and memorable.  The story is far from preachy and doesn't try to ram a moral down your throat.  It is just told.  When it's all over it will leave you in a good mood, which is the best that can be said of any story of its kind.Try to watch the japanese version with english subtitles if you can.

This movie is not just for Anime buffs.  In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who saw this movie and didn't like it.The plot of this movie is simple, it's about a young girl brought to a mystical land and her journey there.  However, the beauty of this movie is not in the plot, its in how this plot is brought to life through the characters and scenes of this movie.  Each scene is skillfully crafted and filled with emotion.  The detail is simply amazing.The only tripping point about this movie, perhaps it's only flaw - but even then not significant - is it lack of explanations.  This world in which the girl, named Chihiro, enters is never really explained in the story.  This isn't a bad thing though, once your swept up in the world it won't really matter why it is there.  In fact any explanation of the world might have ruined the story.  It's suppose to be foreign and mysterious.If you love cinema, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out.	5.0	One of the best  movies ever made, period.	2003-03-05	20	16	4

I must admit that if it weren't for my friends, I probably would have never even given this title a second look, but after I watched it, I was amazed. Miyazaki has managed to create one of the most beautiful, not to mention entertaining, movies I have ever seen. The characters (especially Chihiro) are very true to life. I highly recommend &quot;Spirited Away&quot; even if you aren't an anime fan or, like me, are an otaku (you know who you are). I also encourage you to check out Miyazaki's other works, two of my favorites being &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro.&quot;	5.0	Simply Amazing	2004-07-08	3	2	1

Until I saw a review online stating that this was one of the greatest films ever made, I decided to take up my friend on his offer.What I witnessed was one of the greatest films of all time.  The greatest animated film I have ever seen, it touched my heart.  Sen, or Chihiro was the star of the film not for any other reason than because of her pure and generous heart.  Her compassionate nature really gave hope to the film, and made a seemingly chaotic world seem beautiful.The animated and epic nature of the film really brings optimism into life that one must watch the film to understand.  5 stars!!	5.0	Life-changing experience	2012-11-16	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A39SG8Q7YBRW6Z	Nobukimi Sasaki	I wasn&#65533;t really expecting this movie at the beginning. About first 45 minutes, so many strange creatures were shown up, and I was thinking &#65533;What a weird movie this is!?&#65533; But when the story was getting to the end, my tears came up and didn&#65533;t stop.Chihiro was an ordinary 10 years old girl, who was kind of lazy and always complaining about something. She was suddenly transferred into a strange world where her parents were spelled by a witch, and turned into pigs. There were so many strange creatures in that world. They were mean to Chihiro at the begging. They seemed to be so greedy and selfish. They were only nice to rich people, but mean to someone with dirty looking. They were just interested in making money, playing, and have delicious meals. But unlike those creatures, what Chihiro wanted was to save her parents who had turned into pigs. She worked very hard as much as she could. She treated everyone equally, and she showed her love to those who looked dirty, and lonely. Finally, her love changed the way they were.In that world, people were all forgot his/her past, even his/her original name; they are all taken away by a witch. But Chihiro&#65533;s love brought a boy&#65533;s past back, a river spirit who saved Chihiro when she fell into the river.This is NOT a movie to entertain actions, and adventure. This movie might appear little difficult who is not sensitive. This is a story about love. I&#65533;ve watched three times and cried three times. It&#65533;s never happened to me in any other movie in my life.	5.0	This is about love.	2003-04-17	11	8	3

Its true this movie has a lot of scary parts and some people said it was ""dark"" which it isn't at all!Its truly a beautiful movie but I would reccomend your child would be 10+up for some parts even freaked me out.Amazing Animation, but some people said""the characters were to mean"" such as her parents""they yell too much"" one person said. You can hardly call them yelling its true they wern't perfect parents liek in some others and they did care about Chihiro but theyre like most parents in my hoem town they don't really care what their children do so they seemed real to me.""Yubaba was too cruel"" When her baby was goen she worried like a real mother you have to expect her to get angry ,wouldn't you if your child((if you don't have a child just pretend))) went missing, she was just worried and seriously after Sen ((Chihiro)) cleaned the Stink Spirit she started to appreciate her more, and ok soem characters such as HA-Noshi((No Face)) might scare soem children I thought he looked creppy before I saw the movie but now he's my favorite character and by the end he wasn't truly evil and personally I never thought he really wanted to hurt Chihiro.I'm not doing this to complain to people who don't like it i'm just saying open your mind and see the beauty of this movie such as the part when Haku remembered who he was, and if you think the characters are cruel remember Zeniba's kindness towards Sen and No-Face, and how even though No-Face attacked her she tried to help him, also remember the comedy parts in it ""seriously they are hilarious!""AND ITS ON OVER 90 TOP TEN LISTS!THAT HAS TO TELL YA SOMETHING!Pretty much this is a great movie which even beat his previous movie Mononoke Hime((second fav!!!))."	5.0	Miyazaki's Masterpiece Spirited Away	2003-03-29	3	2	1

I had never been into Japanese animation, it seemed somewhat strange to my Western eyes, but this film changed all that. It was like watching _Beauty and the Beast_ for the first time as a child - there was nothing but a sense of awe. The characters are incredibly rich and entertaining. The storyline is complex and very profound, yet any child can enjoy this film.This to me is why this film is so successful: Children will love the funny characters, animation, and action, and parents can enjoy the underlying questions of family and world position. There is nothing overly deep or dragging, just fantastic storytelling at its best, and an attempt to answer a very Shakespearian question: what's in a name?I would say one of the top 5 animated films ever created.	5.0	Complex and Fabulous	2006-02-10	3	1	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A10Y41LPMQQ15I	NYU Theater Major	Referring to previous reviews, I find it particularly heinous for an anime fan to imply that Miyazaki has a feebleminded imagination.  Ouch...that's so unforgivably tacky. Also, it'd be ideal that making sure meaning isn't lost in translation would be the director's responsibility; no such luck, particularly with dubbed anime, and especially with Disney. It's always been an issue that's been apparent since anime crossed over from Japan. That said, Spirited Away is an amazing movie, and while Otomo and Oshi are forces to be reckoned with, so is Miyazaki.	4.0	Marvelous	2005-03-14	1	0	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2ET37K72WYAR6	Old Grump	I will neither apologize for nor attempt to explain my passion for this film.  Many viewings have not changed that.  Instead, I would like to talk to the small but very vocal minority who find this absolutely the worst movie ever made, plotless, pointless, and incomprehensible.First, I would urge you to seek out a Japanese language version with subtitles.  Disney tries to turn everything into one of its own saccharine productions  As A.S. Templeton pointed out in his two-star review, this makes the two versions almost two different movies.  If you can't find a Japanese version, try to make allowances for Disney's corrupting influence.  My version is the Disney one, and I manage very well.Second, if you find it baffling, try Spark Notes.  ([...])  They provide both a clear plot summary and a detailed analysis.  For those who say you shouldn't need Cliff's Notes to understand a movie, I will point out that that most viewers, including children, didn't need them.If this still doesn't satisfy you, you'll just have to admit it isn't your cup of tea.  There's no shame in that.  There is shame, however, in claiming that your disliking something makes it bad and anyone who likes it either a shill or stupid.  That is simply arrogant and stupid.	5.0	Give it a chance	2014-01-15	1	1	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2RXCARNQ7YA6W	"""oljake"""	"Spirited Away is a triumph of storytelling, and a delight to watch.  The animation is typical of Studio Ghibli, in that it is very stylized and simple, yet very attentive to the subtle nuances of human expression.  The film was an absolute delight to watch, and it never copped out to silliness or a cheap tear-jerking tragedy (a.k.a. kill-off-a-supporting-character-to-make-the-kids-bawl-Disney).  It also stays completely away from typical American cliche plot-devices, and lame Disneyesque supersaturated cuteness.  When all that is stripped away, you are left with a quietly breathtaking and imaginative journey into traditional Japanese culture, mythical fantasy, and the human spirit.  And the film is not meant for your toddler, period.In Japan, it is perfectly acceptable to market an animated film to an adult crowd.  If you try to do that here, everyone will think that the film is pornographic.  Why?  Because Americans think that all cartoons are for kids, and the ones that are not for kids are porn.  This type of thinking is narrow-minded and stupid.  Granted, there are a lot of animated porn films coming out of Japan, but that's only because most of the American distributors that are buying the films think that porn and little kids' shows are the only thing that sell in this country.  The worst part about it?  They're right.  Americans won't buy the other stuff, because we refuse to give anything new a chance.For whatever it's worth to all you one-star raters, you have completely missed the point with this film.  It's not meant for your four-year-old, and it's not supposed to be nicey-cutesy-fuzzy-wuzzy-sweetie-kissy-Disney.  This is a landmark achievement in filmmaking that is meant to be enjoyed, understood, and pondered later; three things your little one more than likely will not do.  So if you are one of those people who would feel embarassed if your were seen going into a theater that was showing an animated film, stay away from good anime like this, and stick with the nice, safe cartoons about horsies and dalmatian doggies.To all the rest of you that can tell a good film when you see it, and won't pass judgement on it before it has a chance to carry you away: Please help keep good anime coming to America, and buy this film.  It is not ""mean"" or ""nonsensical"" like some one-star-reviewers say.  It is groundbreaking, epic fantasy animation.  And it's not for the toddlers.  Buy them a Rugrats tape."	5.0	STOP assuming cartoons are for KIDS ONLY!!!	2003-03-03	7	0	7
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A12CUOYPW2QM91	"Omar Khan ""RW"""	Hayao Miyazaki has had it rough with American audiences.  The master director has only been glimpsed briefly by American movie-watchers once or twice in the nineties.  However, he did manage to secure a somewhat small stateside followings with the releases of &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;My Neighbor Totoro,&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; speckled throughout the nineties.  Finally, he has received the ultimate recognition that he has had coming in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;Now, for those of yout oo lazy to read the back of the DVD here's how the story goes.  Chihiro is a little girl who is at a very odd point in her life; her family is moving to a new town.  On the way, her family decides to take a detour and winds up in a strange land that her father dimisses as an amusement park gone under.  However, night falls and the place comes to life.  Spirits of all shapes and sizes start emerging from the woodwork.  Chihiro is frightened for her life, tires to get away, but can't when she realizes her parents have been turned to pigs.  A benevolent spirit, Haku, helps her out by getting her into the Bath House of the Gods, the property of one evil witch named Yu-Baba.  She gives Chihiro a job, but takes her name as colateral, giving her the suffix &quot;Sen.&quot;  From here she learns about herself in an alien, yet familiar, world populated by gods.The story is very much similar to the works of Lewis Carrol, but works on a more Eastern way of thinking.  The spirits presented here are mainstays in Shinto folklore.  In this, Miyazaki provides the viewer with a world so far into the imagination yet at the same time, hitting close to home.  It's a sense of creativity in something that has been around for eons that makes them wonderous.  The spirits/gods/kame are infinitely more enjoyable than any deity that has come across Western screens.  From the spider-like Kamaji, to the inky No-Face, and (my personal favorite) the oozing Mud God.The characters are much like Miyazaki's other movies.  His traditional heroine who grows strong through out the movie, and the wonderous side characters that support her.  Each character is used for all intents and purposes.  Not a single character wastes screen time.  If you've ever seen a Miyazaki film, you know these characters are easy to relate to and fun to love.The music is everything I would expect from a Ghibli film.  Hisaishi Joe has been conducting for twenty years and shows no sign of losing his touch.  His melodies are a mix of emotions that add onto the action on screen.The animation is gorgeous.  There is no doubt about that, Miyazaki's films always have an aura of perfection, especially in the art and animation department.  Even his older works like &quot;Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro&quot; and &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; age better than most anime their time period.  The whole world in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; looks like one gigantic, colorful portrait.  Key word; Beautiful.In the end, I really can't stop praising this film enough.  The fact that it garnered the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature should do more service to the film than I could.  I can finalize this all by saying that &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is the best film you can buy for yourself, your loved one, or your whole family.  With something for everyone this film proves once and for all, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a master of anime.-RW	5.0	&quot;Spirit of Wonders&quot; Miyazaki Does it Again	2003-10-09	6	6	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3PR0KNBP01UR9	"Orome ""Aldaron"""	Another stunning film by, Hayao Miyazaki, the undisputed master of animation this film suffers from many of the flaws of Princess Mononoke and other masterpieces of Japanese animation: a combination of almost random imagery and shocking leaps between brutality and tenderness and between gravity and silliness. For those comfortable with these features of the genre, this film will stand out as clearly the finest yet made: an essential part of any serious anime collection and easily worth a dozen viewings. However, viewers new to serious anime (we're not talking Speed Racer here) and especially those with young children, should take care: this film, like many of its predecessors (notably Mononoke) contains disturbing images that will not be suitable for all audiences. Moreover, because these images are -- in typical anime fashion -- often dreamily disconnected from any real narrative purpose, they are all the more shocking, especially to those expecting a family animation experience along the lines of Lion King. For the daring though, well worth a try; but be sure to pre-view it before sitting the family in front of it.	3.0	Technically Superb, But Strange	2003-04-28	5	2	3

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A28QJUE3JLTWKO	"Paul A. Jackson ""Paul Jackson"""	This is the first Miyazaki DVD we've seen.  The purchase was for our 5-year-old, who couldn't handle some of the 'scarier' scenes.  The scenes do get pretty intense - an elegant dragon flees from a hoard of swarming origami flying creatures and gets sliced to hell from paper cuts, almost dies; (Don't die, Don't die!) but he makes it out OK.  There are other intense scenes but they're more threatening that explicit.The theme of the story (Take the high road) couldn't be better.  It's a story of a girl who goes from having it a little too good, where you feel a bit for the parents, to a story where the parents overstep, help themselves to some chow intended for spirits looking for a weekend retreat, and turn into pigs.  The rest of the story is the girl rising to a series of challenging steps necessary to win back her parents.Woven into this eastern story (inanimate objects have spirits too) are many Christian values such as blessed are the meek, what you do to the least of my brothers you do to me, the perils of greed, love the sinner, etc.The plot has twists - you're not sure who to trust, but, again, right prevails eventually.A footnote to the appropriateness for kids - the three-year-old loved it.  I recommend sitting through it with any young kid the first couple times.  Also, watch it yourself alone first if you have a concern.  My older boy wanted to quit right at the scariest part, which I thought was not good, so without knowing for sure, I decided to ride it out (I took the high road), and sure enough the scary part was over quickly and there was a happy ending.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A58UES3EXD9PR	Paul Bressie	This is an unqualified masterpiece.  Dazzling!  A rare combination of stylish animation and engaging, brilliant, truly original storytelling that will delight young and old for many repeated viewings.The description above (the www.amazon.com one) is very good so I won't repeat it here.Left out of the description, is that the japanese and the english dialogue are somewhat different.  I first saw the film in the theatres in the original Japanese (subtitled), and was delighted to find on the DVD subtle differences in the english dialogue that I imagine were changed to appeal more to english ears.  Not all the differences are language based.  (For instance: in the japenese version No-face doesn't really speak, he just urges people to take his gold with grunts and body language.  In the english version, he has dialogue.  Fascinating!)Pixar shows great respect in their wonderful job of translation and addition of the english voices.  John Lassiter, of Pixar, is interviewed, and he discusses how impressive he feels this film is.  (There's a stamp of approval.)Thank goodness both versions are included.  Watch them both!  The subtleties are worthwhile and interesting.What I liked most about this movie is how immersed we become in the unusual world Chihiro finds herself in, and how absorbed we, as viewers, become in Chihiro's point of view and her plight.  I, quite often, felt just as she did - ignorant, scared, alienated, desparate, and overwhelmed.  My heart was racing.  Where was this place?  What was going on?  How was she going to get out of this?  What to do next?  I have not found these feelings to abate during further viewings.While there are a few scary moments, I don't find them nearly as scary as the ... queen in Sleeping Beauty or the the forest scene in Snow White.  I think kids of all ages would really enjoy it.  (You might want to watch it first anyway and judge whether it might be too advanced or too scary for the little ones.)The biggest mistake would be to think this is just for kids.  It's amazing.  Highly recommended!!  I would gladly give it more stars if I could.	5.0	Wow! Really impressive!	2003-05-19	10	10	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1I4M9WUJ2L5AB	"Paul Chance ""author, Learning and Behavior"""	"Magical!This is truly a work of genius. Like The Wizard of Oz, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (the book, at least), and the song, Puff the Magic Dragon, it takes us into another world, strange and frightening, yet oddly familiar. And when we leave it, we are a little sad and eager to return.The film is full of mysteries (Thank you, Tsuyoshi, for helping with some of them) and difficult to understand, and that is perhaps part of its appeal. Fundamentally it is, I think, a coming-of-age story, with Chihiro forced to meet great challenges without the support of her parents for the first time.Indeed, Chihiro's parents have in a sense abandoned her by indulging themselves to excess. Therein lies one of the film's lessons: ultimately we must rely on ourselves. Her parents illustrate another theme of the film: Attempts to classify people as good or evil are bound to fail. Everyone, however good,  is capable of vile things (the mindless gluttony of her parents, the violence of Haku), and those who seem irredeemably evil (the dangerous No Face and the cruel Yubaba) are quite capable of good. This is much closer to reality than the cookie cutter figures of so many more traditional films, including those intended solely for adults, and of so many  politicians and talk show hosts who define and dismiss our enemies as ""evil doers.""A related message is illustrated by the stinking river god: We are as we are chiefly because of our environment, which includes how we are treated by others. When the  abuses  of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq came to light, many people excused the actions of our troops by saying, ""There are a few rotten apples in every barrel."" The eminent social psychologist Philip Zimbardo replied, ""It isn't the apples that are rotten, it's the barrel."" It is no coincidence that it is the gentle, respectful Chihiro, not the powerful and violent Yubaba, who tames No Face.Some parts of the film may frighten the youngest children. I remember a nephew who at age ten always closed his eyes when the Wicked Witch of the West appeared in Oz. But we cannot forever close our eyes to the things that frighten us, and films such as Spirited Away help us, children and adult alike, open our eyes. That's  partly why we call them magical."	5.0	Magical	2009-02-14	2	2	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AE3N1RQ3ZIVPG	paul lehrman	At this point in time, probably most people are aware of some of Director Miyazaki's movies. Both of my daughters grew up watching pathetic and audience-insulting &#34;cartoon&#34; movies like &#34;Scooby Do&#34;, etc.  I simply had to show them (both at around age 5 or 8 or so) what great animation, art, creativity, and effort could do to turn out a really classic, beautiful film.  Spirited Away is truly unforgettable.  In the past week, my 5 year old has watched this film over two dozen times.  (I have to admit, that I watched a lot of these &#34;reruns&#34; with her).  It is a movie about growing up and rising to the occasion.  The protagonist is a young girl, who's reactions and solutions to unique and sometimes frightening problems show her to be a real heroine.  It was very inspiring for my daughters to see this movie.  If I had to compare the plot with something, &#34;Alice's Adventures Through The Looking Glass&#34; comes to mind.  However, the world that Miyazaki creates and shows in this movie is so much more nuanced and detailed.  It is both threatening and extremely beautiful.  If you are fortunate enough to be able to watch this film, it will really change your outlook on animated films.  I love Pixar movies, but compared to Spirited Away even their best (which I consider to be Toy Story, which for the record I loved both on a technical level and as pure entertainment), looks pretty pale and flat.  I believe that if you rent Spirited Away, you (like me) will have to own it.  I have now seen most of Muyazaki's films, and am simply blown away by the artistry and detail of the worlds he creates for our 90 or so minutes.  But I have a special place for Spirited away.  It was the first Miyazaki film I ever saw (and who can forget a first love?).  The message for young children, especially young women and girls, is so positive and beautiful.  What a gorgeous film.	5.0	What a great film	2014-03-25	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1DV0WZIEHOPUH	Paul Sharpe	Friends - I agree this is one of the most captivating and wildly imaginitive movies ever, but we bought it based on how much my daughter loved Kiki's Delivery Service (she's 7).  Beware - my child was scared to death.  This is very powerful stuff.  The creators of this movie must have done some real trippy drugs or something.  There's an almost oppressive feel to the movie - this kid sees her parents turned to pigs and has to battle her way through some kind of bad LSD trip to rescue them.  If your child is sensitive, and easily sucked into a world of imagination, this movie might blow thier minds.  I'd give it a PG13 rating at least.  If I'd watched it by myself I would have given it 5 stars because it is so wildly, vividly freaky.  Think we'll be sticking to Barney for a while.	4.0	Caution to those who watch	2004-06-27	10	6	4

Seriously, this film is perfect in every sense of the word and, i absolutely love it. Spirited away will enchant anybody who watches it no matter how old they are. I even managed to get my 45 year old dad to watch it and, no joke, he thought it was amazing.This is the highest grossing film ever in Japan and one of the highest grossing animated films in the world, which goes to show how fantastic this film is. I watched this film a total of 5 times in the first week I bought it and, it is very rare for me to watch any film twice, never mind five times in one week. Another point to make is the fact that the dubbing on this film is great. The script was slightly changed for the English version so that the words fit into the japanese speaking mouths of the characters.

(manga is generally considered adult material, anyway). perhaps that is the reason why there is so much skill and style put into their *art* than many american cartoons because it is not only a cartoon, but a form of artistic expression.i wonder too, why people would complain about the PG rating when americans gave ""The Ring"" PG-13. wasn't this movie ""disturbing"" as well? or did i see a different version of it? digimon? please...i defy anyone to explain to me how a ""plot"", as it were, like this one would even be considered an influential item in society.let's see, does a story about disfigured creatures to be used by humans as fighting tools send a more powerful message than a story of the awakening of a young child's lust for life after having experienced the most unfathomable and learning through this the importance of loving one's family and life? hm... difficult decision, i know.but of course.. we all have our preferences...only there is a difference between quality and mere paltriness."	5.0	huh.	2004-08-15	5	2	3

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AJ36PN55LTKC7	Philip Wester	"The Americans ruined Spirited Away (or at least set its quality down by 25%) just like they ruined other great anime (no S in pluralis) like Sailor Moon, Tenchi Muyo and Records of Lodoss War.At least they didn't cut the movie's length down this time, but they altered the dialogue, which is very disturbing as Disney would probably sue whatever country altered the dialogue in THEIR movies! If you're gonna dub a movie, at least use the original dialogue translated literally, but with SOME alterations for fluity.However, the movie is still worth a view, as it's still brilliant and can beat any Disney movie with great lengths. I've got my fingers crossed hoping that it'll win the 2003 Oscar for ""Best animated movie""!As for the animation, it's in Ghibli Studios' standard style. Think ""My Neighbour Totoro"", only with better drawing and coloring techniques. But if you want real-life like anime, then you're out of luck. The animation is brilliant in its own special way, though.As for the part where Americans parents rant on and on about how scary the movie was: Oh, put a sock in it, will ya'! I was outraged when I found out that Americans parents wanted ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" banned from TV just because season 6 had a few love scenes! For a country that's supposed to stand for freedom and intelligence, the parents are quite naive. They raise the children in such a bad way that they get scared by ""Spirited Away"", which I personally wouldn't have found scary when I was 6-10. (I'm 17 now)Yes, the movie does start off slowly and you do sit there sometimes and ask yourself ""What the heck just happened here?"", but once it starts getting good, it only gets better!Definitely worth a view if you want a movie that's not the typical ""Big scary monsters to fight, boy and girl, boy and girl of course fall in love, everything is fine and dandy all the way through, no good guys harmed greatly, super-happy ending""-movie (you know, the way that ALL Disney movies have been ever since the very 1st, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (learn to spell, Disney!)).

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A19W7OJ823OGC2	PinkFloyd1965	"I have always had inclinations to deeply respect Japan; I feel it is one of the most capable artistic centers in the world, akin to '70s USA. Everything about it rings of a combination of art and technology. Much more interesting, though, is how this ties in with common Japanese themes. Just as Final Fantasy VII was a video game, it focused thematically on respect for nature. In the same vein, Miyazaki's Spirited Away (another phenomenal movie) manages to do this through an animated medium.This theme occurs again and again in Japanese cinema in notable works such as Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion. It, quite honestly, never gets old. This is what makes Spirited Away special. While it addresses modern life, it does not focus on the impersonal nature of technology. Spirited Away's focus is entirely its own. Spurred by the depressed indifference Miyazaki found in ""10 year-old girls"" he knew, he created a portrait of a young girl, Chihiro, overcoming obstacles. It's a simple story, designed only to encourage Japan's newest generation. But, what makes it great is the art with which this is accomplished. I call this movie a portrait because it lacks a Western-style plot. It has no distinctive beginning and no end. What causes Chihiro's disillusionment is unknown, and her story does not necessarily end upon leaving the abandoned amusement park where the story takes place. This reflects the Japanese belief that nothing really ends, and serves as a problem for those unaccustomed to this viewpoint. Likewise, there are some complaints about the story from other reviewers that I urge you to dismiss based upon some simple explanations about the movie.First, many note the anti-Western themes. Really, Miyazaki avoids these. Rather than casting blame on others, he avoids classifying Chihiro's original condition as having any cause. This isn't whiny, it's art. Rather than giving in to the audience's primal inclinations to insist that an adverse condition in the individual (Chihiro) is caused by the negative input of society, Miyazaki instead focuses on Chihiro's triumph. In short, this is more of an uplifting movie than some sociocultural blame game. If you want proof of how controlled Japanese animation can be regarding anti-Western sentiment, watch Grave of the Fireflies (from Studio Ghibli). It's hard to find, but it's easily the best war movie I've ever seen (and it features no battle scenes, another amazing instance of artistic control).Also, some reviews noted Chihiro's ""absence of greed"" juxtaposed against her parent's gluttony as indicative of traditional Japanese virtues. This is not so. She does not eat lustily with her parents because she thinks she will get in trouble. Note that she is entirely self-absorbed until her parents are taken captive. Only when she can no longer be disinterested and negative about modern life does she truly change. Yet, the obstacles of life do not change at all. The spirit world remains the same, although it appears in a much more friendly way towards the movie's end. The demeanor of the characters in the movie are all determined by Chihiro's outlook. Even the cold-hearted witch is shown to be a loving grandmother. And despite being easily enraged, she cares dearly for her oversized baby boy.A note on the ratings. The movie is rated PG because it deserves to be rated as such. Here is the first sentence describing the PG rating, straight from [...]""This is a film which clearly needs to be examined or inquired into by parents before they let their children attend.""And people cannot believe it's only rated PG? PG stands for Parental Guidance Suggested. You can be sure that the movie contains some objectionable content, and if your kids don't like ""scary"" movies, then exercise some parental guidance.

I was thrilled afterwards that I was able to see Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi before the film dissappeared. Shame on Disney for not doing more promotion for this film. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi was the highest grossing film in Japanese history, making even more money than Titanic. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi is the story of a little girl named Chihiro who stumbles on an empty amusement park with her parents. When her parents take food which doesn't belong to them from a vendor stand, they are turned into pigs. Chihiro quickly finds out the amusement park is really a spa for Japanese spirits. She is forced into slavery and must work in a bath house run by a witch named Yubaba. During the course of the film Chihiro goes through a journey of self discovery and learns valuable lessons about respect, honor and self reliance. It is only after learning these lessons that Chihiro is able to free her parents and herself. The animation is a stunning combination of hand drawn images and computer animation.

Writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki, is responsible for animated classics such as ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service.""  That's not to also mention perhaps the greatest animated feat since Disney's ""Fantasia,"" ""Princess Mononoke.""  At the 2003 Academy Awards his movie ""Spirited Away"" received the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, with help from well over 100 top-ten lists from some of today's most well known critics.Chihiro is the typical ten-year-old; especially when it comes to moving to a new house and a new way of life.  Already frightened and unsure about the future Chihiro is confronted with a new challenge when her father misses the turnoff to their new home and winds up at the entrance of a seemingly abandon theme park.""It's an abandon theme park . . . they built them everywhere in the early nineties.  Then the economy went bad, and they all went bankrupt.  This must be one of them . . .""Dusk approaches as Chihiro's parents decide to investigate.  They cross a long field of grass and soon pickup on the scent of food lingering in the air.  After several minutes of looking they find several steaming dishes of food at a counter. Chihiro's parents decide to help themselves, even at the requests of Chihiro to leave.  Paying no attention to her Chihiro decides to go for a walk and shortly after runs into the mysterious young character, Haku, who hastily insists that she leave before dark.  But it is too late.  Large, ghostlike shadows begin to appear out of encroaching dusk.  Chihiro runs to where her parents are eating only to find two enormous pigs where her parents once sat.  Horrified, Chihiro calls out their names to no avail.  She tries to run away, only to find the field she had crossed earlier, is now a lake.It is here that Chihiro encounters an enchanting new world that will test her own abilities, and make light of the ones within her.I know most folks are thinking this is another one of them ""coming of age"" stories.  And maybe you're right.  But you're wrong to grade ""Spirited Away"" by same criteria as the Hollywood same-old-same-old.  Yes, the movie is animated, which probably sends most people's thoughts of the movie straight to the ""kiddie realm,"" and I'd have to say you're wrong again.  Hayao Miyazaki is heavily credited for re-inventing the definition of animation.  Though his characters are drawn, the essence they encapsulate is so much more than people give credit for.  His stories are deep, enthralling, and touching.  They strike at the very chord of human imagination, and all its capacities.After the first five minutes of this movie, I forgot I was watching ""cartoon"" characters and began to see them as real people; which ironically happens in just about all of Miyazaki's films.  Miyazaki redefines the genre of animation by giving thought into every aspect of his work.  The backgrounds are rich in detail and deep in soul. Every shot has been specifically placed to tell the story in its amazing entirety.  In fact Miyazaki personally checks and re-checks every drawing that will be placed in the final cut. Animation allows the plot to shine and Miyazaki's original concepts to surface in a way that has never been done before.  This is a man that takes pride in his work, and it is a fact that is strongly evident in every epic he creates.Although the movie places a strong emphasis on entertaining the younger crowd, several subtle messages are placed in various points throughout the film.  One example would be that of the character No Face who offers those in the bathhouse with gold.  We later find that No Face is actuality a monster who eats other spirits.  I believe this is representative of opportunities that are too good to be true.  If you're not careful they'll take you down with them.  Also, Kamaji, the boiler room man, at first tries to dissuade Chihiro from getting a job by proclaiming that there are none left.  However, we find that Chihiro's adherent persistence eventually gets her a job.  And perhaps the most evident is that of Chihiro signing away her name to the witch Yubaba for a job.  Yubaba gives her the name Sen, and as we work our way through the film we find that Chihiro begins to forget her old name until she is helped by Haku.  In this way symbolizing the thought that we must never forget who we are, regardless of circumstance.With this movie Hayao Miyazaki has again teamed up with famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi.  Hisaishi does a great job at articulating screen to sheet; every note resonates with the essence of the movie.  I heartily believe that the movie could not have reached its full potential without the musical direction of Mr. Hisaishi.This is an excellent DVD set worthy of any cinematic collection that strives for greatness.  By far this is the best-marketed and extra-featured DVD that any of Miyazaki's movies have enjoyed in the states.But perhaps the most enjoyable feature is the Nippon Television Special - The Making of The Film (Spirited Away) on the bonus disc.  The television special shows the inner workings of the Studio Ghibli animation company.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound gives a more lifelike feel to the film, and the included original Japanese language track is always on the checklist for hardcore anime fans.The only downside of the DVD set is the ""Spirited Away"" introduction by John Lasseter at the beginning of the movie.  Disney's last hope in taking some credit for Hayao Miyazaki's work.  Ah, but I digress the movie speaks for more than itself and is one of the finer things in life that make it so enjoyable.Miyazaki San, you never cease to amaze . . ."	5.0	Another Masterpiece from Director Hayao Miyzaki	2004-01-02	19	15	4
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A16837CKPTA07O	"P. Rudnicki ""cynderela23"""	Disney made a brilliant choice when they decided to bring the works of Miyazaki to the U.S.! I remember when I was ten watching Warriors of the Wind for the first time. It was truely an art form, even if it was edited beyond belief! Anyone who liked Warriors of the Wind will truely enjoy Spirited Away. Chihiro is moving to the suburbs with her mother and father, and they decide to make a stop on the way to explore. What they find is an old abandoned theme park with the alluring smells of food drifting on the wind.When Chihiro's parents finially find the food they were seaching for they gourge themselfs on it without asking permission and turn into pigs!Now Chihiro has to work for a spirit who runs the park to free her parents. Giving up her name and losing her memory in the process.I will not give away the whole plot, but I will say that children and adults alike will come to love this movie with it's brilliant animation and beautiful soundtrack.Spirited Away has an amazing likeness to Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland, in it's quality to keep you guessing on what can happen next. Watch it, and I promise you will be running out to see the rest of Studio Ghibli's masterpieces!	5.0	I was spirited away!!	2003-05-10	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AGJDJD3BBKPJH	Quen	You say you are a huge fan of anime and list 'Digimon' with clear conscience?'Spirited Away' is among those animes that have a message, that go a bit...'deeper' than the usual anime that is shown on american TV and that have alot more seriousness than any Disney movie... There are alot of allusions to japanese mythology and gods in this movie. It's most definitely not 'robbed of any plot'.Most probably, you haven't even heard of 'Princess Mononoke' (which is from the same director as the reviewed film), 'Neon Genesis Evangelion', 'X' or other serious anime?In Japan, Miyazaki's film 'Princess Mononoke' was the biggest box-office hit of all time (bigger than Titanic was)...and when 'Spirited Away' came to the cinemas, it even topped 'Mononoke'. That could not happen in America, because in Japan, anime is not just considered 'childish' entertainment, but art. Many animes and mangas are not made for children. This one is, though. Maybe you should try 'Princess Mononoke'. I suppose if you don't like that one too you should maybe reconsider, if it is really anime that you are a 'huge fan' of.	5.0	Concerning the Emotionally Disturbed Reviewer	2004-07-26	4	3	1

I consider myself a picky anime lover; not all will do but a few will blow me away, and this is one of those few. Spirited Away has a great overall moral to it's story: growing up and becoming selfless. In the beginning, our protagonist, Chiyo, is your typical teen. But when forces beyond her control leave her to fight to save her parents, she surprisingly steps up to bat. With each trial and tribulation, Chiyo discovers that perhaps there are more important things in life, a bigger picture if you will. Now, this is done in Miyazaki's crazy way of storytelling, but if you're open culturally, this film's for you.	5.0	One of the best anime films out there	2009-04-21	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2LNJI7JJ4LKZC	Raghuveer	"When am among friends and discuss movies and mention animation, many people I know switch off almost immediately. `Duh, animation?' and `I don't watch kids movies' are the most oft heard remarks. They are partly right of course - many animation movies do cater to kids and it is hard for adults to be enthused about them. But I suspect the real reason is because these are too predictable and have become formulaic. Take almost any Hollywood animation production these days and a common strand can be found among them - mind-blowing images and an ensemble of a righteous (and reluctant) hero, an amusing side-kick, a true blue villain and other cronies providing humor - all voiced by celebrities. The storyline is almost always the same - some destination to go to or a goal/adventure to be accomplished. And the dialogues, always full of pun, so much so that you almost long for some straight talk. After all, there can be too much of a good thing.As a breath of fresh air, comes Japanese animation from the famous studio `Ghibli' headed by Miyazaki who is renowned by many as one of the best living animators and one of the last practitioners of hand-drawn animation. Yes, no computers for him - he faithfully pens all the images that you will see in his movies. This movie is probably his masterpiece and deservedly won the Oscar in 2003 for the `Best animated movie'.The movie is a coming-of-age story of a 10-year old girl, Chihiro. The story details how a little brat transforms into a responsible and hard-working girl. Miyazaki is also an environmentalist - he uses a few scenes in the movie to convey his message (a scene when a river spirit is cleansed by removing mud and other junk from within it is not for the faint-hearted, it may make you retch!).Though the images do not have the depth of those in say - `Shrek'or `The Incredibles', they seem very fresh and one feels like s/he is seeing a faithful adaptation of comics on screen. Miyazaki lingers on each vista and lets the viewer soak in the scenery. One sequence when Chihiro takes a train ride to an unknown destination will stay with me for a long time.If you are a fan of animation and haven't seen this yet, I promise this will become one of your favorites. If you are not, I urge you to take a shot at this anyway. An LA Times critic sums it up best ""it's got a magical air of once-upon-a-time, a fairy-tale quality reminiscent of the unexpurgated works of the Brothers Grimm"".As for me, I watched this on a big screen TV when I was alone at a friend's place and truly felt that I experienced magic on screen."	5.0	Thumbs up!	2006-03-20	3	1	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3VHUQ85RH0BC3	"Raj ""rajivsreviews"""	"Until this movie came out, I had never seen an anime cartoon in my life. Even when the movie released in the theatres I didn't pay much attention to it. In 2003, I was watching the Oscars, and I discovered this movie won an award for the best animated feature. Curious to find out more about this movie, I decided to rent it and take a look at it. After watching ""Spirited Away"", I was in complete awe. This was one of the best animated movies that I had even seen!""Spirited Away"" is the story about a young girl Chihiro, who is moving to a new home with her parents. However, her father takes a `short-cut' during the trip, and somehow they end up in an abandoned theme park. While strolling through the park, Chihiro's parents smell something delicious, and find out that the restaurants in the parks are filled with mouth-watering food. They start gobbling up the food, while Chihiro gets worried, thinking that they are in big trouble. Soon the weather starts changing and Chihiro starts seeing apparitions walking around the park. Terrified, Chihiro runs to her parents to get out of the place, but is horrified to see that they have turned into pigs. She soon finds that she is now in a completely different world where the spirits walk the Earth, and through the help of her new found friend Haku, she has to survive in this strange land.The main reasons why I liked this movie is because of:i) (M)iyazaki's wonderful story: I would have never been introduced to watching Miyazaki's other movies if I had not seen this.ii) (A)dventure: From cleaning the stinking River God, and taking care of `No Face', to her train journey in the end, this movie was filled with excitement and adventure.iii) (G)reat Story: In a way, this movie is like `Alice in Wonderland'. Both the movies talk about a depressed and bored girl, who is suddenly transported into this strange fantasy world, where everything is different, and tries to find their way back. However, even though there are some similarities, I wouldn't call one a copy of another, because `Spirited Away' has a completely different charm to it, and is unique in its own way.iv) (I)ntrigue: The story of this movie is very surreal, revolving around strange and mysterious characters (such as No Face) that keep us entertained.v) (C)olorful: The animation for this movie is wonderful. It is like a breath of fresh air from other animated movies.vi) (A)dequate Translation: I saw the English version of the movie, and didn't find it too bad. Daveigh Chase did a good job of giving voice to Chihiro, as did Suzanne Pleshette, Susan Egan and Jason Marsden for the other charactersvii) (L)ovely Background Score: Music plays an integral part in any movie, and the score for this movie is amazing.The first letter of the above 7 points describes the whole movie in one word: MAGICAL (which it is). Therefore, for those who have not seen this movie as of yet, get it now and see it!"	5.0	Magical!	2005-07-16	2	2	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AP397HRS2GE68	Rebecca M. Henely	"Personally, I prefer Princess Mononoke because of the complexity of its story.  Nevertheless, the beauty and wonder of Spirited Away can not be denied.  The plot of a girl making her way without her parents has been done before, but Miyazaki proves the tale can still be fresh.  Chihiro/Sen is a wonderful character: a petulant and occasionally bratty child who becomes brave and learns to rely on herself in a dangerous and strange world.  I also appreciated her sweet romance with Haku, a young man who helps her and soon turns out to be much more than he seems.  But not only Haku, Chihiro ends up facing many strange and wonderful creatures in the witch's bathouse.  A lake God polluted beyond recognition, a many-armed man who works the heaters, an enormous baby who is turned into a mouse ...All of these characters and this world is created lovingly by Miyazaki.  The animation, which remains mostly hand-drawn, is a wonder to behold.  The characters move so fluidly and realistically, and the designs of some of the gods is unlike any seen before.  After watching this film, the viewer feels like they have journeyed through an entirely new world.  It's amazing.The movie also features a beautiful score that's both magical and haunting.  I loved it.DVD features for the movie are also top-notch.  My favorite was the ""Making of"" which gave a look at the animation process in Japan and a glimpse of Miyazaki in action.  The interviews with the American voice actors were also interesting, but on the whole I prefer subtitles.This is a wonderful movie that I recommend to all.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	"Anime Vs. Disney. Anime Vs. Disney. Anime Vs. Disney.Who gives a damn?Anyway, ""Spirited Away"" follows the story of Chihiro (AKA Sen) as she is separated from her parents during their move to a new town, and her subsequent adventures in the Spirit World. Along the way she makes some friends, defeats some enemies and tries her hardest to be reunited with Mom and Dad, and get home.The first and most important thing about ""Spirited Away"" is the quality of the storyline. In my opinion, it fulfills more of the ""Kids-Movies-For-Adults"" criteria than any of the Harry Potters to date, becuase of the truly universal themes contained therein - love, loss, family bonds, friendship - and becuase of the innate charm and beautifully-crafted characterisation of the characters. Chihiro is a plucky and adventurous girl, Haku is her straight-laced mystical counterpart, Yubaba is perhaps the most enjoyable villainess since Disney's Maleficent. The story unfolds with a total lack of pretension and a gentle, yet enthralling, pace, and the whole shebang moves with such an elegant and effortless grace that we are begging to be taken along for the ride.Animation-wise, if ""Shrek 2"" is the current king of CGI, then the hand-drawn crown absolutely must go to ""Spirited Away"". The first thing we notice is the glorious colour of the Spirit world, the hodgepodge of western and eastern architectural styles and the straight-from-a-child's-imagination renderings of Yubaba and her consort Gods are all flawless in their movement. Hand-drawn animation may be a dying art form, but with such a brilliant and beautiful swan song as this, it will never be forgotten. Even those of us without an understanding of the Hand-Drawn animation process can only sit back and be amazed at the quality and clarity of Chihiro, Haku, Yubaba et al. Landscapes and interiors chew on the scenery all by themselves, and provide a visually enthralling stage against which the wonderful players tell us the story.To wonder if our children will enjoy ""Spirited Away"" is, I believe, an insult to their powers of imagination and cognition - this is a timeless and classic tale full of familiar themes and top-notch characters, and, when it's done with such an endearing naivete, I'd never once hesitate to recommend ""Spirited Away"" to the parents of any child, any age, and from any culture.A classic that must be seen to be understood, and thoroughly recommended."	5.0	Stunning and Moving	2004-08-22	4	3	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2H9UO8RYFX5MB	"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich"""	There is so much that could be said about Hayao Miyazaki's incredible tale of a little girl lost in a new world, it's difficult to even know where to begin. Since others have already said so much, I'll try to keep it short.&quot;Spirited Away&quot; has all the ingredients of a classic fairy tale, but told using a modern medium. In just over two hours, it accomplishes the admirable goal of establishing a new world, one experienced for the first time by the young human girl Chihiro, later called Sen. As first her parents are changed, so Chihiro changes as she learns how best to adapt to this new environment, though Chihiro is changed in far more subtle (and perhaps more permanent) ways.Comparisons to L. Frank Baum's &quot;Oz&quot; series, or perhaps even more, Lewis Carroll's &quot;Alice&quot; books, are entirely apt. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; shares the best elements of those classic stories: frightening situations, mysterious characters, a sense of humor, and an unquenchable sense of wonder and magic. As Chihiro adapts to and comes to terms with this strange new place and the new people she has to interact with, we are given a rare treat... a glimpse into something we've never seen before, through the eyes and sensibilities of a child.The DVD presentation is even better than expected, with excellent image and sound reproduction. What's more, the second DVD includes extras that are actually worth watching. In particular, the Nippon TV special includes some enticing segments showing Miyazaki working on &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; conveying his ideas to the rest of those working on the film. The DVD is well worth watching more than once, and will be a happy addition to my small (but growing) collection.What's best about the DVD, however, is unquestionably the film itself. Steeped in Japanese culture and mythology, and yet universal in its themes, it is a film which is worthy of the best tales we pass down to our children, and to our children's children. The story is unique, and yet it should have meaning for anyone who sees it, particularly those who remember with fondness the rare magic that a good story can weave.

Chihiro's development from a sulky, complainsome girl into a strong-willed and friendly young woman is something that's amazing itself. Unlike most Disney films, Spirited Away has lots more than just one message in the film, and each one is more deeper than you'd think. For instance, I had explain to my MOTHER what all the junk and stuff spilling out from the Stink Spirit meant!I know a few people who dislike the whole thing with Kaonashi(No-Face) and the train trip. First of all, the whole deal with No-Face was that he wanted to enter Chihiro's heart, but he thought he could do it by offering her gold. He was just lonely; which was also the theme for the trip to the Sixth Station. All those faceless 'shadow people' looked like they were lonely too, and that whole scene with the little faceless girl watching the train pass by really gripped my heart for some reason. Combined with Joe Hisashi's beautifull orchestrated score, the scene, I think, was one of the best parts in the movie.As many have said before me, the PG rating is there for a reason. Hello, doesn't the 'Some Scary Moments' tag ring a bell?Those parents should view this film first if they're that concerned about the content, and also, they shouldn't just dismiss this as a children's film; it can be enjoyed by anyone.This is anime at its best, people.Everybody who's remotely interested in GOOD cinema should see this at least once.	5.0	A masterpiece that should be viewed by the open-minded.	2003-05-04	21	20	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AOFOHHFY9PN	"Robotech_Master ""robotech_master_01"""	Spirited Away is one of the greatest movies made in the last five years, and one of the greatest animated movies of all time.  Given the movie's impressive record on review-aggregator sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, I don't feel the need to reiterate what so many before me have already said (and what I've already said in reviews elsewhere).  Suffice it to say that this is a fantastic emotional roller coaster ride and a feast for the eyes and ears that is not to be missed.  Slightly scary in places, but well-suited for most kids six to seven and up, and some kids younger than that.As far as the DVD is concerned, the picture is very good (mitigated only by a small glitch involving the alternate angle English language version of the title screen), the audio is excellent, and the extra features are among the best extra features ever included on an anime DVD.  Several interesting documentary clips, both English and Japanese, can be found herein, as well as an introduction by Pixar honcho John Lasseter (who also excec-produced the dub), 30 minutes of Japanese trailers, and various other things like that.The original Japanese-language version is the best, of course, but the dub isn't half bad either.  Daveigh Chase does an excellent job as the movie's maturing heroine, and the supporting cast also does good work.  Haku's voice comes off as maybe a little harsh, but I can live with it.	5.0	Fabulous movie, excellent DVD	2003-04-18	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, ""Spirited Away,"" a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned ""amusement park"" that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la ""Carnival of Souls"").  After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that ""Spirited Away"" might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.  The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do.  For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?  The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that ""Spirited Away"" has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well.""Spirited Away"" offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care."	3.0	a minority, dissenting view	2003-05-03	20	14	6
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A7FZ9X0B6QBS3	Ronald E. Olivier	If you've ever enjoyed watching any incarnation of Lewis Carroll's &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; or &#34;Through the Looking Glass&#34;, then you will absolutely LOVE this film from Hayao Miyazaki.  Though this movie has a similar feel to the Carroll classics, with characters exploring alternate realities filled with wondrous beings and events, I think that Spirited Away is far more complex, interesting, and appealing.The film centers on Chihiro, who's introduced as a whiny fussbudget of a 10-year old girl who's family is moving to a new home.  Her father takes a wrong turn en route and comes across a tunnel in a building.  He and her mom decide to investigate, much to Chihiro's chagrin.  I watched her reaction - a growing anxiety - and immediately saw the very actions of my own daughter  reacting to things that frightened her when she was younger.  I was amazed at the detail of the animation...and I was hooked.The remainder of the film - clocking in at almost two hours - was no less enthralling.  Once through the tunnel, Chihiro's mom and dad follow their curiousity (and their appetite) to an abandoned theme park's food court, while Chihiro timidly explores some the rest of the park.  It begins to get late and the darkness comes, and everything changes - including her parents who have been turned into hogs!The rest of the movie explores the world that Chihiro has unwittingly stumbled into.  It's a spiritual realm centered in a bath house where the spirits come and go.  Yet as fanciful and interesting as these characters are, it is Chihiro that remains the centerpiece around which the rest of the story revolves.  She must be careful not to lose her identity, and must endure in order to transform her mom and dad back to human form.  Unlike Alice, Chihiro grows in confidence and courage as the film progresses.Part of what makes this film work so well is that the viewer can put aside any prejudice as to which characters are 'good' and which are 'evil'.  Few characters, if any, can be so simply pigeonholed.  A good example is Haku, who befriends Chihiro but also is a flunkie who does the dirty work for his boss, Yubaba.  Even Yubaba, the closest thing to a villain in the film, doesn't fit neatly into that role.And despite this being a film &#34;aimed at 10 year-old girls&#34;, it has a lot to say about things like greed, ecology, gluttony, friendship, and love (true sacrificial love, not starry-eyed romance) that adults can appreciate.  But, unlike so many recent animated movies, the movie is not schizophrenic in it's presentation of these things.  Things are not 'built into' the story to keep the adults attention.  There is simply one story being told here, one that is simple enough for 10-year old, yet deep enough to appeal to any age or maturity level.  The result is a masterpiece that is worth seeing over and over.	5.0	Beautiful and engrossing.  This is what animation should be.	2014-01-04	0	0	0

I read one review about someone's 8 year old being scared to death about the parents tunring into pigs. So I definitley would not reccomend this movie for younger ages. If you are looking for a japanese anime movie for younger children, try kiki's delivery service. The only anime movies i saw before this one was the pokemon movies and kiki delvery service, but this one is weird, but yet, I love it.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AH4IRHFUFERTZ	"Royce E. Buehler ""figvine"""	"Chihiro, a typical slightly spoiled ten year old girl, wanders off the beaten path with her parents, and is thrust into a bewildering otherworld. Her parents have soon fallen under a malign enchantment, and suddenly it falls to her, with the aid of a mysteriously familiar boy named Haku, to rescue them. She has to decide where to place her trust, as it becomes apparent that Haku is in the service of the villainous tyrant grandmother Yabubu, who rules over this otherworld.It is Chihiro's spirit that steers her through these uncharted waters. We watch her discover in herself and exhibit, tentatively at first but with growing confidence, all of the virtues a fairy-tale hero must learn: resourcefulness, compassion, politeness (hey, this *is* Japanese!) and courage. Because we've witnessed her ordinary beginnings, we identify with and believe in all her emerging qualities. It's all done with a deft matter-of-fact touch that never cloys and never preaches. The animation is quietly dazzling. The plot is dense and full of surprises. The symbolism is as exotic as a Shinto shrine, and as familiar as the echos set up by the best fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen or old Russia.The cream of American animation for children in recent years - films like Aladdin or Monsters Inc - have drawn in audiences with screenplays written on a double track: a simple, comforting story for the kids, and a long series of nods and winks over the kids' heads to the adults, catering to our sense of irony and patting us on the back for catching all the topical and cinematic references. And that's been fun as far as it goes.""Spirited Away"" throws all that into the dustbin, goes back to the basics, to the conventions and surprises of timeless fairy tale, to a character-based humor that appeals to all ages, and to the sense of wonder that reawakens the child in everyone. It's an hour and a half of pure, funny poetry. It hits every mark it aims for. It's an unqualified classic. And it will become the first DVD I buy for my two year old grandson, even though it will have to be held in trust until he turns six, and can watch it without being freaked out by the spooky parts."	5.0	I was Blown Away	2003-02-18	125	118	7

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1O5PVMDLZLBO6	R. Scott	You can read the descriptions of the plot anywhere. But what is missing is the story behind the movie.  I never heard of this director or his works before. It was in a review I read in Osaka that spoke of him. Later I caught his name when a Disney Animator talked about him in obvious awe. In the story I read in Japan Miyazaki-san did something I can only imagine.  He would draw thousands of frames himself. His style is that of ancient Japanese art. This is a man who does so for the love of the works results rather than a box office take. So when I finally saw this movie with English subtitles I was not only caught up with the story, characters and rich beauty but I was in awe of the details and timing and work done by Miyazaki-san.  Details you would never see even in the best that Disney can offer.  Afterthoughts, things going on all over the screen. Things that no computer could do (Miyazaki-san disdains computers).  Its an amazing thing when you realize what he had done. Even Maxim magazine, believe it or not, said they didn't understand it, but it was and I quote &quot;beautiful&quot;. Talk about praise from an unexpected source. The efforts in this movie are only touched on when you see the Japanese special (especially informative on animation construction).This movie came and went in one week showing in one theater in all of Syracuse. My family wasn't interested so they never saw it in the U.S. I saw it in Japan and told my wife about it.  It came through town again and she took the kids to see it.  They sat quiet for the whole movie and talked about it for a week.Everyone who has seen it has been floored by it.Remember when you see this movie that many things are said through silence and done so well that you get the message. Thoughts conveyed with eye movement rather than dialogs. The details you pick up whether you want to or not will amaze you. Also remember that Magic does not always makes sense.The only thing I saw wrong with this DVD was not the movie itself but when the President of Pixar brought Miyazaki-san in front of the camera, pointed to it and presented him to the world. Miyazaki-san's obvious discomfort to this publicity was embarrassing. I cannot fault the Pixar's guy for his enthusiasm but I saw a man who did not do something like this for such publicity.So skip that part and go right to the movie. Sit back by yourself or better with a crowd and enjoy.  I also suggest you buy it if you can afford it. You will watch it again.	5.0	A Great Movie from a Master in the Art	2004-04-08	4	3	1

For instance, it won the Golden Bear at the Berlinale in Germany Spring 2002. It was the first time ever, that an animation movie won this prize, since it resembles the German equivalent to the ""Best Picture"" category. I will not give a list of all the Top10 lists it is on here, there are to many.Personally, I like this movie, since it reaches excellence in both technical as well narrative elements.Though I also like fully CGI-animated movies, animes have the tendency to transport subtle feelings and changes of moods in a more realistic way. Spirited away tells a story that appeals to growing-ups and grown-ups. The hardship of Sen to survive in a world of ghastly and strange creatures, the responsibility for the faith of her parents and the necessarity to overcome her shyness and fears in order to save a friend dos not tell a new story. We have seen similiar plots in movies like ""Stand by me"" before.

Dejonghe ""Ryan"""	"SPIRITED AWAY is one of Studio Ghibili's most recognized films, having won Academy Awards in both America and Japan, as well as winning the German Golden Bear. SPIRITED AWAY may receive additional recognition now that its director (and Studio Ghibili's co-founder) Hayao Miyazaki has announced his last film. Many critics consider SPIRITED AWAY to be scrumtrulescent--the zenith of animated cinematography and story telling.SPIRITED AWAY is suited mainly to the younger and more imaginative viewing crowd. Those more advanced in years who have become accustomed to more traditional film may be put off. Or, in the words of my parents, ""this is the weirdest thing I have ever seen"".Writer and director Miyazaki ties in rich and deep meaning throughout the film; much of that meaning is full of symbolism more easily recognized in Japanese culture. Even so, most creative-minded audience members will still appreciate the various spirits: wind, river, and even turnip. Some of these elements lend themselves to a more scary nature and may frighten a younger audience. Parents be warned, just because Walk Disney Pictures brought this film into the States and dubbed English speaking actors into the film does not mean it's not scary--much of it is.Personally, much of this film was lost on me--until I sought out articles that defined the hidden meanings. Yes, this film is beautiful and irresistible to watch, but the story is incomplete without fully understanding all of its underlying connotations. If I knew the full meaning going into the movie, I would easily give this over five stars, but because I had to do after-viewing research, this film drops down to four stars."	4.0	"A Beautiful Film Whose Meaning May Be ""Weirded Away"" On Some"	2013-10-15	5	3	2

When I went to see it in English, however, there were kids that were 8 yrs old and below... mostly in the range age of 4-6. That was really bad. The first 30 min into the movie kids started to cry and go out of the theaters and start to talk. By the time the movie was over more than half the theater was empty.

The drawing and coloring was again as great as I expected. The movie starts in a very mysterious setting leaving you a little scared what would come next. As movie passes on you start to see new kinds of spirits. Not many of them are bad, they are just seeking a resting place away from materialistic world. The movie is in general not meant to be about scary ghosts or vengeful spirits. It is actually about coexistence of men and spirits and how they try to reach a balance. In cases spirits help men or vice versa. Myazaki explains in the special features how this animation is based on his real life experience and it seems that he actually modeled the little girl after a friends daughter whom he knew.I think generally this is a good movie and I also recommend that you have a look at other Ghibli creations too.	5.0	Mysterious, full of spirits	2006-09-23	5	3	2

The first time I saw it was as a weekly arthouse feature at my local cinema, and I was blown away by the beautiful storyline, appealing characters, and sweeping animation and musical score.  At the time, I thought that Pixar had done a fantastic job with the dubbing.A couple of years afterwards, I bought the DVD and watched the original Japanese version, and have never felt the same about the English dub.  While the vocal performances are quite good, the writing manages to muddle and stink up the original dialogue.  Sometimes the changes are subtle: ""god"" in the original becomes ""spirit"" in the dub (I admit to knowing no Japanese; perhaps the Japanese word is the same for both?).  Other times, it's more blatant.  Disney seems to have felt the need to dumb this film down (""Americanize"" it, if you will) to the point where they added explanatory dialogue to fill in what in the original were great moments of silence.  Obviously I can't tell you what they are without disclosing spoilers, but some of the mysteries of the film are ruined by this ""over-dubbing,"" and more than one transition is destroyed by it.Fortunately for us, we have DVD technology; and this particular release is excellent, in that it gives us the dubbed version in addition to the original Japanese with its own set of more literal subtitles.  These subtitles sometimes go too quickly, but this film is so beautiful that it bears repeated viewings anyway.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB	"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First"""	I saw &#65533;Spirited Away&#65533; two times in Spain (in Spanish, naturally), and it has become my absolute favourite of all of Hayao Miyazaki&#65533;s films. Miyazaki is, for me, the epitome of Japanese animation and the undisputed master of his craft. He fills the screen with minute details, doing most of the painstaking animation by hand in an age of computer animation (see Disney). His films are always unique both in visual style and in plot, expressing lost mythologies, alternate worlds, and the spirits that surround us. In Japan anime is not only for children, a concept which Western audiences have difficulty understanding. These are more than mere cartoons; they are explorations of self, nature, and in some ways Japanese society (there are frequently Japanese elements in many of Miyazaki&#65533;s films although most are set in fictitious places).&#65533;Spirited Away&#65533; tells the lovely story of Chihiro, a ten-year-old Japanese girl that is moving to a new town. Along the way the family stops to explore a mysterious tunnel that turns out to be a pathway into an alternate world filled with gods, witches and strange creatures. Chihiro&#65533;s parents are transformed into large pigs as punishment for their gluttony (there are frequently morals in Miyazaki&#65533;s tales as well), and Chihiro begins work for the witch Yubaba while desperately trying to find a cure for her parents before they are eaten (!). She befriends Haku, a mysterious boy whom she feels some past connection to, and together the two attempt to overthrow the tyrannical reign of Yubaba.A gorgeous film, with a beautiful soundtrack by frequent Miyazai collaborator Joe Hisaishi (&#65533;Princess Mononoke,&#65533; &#65533;Kiki&#65533;s Delivery Service,&#65533; &#65533;Totoro&#65533;). There are some elements that may be disturbing to very young children (the threat of Chihiro&#65533;s parents being eaten even as a pig&#65533;s head is shown at a feast, several scary rampages, some blood), but overall this is an excellent, quality film that is a feast for the eyes, ears, and imagination, and a true journey of the spirit.	5.0	A remarkable journey	2003-02-11	20	20	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3ICOKGFYJOPQO	SarahIK	Spirited Away is truly a precious movie that I hold dearly in my heart.  I definitely recommend it.  After watching this movie, I started watching Miyazaki's other movies, and all of them are just as amazing.  Miyazaki's movies are very refreshing, and they always make me feel better.  When something in my life is hard, I watch one of his movies, and I feel like I can deal with anything that comes my way, and more.  I realize not everyone will feel the same way, but do at least give this movie a try!	5.0	Words Can't Even Begin To Express How Great This Movie Is	2012-01-16	4	4	0

This is a true artist with a vehicle for telling the most creative and beautiful stories.  Spirited Away was the first movie we saw by him and quickly became one of many.  I am pretty stricked when it comes to age appropriate material, so I will add that I wouldn't show it to anyone under 10.  Most of his movies are for this age group.  Totoro, which is our families favorite, is fine for any age.	5.0	An absolute MUST see!!!	2010-02-01	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2GQ7EUWPSB0OP	Sarakani	A friend introduced me to this short magical film that does not have a distinctive story etched to the contcatanating skeins of a vividly visual experience.  I really loved this fairly new concept (perhaps a hitherto but underexposed aspect of Oriental culture) in a spirit world, parrallel to our own where ghosts can converge to have a bath and a little girl, lost in it does her utmost to save her porcine parents from being eaten up.  Fortunately she has friends, queer, wonderful friends and the means to hand if only she trusts herself/others and her own heart in a multidimensional adventure in which one is never sure what could happen next.  Overall there are little vignettes of a strange spirit world and it leads to a conclusion but not a conventional ending.  This film is not just for children though children would enjoy it and find it scary.  A very wholesome, lavish expose of the ghost world and its interaction with our seemingly more real domain.  Quite magical.	5.0	Who needs a bath?	2005-08-11	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2WQNHK82VTJWT	Sardan	It is mind-boggling that the biggest hit in Japanese cinema history is virtually unknown in the U.S. There are so many good reviews of this movie, yet I had to add my own because this movie is a quite literally a classic.As a rule, American animated films are made for children. But this is for adults, or at least older kids. (It has imagery that could disturb young children.) That said, it is a visually gorgeous, richly layered film. It is sad that Disney has announced an end to their own traditional 2-D animated films (in favor of rendered 3-D a la Finding Nemo), because Spirited Away shows how powerful and effective the medium can be.In an era of formulaic movies, it is wonderful to see a work of such blazing originality. One thing we tend to take for granted in most movies is how predictable the characters are. Good guys are purely virtuous. Bad guys are purely evil. But in this movie, the young girl who is the main character starts off rather shallow and self-absorbed. It's not clear for much of the movie whether mysterious apprentice who helps her early on is good or evil. Virtually all the characters have more depth than is needed to move the story along; that's one of the many elements that combine to lift this movie out of the realm of the ordinary.It's no surprise why this movie is relatively unknown in the U.S.: it was underpromoted when it was released here, it's by a director few Americans have ever heard of (though he's a legend in Japan), it doesn't have voice acting by big-name stars, and it doesn't have a plot that lends itself to sound-bite descriptions.But PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy it. It should be part of every film-lover's collection. My biggest regret about this movie is that it doesn't have a director's audio track (yes, I know it would have to be translated), since I would love to get deeper insights into what Myazaki was thinking in every scene.Once you have seen for yourself how good this movie is, don't forget to check out other Myazaki films. They're not all works of genius, as this one is, but they're all quite good and well worth the price.	5.0	Truly an overlooked classic	2004-07-31	3	2	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A23BDGODZVA1OZ	saserfrac	This movie drags on with very few moments to keep you interested.  I think it is cultural differences, though Japanese animation is truely inferior to Disney classics.  However I give it three stars because the director seemed to put his heart into it and tried to be as original as possible.  The sad thing is, with all its originality it hardly entertained me or moved me.	3.0	An epic only because needless segments weren't cut	2003-12-21	26	3	23
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A5AYV2HSQF7OE	Sasha	"I bought this movie with the very high hopes of watching an entertaining, artsy, beautiful story packed to the brim with excitement and great characters.  What I got was nothing of the kind.  I watched this with 2 other people, both of whom hated it also, and we've seen a lot of movies.  After 20 minutes of watching it, I remarked that I would give this movie an ""F"" at this point.  The other two in the room agreed wholeheartedly.  We kept waiting, watching, and hoping for it to improve in any way, shape, or form.  No such luck.  It actually got worse, because THERE IS NO STORY HERE!  Nothing makes any sense at all.  The characters never come to life in any way that makes any sense, the goal of the heroine never becomes apparent, and you're left waiting for the end.  After one hour of complete and utter misery, we fast-forwarded and were very glad we did, because the ending also makes no sense!  So WHY WATCH IT?  and why do people rave on and on about it?  I think one reviewer has hit the nail on the head: people are only pretending to like it because they think it makes them sound intellectual.  On a scale from one to ten, we rate it a ZERO, but if you could take the scale and actually drop it on the movie, and destroy it, that might be entertaining!"	1.0	What is going on in this movie??

This is a cumulation of a fantastic story...amazing art that tingles the senses...and a moving soundtrack. All alone are tributes to themselves. Together they form the masterpiece that is this film.I do not review here often and when I do, I tend to score low. That said, I do not give this movie 5 stars lightly. Great film making is very much alive thanks to the talents and hard work of Miyazaki and crew.	5.0	Refined talent leads to masterpiece	2003-04-21	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AR1T36GLLAFFX	Scott FS	If you've never seen this animated gem, I guarantee that you've never seen anything like it.  As of this writing, there are 921 reviews here (!), so I won't comment on the plot except to say a middle-class Japanese family is transported into a magical world were the rule of reality don't apply.I will say that I saw this film a year or so ago.  One mark of the personal importance of a film is if it comes back to you when someone asks about films they should see, or if snippets of the film pop into your mind unbidden.  That is the case with 'Spirited Away'.This is one of those films that one must see if one wants to understand the state of modern film.  I'm not a big 'cartoon' buff (though to call this a cartoon is to call Shakespeare a hack writer), and I've seen a couple of Japanese anime films, but I enjoyed 'Paprika'.This should be on a list of the top 25 animated films of all time.  In fact, it should be in the top 10.  And it should be in the top 100 films of any type.It's amazing.  Very, very highly recommended.  Do yourself a favor; become a more well-rounded and well-informed film connoisseur and watch this film.  Today.	5.0	Stunning, and a movie you will always remember	2010-12-22	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A129G02P2EVMH8	Scott McKeon	Beautiful and whimsical, yet deep enough to keep you engaged in conversation about it for hours without ever actually nailing it down.  Miyazaki is a masterful storyteller, and he tells an engaging and compelling story.  The sybolism and thematic questions and concepts that run throughout the film are on par with his other masterworks like Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Howl's Moving Castle, and the art adn story are accessible and appealing for adults and kids alike.  Just be warned, this world and mythology Miyazaki references doesn't exactly follow typical Western conventions.	5.0	Beautiful, fun, and fascinating piece by a master artist.	2013-11-04	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A246S6BVRZJJMN	"S. Dunn ""Small Artist Admin."""	"This movie is beautiful and I agree with many of the reviews. But those that say it is for young children probably do not have children. I watched this with my five year old daughter (the first hour) and she got very quiet and left the room. She ended up being very scared and upset in a very real way. She even had nightmares. It was my mistake. I should have watched it first to see. I am not saying that ALL children would be. But I would definitly say it is for more sophisticated children/older. And yes-classic disney was a bit more scary. But the scene where snow white gets lost in the forest is not quite the same as the feeling and imagery of the this film which does not let up as does Snow White when she says ""I was being silly to be scared"" then starts singing. Just watch it first and see what you think before showing small children."	4.0	FOR PARENTS: Beautiful but not for small children	2008-09-09	3	2	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2RDR5G65D9H84	Sebastian Fernandez	"There are many outstanding aspects about this film that contribute to place it among the best anime productions I have seen in my life. It all starts with the animation, since the attention to detail in Miyazaki's work is seldom experienced. I could not help gasping when in one of the scenes I saw the perfect reflection of Chihiro on the window of a train in which she was traveling. These are the kind of details that give the production a realism that is really hard to find. The second crucial element is the story itself, which is proof of a prodigious imagination, and which without a doubt can be experienced several times without generating boredom in the spectator. Finally, and maybe this is the most striking aspect of all, this is a movie that can be appreciated by audiences of all ages, because there is something to take away for everyone. I can only imagine how interesting it will be for my daughter to watch this film as a kid, teenager and adult, since there are things to discover at each level of maturity.Chihiro, the main protagonist of the story, is a ten-year-old girl who is moving with her parents to a new city. She is the typical kid nearing adolescence, and therefore, is unhappy with the world, her parents in particular, and shows no interest in anything. When looking for their new house, a wrong turn leads them to a mysterious place that looks like an abandoned theme park, but when night falls quicker than expected, Chihiro finds herself all alone in a world full of spirits. There are no words to describe the astounding magical world in which she is immersed, and the transformation the character undergoes is as mesmerizing as it is revealing.When a few years ago I watchedPrincess MononokeI thought I had experienced Miyazaki at the top of his game, but this film gives it a run for its money. Bottom line is that both works should be required watching for every fan of the genre. People that are looking for an introduction to anime can find no better place to start than with ""Spirited Away"". The only drawback is that it will create a tough benchmark for future experiences to match.In terms of the Extras, the disc that has the film, also has a piece on the Art of Spirited Away, where Miyazaki shares some of the ""secrets"" behind his inspiration and peers and coworkers talk about the wonderful qualities of this magnificent director. In most cases I would say that the praise was scripted and disregard it as such, but in this case it really rings true, and it is entertaining and insightful to watch. This segment also includes commentary on the challenges faced with the translation, and on the steps that were put in place to conserve the original intent of the film. This is extremely important, especially in the anime / manga genre, where sadly, lousy translations that mangle the product are not uncommon.The Extras in the additional disc were not really worth watching, and I felt like they were there just as a way to make this a two-disc edition. Nevertheless, the rest of the product is so outstanding that I could not bring myself to lower my rating."	5.0	"""What happened to my spell? Only love can break it"""	2007-11-06	3	3	0

I had waited two years for the zone-1 version to come out.And I'm totally disappointed by the picture quality of this DVD! It's blurry and desaturated. It's lost all the sharpness and saturation of the original movie. Can't believe Disney did such a bad job on Telecine (the film transfer process) for this award-winning movie.But the problem is, for this DVD, disc 2 (the Original Japanese trailers) is better than disc 1. The first several trailers just look gorgeously crisp and clear with absolutely no blurs, and the color looks vibrant and vivid..So, I think Disney should consider re-mastering this movie or offering a refund program.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3N9TGJFS6IQFY	SheLikesDvds.com	In the past year Spirited Away replaced Titanic as the highest grossing film in Japan and won a Best Animated Oscar. Unfortunately many Americans have never heard of this wonderful film.The recent imports of Anime (animation from Japan) such as Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh and Digimon, have given American audiences an incorrect image of anime. In many cases these shows have been completely reworked for American audiences. As a result many of the rich and complex story lines are diluted down into fast moving action with little plot. It is no wonder many adults relegate Anime to children's cartoon.Luckily masters such as Hayao Miyazaki are still showing the amazing powers of animation. Spirited Away, arguably his best work ever, is the story of a young girl, Chihiro. She and her parents are moving to a new town. Along the way they take a wrong turn and end up in a spirit land. The center of this magical land is a giant bathhouse where the spirits come to realize and rejuvenate themselves. The bathhouse is run by Yubaba, a witch with again head, a giant mole, a giant baby and a twin sister. When Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, she must take a job in the bathhouse cleaning tubs in order to save herself from the same fate. Chihiro must overcome her fears and find the strength to save her parents and get them all home.The spirit world is populated with many fanciful creative the like of which we have not seen since Alice fell down the rabbit hole. But don't worry, extensive knowledge of the Japanese Religion Shintoism is not required to enjoy this film. Simply know that they believed everything had its own spirit from radishes to rivers.If you did not get a chance to see this movie in the theatre, this is your opportunity. The film is a sweet, funny and slightly trippy story that is sure to delight.Read a review of the whole DVD at shelikesdvds.com	5.0	Miyazaki's Best	2003-04-14	9	8	1

It is the best anime I have ever seen and it may just be the best movie I have ever seen.  I waited until the DVD release so that I could watch the version in Japanese, with subtitles.  Even my five-year-old brother, who can't read yet and is therefore usually bored when I watch anime, sat through the entire thing in Japanese several times and loved it.Chihiro is an average ten-year-old girl who is moving, and like most ten-year-old girls in this situation, doesn't want to.  She sits in the back of her car, depressed, when her father makes a wrong turn.  They enter a tunnel and go into a mysterious town, where her parents begin to eat the food.  Chihiro looks around a bit, and then a strange boy comes up to her, yelling at her, &quot;Get out of here!  It's almost night!  Go back across the river, hurry!&quot;  Chihiro runs back to her parents to find they have turned into pigs; it is getting dark and strange creatures are roaming about.  Naturally, she is frightened.  The boy, who is called Haku, tells her to find work with Kamaji, who in turn tells her to go to Yubaba, the witch that rules.  Chihiro gets work, and her name is changed to Sen.The journey that Sen/Chihiro embarks upon is amazing.  She meets the most interesting cast of characters, and by the end, has everyone on her side.  From Haku, who she feels a mysterious connection with, to the odd Kao-nashi (No-Face), the world is inhabited with the most interesting people and...creatures.  Chihiro's biggest journey is her journey as a person.  She becomes very different from who she was before.  I think this movie should be mandatory viewing for every young child before they can grow up into the &quot;sad&quot; young children of today.  (Okay, I'm not *that* old myself, but anyhow...)As for the younger set...parents should determine whether it would be scary or not for their child.  I think most children would be fine with it, but I would recommend parental viewing of this DVD first if you are unsure.  My brother, who is scared of many things and has nightmares, enjoyed the movie very much.I would recommend this to anyone, also the soundtrack, which I own.  It's very beautiful.	5.0	Sen to Chihiro no Kamakushi	2003-07-10	3	3	0

The movie is not a rehash of previous Miyazaki stuff at all. While Chihiro is reminiscent of both Kiki and Satsuki from Mimi o Sumaseba, there's an appearance of the makuro kurosukes (originally from Totoro) and the atmosphere a bit reminiscent of Mononoke Hime, this movie makes you think much more than any of the previous Miyazaki films. There are many layers of meaning and symbolism in the film, and it joins a short list of anime classics like Akira, Lain and Metropolis which cannot be fully appreciated without viewing several times.	5.0	Exquisitely weird	2003-06-08	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AR4I7Y691G0WT	Shinichi Kyou	Let me start by saying that this by FAR not Miyazaki Hayao's best film. It won't touch you as My Neighbor Totoro will, nor will it amaze you as Kiki's Delivery Service will. BUT what it will do is take you to a fantasy world. And what wonderful world it is.The film shows the sheer artistic genius that is Miyazaki. This film seems like an explosion of his imagination, from Yuubaba to No Face. Spirited Away is a film about growing up, finding your place in this world. Chihiro is actually based on a real ten-year-old, she is one of Miyazaki's friend's daughter. He (Miyazaki) wanted to ask people that &quot;she is very happy right now, but as she grows up, will she be able to withstand the pressure the world gives?&quot;Yes, this is NOT Miyazaki's best, yet it deserves the title to be the highest grossing film in Japan, and the Oscar. As a magazine said, &quot;if Spirited Away didn't win the Oscar, they might as well erase the category Best Animated Film altogether.&quot;SIDE NOTE: If anyone cares, there are rumors that Spirited Away was made because of one song (the ending song, I couldn't remember the name right now) sung by fan, also an unknown musician. The funny thing is, the song was actually submitted for another movie! It was submitted for... uh, my memory has somehow gone blank right now, so I can't remember the film... Something like _name_, The Chimney Cleaner or Chimney Boy or...	5.0	Not Miyazaki's best	2003-07-17	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2AN988COWP49T	Shiragami Hiromi	As a Japanese, I was totally fluttered by whom rated this film 5-stars and gave kind praises to it as if it is me who are praised. On the other hand, it saddens me a little that there are some people who don't like it at all. But can't complain, I guess, as it would be natural thing.Interestingly, though, most of those who say &quot;Didn't like it&quot; seem to just not understand the whole concept of the film that is, say, &quot;Japaneseness&quot;.Weird, odd and grotesque creatures? Well, some of them may be  Miyazaki's creations, but the most of them are not uncommon at all in Japanese forklores. We have a milliards of gods and spirits and monsters (most of them are harmless and good-hearted unless you are harmful to them!).While many of Japanese would say of themselves as non-religeous or rather nonchalant about religions, but, in fact, they are quite superstitious. I could say most of the Japanese are  animists deep down in their souls. (Existence of the souls is a priori here, by the way)Some years ago, then prime minister Mori said &quot;Japan is a gods' land.&quot;in a meeting of Shinto (it means &quot;gods' way&quot;) priests and stirred a controversy among the left-wingers in and outside of Japan because the phrase was interpreted as &quot;the Divine Land&quot; like in the Christianity's sense. This was unfortunate misunderstanding since, in Japan, mountains, rivers, trees, rocks, earth, and even cooking fire-places have gods in them. Virtually speaking, gods are everywhere. Gods mean the nature itself. So, Mr. Mori said only a matter of course about Japan.In Japan, children are (or, I might say, used to be) taught not to disturb or impurify those places or things or animals that have gods or spirits in them, or you may get a curse____ like Chihiro's parents did!It was interesting part of this film to me that Chihiro's Mother (and Father too, I guess) apparently had some knowledges about those gods' houses (Hokora, in Japanese), still, they felt nothing awesome about it. It was Chihiro, who was evidently  ignorant about those gods' stuff, lazy and self-centred modern day girl, that sensed something unearthly of them and felt a strong objection to intrude into the gods' domain, almost instinctively.That made me think about the national identity of the Japanese that, they say, many of us have lost since the defeat of the world war 2 because the American occupation policy denied &quot;Japanese spirit&quot;, that is much based on this somekind of religious feelings every Japanese could have at the bottom of their hearts, as a dangerous thought and tried to wipe it out so that  the &quot;saucy&quot; Japanese would never stand up against America.Maybe you could say that Chihiro's parents are typical of post-war Japanese who have been educated in that left-tilted, sort of self-denying way.But, thankfully, it has certainly remained in hearts of us. Some of us, if not all of us. That is, I think, why this film moved the hearts of such a large number of audience in Japan. Especially the grown-ups who, I think, have searched everywhere and everyday for the &quot;Japanese spirit&quot; that they can identify with their own Japaneseness.Another significance of this film is that it has restored old virtues such as diligence, being free from avarice and respectful to your superiors, and courage those have been quite neglected recently. That is one main reason why I want my children to watch this film outside the fact that it is simplly a great fun and a joy for the eyes, although they (especially my youngest who was 4 when she saw this film for the first time in Japan) just admire it and watch it for a million times without telling to do so.By the way, I was shocked by a review with 1-star rating that says Chihiro's work experience in the Bath House as a &quot;slavedom&quot;. It reminded me an English person accusing me of using my children like slaves when I asked them to help me do the household chore. When I was young, it was perfectly nomal for the children to help their parents, I admit it is not always true these days, though.Moreover, for the Japanese, working is not only for living but  rather high-minded thing to do, I would say. (At reast it was so just a decade ago until the &quot;bubble&quot; thing made everyone crazy.)Anyway, finding so many foreigners love this &quot;very Japanese&quot; film makes me almost cry. It means a lot to me. Knowing entire of other people are not disapproval of your cultural origin makes me so happy. That sense of tolerance would make the world much better place to live.Thank you all, and I am proud of you very much, Mr. Miyazaki.	5.0	Weird? Grotesque? Well, this is Japan!	2004-02-06	24	22	2

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AHH3QXD872KVY	"""shnjem"""	I went to see this in the theater with my teenage dughter and we both loved the movie. Princess Mononoke was my first exposure to anime, and in my opinion, Spirited Away far surpasses that movie.The animation is exquisite, with beautiful colors and motion. It absolutely carries you away to another realm. The plot is not difficult to follow, and the characters are all so memorable, it's hard to single out just one. I especially appoved of the voice-casting, as Princess Mononoke had some jarring problems with voice/character connection. I was surprised to read Suzanne Pleshette's name in the credits, as well as some of the others; they had done such a wonderful job of inhabiting their roles. This movie was made to be aimed at 10 year olds, but it does not shrink away from mature ideas and values. Some parts might be scary to American youngsters, but it wins my approval for ages 10 and up. I can't wait for the DVD.	5.0	An excellent movie.	2003-01-17	8	8	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A19CA56CK7Z05R	"Sho J. Morimoto ""aresdracon"""	&quot;Spirited Away,&quot; lastest of animator Miyazaki Hayao's masterpieces, is an endearing tale of personal growth through effort and compassion. Given Miyazaki's strong socio-political beliefs, one can easily stumble into the pitfall of over-analyzing this film. However, it is simply a fantastic story of a girl who overcomes great obstacles and thereby gains a greater appreciation of life (and the freedom of her parents from a curse). The simplicity of the plotline in spite of its deep emotional content is what makes this film so refreshing!There are two (very) minor problems I have. First, and most importantly, some of the original meaning and dialogue is lost in the translation. I highly recommend watching the movie in Japanese with English subtitles. Second, the ending seemed a bit abrupt and rushed; Chihiro's journey was so grueling yet the basic problem of freeing her loved ones from the curse was resolved in an instant. However, it could just be that the story focuses entirely on the journey and the resolution could vary without changing its essence.As with most Japanese anime films, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; does contain more scenes that may be frightening to young children than your average American cartoon. However, for Miyazaki, violence is very minimal in this film.	5.0	Inspiring and spirited!	2003-08-07	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ABMN74TBW5UWE	Sidehop	I admit, when my sister and I watched this in the movie theater years ago, it was very slow in the beginning.  From the title of the movie to Chihiro first moving into a new town, the movie takes a dramatic effect after her and her family get lost.From there the story picks up and Chihiro learns so many things in this new world she's now faced being alone.  By end of the movie it's a very wild and happy ending yet somehow the movie makes you think and really does end with a refreshing feel.  It's not often many children's movie will make you feel this way nor want to replay the movie over and over.  I don't even know how many times we've watch Miyazaki's work.  A lot of Japanese anime's geared for children really stays at heart of children.  Disney probably would not have got the rights to sell them otherwise in the USA if that wasn't the case.I'll have to warn parents and anyone with small children that it may scare them a bit in certain scenes.  It's not so much of ghost or anything jumping at you in front the screen but some scenes can be dark and Miyazaki really tries to give that creepy feel while he comes back with something much better and happier.Another classic and excellent movie worth watching with anyone especially families.	5.0	So many wild and happy emotions!	2012-01-21	0	0	0

I watched it again at fifteen, and I was terrified 20 minutes in. Okay...the story..Bratty Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new town. Chihiro is notably annoyed and unhappy. When they get lost on the way and go through a weird tunnel they find, they find a theme park with delicious food on an abandoned stall which Chihiro's parents eat, planning to pay when the shopkeeper comes back. However, Chihiro refuses and walks off, stumbling upon a bathouse, and some boy of about 14, who tells her to leave. Chihiro immediately runs to her parents to find they are no longer humans. Hence comes the scary scene. My eight-year-old self wonders ""Who is this boy? What has he done?""Chihiro learns that she is in the world of spirits, where she is an inferior human. If she doesn't want to meet the same fate as her parents, she must get a job at the bathouse, as she learns from the boy, known as ""Haku"", although he later reveals that his real name was stolen. When Chihiro gets a job from the sorceress that rules the bathouse, Yubaba, she too loses her name, and her name, meaning ""a thousand questions"" changes to ""Sen"", meaning ""thousand"". Only then does Chihiro grow up and become a diligent caring young woman.My favourite thing about the movie by far is the relation between Chihiro and Haku. They are friends, and Haku tries to look after Chihiro, then when Haku nearly dies, the relationship switches, and it's time for Chihiro to help Haku. By the end, they..well, that's a spoiler.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ABE14SVILZLNY	"SID ""Punk"""	"This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since ""Akira"" has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the ""Stink Spirit"" that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also."	5.0	Spirited Away	2004-03-19	4	4	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A378WO3ESBBXQ3	Simon Knowles	"At the time of this review's writing, Spirited Away just won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, beating out Lilo & Stitch, Treasure Planet, Spirit, and Ice Age. It also bears the distinction of being the first Japanese animation to win the award. I say, there was no contest.Spirited Away is a fantastic and deep movie, with characters that feel very much alive, even though they're obviously animated drawings. Miyazaki, the director, deliberately instructed his animators to focus on the tiny human details of everyday actions, such as eating. The animators were actually in the studio's cafeteria, filming their coworkers. This attention to detail is what makes the movie come alive. Chihiro sits down and carefully inches her way down a steep stairway on the outside of a building. Chihiro's mother bites a strip of meat off a cooked bird, and pulls sideways with her jaw, not straight out. (The meat doesn't streeeeetch and pop, either.) It just seems REAL.And then, of course, the movie really begins and things get somewhat surreal. The parade of creatures crossing the bridge is just the beginning: Robed figures wearing masks and holding fans in front of their faces, creatures that appear to be giant chickadees, weird monster-like creatures with tusks and horns and green hair. And they're being welcomed by humanish frogs. And that's just the beginning of the movie.But, at the same time, with all these fantastic spirits and creatures, the movie maintains its human element: Chihiro. She is the only real human in most of the movie, and it is her ability to adapt, and to care, that propels the story. Chiriho grows. She learns that she has to make it on her own initiative if she wants to get what she needs.If you're still with me, hopefully you're not of the mind that cartoons are just for kids. This movie has a PG rating for a reason. It's not for young children. There is some blood, and a few moments that would probably scare anyone under the age of 8 or so. However, this movie is for kids and adults not because of that, but because of how deep and meaningful its story is. Months after seeing it in theatres, I was still picking out pieces of theme from the film. There is a lot in here: Themes of identity and names, friendship, giving, family, greed, love, bravery, survival, maturity, and self-sacrifice.Miyazaki also gave the story another aspect of realism: There is no clearly-defined ""good"" and ""bad"" guy. The heroine (Chihiro) is not perfect, though she tries hard to be strong. The 'villain' has a warm, caring side that she reserves for only one person. The mysterious character with unclear motives takes an unexpected turn. Miyazaki refuses to paint the story in extremes of black and white. What does this mean? He writes the story with all the detail and care it deserves, knowing you'll have to be paying attention.All of this to say, watch this movie. I believe you'll thank me for it."	5.0	Academy Award-winning for a reason!	2003-03-26	79	74	5
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A14R2XG0P4N1J9	Simon Ward	I can't understand how people can be giving this a review of one star. So many are justifying it by saying that they are a fan of anime but it's not Miyazaki's best work...Hello?! This is the largest grossing and most successful film in Japanese box office history?!!! That surely will give you some indication that this film was appreciated by a LOT of people. There are also reviews stating that this film is too scary and emotionally scarring for younger viewers... I can't think of a single moment where i felt mildly frightened. Granted, the scene where she first enters the spirit world could be 'scary' for some younger viewers but no more so than something along the lines of E.T.. and yes, there is a bit of blood in the film (dragon blood i might add) - well anyone who's watched Japanese animation will know that this is not so uncommon and truly not something to get overly worked up about. I would reccommend this film for any viewer of any age. At the end of the day..it's your call - nobody's forcing you or your children to watch it but bear in mind it was recently voted #3 in the top 100 cartoons of all time. Surely part of you wants to check this out? I just cant help but notice this film recieves almost solely 5 or 1 star ratings..and those giving it one star give the impression of being unimaginative, uncreative and unwilling to bother with a film that requires some thought to fully appreciate it for what it is.

Here are individual reviews on the technical aspects of the DVD:VIDEO: A+The video is presented in its original 2.01:1 aspect ratio and is enhanced for 16x9 tvs. The picture quality is much better than I remember it in theaters. The picture is crystal clear and looks fantastic.AUDIO: A++The sound is really fantastic. There are 3 audio tracks on this disc: English Dub (the one used in the theatrical release, thank God) and original Japanese dialogue both in 5.1 Dolby Digital (WHY NOT DTS?!) and a French audio track presented in 2.0 Dolby Surround. Anyway, I did not hear the original Japanese dub, but let me tell you that the audio on the English version is amazing. The bass is always bumping whenever a spirit is on screen. The surrounds are very active with surround sound and dialogue is well heard.That is my take on the first disc.

Nakajima's Spotlight review was for this wonderful movie (great idea to give tips for non-Japanese viewers!), he made an error in his Tip #4, Haku's real name.And as I love Haku's gentle (JAPANESE) character too much, and Chihiro and Haku's relationship is so vital to the story, I had to correct it and add additional insight. (Also Disney BUTCHERED the English version giving Haku a commercialized ""Hi! I announce the rides at Disneyland!"" voice with butchered dubbing....sob).OK! So the correction:""[4] Haku's real name is ""Migihayami Kohakusui."" All the Japanese audience, as Chihiro in fact was, would be surprised to hear this long and old-fashioned name, which clearly suggests his ancient and aristocratic origin.""This is incorrect.Haku's real name is.. (drum roll please...) NIGIHAYAMI KOHAKUNUSHI.(nee-gi-ha-ya-mee ko-ha-ku-nu-shi)And he is, in case you missed it, a river god. Nushi, in Japanese denotes deities and spirits. Haku was the god that protected the Kohaku river until (urban development) filled the river and it was no longer. See Miyazaki's message here?Chihiro tells Haku that her mother once told her that she fell into a river when she was a child. She remembers this when she clings onto Haku's horns (when he is in dragon form). It brings back the memory of when she fell in the river and Haku guided her back to shore, saving her life. She says the river no longer exists because they built apartment complexes over it (in Japanese, called ""mansions""), but that the river was called.. the Kohaku river (Kohaku-gawa, ""kawa/gawa"" = Japanese for river).There is a fan on the web who managed to transcribe Haku's entire name to be ""Master of the peaceful and swift-flowing small white river."" (...) which I think is pretty close to the fact. Haku, means White, in Japanese. Plus I mentioned the Disney travesty for more than one reason. The original Japanese voice for Haku, is that of a YOUNG boy (well, young ""god"" boy). Haku, is a young river spirit, as far as spirit years go, hence he is a young boy in human form.It would be worthwhile to see the subtitled version of this movie, as even not understanding Japanese, you may catch the softer inflections in his voice when he speaks to Chihiro, and also enjoy Chihiro's young, NON-whiny voice."	5.0	* Haku's name was NIGIHAYAMI KOHAKUNUSHI, and he was a river god.	2005-08-01	7	7	0

The first was The Castle of Cagliostro (considered by many, including me, to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time).  This movie was easily on the same level of The Castle of Cagliostro.  Miyazaki manages to develop realistic characters that refuse to be classified as either good or bad, like so many other Disney films.That being said I find it hard to believe that Miyazaki intended for this to be a children's movie.  It does incorporate the some of typical Disney children's themes into it but much of the movie I think would be too ""scary"" for children.  For instance, the desperately lonely character No-Face seems compassionate at first but then proceeds to eat several people.  No-Face later realizes that Chihiro only wanted to be his friend and joins her in her journey.  Even Haku, the only person that wanted to help Chihiro in the spirit world, is revealed as a thief that was only using Yubaba to gain power.  The images themselves are what nightmares are made of.  One scene in particular after they bathe the ""stink spirit"" I found particularly creepy.  In the scene a floating skull appears in the air and says ""well done.""This is a must see for any fan of anime."	5.0	Made me a Miyazaki fan	2004-07-31	4	3	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	My first look at Miyazaki's work, (as it is for for many westerners no doubt) and I was blown away. The animation is out of this world, both in quality and in imagination. The story line is original and different and follows a girl trying to bring back her parents from a curse where they are turning into pigs and follows her adventures as she tries to achieve this. The world she travels in is beautiful, weird and magical to watch. Well worth a look by anyone, but be warned you may get hooked and there is a host of other Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki work out there to tantalise and delight.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	5.0	Spirited Away	2011-03-05	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1SMCVGYLIVVQ7	Spiehler	"Like many others, I first encountered ""Spirited Away"" when it took the Best Animated Picture Oscar, and was theatrically re-released. I originally went with some trepidation, because while I'm a huge animation buff, I've never cared much for anime. I went to see Akira in the middle of its hype, and walked out shaking my head, muttering ""All style, no substance. Depth of a puddle."" I've since had others tell me Akira was overrated. I'm inclined to believe them.Anyhow, Spirited Away changed my mind forever. Saw it twice in the theater, and bought the DVD the minute it ame out. What a gorgeous film. Distrubing images? Certainly. Like ANY good fairy tale. Snow White, Pinocchio, Alice In Wonderland, Oz-these all contain bits of nightmare. But it's ""Good Scary"" as opposed to mindless fright.Is the movie confusing? Only if you need to have plot lines and characters telegraphed to you. If you don't like to think about a movie, by all means, run screaming from Spirited Away. But if you  enjoy immersing yourself in a fully formed alternate reality, this is your flick.And what a wonderful message. Chihiro only begins to triumph when she sets herself aside, and sacrifices for the sake of others. Some of the imagery of her sacrifice (Haku's purging of the blackness inside) is spirituality of a high order.I can understand why serious anime fans might be able to nitpick this movie. It's the same with anyone who's deeply into a subject matter. But, if you're a film fan, especially one new to anime, this is a masterwork, pure and simple. Arguably one of the finest films ever made, any genre, any era."	5.0	Not just great animation-A great film, period.	2005-03-15	9	9	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2XEIYMY4PW8MA	Stephanie	"It was at least two years ago when I watched ""Spirited Away."" I still remember so many vivid details about it. The exquisitely drawn characters and scenery, combined with lovely colours make it very easy to remember a lot about this movie. The plot is much better than most animated movies I have watched, but even a small child can enjoy it, if only for the unique characters seen in this film. It is very enthralling, and you may find yourself being sucked in, and forgetting that you are actually watching a movie.Because of the uniqueness of this movie, some people may not enjoy it. They may find it to be ""weird"" or the plot to be too slow. If you are open-minded, though, and enjoy anime (or even if you aren't familiar with anime, but can take an animated movie seriously enough to give it a chance) you will probably like this movie.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"Probably the most famous Studio Ghibli anime, ""Spirited Away"" is one of Ghibli's best, a magical, moving and just plain awesome tale that no movie fan should be without.  It features some of the most incredible animation ever put forward, some of the most fantastic animation ever brought to life, and some of the most memorable characters in movie history.Chihiro, an obstinate but lovable little girl, is moving across the country (not to any great enthusiasm on her part) with her rather clueless parents when the family stops at what appear to be the ruins of an old shrine, for some sightseeing.  As they're entering this imposing place, only minutes into the film, ""Spirited Away"" will probably have already captivated you with its gorgeous visuals and its contrasting tones of whimsical/humorous and subtly foreboding darkness.  Inside the ruins, things are less...ruined....and there's a sumptuous feast laid out, which Chihiro's parents dig into with reckless abandon while Chiro herself wanders about nervously.  It turns out that there's reason to be nervous, for when dusk falls in this place, those inside it witness the coming of strange forms and then find themselves spirited away, out of this world and into a mysterious other.  Chihiro's parents transform into pigs and are corralled into pens, and Chihiro herself is pressed into labor by a sinister witch who rules a vast hostel for travelling entities in this new world, and is renamed Sen.Sen's prospects of escaping and freeing her parents appear bleak, but strange things can happen hear.  Befriended by a strange and knowledgable older boy named Haku, Sen finds unlikely allies whose virtues are merely buried under intimidating crusts.  All manner of bizarre beings pass in and out of the great bath house where Sen now labors, some of whom the ruling witch is as frightened of as are Sen and the other 'underlings'.  Odysseies and discoveries ensue that I don't want to even hint at, and the coming together of the oddest combinations of beings uncovers both goodness and sadness in the strangest places.A phenomenal movie.  Also recommended are ""Castle In The Sky"", ""Pom Poko"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service""...all of Ghibli's movies actually, although some, like the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" and the heart-wrenching wartime orphan drama ""Grave Of The Fireflies"", might not be the best picks for young children.  Studio Ghibli is the strongest single force in the diverse and astonishing world of anime, and for those who've yet to discover the wonders of anime, ""Spirited Away"" is a perfect place to start."	5.0	Among The Best Ever	2007-01-22	2	1	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1C9GCHR99WX3F	Stephen Verhaeren	I am confused why this movie this movie won best animated feature film, I don't think this was the best out the 5 films that was nomiated for best animated feature film. Since this is also a venson of this movie in Japan, there is a cast for the people who live in America, made by Disney. The English cast includes Daveigh Chase (from Lilo & Stitch, who voiced Lilio). As the movie opens, a preteen girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) who is moving to a new house with her father (Michael Chiklis) and mother (Lauren Holly). They are almost to thier new house, when the dad, decides to take a short cut to the house, and end up at a bulding, they decide (expect for Chihiro) to take a quick look around, Chihiro doesn't want to look, but comes along anyways. They had up in a strange town, they seems to be deserted, Chihiro's parents start to eat in a restaurant, and she goes off. She is warned by a local that if she doesn't get a job, she will be turned to something else then what she is by Yababa (Suzanne Pleshette), she gets send off to see Kamaji (David Oqden Stiers) who sends her to see Yababa. Yababa lives at the top of the bath house, and Chihiro has to take about a couple of elevators, before arriving at Yababa's. At first, Yababa doesn't want to give Chihiro a job, but she would not take no for answer. Then she strikes a deal with Yababa, that she will not leave unless Yababa gives her a job. She gives, and Chihiro signs a contract, and her name gets changed to Sen.	5.0	"""Why in the world, do you think I should give you a job?"""	2003-07-27	1	0	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	My Neighbor Totoro is my favorite Hayao Miyazaki film most days, but Spirited Away is on the same level. It's the best animated film ever to win an Oscar.So what elevates it from other great animation such as Pixar? It's a combination of many things.Miyazaki's animation feels different to anything else that I've experienced. It's detailed and complex, with well-developed characters, and it has heart. He creates lovable characters, but some have human flaws and they are more real than characters found in most animated fare.Spirited Away tells the story of a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro (Chase). Her parents are driving her to their new home and she's upset about leaving her friends behind. In fact, she's bratty and whines a lot. Her father drives down the wrong road and they end up in an abandoned amusement park. Although it's deserted, they can smell food. Chihiro's parents decide to take advantage of a free meal, but Chihiro doesn't. She's horrified to see them transform into pigs.While she is deciding what to do, a boy named Haku (Marsden) shows up and urges her to leave before it gets dark. She refuses to leave her parents so he decides to help her. Darkness brings a few changes and spirits appear. An area which appeared to be deserted is suddenly alive with light and chatter. Haku explains to Chihiro that she will never be allowed to leave unless she earns her place in the town. To do so, she must seek employment at the bath house.The bath house is run by Yubaba (Pleshette) and she's a formidable witch. But, with the help of Kamaji (Stiers), who takes care of the boiler, Chihiro is given a chance to find a job. She's assigned to Lin, who shows her what to do. Lin also tries to toughen Chihiro up and teach her to improve her sullen attitude and learn some manners. Spirited Away is a coming-of-age story in which Chihiro eventually becomes a happy, confident girl, capable of facing anything.The story is vast and quite complex for an animated film. Miyazaki doesn't rush things and takes a little over two hours to show Chihiro's story. It's aimed at an older audience than films such as Ponyo and My Neighbor Totoro, but it contains some of the beauty and innocence that's present in all Studio Ghibli films.Miyazaki's imagination is almost limitless. You'll meet witches, soot sprites, dragons, spirits, weird animals and a giant baby. I've sometimes heard people complain that they don't understand the story. If you just accept it as a fantasy where magic exists, it's really pretty easy to follow.The style of animation may be different from anything that you are used to. The image is two-dimensional and each frame looks like a watercolor painting. But take note of the amount of detail present in each frame. Some of it doesn't need to be there for the story to work, but it's a richer experience because it is present. When Chihiro nervously edges down a steep flight of stairs, look at the detail in the individual steps. When she puts her shoes on, there's a very human gesture that most animators wouldn't bother with. Spirited Away is clearly a labor of love and a work of art.If you give the film a try, you might find yourself hooked after about two minutes as I was. The look of the film and Joe Hisaishi's score set a mood immediately and draw you in. It's a slightly darker and more dangerous world than many Studio Ghibli settings, but you'll be reluctant to leave.	5.0	Imagination, heart, beauty and innocence from Miyazaki	2012-03-22	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3ERDIBXJ6MHA6	Steven Chen	"I first saw this film at the El Capitan theater in Hollywood with English subtitles.  At the time, I thought that the movie was amazing from a creative standpoint, but there were a few of things that I left somewhat confused about.The English version of Spirited Away adds a lot of dialogue that was not included in the Japanese version with English subtitles to help clear the confusion.  Namely, they added a lot of dialogue to scenes that may not have transitioned well between cultures, such as the ""cutting of evil"" and the ending.As for the movie itself...I've seen it about five times now, each time with a new group of friends that seemed really reluctant to watch a ""cartoon.""  It is a testament to this film's accessibility to all ages that by the end of each of these screenings, everyone who saw it fell in love with the film.  It is truly a masterpiece of imagination and creatvity."	5.0	One of the best Animated films	2003-06-27	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3UX7U436HNH7A	Steven Shon	And there's a reason for that.  Although the DVD is made by Disney, the movie is licensed by Disney, and the promotion (such as it is) of this movie is done by Disney, this is *not* a Disney movie.  And thank God for that.First, allow me to start with the animation.  True, it is not as smooth as a lot of American animated films in several places.  However, it is still very smooth often enough, and never drops below an acceptable framerate.  In addition, it far more *detailed* than most American animation...yes, there are less unnecessary movements in segments, but there is far more detail in images.  American animation rarely has many shadows on characters or moving objects, instead having one base color for every (moving) object with another one to tell you that even though it *looks* like a hunk of concrete, it really isn't supposed to be.  The art in Spirited Away, although stylized, is far more detailed...most moving objects obey a &quot;three-color rule&quot; (one base color, one color for highlights, one color for shadows), and far more effort is put into details and backrounds than in any Disney film.The dub is...well, it's servicable.  Apparently matching voices to animation is far more difficult than doing it the other way around, so the voices are somewhat stilted in places.  Disney also ruined an entire plotline, and a rather important one at that, so as not to confuse the little kiddies...or something like that, because they completely undid a major mystery of the story right off the bat, probably to try to hit the little kids in the audience over the head with the answer.The Japanese language version, on the other hand, is excellent, although the subtitles aren't the most accurate translation.  Voice acting is believable and so on, and the writing is top-notch.Oh, and the soundtrack *rules*.  You have to buy this if you like orchestrated music *at all*.A lot of parents are complaining because it's &quot;too confusing&quot; and &quot;too negative&quot; for little kids to see, they say.  You see, this movie does not coddle its viewers.  In most Disney movies, the plot goes something like this:  A beautiful girl is forced into a life of &quot;horrible servitude&quot; (which does not stop her from constantly smiling, dancing, singing, and generally having a wonderful time for the first eighteen years of her life), and then is put to sleep until some random guy with a good smile comes along and even though she's never met the guy they decide to spend the rest of their lives together.This story is very different.  In the beginning of the movie, Chihiro is severed from her only potential allies, her parents.  However, rather than mope around going, &quot;Oh my paws and whiskers, whatever shall I do?&quot;, she realizes that she's going to have to stand up and figure things out for herself, and in the meantime she has to survive.  It isn't easy, because this is nothing like her previous coddled existance...people are not all sugary sweet to her, and she's forced to work hard...and generally, she's forced into a life of servitude, and she does not get the chance to sing or dance or smile about it.  She meets a nice guy, but he has some sort of mystery behind him, and also works for the opposing side...however, in the end, through her own strength, and with a little encouragement she manages to (a) save the guy she's grown to love and knows well and (b) save her parents, and free *herself* from her problems.  There is no happy ending, she does not live happily ever after...rather, she has to grow up, and instead of living the rest of her life doing nothing must return to the real world, and deal with whatever problems come her way.Chihiro is a rapid departure from previous children's heroines, because previous heroines did not really do very much.  The moral of their stories was that nothing could ever be so bad you couldn't be happy, and that other people would solve all your problems for you.  Chihiro, though, teaches us that things won't always be all right.  Problems will come up, and times will not always be sing-song-along happy...however, if you work hard you yourself can solve your problems, and although you won't have a fairy-tale ending, you'll be able to live happily enough in the real world, with no problems so great you can't solve them.This is why I love this movie so much; because the only thing Chihiro gets from other people is encouragement.  She has to deal with things for herself.  Not only do you have great animation, a great story, and a really really REALLY AWESOME SOUNDTRACK *cough*...excuse me there, got a bit carried away...it also offers a lesson.  And again, unlike other films, it does not hit you over the head with it...but if you chose to grab it, you may.	5.0	Far more intelligent than typical Disney fare...	2003-11-26	10	9	1

I was quite disappointed.There is no denying that the animation is great. Everything is very nicely drawn. However the story is confusing. The story revolves around a young girl who becomes trapped in a magical world is spirits. I don't know where these spirits came from or what they do. It seems that this girl is constantly getting scared and running away from scary spirits. But the movie never explains why these spirits don't like humans. She befriends another young boy who turns into a dragon. How and why does he turn into a dragon? I'm so confused.This was the first anime movie I've ever watched. Perhaps Japanese people know more about Japanese stories and mythology and can fill in the gaps. But for a North American audience I feel that more should have been explained.Overall, this movie is worth watching. However I suggest renting it instead of buying it.	3.0	Great Animation But Confusing Story	2003-05-05	18	4	14

Amazon.com's review is right on target - this is AMAZING.  This film is so deeply beautiful and refreshing it is nearly painful.  Have you ever heard music so heavenly and godlike it nearly causes you pain?  This is a similar experience.  Watching this is so refreshing, new, and different I really lack some of the words to describe it.  It is intelligent, very subtle and unlike most throwaway children's fare (which is crass, cluttered, disgusting and/or just haphazardly thrown together) this movie has the ability to profoundly move adults.  Much like Harold Budd's epic tone poems, this film is subtle, sweeping beauty.  A work of true imagination, a great escape from our cynical, industrial world.Are you sick and tired of kids cartoons that are gross and filthy?  Do you want to see something that is the ultimate breath of life, innocence, and joy?  Time for Miyazaki's Spirited Away!

But, actually, I am not sure why this is the most popular Ghibli movie in America. I think even for Japanese it is difficult to understand some of scenes. Miyazaki used a lot of abstract and symbolic elements and they made this movie more complicated than his other movies such as My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke.But I would say this is still a very interesting movie and some scenes have left a strong impression on my mind.

It an endearing story of a little girl who doesnt want to grow up, but is forced to, and emerges as a strong young woman.My two year old was recently going though my DVDs, and asked me if she could watch it.  I agreed, and as I dont want to have to read the entire movie to her, set the audio to English.  I was watching an entirely different movie from the one I fell in love with.  Chihiro was a whiney crybaby who refused to grow up.  Lin was turned into a mother figure instead to treating Chihiro as a peer.I was really suprised that the dub was so different from the movie.  And even though my little girl loved it (she watched the entire thing -- never moved) I'm not sure I will let her until she can read.	4.0	Spirited Away	2011-06-30	0	0	0

When a relative happened apon a pre-release video copy, he passed it along to us because we are huge Disney fans. My husband, 2 daughters and I love Disney animated movies. My older daughter, who is 6, had to run and hide 1/4 of the way into ""Spirited Away"". She has never done that from an animated movie before. Watching the parents turn into pigs was too much for her!The animation is beautiful but the story line is disjointed and many parts are not explained. It is as trippy as the Teletubbies.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1570WVJOCI3B9	"T. El-khateeb ""TAR1K"""	Ok, this is a review from an animation lover. This is the first Miyazaki film I've seen, so I'm not going to compare it to his other films or even to other animated films. I bought this DVD becuase of the hype Spirited Away generated, and out of plain curiosity.I love Disney, and animation in general. Though 99% of the reviews I read about Spirited Away gave it 5 stars, to me the movie is 3.5 stars. Why? well becuase basically it didn't make me feel anything. there are funny parts, there are scary parts, but the whole thing leaves you wanting more just becuase it delivered so little. Many charecters come and go, without purpose, leaving you wondering why are they here? how did they end up in this place? what is their story? and that is true, as the movie ended, I discovered that we should only care about Chihiro and not the rest of the charecters, which I find wrong and almost instantly kills the supporting cast. I now know the ending, and knowing that there's isn't anything else this movie can give me, I doubt I'll want to watch it again.As for the DVD, well major disappointment. I'm sure that the contents could've been easily squeezed into one DVD. Even the Treasure Planet ONE DISK DVD has more extras. And though the claim here is that &quot;quality is more important than quantity&quot;, I disagree. The Making Of documentary (which is made by a Japanese TV station, and is in Japanese with English subtitles) is very nice, and very pleasing to see such a fresh documentary; it's structure, commentary and everything else is entierly new and very pleasing. The sad part is that many animation/movie related subjects weren't mentoined. Computer animation, abandoned sequences, history of charecters or anything to take us deeper into the myth and wonder of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, is nowhere to be found. Only 4 features in a whole DVD is really very little. One of them is a Storyboard To Scene Comparison featurette, and another is a series of Japanese trailers (both add up to around 10 minutes) and the &quot;making of&quot; runs at 40+ minutes.I still like the movie, but I don't love it, and actually doubt It'll make my top 30 best animated movies list, still the animation is superb, the dubbing is perfect, and as a whole it really takes you to another world. Sadly it leaves a lot to desire, and I believe it only scratches the surface of what could've been the best movie ever (animated or any other kind)This is my personal point of view, and I'm sure many will disagree, but I tried to be as objective as I could. Thanks.	4.0	Objective point of view!	2003-06-10	15	4	11

Both English and Japanese audio is provided along with English subs, so whether you prefer dubs or despise them, you'll still be happy.The story proceeds fairly quickly to the crux of the matter and then kinda gets side tracked for a bit.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AJYKF9AMO2YQ9	The Moogleking	Many people born before the anime era stereotype anime as senslessly violent and poorly written. Show them this masterpiece, and pretty soon they'll be watching it at 6:30 in the morning every Saturday, while you try to get some sleep.I love this film because it shows that anime can still be very absorbing without unessecary violence, nudity, ect. The englishdub REEKS of Disney (vile stuff, it is) , so make sure to watch it in Japanese w/ subtitles. The movie lacks info about the characters' origins (mostly Haku), but that's really the only flaw. The animation is smooth and crisp, the characthers have deep personalities, the monsters are hilarious (try to spot the Totaro in one of the beginning sequences) and the overall story combines many emotions as the main character quests to get home.The soundtrack goes well with the movie (like how the jazzy soundtrack went well with Blue Submarine No.6), but may get repetitively annoying to some folks. As always, Hayao Miyazaki uses very innovative ideas, such as the main characther's parents getting transformed into pigs. Well, that sums it up. I would tell you more about it, but I won't give away too much of the plot. If you think this anime is bad and has a dull plot, go and watch Love Hana or Tenchi Muyo until your eyes can be mistaken for beach balls.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A34RDZS6AKJRHR	Theodore Csernica	"I hardly need to enlarge on the praise already heaped on this film. It's almost impossible to exaggerate its visual quality, storytelling, characterization, and sheer mythopoeic sparkle.  But thank goodness the DVD has the original Japanese track and English subtitles done by translators other than those who worked on the dub.  The dub is simply awful.To begin with, the voice of one of the two younger principals is horribly miscast. For some reason, Disney thought it would be a good idea to cast an adult to voice a 12-year-old boy.  (He's actually ageless, but this is his usual form.) The voice does not match the character. If this was a compromise to get quality acting then they failed: quality acting is not what they got. Jason Mardsen as Haku is uniformly wooden.Daveigh Chase ought to have been an appropriate choice for Chihiro, and under other circumstances she might have done a creditable job. Her voice is certainly pleasant enough. But she whines her way through the entire movie even as the character is supposed to be growing past her whineyness.  With such a young actress the fault ought to be laid at the feet of whoever directed the English dub, since she simply can't be expected to have the life experience necessary to achieve an in-depth reading of a complex character on her own.So if the poor translation didn't serve to change the mood or sense of a scene, the actors often did, but no doubt they were often directed to do so.  The American director seemed more than willing to sacrifice portions of Miyazaki's vision to put his own imprint on the film. When you see the ""making of"" feature and understand the great care Miyazaki took to get just the right performance out of his actors, it's hard to see this as anything but vandalism of the crassest kind. If the director didn't do this deliberately, it's an incompetence this film did not merit.The dub is plagued with needless chatter.  It takes advantage of moments where the characters' mouths aren't visible to insert dialogue that adds nothing to the scene but rather destroys the mood it was setting.  It was annoying enough when Disney did this to Miyazaki's earlier ""Kiki's Delivery Service""; here it's positively jarring even though there's less of it. The added final line of the movie comes close to ruining it, if that was possible, as it reaches for an entirely inappropriate cheap laugh.Which brings me to the dub's translation.  I know that compromises occasionally have to be made to get the lip movements more or less in synch, but that's no excuse here.  Some of the English dialogue is so at variance with the original that a character's intent seems to be completely inverted at times, and entire scenes take on different meanings.However, not all the acting is bad and not all the translation is so discreditable.  David Ogden Stiers and Suzanne Pleshette turn in superb performances as the boiler man Kamaji and the twin witches respectively, even if inappropriate words were occasionally given to them to say.  I also know that some have objected to the translation of ""hanko"" as ""seal"" -- this is the mcguffin driving the second half of the film -- but I'd be hard-pressed to think of something more appropriate. (However, simply calling it ""magical"" is inadequate to explain its importance. Some cultural background is helpful here.)The subtitle translation is far superior, although even someone like myself who knows no Japanese beyond a handful of words can spot some changes. For example, at one point the subtitles have Haku addressing Kamaji by name when he can clearly be heard to be saying ""ojisan"", ""grandfather"".  This speaks volumes about their relationship, but it was just thrown away for some reason. (The same happens with Chihiro, but with her it matters less because she and Kamaji have enough screen time together that their relationship is understood.) However, being able to hear the fine work of the original actors more than makes up for any small deficiency along these lines.Why on earth does Disney think it necessary to insert a tedious ""introduction"" by John Lasseter at the beginning of every Miyazaki film it distributes?  Yes, the ""Skip"" button works here, but why should we have to do this every time we play every disc? It's an annoyance that doesn't have to be there.This movie cannot be truly appreciated in the Disney version, which might go some way toward explaining its poor performance in the American theatrical relsease. It deserves to be seen as Miyazaki made it.  Please treat yourself to a viewing of it."	5.0	Astonishing film, miserable dub - very minor spoilers	2005-01-13	6	3	3
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2P096KP1QMVFS	Theodore J. Kaplan	"I am 35 now, and ""Spirited Away"" remains my favorite movie, nearly 10 years after its release.  I have watched this DVD over 100 times.  During a prolonged illness in 2005-2006, I did my best to continue working full-time, and I could do this by remembering what was awaiting me when I got home, and what would keep me company after my family went to bed and I remained in the living room, in too much pain to sleep: the most incredible world ever conceived, where, by watching, I actually felt temporarily free of pain and fear, as though the Yuya bathhouse- in attendance to so many gods- was also tending to me.Many people have told me that they prefer ""Howl's Moving Castle"" to ""Spirited Away.""  I love Howl, and the many other movies Miyazaki has made from European stories and/or influences.  But the thing that makes ""Spirited Away"" such a supreme work is that it remains in and of Japan.I am an American man, and perhaps American motifs have lost some of their appeal as they have naturally saturated every aspect of our art and media... as an anime fan, it was probably inevitable that I developed a fondness for (""My"") Japan- the Japan I have come to perceive by studying, reading, watching, etc. etc. etc.....Here Miyazaki has created a world which embodies so much of that distinct, distant Japanese character- as perceived by an American who has never (yet) been to Japan- and retains something unique, singular and profound...

It doesn't matter what sort of animation you're into or not into, this movie is very enjoyable and has something for the whole family, though real little ones might be spooked by some of the spirits' appearances and behaviors (and there is minor bloodshed as well).

Sometimes, in fact, I have never even heard of these award-winning films.  No, I am not referring to foreign films or documentaries or the winner of the ""Most Obscure Film from Kazakhstan"" prize.  I'm talking about the big awards for movies of which I should have at least heard.Five movies were nominated for this year's Best Animated Feature award.  Included in the list of nominees were such films as Lilo &amp; Stitch, Ice Age, and Treasure Planet.  The only nominee of which I had heard nothing was Spirited Away, a Japanese film dubbed into English.  Obviously, this chapped my delicate sensibilities, so I immediately arranged to view the film - to my complete and utter joy.Spirited Away is the story of Chihiro, a young, selfish girl who is thrust into a surreal world of talking frogs, witches, dragons and spirits.  Through her attempts to rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs (that'll teach them to eat the food of the spirits), Chihiro learns lessons about friendship, bravery and love.  I'm not doing the story justice, simply because I don't feel that I'm up to the task.If I was forced to describe Spirited Away in ten words or less, I would have to call it ""Alice in Wonderland embedded in Japanese mythology"".  Unfortunately, it is the Japanese mythology that is the only fault.  And, though it pains me to say it, the fault is mine - I am simply not well-versed in that type of literature.Japanese audiences loved this movie.  With its original theatrical release in Japan in 2001, Spirited Away became the highest grossing film ever for that country.  I loved the movie, too, despite my admitted short-comings.That being said, I would recommend that parents screen this film before showing it to younger children, as some scenes may be a bit frightening.  For the parents that do watch the film - don't be surprised if you enjoy the film more than your kids.

It's simply magical.The story is about a young girl, Chihiro, who is moving to a new town with her parents.  Along the way to their new home, they get lost on a back road and explore an abandoned amusement park, only to find that (as many things are in Miyazaki's films) it is definitely not what it seems!  Chihiro finds her parents enchanted by a witch who runs a bathhouse for spirits.  With the help of Haku and other friends she has to make along the way, Chihiro must find a way to set herself and her parents free.I lost track of how many copies of this I have purchased, but there's been atleast a dozen or so.

I strongly recommend the purchase of the DVD for the special features, and beyond that, so you have the option of watching it in subbed and dubbed. For children, the dubbing is better because they will be better able to appreciate it as well as the jokes that Disney has thrown in. But for any person who wants to enjoy the film as it was intended to be enjoyed (and keep in mind this was the BEST film in Japan ever, so Disney has no right changing it) It must be watched in subtitles. I understand Japanese so I was able to check if the subtitles were accurate, and they were indeed. But the dubbing is not accurate. Japanese and English are such different languages that to get the lips to sync you have to change the dialogue entirely. Also, Disney altered the dialogue in some cases that is acutally changes the development of the characters. For example, in one case she says &quot;what should I do&quot; but in the dub it says &quot;where are you haku.&quot; Also, beyond anything, the voice of that little girl in the dub is so irritating. The girl chosen for the original sounds much better, more mature. To conclude this ramble, This movie deserves twice what it costs, and beyond that, is a treasure that only comes around once every decade. This is truly what animation should be, much like many of the older disney films.	5.0	Absolutely wonderful! (avoid the dub)	2003-04-23	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A38HC3EL85NU6T	TofuKitty	This is a wonderful movie. It isn't as deep as princess mononoke but it is wonderful just the same. I saw it three times in the theater in under a week, that's how much this movie moved me. It's not just a movie it's an experience. As an extra little bonus for anime fans the dub is very good, something I could watch over and over. (At least I thought so) One word of caution is I could see serveral younger veiwer being scared by some of the scences, so those of you with young kids at home are advised to watch this movie before showing it you your kids.I have only two complaints about this DVD set. One being I have some issues with the literal translation subtitles, though my Japanese is limited, I feel they could be a little more accurate. (A Spanish language track also would have been a treat)My other is issue is the &quot;selected scene story board accsess&quot; is simply for 1 scene. I would love to see storyboards for the entire movie like what was included for laputa, kiki, and the Japanese release. You can watch the story board with english or Japanese dialoge but be warned there are no subtitles.Over all this is a great movie and a great DVD. I'd give the movie 5 stars and the DVD 4 stars for reasons explained above.	5.0	The first good movie I've seen in a long time	2003-04-17	3	3	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2RRFUHI1CSKIA	tokka	spirited away is like a dream. i espescially like the pure emotion put into this film.  Director Hayao Miyazaki poured his heart and soul into making this movie a special experience for its viewers. i like the way he connected the real world with the imaginary by plucking real live personalities, studying their emotions and then inserting them into this amazing piece of work as hand drawn charachters. that is another thing i like about this film, it wasnt made by some barely pubescent teen with a computer, it was made by teamwork of a large staff working, eating and socialising within gimli studio. what suprises me is that a film of this magnitude started with Miyazaki meeting a bored unsociable 10 year old daughter of his friend. Miyazaki observed the girl and concluded that he must makke a movie that is interesting to 10 year olds. he wanted to show them they werent just short teens forgotten near the floor, he wanted to excite them into taking a more active role in their lives.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	Spirited away is a Japanese animation about a 10 year old girl who travels with her parents to a new house. On the way they discover what seems to be an abandoned theme park, which the parents explore. It turns out to be a magic world, in which the young girl has to use her own rescources to initially survive and then to rescue her parents.The film is one of the most succesful Japanese films to be made in recent times. It is no surprise as not only is the story involving but the animation is beautiful. Rather than using computer generated graphics the film consists of the old style animation in which drawings are used to create the scene and movement of the characters. Each scene is carefully painted and the detail showing such things as the growth of moss on steps is painstaking.The film is also interesting as it is based on a mythology which is Japanese rather than Western. Whilst there are a couple of characters called witches, the Magic World is Japanese and features the eight million gods of the Buddist mythology. Somehow this makes the plot of the film totally unpredictable and no cliched. With Western story conventions, characters behave in stereotyped ways. Witches are evil, fairies are good. In this film the motives and actions of the characters are far more complex.After seeing the film some time ago and thinking about it the one thing which comes back though is the beauty of the animation. Even the closing stills are little works of art in themselves.	4.0	Very Good	2003-01-12	3	3	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1R35TL2RYP99J	Trigun Dude	Hayao Miyazaki is a giant among anime; writing, producing, and directing such films as &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;, &quot;Castle In The Sky&quot;, and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.  In &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, Miyazaki shows his full potential and charms audiences both young and old.&quot;Spirited Away&quot; starts with a young girl, Chihiro, moving with her family to a rural environment.  She is not happy of her family moving her away from her friends to a new school.  Her family stops at what they assume is a closed down amusement park.  Chihiro's parents find a food stand and start to eat.  Chihiro leaves them to look around the amusement park.  As the sun descends into the horizon, Chihiro frantically searches for her parents, only to find they had been transformed into pigs.Chihiro later finds out that the &quot;amusement park&quot; is actually a bath house for spirits.  She is helped by a young boy with the ability to transform into a dragon.  He helps her get a job at the bath house so she will not be captured and turned into an animal.  She then has to toughen up and start working so she can try to save her parents.This movie has paid large amounts of care in making every scene look true to life.  Miyazaki makes every movement of every character look as realistic as possible.  Every hair that falls, and every drop of water hitting a puddle look as if they were taken from a live action drama.  The attention to detail makes this magical tale even more believable.The writing in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a masterpiece.  Every sly remark from Chihiro sounds as if it was straight from the mouth of a ten year old girl.  This real-to-life writing is just another piece of the perfection that is &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.In conclusion, if there is any movie worthy of being purchased to be viewed multiple times and enjoyed over and over again, tis is it.	5.0	A Giant among all Anime	2003-04-18	3	2	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1ICEZXI9PTCN3	"""troytron"""	"'Spirited Away' was the first Miyazaki film I had ever seen so, in a positve sense, I had none of his past work with which to compare it or to influence my opinion. It was recommended by a friend who is a fan of some of Miyazaki's films and also by the numerous radiant reviews I had seen in this latest film's regard. I was not disappointed. Immediately, without any preconceived notions derived from Miyazaki's prior works, I was captured by the sense of wonder evoked by Miyzaki-san's truly elegant and unique approach to animation. The motifs present in every frame, the peripheral details in his frames that really are *not* so peripheral, the simplicity yet relevance of his modern characters -- all of these things made for instant interest, and then outright enchantment. Miyazaki proved himself a maestro, a deft conductor of a well-assembled orchestra from the very first moments. Music, exceptional use of color, brooding angles, and restrained dialogue strike a simultaneous chord of melancholy from the first moments we glimpse the dilemma of Chihiro in the back-seat of the car as her family is obviously in ""transition."" Every sight and sound is calculated with care and delicacy as the story moves quickly to the point where the family's ""off-the-beaten-path"" detour takes them to a mysterious but beguling sanctuary (of sorts) in the middle of a woodland. There, Chihiro's parents decide to have a carefree look around the lonely ruins, while the child-figure, Chihiro, senses trouble immediately. This establishes a powerful foundation for what I perceive to be Miyazaki-san's overall theme -- the Child, without guile or guide, often has the best instincts...despite having the least power, choice, or control with which to act upon those instincts.Chihiro relcutantly follows her parents into what appears to be a crumbling, abandoned theme-park. The eerie, lonely tones continue until the motif of delicious FOOD is planted smack-dab in the middle of the plot. The tones change, for the glorious, freshly-made ""feast"" brings both a sense of satisfaction and familiarity that plays nicely around the child's persistent apprehensions and the viewer's niggling sense that something simply CAN'T be right in this desolate landscape.What happens after Chihiro's parents dismiss her misgivings and settle down for a gluttonous meal is nothing less than a rip-roaring, non-stop explosion of magic, color, danger, mayhem, surprise, haunting imagery, and all-out bizarre (but morally ""thematically"" realistic) animation. The ""abandoned theme park"" turns out to be a ""Bath-house"" for the ancient Gods and Spirits of Japan -- abandoned by light of day, but magically transmogrified by night into an alternative universe where these spirits come to refresh themselves in ways that are at once human and decidedly immortal.The whole place is ""managed"" by a jaded and crabby old sorceress named ""Zeniba"" -- a character who must be seen to be believed, and both her clientele and her slave-driven employees never fail to disappoint the viewer's senses. There are a GREAT number of derivative qualities to Miyazaki-san's overall work -- shades of the Wizard of Oz,Alice in Wonderland, Never-Ending Story, Beauty and the Beast, and even an obscure Godzilla film make their influences known-- but these thematic borrowings and motifs serve the universal quality of the story with a very functional integrity. Even more poignant is the subtle sadness with which Miyazaki notes that the Japanese are fast trading the magic and mythical tradition of their ancient culture, in its entirety, for the irrepressible gift of Modernity.There's a love story here (or rather, a story about the primacy of love), and the truly empowering theme of a moody, spoiled little girl who is suddenly thrust into the madness of REAL magic and who must find a way to rise above her immaturity to save herself, her parents, and the balance of the seen and unseen worlds, is very inspiring. Essentially, Miyazaki-san is telling us how adaptable we are to frightening, frantic change in this world...and how adaptable we must be in order to survive. The fact that this lesson is learned best in his story by a *child* opens the door to many serious  questions about what our modern cultures are now demanding of the very young.These underlying brushstrokes aside, the whole film is a work of brilliance on the part of Mayazaki-san and his animators. The American dubbing is impeccable -- particularly Suzanne Pleshete as Zeniba and her ""alter ego."" The sight, story, and fate of the ""Stink Spirit"" alone is worth the purchase of this DVD. 'Spirited Away' is definitely an adult film in that it will appeal to fans of *anime* and will thrill the sensible adult mind as effortlessly as it will captivate the child, but some of the calibrated images are spooky and indelible; kids under six will have a couple of toss-and-turn nights, perhaps, after watching the film. Overall, though, this is a goldmine for the entire family, the ageless and proverbial young-at-heart, and one of the best Japanese films to emerge in recent years -- as evidenced by its big box office in Japan and in American art-house venues. The extras on the disc are notable for the original Japanese dub and moreso for the documentary of how Miyazaki literally ""hand-crafted"" this film the old fashioned way and emerged with a jewel that is every bit as breath-taking and eye-catching as the digital creations being churned out by contemporaneous production companies. Four and a Half Shooting Stars and kudos to Miyazaki-san. The half-star is detracted only because themes  are just a mite too OBVIOUSLY derivative -- but just a mite. This one's a keeper.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A255FPC0LAZOMC	truth seeker	it brings out your inner child and wonder about the other world. From a person who studies the philosophies and theosophy knowledge. It paints the picture of what can in the ethiric planes (dream world) or other dimensions. having a back ground in pagan wiccan studies and lore, they say don't eat anything from the fairy realm because you will get stuck there, and can't find your way back. Just my thoughts about it. Wonderful movie though. I also would suggest to have the audio in English, and the litteral Japanese translation subtitles to compare what the thoughts of the movie is. Chihiro is so soft spoken in the Japanese language, and very loud and annoying in the english version because of culture. Westerners are considered loud and obnoxious in modest Asian countries.	5.0	Miyazaki's films are always fantastic	2013-01-03	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2OCJNB6B46OKP	"Underground Reborn ""gnome"""	As the new millenum had finally arrived Studio Ghibli graced the world with 'Spirited Away'. This movie took the world of Hayao Miyazaki and threw it right into your face saying 'This is the work of Studio Ghibli. Watch our movies!!!' So we listened and to show America's graditude 'Spirited Away' won the second Oscar for Best Animated Feature.This is a story of Chihiro. A spoiled brat who never has to do anything. Though she gets anything she wants whenever she wants she still feels alone and ignored by the world. On the move to their new house Chihiro's family spots an abandoned amusement park. What they don't know is that it is a resort to the spirits that walk the Earth at night. Now her paretns broke the rules and turned into pigs so it's up to Chihiro to break the curse. On her dangerous yet sometimes humerous quest she learns what it is like to prove to yourself in the world and you can do great things.This is a very different film for Hayao Miyzaki. This is a story that plays upon some of the most bizzare fantasy stories. It is also a movie that can be a bit weird and sometimes disturbing. Yet what you see will blow your mind for it is so origional and so mind bending you will be craving to see what happens next. At this point Studio Ghibli is a world renound phenomenon and Disney is giving it a helping hand to get all the films to the world. 'Spirited Away' is a real milestone for Ghibli because once this movie received it's Oscar it was embraced by a whole new wave of fans. After that they craved more and thus the films like 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Pom Poko' were finally brought over seas and now one can only think about the next wave of films that is on its way to us.(End of Volume 1)	5.0	And the first chapter ends....with an Oscar!

Though visually, they all look great and unique, the story plot is somewhat confusing for those not familiar with the genre. Spirited Away has it's great moments. The creatures are interesting and again, the visual effects are truly eye opening. However, at times, the movie just spirals into a completely different plot and you almost have to get your bearings about what is going on. It jumps and gets pretty weird at times. My husband, who is a fan, explained that alot of anime movies are shot like this. He actually told me that 'Crouching Dragon, Hidden Dragon' is basically a live-action Anime film. Like I said, it gets pretty odd at times and young kids may not understand alot of what is going on.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1T3BLDYI85T0W	Veronica Bennett	Spirited Away swept me away.  I first viewed the version in Japanese with English subtitles.  I was hooked.  The art, the animation, and Miyazaki's imagination are just magnificent.  I must confess, every time I watch his work, I think about the thousands of hours of drawing needed to create such a full length film.  I understand that he drew most of his work himself, resisting (until recently) digital animation.So intrigued, I purchased the dubbed in English version.  When I could hear the conversation, the story then really came to life.  I realize now that in watching the version with subtitles, I had missed many visual nuances and subtleties that also move the story along.The story is very sweet. There are lessons for children and adults of all ages.  Chihiro/Sen is respectful of tradition, nature, and the elderly.  Her respect is acknowledged by those with whom she comes in contact.  She handles her trials head on and with much courage.  She is a roll model for young girls who must learn to assert themselves without bitterness or cynicism.Hey... its a great story and you will enjoy each of the characters... enjoy!	5.0	The  Animation is Perfection	2006-02-10	6	3	3

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2WVO6HLC181H6	ViolentlyHappy	Who knew that someone could tie together anime, fantasy, love, and tons of imagination into 125 minutes? Well it was very much possible. I give props out the Miyazaki-san, because this is one of his greatest achievements.First.The characters are wonderfully depicted. The protagonist, Chihiro, has the greatest personality that a twelve year old (I think) could POSSIBLY have. Growing up, I'm guessing, she was probably either spoiled or ignored terribly. And when she's suddenly thrown into this world were she finds that she has to take care of herself, she shapes up. She steps-up to the challenge of surviving in a magical world when she, unconsciously, falls in love with the river spirit, Haku. And vise versa, Haku begins at the other end of the rope and has to learn how to be a child again. Having no memories of who he is or where he came from, Haku is just one emotional blank. And that is what draws Chihiro to him. From the moment they met in the spirit world, she realizes that Haku is always going to be there when she needs him, and all while Haku himself showed immediate concern for her safety and later on doesn't hesitate to help her once she becomes trapped there.Second.The colors and animation blend together so beautifully it is shocking. The movement of the characters, the music and the scenery is depicted so well. If you read it as a book or a manga series, there would be no doubt in your mind that the way the story is portrayed and visualized, would be how you imagined it when you read it.Third.The storyline is amazingly written very well for an animation based film. Love, regret, hopelessness, trust and friendships are just a few of the themes that underline this movie.This is an excellent film, and I recommend it to people of all ages.	4.0	I was definetly 'spirited away'	2008-04-30	1	1	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AFE9RSMXII4B9	V. Nguyen	This movie goes along the line of great Japanese animation such as Princess Mononoke and Kiki's delivery service. Which, by the way is done by all the same person; the brilliant and unbelievable Hayao Miyazaki.For young Chihiro and her family, a mysterious tunnel and haunted town lead to the Land of Spirits, inhabited by gods and monsters and ruled by the greedy witch Yu-baba.  Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs; to rescue them, she must surrender her name and serve in this world.  Luckily she finds friends and allies, including the handsome but mysterious boy Haku.  Initially sulky and listless, Chihiro (or Sen, as she's now called) finds inner strengths and establishes an identity in this strange world.  The rest of the story tells of her trying to go home with her parents transformed back.The initial conflict is not as many think as Yu-baba vs. Chihiro, but Chihiro vs. Chihiro in which she battles herself to find inner strength. What is interesting about this movie is there no definitive bad guy. They all have good reason why they do the things they do. Look at Yu-baba, she is only trying to run her bathhouse successfully.The music fits wonderfully with the movie. It has an indescribable sound to it with a both melancholy but yet uplifting quality in it.The characters are neither all good nor all bad. The main character is not an overly brave overly talented girl, very average and very easily relatable. The main guy is not all good when his character flaws start emerging with its mysterious unknown past. The &#65533;bad&#65533; guy isn&#65533;t all that bad. These are characters that will stick with you and make you root for them until the very end.The animation will floor you with its painstaking details and breathtaking colors. Not since beauty and the beast have we seen such animation that truly deserves an oscar. Frame by frame is like piece of artwork genius. Very impressive and truly a work of art.The story goes by quick and the ending may not be what most fans expected and sadly so. But every movie has its vices. Still, everything mores than makeup for it.A movie worth seeing more than once. I should know, I&#65533;ve seen at a lot more than once. Deserves all its praise and much more. A must see movie spectacular.	5.0	Beautiful animation with a beautiful story.	2003-06-16	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2S70GN8318ZJB	Will	Hayao Miyazaki never fails to please and it is no different with Spirited Away. It is no doubt that Miyazaki is an anime genius who knows how to keep the viewer interested in both story and the characters. I can say with no doubt in my mind that Spirited Away is a must have for any movie fan and no collection can be complete without it. It has been many years since I have seen this movie and now even in my twenties I still enjoy it and wonder how I have lived so many years without remembering this movie. It is a must get along with many more of Miyazaki's movies.	5.0	One of the best movies of my childhood!	2012-01-02	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AX9FLAFCVP2FB	"William Alexander ""Bill Alexander"""	This film is fantastic.  I won't go into the plot as other reviews have already done so competently, so I'll relate my reaction to watching it.Every scene is a wonderful blend of child-like precocious-ness, fanciful animation, and fantastic story telling.  Every scene is imbued with mystery and a sense of wonderment and I found myself completely enchanted from beginning to end.  The characters are rich and interesting, the colors jump off the screen, and I was completely enraptured by the wonderful journey that this little girl embarked on.  Viewing this film is truly a delight that people of all ages can appreciate.I recommend this film highly; even for an adult it is highly enchanting and wonderful.	5.0	Incredible story telling and animation	2003-07-29	2	1	1
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A2ITYWQZY6FASI	William D	I love this movie to death. I watched it the first time with my older brother who moved away a few years ago. So this movie does have sentimental value to me. However, if you are going to buy this product, word of advice, buy it from Amazon, not from Melody's Media Corner. Reason why is because they shipped it with FedEx as the carrier. I got a notification saying that my package was in town and was out for delivery on May 30th. It came a day later, which is usually fine, no problem with that. Until I opened the package. Inside the factory sealed case were two loose discs, both of them scratched badly, and both of the holders were broken. Along with that, the back of the discs have a distinct, curvy, rainbow pattern to it, as if it has been through a wash. Not sure what happened along the way, but I'm very upset with the horrendous condition my package came in. It still plays normally, with just a few skips here and there. Overall, the movie is incredible, I recommend it to just about anyone! Just save yourself some frustration and buy it from Amazon.. not Melody's Media Corner.	4.0	Amazing Movie! Brings back memories!

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A3IG2ZD9HPTJJH	"William F. Soule ""f_ll_nth_bl_nk"""	This is a great movie, but it is obviously not for everyone, especially those who lack a creative spirit. I read one review that downcasted the Japanese for not making the characters look Asian enough! And another said that this movie is too &quot;different and weird.&quot; How sad. Others complained that this movie is too scary for kids (it says right on it - PG: For Some Scary Moments). And indeed there are! Don't rent it for your 4-year olds and complain about that it if they get scared. Anyway, to my opinion about the movie:BAD: This movie isn't perfect, and there are a few MINOR things that bothered me. First, the noses. When Chihiro turns sideways, her nose looks oddly shaped and flat.And last, the relationship between Yababa's sister and Chihiro wasn't developed enough. They share a scene with each other for about 5 minutes before Chihiro has to leave, and they are saying their good-byes as if they have been with each other for years!GOOD: The creativity of this movie is astounding! That's probably why some people don't like it. Maybe it's just too creative for some people. (Look at our music industry, for example. Since when did people enjoy a little creativity in music? But I won't go there). Anyway, there are a lot of weird creatures and spirits and a talking frog! You should also see some of the food the parents eat, as well as everything else, but there are too many things to type about.And also the originality of this movie... I haven't seen any movie even remotely like this one. If you have noticed the protaganists and antagonists, they are not the typical good vs. evil. Like Yababa (the main antagonist). I don't think she is evil, although she does unlikeable things. She is, however, trustworthy and she takes care of her giant baby! And the protaganist (Chihiro being the main one) is at first unlikeable (her screaming over everything... sheesh), but you grow to sympathize with her and like her throughout the movie. And one character (No-Face) switches from neutral to protagonist to antagonist to protagonist again.Also, the weird plot and setting (they enter this other world that seems to be in another world...). It's kind of hard to explain without giving everything away. You really have to see it for yourself.And the dubbing/voice acting was actually all right! I really liked the voices for all the characters, from the actor for Chihiro who really puts emotion into her character, and to Yababa with her throaty voice. Everyone was perfect.Also, I'm really glad with Miyazaki, because it feels like he was making this movie for himself (this movie does not follow any formula like in a lot of American movies). There are a lot of climaxes and resolutions in this movie and it feels as if he made up this movie as he went along, which in this case is a good thing.Overall, a great movie. Just don't complain about this movie because it has violence or the characters didn't look Asian enough. That's what G movies are made for- people who cannot enjoy creativity and a piece of art that was made for Miyazaki's pleasure. This is definitely not for close-minded people.	5.0	It says PG right on it!	2004-01-20	6	6	0

I read all the great reviews and I was SO looking forward to watching this DVD but, oh my, even making allowances for cultural differences, this was a total drag.  I found many of the characters irritating, the plot (?was there a plot) went every which way, and I didn't think the animation was so very spectacular.  (No I wasn't expecting Disney or even Don Bluth - but I thought it would be better that it was somehow.)  Well.... you can't please everybody.  I'm just not that hard to entertain as a rule.  (Please know that the last movie I absolutely hated was in 1971!!!)  I'm glad that so many people seem to have gleaned so much pleasure from this flick.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	AUTBHG6070SL4	"wiredweird ""wiredweird"""	-- by some of the best story-telling in animation today.The basic plot is familiar, especially to Miyazaki fans. A plucky young girl, thrown into strange circumstances, wins her goals through hard work and bravery. In this case, little Chohiro is thrown into a Japanese fantasy world, working as a bath-house drudge, in order to save her enchanted parents.The bath-house, however, serves the spirits, gods, and other beings that apparently inhabit Japan's fairy tales. Remember in Shrek, how seemingly every one of the Brothers Grimm characters came to life, all together? It's like that, but with a serious tone. The difference is that I didn't recognize any of the characters. They're not the fairy tales I grew up with. I could see that they were cultural icons, but not from my culture. That fascinated me - now I want to go and find out just who all those characters were, and what cultural meaning they have.It's kid-safe, with no serious adult themes or violence. Those aren't needed to keep Chohiro's quest interesting and to sustain a sense of wonder. There's enough to keep an adult interested, too. Don't wait til there's a kid around to treat yourself to this incredible movie.//wiredweird	5.0	Carried away --	2005-02-26	3	2	1

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A38671VQ0UM3AL	Wren	Spirited Away quickly became my favorite movie of all time. It is a masterpiece. This film is utterly transportive - from the soundtrack to the setting to the spirits that populate Miyazaki's magical world, it draws you in and you never, ever want to leave. This is a story of a selfish, spoiled little girl who ultimately learns to have courage and pull her own weight to save her parents and the friends she makes along the way. She must work hard, learn to play by the rules (and break them), and trust her gut. Please treat yourself to this unique and special fairy tale.

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A12H8HKK4EOOE	Yoghurtaddict	Spirited Away is a film that people of all ages should be able to connect to. The story involves Chihiro, a young girl who ends up in the world of spirits. Spirits represent pretty much anything you can think of in life from plants like the Radish spirit to emotion such as the lonely No Face. Throughout the movie we see Chihiro grow from a self centered child to a more mature self. This movie shows this quite literally how if you don't know the means of basic survival, chances are the world is going to eat you up. It's the kind of messages kids need to get these days rather than thinking they're going to get a job from something like Spy Kids. Sure this film may be scary for some kids, but for the good majority it's a taste of reality with plenty of enjoyment to go with it.	5.0	A Film All Ages Can Connect Too	2003-04-22	0	0	0
B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A52NNA3BJGJ43	yorozuya	I first saw this a year ago on Disney Channel asia and fell in love with it. It really saddens me that people would give this a one star only because the dvd won't work. I also saw some comments that said they are confused. But for me, it wasn't really that confusing. Maybe it's because I'm Asian too or maybe I've watched and read animes and mangas for a long time that I can understand their culture. One thing that I noticed is that this movie is for ages 5 and above. I must say that this is not for 5 year-old children. Hayao Miyazaki himself stated that this is for children who are 10 years old or above.% year olds won't be able to understand what happens in this movie.	5.0	best animated film	2013-03-04	0	0	0

B00005JLET	Spirited Away [VHS]	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	I've been introducing my seven-year-old to several of Studio Ghibli offerings, such asKiki's Delivery Service,Howl's Moving Castle,My Neighbor Totoro,Ponyo, and more recentlyStudio Ghibli: The Borrower Arrietty DVD (Licensed boxed version, Japanese audio version with Eng Sub). I held off on showing her Spirited Away until today because I felt some elements such as the spirit world would be too scary for her until now.She watched it with me this afternoon and loved it! Before showing this to her, I explained some elements of Asian folklore (I am originally from Southeast Asia and could relate to some of the folklore underlying this story) so she could follow the story better, though this is not strictly necessary, especially for older viewers.Spirited Away follows the adventures of 10-year-old Chihiro who together with her parents is making a move from the city to the suburbs. Chihiro is not very happy about this move, and when her parents accidentally find themselves off the beaten path on their way to their new home, she discourages them from exploring. Chihiro has a strange sense of foreboding that this new place which her father presumes to be an abandoned theme park is much more than that and she is of course proven right. Her parents are turned into pigs after gorging on food they found at this place, which turns out to be inhabited by the spirit world.In Asian folklore, there is an emphasis on respecting old superstitions, which includes belief in the spirit world inhabited by the Gods and otherworldly creatures. When Chihiro's parents gorged on food meant for the spirits, they were being very disrespectful and so are punished accordingly. The rest of the story follows Chihiro's efforts, aided by the loyal Haku, to redeem her parents and make their escape from the malevolent witch Yubaba who rules over this world.The animation is simply amazing and conjures up a fantastical world of odd-looking creatures (that radish spirit was just out of this world!) in an alternate world that is vividly brought to life. The animation is superior but what makes this such a memorable film is the heartfelt story with its underlying theme of respect, loyalty,friendship, trust, and sacrifice. Chihiro's relentless efforts to save her parents credibly portrays the theme of filial piety and her courage and determination make her a true heroine, serving as a great role model for children. This is a film to be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, and I am so glad that I have the opportunity to share this remarkable film with my own child. P.S. Watch out for deals on Studio Ghibli films here on Amazon, as the prices tend to drop and I've been able to amass my very own Ghibli collection!	5.0	What a wondrous tale!	2012-03-10	1	1	0
