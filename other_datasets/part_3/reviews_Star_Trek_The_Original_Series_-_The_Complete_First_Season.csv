B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AG8W3FNYGJRKI	1234567890	Just about every episode in this set is great! Some of the best episodes include 'Squire of Gothos' 'City on the edge of forever' and 'What are little girls made of'.Did you know that a man in a bathrobe walks by on the enterprise! I first noticed him in the beginning of 'What are little girls made of'. He walks by in the backround with a strange look on his face. I also noticed him in 'Errand of Mercy'. He walks by a few times on the bridge.	5.0	Affirmative, Captian	2005-11-13	5	0	5

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A11OMEN3BSTQQ0	"70's_Rule ""mb"""	It's hard not to be biased by my love of TOS, but even so I have to give Season 1 in regular definition 5 out 5.  The series writing and acting was brilliant throughout Season 1.  Favorite episodes in Season 1 include &#34;City On The Edge Of Forever&#34;, &#34;The Menagerie/The Cage&#34;, &#34;A Taste Of Armageddon&#34;, &#34;Charlie X&#34;, &#34;Miri&#34;, &#34;The Conscience Of The King&#34; - all engaging episodes and transporting, so to speak.  There's magic with these first serials that I don't think is duplicated on too many of shows of any genre or period.One thing I've noticed is that &#34;Star Trek-TNG&#34; fans seem to have trouble appreciating TOS, and they are very different in my opinion.  So I recommend just buying a few episodes from Season 1 or simply joining Amazon Prime at $79.00 for a whole YEAR (a bargain by any measure) where you can watch them as much as you want and then decide whether to make them part of your permanent collection.IMPORTANT NOTE:  For avid Star Trek fans I do NOT recommend the remastered/HD version.  It sounds like it'd be better quality, but all that was done was to &#34;update&#34; the special effects scenes (should as the Enterprise orbiting a planet) to a computer graphic that totally clashes with the rest of the early special effects in the main parts of the show.  The original video and audio was no better in my judgement.  I only hope the don't stop making the original episodes in favor of the HD remasters.	5.0	Wonderful, but make sure you buy or view the ORIGINAL original series, NOT the HD version	2013-08-27	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2T9FHVVGNSFVF	A Customer	I'll admit that I was biased and didn't want to get involved. I guess I prejudged it based on the stereotype of &#34;Trekkies&#34;. My favorite show is &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34; for its ability to get me into a particular headspace. I can't precisely put my finger on it but, without subjecting us all to a wandering rant, I react to &#34;Star Trek TOS&#34; very similarly. This reaction isn't consistent across the sci-fi genre.	5.0	I was hesitant. Turns out I love it, though.	2014-03-25	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3JXOXKWOIETIY	"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse"""	"This is the first and best season of TOS.  Some of my own favorites from this season are ""Miri"" guest starring Kim Darby on a duplicate Earth (though a cloudless one) where only kids have survived a longevity experiment gone haywire.  But Grup Kirk comes to the rescue with ""NO BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!""  and Kim's subtlety is a good foil to Shatner's intensity.  Also here is one of the ""kids"" Michael Pollard who was 26 at the time.  That one kid is so annoying, the one who always shouts ""BONK BONK ON THE HEAD!""  Spock, who a few episodes earlier was saying stuff like, ""Ah yes, one of your Earth emotions"", is here explaining Miri's emotions to the others.Another good one is Charlie X who sees Janis and asks Kirk, ""Is that a girl?""  Actually a poignant take on adolescence guest stars Robert Walker Jr.  After Charlie says, ""No laughing"", that girl without the face is always scary.The Naked Time is ill-conceived, though a vehicle for developing the show for later superior episodes.  The Enemy Within is good with the dubplicate Kirk. The Conscience of the King is here, the war criminal one and some Shakespeare thrown in.  Galileo Seven and yes, ""City on the Edge of Forever"" closes out the Season.Some comments on ""City"".  How exactly does Edith Keeler influence FDR to delay entry into the war... do they mean AFTER Pearl Harbor he delayed?  Hmmm.  Also Uhuru's comment to Kirk, ""Happiness at least sir"" was so out of place...though not as much as her comments during his recent roast."	5.0	Season One:  The Holy Grail of '60s Sci-Fi!	2006-09-19	6	4	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2OZBJ58CML9OS	A. Gammill	"Like (I suspect) most people reading this, I have a long history with Star Trek and all its incarnations.  But it all began with this show.  And I for one am tired of hearing about how ""cheesy"" it was, or ""bad special effects.""  What?  Man, this was groundbreaking stuff in the late 60's, and anyone with a sense of history should realize that.I've pretty much enjoyed all the spinoffs, movies, etc.  But you'll never convince me that any of them had the chemistry, the ingenuity or sheer entertainment value of the classic series.  Kirk was the all-time thinking man's action hero, an Alpha Male for the 23rd century.  And there just hasn't been a more interesting alien character than Mr. Spock, played with intelligence and dignity by Leonard Nimoy.  And...well, you know about the cast already.As with the other Trek series DVD collections, there are several well-made featurettes.  It's a nice treat (and a bit surprising) to hear a few stories you may not have heard before.  I especially enjoyed Leonard Nimoy's comments on his widely misinterpreted autobiography ""I Am Not Spock.""Maybe it's been awhile since you really sat down and watched Star Trek.  Maybe you marvel at how the technology on the show  Enterprise seems far in advance of that on Kirk's ship, even though Enterprise is set BEFORE the orginal Trek.  Maybe every time you see one of those Priceline commercials you wince at what the Mighty Shatner has been reduced to.  In any event, this excellent DVD set comes at a time when I think maybe we all need to be reminded of why Star Trek has endured for nearly 40 years.Casual fan or hardcore ""Trekkie"" (or ""Trekker""), I really think you should get this one."	5.0	"In a word, ""Fascinating"""	2004-08-08	12	10	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1RG4WKNMPYS4X	airfirehorse	"I bought this set because i really loved the series. All of the first season episodes are here, but they are completely out of order. Yes, they are in ""airdate"" order, but when i buy a set like this i expect them to correct that and simply put them in order of occurrence. I actually took the time to watch them in the order of ""star date"" (chronologically). I preferred this way due to uniform and personnel changes. This seems like a major oversight by the DVD set's producers.The extras are wonderful--perhaps too much Shatner, but still informative. I wish there was more on DeForrest Kelly, though. The original first episode should have been included (even though they do include the ""Menagerie"" episode, which covers most of it). All in all, not the best set, but i have enjoyed it."	4.0	A most original series, but...	2004-09-05	9	3	6

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A19HQVND02SRWE	Alan	"Here it is, the original, first season of Star Trek, presented uncut and in its original broadcast order.  What a lot of people don't know is that when shows are sold for syndication, cuts are made to the episodes to allow the broadcaster more time for commercials.  If you're one of the people who caught Star Trek for the first time in syndication (and not during it's original run on NBC), you almost undoubtedly have not seen the episodes in their entirety.  It's nice to have them uncut here, running at about 50 minutes each.  The picture quality is good, though the sound seems to be a little loud at parts (like during the credits).  Not all of the episodes are great -- I've never cared much for ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" -- but there are some real classics here, such as ""Arena"", ""Errand Of Mercy"" (with the first appearance of the Klingons), ""Space Seed"" (with the first appearance of Khan), and of course, ""The City On The Edge Of Forever"".This is classic television, and classic Trek, before it was run into the ground and beaten to death by Paramount, Rick Berman, and Brannon Braga."	5.0	A classic	2005-07-04	5	3	2

I believe it to be if, not the best, one of The best shows on the television, ever.  It has everything, absolutely everything!!! its limited only by the imagination!!!  Gene Rodenberry was a visionary.  He really created a new genre, he made Star Trek.  The proof is all around us today in cinema, technology, even our lingo.  It's no wonder this show and all the others that have followed have had such great success.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A15IKI9BAE75T2	Alex G	Disclosure: I generally do not like CGI effects, however, in the case of Trek I am very impressed. Gene Roddenberry must be smiling in Trek heaven at this generally noble restoration and enhancement of his most effective baby. While there are some episodes (generally in the later years' episodes, such as The Tholian Web and Elan of Troyious) that were better off than before the upgrade, the overhall was quite worth the wait. The Gallileo 7, Arena, Space Seed, and A Taste of Amageddon, stand out as greatly improved with substantial new material.The video, as many describe here, does suffer from some grainy issues, but generally, the enhancements are effective and plentiful, giving brand new views of the Enterprise, new space shots and compellingly effective views of shuttlecraft and the many alien planets, which are color cooridinated to the look of the shows'skies (a brilliant move!).One thing that really gripes me is the intro Space: The Final Frontier speech is very poorly rendered, and is almost inaudible in stereo, and hardly better in 5.1 surround. That is unacceptable as it a trademark of the show. It is almost as if the separate channels of the audio are out of phase with each other, therefore cancelling each other out. Very poor 2 stars for that.Otherwise the audio I rate at 3 to 4 stars, and occasionally rising to five stars in a few episodes, as they are jpeg for the most of us. It is not unusual for the alarn klaxons to be mixed in stereo, and many of the audio effects that were formerly mono, are now in rich stereo and dolby 5 channel. I believe most of us that do not have the HD DVD are precluded from accessing the HD portion (with the exception being the money grabbing Blu-Ray format) of the video.Jpeg Dolby 5.1 audio was very expensive in its day and is still pretty steep for most of us now. How many of us really have big 5 channel stereos and a sub? You have to have that to get even a glimpse of Dolby 5.1. Blu-ray's superior audio can only shine if you have multi thousand dollar 5 or seven channel stereos, and how many consumers have that? Even my doctors, with all the money they make, say that studio monitors, which is what blu ray HD audio requires, is out of their reach. Truth is Dolby 5.1 audio was good enough for the majority of us. I have a 5.1 system and believe me it sounds nearly perfect. Dumping all my gear and getting new amps and receivers and a blu ray system would be nuts. I refuse to be a studio chump and dump my good gear for some studios and electronics stores to make a mint off of me is not gonna happen.I have to agree, this is overpriced and it is true that the packaging being cheap plastic, leaves much to be desired.This being Star Trek, the show material is first rate and most of us here love Star Trek or we would not be considering this DVD set. This is all I can write for the moment. I will add more later...	4.0	Five stars for the Video, but less than desirable 3 for the intro sound, 5 stars for the enhanced CGI	2010-08-31	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1A9LNXJC9D895	Alfonso Llana	Being a Colombian living in Colombia, every few opportunities I had to travel to the US I used to buy tapes of Star Trek the original series. I began in 1985 and though of lately had become a little lazy I got almost there, all the 79 episodes, but never was able to do it....and then there are internet and Amazon and so on and this fabulous collection is beamed down to me.What I think? It is all I had dreamed about...well almost. Regarding the bottom line (having the episodes with great video&sound; quality) it is mission acomplished but:-though the clamshell package is terrific the album style plastic cases the DVD's are actually stored in are not. I ended breaking up one of the small plastic legs in each one of them in order to make an easier job of using and storing the discs.-I would have liked much more bonus material, much more.-Though I consider myself pretty fluent in English many in my family and/or group of friends are not. In these times it is not understandable why such a worldwide liked production like Star Trek was not made with subtitles in several languages.-last but not least the set is very expensive. It has ever increased in price after I bought my sample. Second and third seasons are becoming even more expensive. Sigh... I suppose is a matter of offer and demand.To end the subject, I LOVE this set, every second of it.	5.0	I have been waiting 20 years	2004-11-28	8	5	3

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A17K7LGWGJOPS9	Allan J. Krueger	I read the reviews for this set and, as a collector, I found many of the complaints, unsettling: poor package design, excessive echo in the opening voiceover by Shatner and problematic discs.When I received the set, I thought I had dodged a bullet - it arrived unbroken and complete. I popped in the first disc and watched an episode. I thought the video and audio were stunning - minus the opening voiceover. I decided to watch a second episode... About half way through, the video paused repeatedly. Then, started running without audio. The audio stumbled back on, but, was totally out of sync with the video. This continued for several minutes before the disc resumed normal playing. I decided to quit for the night.This morning, I loaded another disc and attempted to play the second episode. My player reported that it could not play the disc and gave me an error code. I have had the player for three months and previously, had not run into a single issue with my other 15 discs - NO ISSUES! From this, I have to conclude that the HD side of these discs have problems. I am now faced with the decision of whether to send the set back and be without OR pay a ridiculous price for the functional standard DVD set (with HORRIBLE packaging)!	3.0	Not so fast!	2008-03-01	4	3	1

I think the DVD box set from a few years ago is the way to go and I own an HD-DVD player!The reality is these are altered versions of Star Trek The Original Series with new effects and audio tracks. That's fine for some but don't you think they should have included on this set the actual original unaltered versions as well sans those new effects and audio tracks? For the uninformed they don't realize they aren't really getting the actual original versions but a new updated collection with CGI and unaltered versions no where to found. Why has no one brought this up?Also a friend of mine said that when watching the new versions that the picture switches between the original 4:3 aspect ratio for the untouched scenes to a 16 x 9 ratio for the new CGI scenes. Wow. Does this also not bother anyone?Sorry folks I'll pass on this set. I already own the originals as it is and I am quite pleased with the quality as the HD-DVD player does a fine job of upscaling. No thanks Paramount you get no more money from me.	1.0	Does no one care that the original  unaltered aired episodes are not available on the this set???	2007-10-01	104	48	56

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A235WLH4D774IL	"ALPS ""AL-P"""	"No matter where you go, there you are. After six television series, ten motion pictures, and endless books and conventions, Star Trek, the original 1966 television show has reclaimed it's greatness.In it's first and greatest season, humanity was the running theme. Allthough the writers, some of the greatest, science fiction or otherwise, worked with a brick wall of a canon or writers' guide, somehow made the characters  believable in a fantastic stage of storytelling. Watching these episodes now as an adult,  maturity has added a new dimension to the viewing. Duty, honor, accountability, sacrifice, and unconditional love, are intertwined between the characters. Star Trek has an unfortunate stigma of geekdom attached to it, which it unfairly made it's fans targets of ridicule. But when you watch an episode such as the Naked Time, where an alien virus, brings out the infected crews inner emotions and fears out into the surface, in the final scene after the cure, Kirk gazes to Yoman Rand, without her noticing, he reaches out to touch her and in the same motion draws his hand back, proclaiming, ""no beach to walk on"". He realizes he could never have a woman in his life, because of the Enterprise. In the same episode, Nurse Chapel, explains to Spock, that she will love him unconditionally, in which he is terrified that he doesn't understand it. Hard to believe that this was 1960's television, the golden age of the 50's spilled on a space opera. Paramount has done an outstanding job with this box set. The masterly photography of Gerry Finnerman, is flawless and the sound is sharp and clear. I loved the menus and the extras, at least Mr. Shatner didn't tell his ""bicycle story"", I heard too much at conventions. But the thing that made me most happy, is that The City on the Edge of Forever, had been restored. In the 1980's when the shows were first out on video, City has a scene with Mr. Shatner (his greastest performance on the series) and Joan Collins, are walking down the street hand in hand, while a 1930 radio plays a singer crooning, ""good night sweetheart"". The song was important because this is the scene where their love for each other is getting deeper. I suppose due to copywrite problems, the song was replaced along with the underscore of it in key sequences, with something less effective. But, now the song is back! I will not complain about the price or packaging, to me it is worth the price, and it sets the standard, not by price but quality. I would have liked the blooper reel or the film sent to the Venice Film Festival. Also, I would have like to have had an interview with Grace Lee Whitney, I would have been interested to hear her take of what happened to her character and her life as an Star Trek icon. She was too much woman to igore, too much woman."	5.0	NO BEACH TO WALK ON	2005-04-14	13	10	3

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A13JU90C7AU3RT	"Amazon Customer ""believe2bfree"""	Hard to believe this show is almost 50 years old, and still looks good.  What makes it great is the lack of technology available to the producers in the 60's.  They had to have good scripts and a good story to make it work, and they did.  You don't really have to have a brain to watch modern sci-fi, you just go along for the ride, but on the original Trek, you were there.  And the variety was good - comedy, adventure, science, and theology, all represented.  And these shows look great, literally.  The remastered color and imagery are far superior to what most of us saw on the originals, if you have a good HD TV.  One sad note, however: due to the dummies at NBC New York, the final year of production saw a decline in quality of scripts and topics, and on a few programs, the actors depression showed in their onscreen performance.  About half of the original cast are gone now, but to the rest, Thank You.	5.0	Bring your Imagination	2013-04-04	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A20WTWM08BPHNY	"Amazon Customer ""demzer"""	"To rebut another review, anything professionally shot on 35 mm film, whether from the 1960s or 2007, is natively high-definition--that is, the amount of information that has been recorded on the MASTER is equal to or greater than HD standards.  It's only the duplications that, until HD mastering, were of lesser definition.  That's the reason studios at first were so hesitant to adopt HD DVDs--it diminished the value of their master if everyone had a copy as good.  So when a film is remastered in HD from an original film master in good condition, it's true HD and not ""extra pixels filling in empty space.""  Remastering, of course, can be done well or poorly, accounting for differing quality in the final product.  Anyone who's seen these remastered episodes knows how fantastic they are--both for how great they look and, yes, how they show up the wooden sets and cheap costumes, etc. from the period.  But that's part of the fun!  What's astonishing is how well this show holds up in HD, and how much the new effects extend its original vision.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AMIGVTZZIWS6I	Amazon Customer	"Season one of The Original Series is, in my opinion, the best of the three.  It contains so many great, iconic episodes: ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" ""The Corbomite Maneuver,"" ""Balance of Terror,"" and of course the two most iconic episodes ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and ""Space Seed.""  Season two and to a lesser extent season three certainly had some great episodes, but this first season outshines them all for the shear quality of the writing and originality.Having watched all the episodes of Star Trek when they aired on television I was much more interested in the reworked versions. I have to admit that I was blown away at the new visual effects and improved quality of the picture and sound.  In some cases the new visual effects were greatly different from the original but in most cases just a few small tweaks were made to improve flight and battle scenes.  For me, the real improvement was in the quality of the prints.  When you watch the Original Series on television you can tell the prints are old and well worn, but with this Blu Ray version all those spots and hiccups are gone without ruining the overall quality of what you're watching."	5.0	The First and Best Season of Star Trek	2009-07-03	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2HJT8HRVMU6BZ	Amazon Customer	"I am thoroughly enjoying reliving my youth watching the original Star Trek series, and when I read the reviews of the blu-ray edition, I was excited to make the purchase. All in all, I am very satisfied, but I guess my expectations of the hi-def quality were too high. As I watch closely, the artifacts on the images are visible, and I am not surprised, but still need to give this a 5-star rating, as it is still a far better quality than the old VHS transfers, which I used to own. Here is something to keep in mind: I am watching these episodes on a 42 inch 1080p LCD TV, and when I watched the first episode, I was rather close to the TV, which technically is the wrong way to watch it. There is a recommended viewing distance, which varies according to the size of the TV, and I can see the reason behind this. When I watched the same episode in another room, where I also have the same size LCD 1080p TV, I was able to watch it from a much further distance, and the difference was quite noticeable, as the artifacts were, in fact, not visible at all,or barely, so the saturation of colors, the detail, etc, were far more noticeable and appreciated. The only time watching at the closer distance will not be a factor, is if the movie is filmed in hi-def  and is a blu-ray edition, where even at a close distance, there are no distractions, as the excellent quality of the hi-def transfer is obvious. Even in this blu-ray edition of Star Trek, the ""enhanced"" images, were crystal clear, even at close range. It dramatically changed (at the close distance), when the episode began to play following the view of the enhanced image, which is when the artifacts were noticeable. So what I can advise is to ""keep your distance,"" and you will certainly enjoy this amazing series in blu-ray quality!"	5.0	WONDEFUL, BUT...	2009-05-03	5	3	2

If you want the true ""Star Trek"", get the yel/blue/red sets - that is as close to a definitive version as we have.  If you also want a beautifully colored version (I'm assuming the colors were enhanced rather than restored because they are so bright) with great clarity it is worth it to get the new set. All the exterior space shots and shots of the ships and planets are completely digitized (?!?!) and have been redone digitally so they look like they're from 90's .It would have been perfect if they had just left the new digital stuff out and just did the color/clarity.The new hd-dvd version is for fun extra-entertainment and does breathe new life into the show and I luv watching the interior shots but the digital replacements are just silly compared to the caretakingly created, beautifully crafted shots of the original and are often glaringly annoying (aka the pastel swirlys!). The new set though brightly lit and clear is also missing the depth, subtlety, and endearingly flawed graininess (which I love) of the cinematography which made ST so real . The set that is the true Star Trek which has the original, truly beautiful and visionarily filmed space-sequences is the blue/yellow/red dvd sets.In other words, whether you buy this hd-set or not - do NOT miss getting the blue/yel/red sets, if u want ST!!!"	4.0	This set vs. yel/blue/red set	2008-02-19	10	8	2

On recommendation of a specific episode, I came back to the original series with both anticipation and trepidation. I remembered the mini-skirts and the sixties costumes and hair and worried that the series would be all cheese. I am happy to report that even though Star Trek is popcorn fun, serious questions are raised as well and this series is a classic not only because it was groundbreaking in its time, but on its own merits.In this episode, three beautiful women, the property of a space-fareing conman are brought aboard the enterprise to the sexual discomfort of all aborad. When crystal, required to run the entire ship are compromised and a mining colony must be visited, Harry Mudd plies his wares in the mining colony and queers Kirk's pitch for acquiring the desperately needed crystals. But, the women have a secret too, their allure is not all it appears. The episode asks questions about beauty, biology and love and with enough cheesy fun that you almost don't realize such serious questions are being asked.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AQUVTQFFXP4AC	"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark"""	"Everything that is advertised in the adverts for this set (featuring prominently in the Blu Ray Star Trek Movie collection) is absolutely true.Painstaking effort was put into the digital mastering and restoration of the series, as evidenced in one of the documentaries on the first or second disc, which actually shows what I've never seen before: exactly HOW footage is ""digitally mastered"" or restored.  They show them doing such disgustingly brutal and time-consuming things such as rubbing out and scrubbing scratches, dirt, dust, and other imperfections from film footage.  They also show how all the music was re-recorded EXACTLY as it had been in the original show.For a low-budget TV series in the 1960s, the picture quality is stunning.  It never falls below DVD quality, though true Blu Ray perfection is elusive, as many shots suffer from some minor scratching that escaped notice, or blurry or scratchy bits that could not be fine-tuned any further.  There are still hundreds of shots and moments that are in perfect Blu Ray detail, and perfect colors and contrast.  You can see perfectly now that, keeping true to his green blood, Spock's skin almost always has a greenish tint.One of the great things about it that always appeases people like me is that you can choose BOTH the original episode or the Remastered versions, separated only by the option once starting an episode, or switching with the previously completely useless ""Angle"" button.The show itself utterly astounds and blows me away by just how mature and ahead of its time it is in storytelling and morality.  Almost no episode has a clear cut ""black and white"" context, and there are very infrequently any real villains who are evil simply because script demands it to be so.Some of the highlight episodes include ""Where No Man has Gone Before"", the second pilot episode, which features Gary Lockwood (Frank Poole in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") playing Gary Mitchell, a navigator on the Enterprise who suddenly gains godlike powers and silver-covered eyes after the ship attempts to blow through an Electromagnetic barrier at the edge of the galaxy.Rather than explaining anything, it's a complete mystery just what has happened to Gary.  We are told and explained how it involves ESP and his psychic response to it, but we never KNOW if his mind was permanently changed, or if an energy creature took control of his mind, or if he was genuinely becoming corrupted.  There are scenes where he is struck with extreme energy, causing his silver eyes to disappear, and he looks to Kirk with his normal eyes and calls out weakly ""Jim..."", only a moment later to have his silver eyes return, and his attitude returning to the haughty ""A God am I"" sort, leaving Captain Kirk AND us wondering whether Gary could truly be saved, or if it was a trick.A great many episodes follow this format of morality, and conflicts between what is right and what is logical, and even between two different versions of right.  One of the most jarring and mind-blowing episodes for me involved the Enterprise attempting to establish diplomatic relations with a peaceful planet, only to discover they've been at war with their neighboring planet for 500 years... and have fought the war entirely on computer (like video games), and when people die in the computer, they report to suicide booths in real life, in order for the war to progress.  No one likes it, but they accept it, because if they do not, they break a treaty, and invite REAL war that could destroy both planets.And then the episode with Khan, ""Space Seed"".  What I found truly wonderful about the end is how Kirk understands that Khan is not truly evil; he is simply himself.  He knows nothing else but to dominate others, and lead them.  So rather than imprison Khan for the chaos he caused on the ship, he 'exiles' him and his crew to Ceti Alpha V to form his own little Kingdom, and test his strength and intelligence in surviving the harsh conditions of that world.  Khan joyfully accepts the challenge, though ""Wrath of Khan"" shows us just what became of that 'exile'.All the discs except one have bonus documentaries on them, with the only questionable one I think being an ego-service one focused entirely on William Shatner, who spends the entire documentary talking about his love of horses and horseriding.The only flaw with the set involves the sound.  The sound quality is superb, but the sound effects and music are INSANELY loud compared to the softness of the dialogue.  It is a serious unbalance between the two that causes a constant need to be at the helm of the remote control's volume level.Aside from that, the set is huge with the episodes, original version or remastered version, extra features, select episode commentaries, and documentaries on a wide variety of subjects, including interviews with Gary Lockwood, Ricardo Montalban, the entire original cast, and Billy Blackburn, who not only was an extra in many episodes, but provides home video footage from the set of some episodes."	5.0	A perfect Blu Ray release	2009-09-16	4	4	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2WOYH8A64QTWZ	Anders Blom	"I have wanted to own all the episodes of the original series of Star Trek for quite some time. I noticed that the prices for the dvd releases of this series are ridiculously expensive at or about $100 per season. I found that I was also torn between which version to get, either the original production or the new re-stored ""Lucasfied"" version. I then came across this product right here on Amazon in Blu-ray for a fraction of the cost. I quickly realized that with the purchase of a Blu-ray drive (LITE-ON iHOS104) I could finally start a blu-ray collection and begin it with the entire collection of Star Trek the original series (BOTH VERSIONS!!!) re-mastered and re-stored for far less money then what the dvd sets would cost.A NO BRAINER!In Full HD, the video is astonishing; the color, blacks and detail of these episodes makes this set on blu-ray a must own for any fan. Every episode can be watched with its original special effects or the newly redone (Lucasfied) version. Each version is re-mastered and fully re-stored with amazing visual clarity and quality.The ""Lucasfied"" versions of all the episodes include the original re-mastered and re-stored episodes, but ALL the special effects are redone with computer generated imagery (CGI). Every phaser blast, space scene, explosion and whatnot has been completely replaced with an excellent CGI that stays true to the concept of design. Keep in mind; you can still play every episode with the original special effects and they are still from a re-mastered and fully restored source.Season One:Disc One - The Man Trap, Charlie X, Where No Man Has Gone Before*, The Naked TimeSpecial Features - Preview Trailers, Spacelift: Transplanting Trek Into The 21st CenturyDisc Two - The Enemy Within, Mudd's Women, What Are Little Girls Made Of?, Miri, Dagger Of The MindSpecial Features - Preview TrailersDisc Three - The Corbomite Maneuver, The Menagerie Part 1*, The Menagerie Part 2*, The Conscience Of The KingSpecial Features - Preview Trailers, Reflections On SpockDisc Four - Balance Of Terror*, Shore Leave, The Galileo Seven, The Squire Of GothosSpecial Features - Preview Trailers, Life Beyound Trek: William ShatnerDisc Five - Arena, Tomorrow Is Yesterday, Court Martial, The Return Of The ArchonsSpecial Features - Preview Trailers, To Boldly Go...

The episodes and the special features are listed on the inside of the box cover (might be a little hard to read for some).The original pilot with two versions are on the third season blu-ray release.The ONLY downfall is the audio, I am no expert but it seems that the studio cut some serious corners in this aspect. The volume levels for the 8 channel audio are unbalanced. Voices seem to be soft... to correct this one must tweak the control panel for their system or simply place the audio to the optional original broadcast mono. I have settled for the mono as this is still a phenomenal audio presentation.LITE-ON 4x Blu-ray Disc SATA Internal Optical Drive iHOS104Read my review for this drive too, I address a lot of misconceptions about it."	5.0	Both versions for one low price!	2010-03-18	4	3	1

Williams	"My whole life have I been watching and enjoying this great show.I can remember watching it with my sister on NBC when it was brand new.I loved it then,and I love it even more today.Star Trek has always been something that we hope the world will someday be,something that we wish it to be.It would be so great to be able to ""beam"" somewhere-like San Francisco for dinner,perhaps?.No more need for vechicles that pollute the air we breath and foul the very water we drink! Or,how about all the diseases that they have found cures for on the show,cures that are soo badly needed today?Wow! The possibilities are endless!Unfortunately,we live in a modern world that is filled with greed and advarice.Technology that would free us from fossil fuels is stifled by the oil companies and government so that the oil companies can remain in buisness for just a little while longer and pull in that last dollar that they need soo badly.Diseases that we have been searching for cures for years and years are still with us.Why? I think that it's because the researchers know that if they did find the needed cures that they just might be out of a job.Nobody wants to face the prospect of being unemployed.I like to think that there is a quick cure for the common cold locked in a vault at one of the pharmacutical companies out there somewhere.Think of all the money they would lose every cold season if that cure ever made it to your local pharmacy.The sale of over the counter cold remedies is a multi billion dollar industry.Wouldn't want to ease suffering if it means losing profit.Here we come ,finally,to the point of this review.Sorry for blathering on there.Star Trek is a great show.There is no doubt about that.The new remastered scenes are,in my humble opinion,very cool.""The Doomsday Machine"" has always been my favorite episode.What they did was absolutely awesome.Unfortunately,not every episode of Star Trek was soo great.Some of them (such as ""Spock's Brain"" and ""Turnabout Intruder"")were soo bad that I wish they wouldn't even bother including them in the new DVD sets.Either way,I plan to buy these remastered episodes.I love them and am looking foreward to owning them.I am going to wait until all three seasons are available and for the price to drop first,though.Star Trek Lives!Live Long and Prosper!"	5.0	Greatest sci-fi show of all time.	2007-10-01	9	4	5

I predicted Paramount was going to re-re-re-release everything again for it's 40th anniversary. (1967-2007)...Well, it looks like I was right and they are bringing it just under the wire, before the 40th birthdate is over (to be released November 2007).  To those who bought the red-blue-yellow boxed DVD sets who also called those those fans who bought the two episodes per disc original DVD release as being ""stupid"", well, if you thought that you had the final release, you are now officially a ""victim"" yourself and will have to eat your own words -- that's IF you want the ""enhanced"" Star Trek.For myself, I am one of the original two disc per DVD collector and am perfectly happy with it.  Frankly I don't like the visual enhancement and the re-recorded music.  I have seen a half-dozen episodes of the enhanced version and to be honest the ""look"" is ""off"".  I like the original physical models that were used...to me the digital models look, well...digital.  Like a video game.  I also find the music to sound off.  It is virtually impossible to re-perform the music exactly.  These differences are enough for the whole viewing experience to be distracting.  If you have the previous incarnations...I think they are just fine.  Save your money.  Besides the whole EXPENSIVE release is on HD-DVD and not Blu-Ray...and the format war is not over yet.

The first season in many ways is the best.  For one thing, the main characters are still under development, and we witness this process in many of the early episodes.  For another, the recurrent themes of the Star Trek series (renegade alien intelligences, the pitfalls of super-human powers, the push for peaceful resolution of conflicts, the necessity of human freedom) each appear for the first time--  not yet become predictable by repetition.

What the technical people on the show accomplished with limited technology is actually rather remarkable.  It is the program that made all other intelligent (and not-so-intelligent) sci-fi possible.Quite simply, this is television's greatest series.  However it is packaged, it is welcome - by me and legions of ""Trekkies"" from 'way back' (no, not ""Trekkers,"" as eighties and ninties revisionists would have us believe - it has been, and always will be, ""Trekkies!"").Buy the first season, and the other two sets as well.

I wasn't expecting it to be so nice. If you like TOS you have to own these.Its funny I go back and forth between watching these and TNG and I have to admit they are both extremely wonderful bodies of work. Sometimes TOS gets the short end of the stick because it is somewhat aged and the obvious Uber-American and Christian overtones but they are very entertaining.One thing I LOVE about both TOS and TNG is that they make each other better. Watching either one make you appreciate how good the other is as well.The fact is, you are the type of person who likes Star Trek or you are not. But if you do, you understand what marvellous and intelligent entertainment they both are, I am even as bold to say that both TOS and TNG affected the real world in that there are aspects in both that were so compelling that the world made these aspects real. That really says something about this &#34;vision&#34; of Star Trek.Bottom line if you even casually like TOS you will REALLY like the remastered version.	5.0	WOW! Amazing!	2013-12-24	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A358MEQOX8FZI7	Awendela	I bought this some time ago, but just finished watching the entire first season.  There was a slight scratch on one of the discs, but I can no longer return so I'll live with it.I watched the original series when I was a teen so it's nice to see all the episodes again (and uncut like they are on reruns today!).  Episodes are about 49-50 minutes each.  The volume seems a bit low compared to live TV, but I just turn up the volume when watching the DVDs.So glad I finally bought these . . . been wanting them for years.	4.0	"Love this original series - not the remastered version - so it's truly ""original"""	2013-08-22	1	1	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3MNGI81TEAJFQ	Axel	As a Star Trek fan, I enjoyed this boxset for the sole reason that it contained all the episodes from the first season of the original Star Trek.  The package is good and the booklet inside gives not only the summary of the episodes, but some interesting information regarding technology and aliens in Star Trek.However, the price is ungodly high. This set is listed at $129.99 for eight discs, where the list price for the first season of CSI is $84.98 for six.Because of the price, the Star Trek boxsets are really only for people who absolutely love Star Trek.  Not many people outside of hardcore fans of the franchise will be willing to pay what is asked for these things.  I'm a big Star Trek fan and I had a problem paying what I did for the two boxsets I bought.  If Paramount would drop the list price down to maybe $60 or $70 they'd probably pull a much larger profit...and leave consumers happier.(This review goes for all other Star Trek boxsets as they are all listed at at least $129.99 - and most containing seven discs)	3.0	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	2005-06-27	9	7	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A35DI02LLA0TGU	B. Amonette	"Star Trek: The Original Series - Season 1 [Blu-ray]I recently purchased the first season of Star Trek on Blue ray.  I was impressed by some of the enhancements, ship motion is more seamless and other graphical changes.  I must say that I am disappointed  by the fact that the episodes are not in order.  I grew up in the 60's, and my family sat watching each week as the latest episode was released.  So when I sat down with my son to watch them for his first time, there was just something missing.I will say in the defense of the product, that they include stardates in the menus so that you can try to arrange them in some order.  So far I have not found the first episode ""The Cage"" with  Captain Pike, and I really wanted to start with that episode.  I am hoping that it is buried somewhere in the multi-disc set, and not simply omitted.Overall, I will say that at the discounted price, the set was worthwhile, but as stated before, I am a bit disappointed."	3.0	Slightly Disappointed	2009-05-19	8	3	5

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AG0TA24LI0XV7	Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius	"I grew up with reruns of the original series, in the 1970's and 1980's. It was terrific television. My fondness for this show grew as I got older when I could appreciate the writing and the characters even better. This series was something special. It raised questions and issues that other shows wouldn't even dream of doing. It had moral fiber and decent principles. It explored philosophy, horror, comedy, and psychology. Not since The Twilight Zone had their been a comparable television production.This program is one of the most popular and beloved in American television, so I assumed the dvd sets would be worth getting, naturally. After all, the fans are legion and the show has been, and still is, immensely loved by millions. It is so wonderful to have access to these episodes at my leisure. I don't need to bother anymore with the edited/butchered reruns on cable, with its endless commercials, and stupid pop-ups at the bottom of the screen. That is a sweet, beautiful thing.One drawback: the case and packaging of these sets is a bit ridiculous. Some people will probably like it because it seems fun. But to me the packages look as though they were only designed to look appealing while sitting on the shelves at BestBuy or Walmart. At one's home, they lose their appeal immediately. First there is the silly outer plastic 'shell', revealing a paper sleeve which covers the inner 'book' case. It's all a bit too much. Sometimes simpler is better.Now, I do understand that thousands of these sets had to be manufactured, and economics is an issue. But surely a dvd show that's this beloved (and this expensive considering the suggested retail pricing) was worthy of better, more sturdy packaging. The flimsy, clear plastic disc holders will not last long; unless handled with extremely meticulous care they will fall apart like pages from a book with crumbling binding.The rounded, brightly colored case (which looks cool at first) is highly impractical and really a bit stupid when you consider it. Paramount should have done better by Star Trek.Also, (it's not crucial in the least but) a ""Play All"" feature would have been nice on each disc. Sometimes it's nice to have the entire disc play automatically.The episode guide has the smallest print you could ask for.I have no other issues with the dvd's. Image is fine for me. Menus are cute, as I expected.This show is a piece of television history and a big chunk of nostalgia from my youth. Hence the four stars. But the box and disc holders just don't satisfy me. A small issue but I just thought I would mention it."	4.0	Star Trek, Great. (Packaging, Impractical.)	2007-09-08	0	0	0

This is a science fiction series that was way ahead of its time both in exciting technological ideas for the future and in social acceptance of different cultures. That is both in fictitious cultures and in known  cultures and social roles of the 1960's. Since re-watching it, I now have a few new favorite episodes. I also should add that the quality of the remastering of the classic series is very, very good.	4.0	A Science Fiction Series Way Ahead of its Time	2013-12-07	1	1	0

Harkins ""Billy in South Ga"""	I was raised watching this show because I had a couple of sci-fi/Star Trekie parents. Watching it on local antenna TV the quality was never good and signal outage at key times was quite common. Well I wish I could tell you young sci-fi fans what you have available to you. I know some might say this old show and the special effects nothing like you have on shows like Battlestar Galactica and such but this is quality plots started by one of first sci-fi authors Ray Bradbury. As you watch the shows you can't help but notice in the credits that episodes were written by various authors surely directed by Ray Bradbury and you can't help but watch newer show and realized a lot of their plots came from shows like this. In season 2, I would highly recomend starting with Balance of Terror, The Changeling, and The Doomsday weapon.	5.0	Remastered is GReat!	2014-04-30	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A217ZU7TX431H9	"B. Estorga ""Country mouse stuck in the City"""	Since other reviewers have already extensively covered the contents of these discs, let me add instead what stood out to me: 1) the design of the packaging, 2)  the DVD menu interface, and 3) the series itself!1) The packaging is AWESOME.  Distinctive and futuristic in that fabulous Sci-Fi Era way, while still being entirely utilitarian.  It holds the DVDs securely and safely stowed inside the plastic shell.2) The menu interface is great ~ one of the best I've seen on a DVD in a long while.  Easy to navigate and filled with little features I didn't expect to find, like trailers for each episode.  WOW!3) Obviously if I wasn't a die-hard ST fan I wouldn't have spent the money on the entire first season.  ;-)  However this really IS a great show, with far more morals and far LESS gratuitous sex and violence than what is on TV today.  It is an adult show that I don't feel guilty letting my kids watch with me.I HIGHLY recommend this.

The video quality was excellent, and the only drawback might be that some of the special effects are a little less impressive - though they were still amazing for the time.One thing that enhanced my enjoyment of this season was watching concurrently with reading THESE ARE THE VOYAGES (reviewed elsewhere) which is an episodic guide to the show. I found myself looking for certain things or paying attention to actors, costumes, and sets with more depth because of it, but even without a complementary read like that, this is an amazing show and well worth watching the whole series.	5.0	Crystal Clear, Great Sound, Streamed Beautifully	2014-04-30	0	0	0

This year my girlfriend bought me the first two seasons on DVD and I am thrilled to have it! I have a surround sound system and it works great with the new sound they have done for this set. ""Where no man has gone before"" has an excellent documentary to go with the episode and I highly recomment having your pause button handy while watching the comments. Some big names are in this set; Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Robert Matheson..... all worth the time to watch.  Some people claim that this was one of the hokiest TV series of all time. I would offer back to nay sayers that if they can name another series that has had 4 (yes four) spin-offs from a series that lasted only 3 seasons AND is as popular almost 40 years later to try, just try!Excellent and worth every penny.

I liked the original series best, but it didn't actually start getting good until season three or so.  Just because it's Star Trek doesn't give it an automatic five stars.  Though even in its infancy, it's better than Voyager or Enterprise by far!  The first season of the Origial series was kind of silly and I am glad they soon got rid of Yeoman Rand. That relationship with Kirk and Rand was just too corney(the same could probably be said of Enterprises's Trip and The vulcan girl, what's her name)..

I do have mixed feelings about the small changes made (the way planets look from orbit, solar flares, etc,) as these were added on as part of the remastering and not in the original series, but they do look very nice. These changes are NOT like Lucas' bastardizing his original movies, but more like subtle changes. Perhaps serious die-hard Trekkies will have issue with it.all in all, the remastered seasons look so good, that if you haven't watched Star Trek in years, or decades, or even ever, do give them a try.

While the modernized effects are clever, they take something away from the era in which the show was originally created. Plus, I have a 60&#34; plasma that auto detects screen format and extrapolates 4:3 picture source to 16:9, each time a newer digitized screen exits back to the original screen size the set temporarily resets itself as well thus the picture reverts to 4:3 while the signal is reprocessed.

There are also all the other Star Trek series such as The Next Generation, Star Trek Enterprise and Deep Space Nine as well as a host of other programs such as Battlestar Galactica and Stargate.  I hope that they will all be available for a long time to come.  I mainly use my Prime membership to get free 2-day shipping, but if I did not have that, it would be worth the $80 per year just to get all of the free television programs and movies.  It is much less expensive than cable, and for new movies, the rentals are in a good price range.  Though I like the older television programs and movies the best.	5.0	Thank you Amazon for making these available for free for Prime members.	2013-04-17	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A34VG1KP3SCH4J	Boris Skrbic	"Despite the recreated visual effects, it is important to emphasize that the word ""remastered"" very much applies in this case. A couple of new extras aside, most of the time a longtime viewer is treated simply to the virtually spotless image with brief CG interludes in the average episode, and even there the goal is to emulate the style of the original series as much as possible, with varying degrees of success. (I'm reviewing the DVD side here -- with the right equipment, the audio-visual experience is going to be much better on the HD side, of course.)At the same time, there is no reason for casual viewers to start with the old DVD set, because the HD remastering very much improves the overall viewing experience even on the DVD side. Therefore, if you are a casual viewer who would like to see more of the original Star Trek, definitely start with the remastered shows. Still, I'm giving the set three stars because its complex packaging, steep price, and the choice to combine HD DVD and DVD content diminishes the purchasing experience for an otherwise great season of the original series."	3.0	"The word ""remastered"" very much applies"	2007-12-18	4	2	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Brent Butler	"Star Trek fans can be a picky bunch, and I reference the mixed reaction to the reboot film as an example. However, I can't imagine that any fan would approach this Blu-ray set with anything but enthusiasm and grateful anticipation. As I said in my title, the shows have never looked better, including in their original broadcasts on NBC. The restoration process for this presentation was performed with reverence from the original film negatives. Defects in the picture due to tears, stains, and other causes were painstaking cleaned up after the scan to digital files. Colors and contrasts were adjusted correctly. Even the famous theme music was rerecorded using the original arrangement and an orchestra of the correct size and mix of instruments.I like to let people know in my reviews of Star Trek products that I watched, with eagerness, the first episode broadcast. Back in those days networks sometimes did what they called a ""sneak preview"" week. Each fall the premier week for new series was more of a big deal than it is today, because you only had three networks and limited choices. For a kid, in particular, it was always an exciting time of promise and adventure. I never felt that more than in 1966 when I saw the lead up commercials for Star Trek. The ""Sneak Preview"" week was just a tactic to try to get in ahead of the other networks, but they were all three quickly doing it. I had just started to become interested in science fiction, having recently read my first science fiction book (Robert Heinlein's ""The Star Beast""). When I finally saw the Star Trek's 'sneak preview' episode, ""The Man Trap"", at first it was a bit disorienting for a 9 year old. I thought maybe the bridge was the only working area of the space ship, for example. LOL As the series progressed, though, I quickly caught on. I loved every minute of Star Trek I could watch, and that has pretty much remained true now for 44 years.In making a Blu-ray presentation of the Star Trek series, the producers of this product knew they had an issue to resolve. Although the resolution of the live action scenes was more than sufficient to create high definition images, the special effects shots just were not on the same scale. So they took the amazing action of recreating the effects shots. I'll have to say, they did a great job of it too. For purists, the original effects shots are also included ... in fact you can skip back and forth between the two sets of shots 'on the fly' as you watch an episode! However, a lot of thought went into the creation of the new effects. They are a distinct improvement over what the original production crew was able to do with the limited budget and technology available during the show's production. I only wish Roddenberry could have seen the results of this work. It is precisely what he would have done in the 1960s had he the means to do so.The special features are a nice addition to the episodes, particularly the HD tour of the Enterprise, and the documentary about the restoration and effects.Season One has some of the most memorable episodes in the series. A few highlights:* ""The Man Trap"" is mostly notable for being the first aired, but its treatment of the ""monster"" in a somewhat sympathetic light was unusual for scripts of that day.* ""Charlie X"" was the Enterprise crew's first encounter, of many, with beings who exhibited god-like powers.* ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" was the first show FILMED which included being with god-like powers LOL, as it was the second pilot for the show, and the one that included some of the permanent cast to come.* ""The Enemy Within"" gave Shatner a chance to shine, as the transporter split him into his ""good side"" and his ""bad side"". This would be the first of several Kirk ""evil twin"" stories. LOL (Shatner had evil twins, Picard always seemed to get brain-washed! LOL)* ""Mudd's Women"" introduced Harry Mudd, one of the very few guest starring roles to appear more than once. In this first episode, Mudd has a very serious side, unlike the out and out comedy of his second appearance. The show has a very nice message about a person's inner beauty.* ""The Menagerie, Parts I and II"" was produced as an excuse to not waste the work done filming the very fine first pilot. Here, the story is interleaved with a ""current"" story, as told by Spock and logs from an earlier Enterprise mission with its second captain, Christopher Pike. (In Star Trek lore, the first captain was an older captain named Robert April. Robert April was a favorite character name for Gene Roddenberry, who penned a minister by that name for two episodes he wrote for the western ""Paladin"", several years before he created Star Trek). Jeff Hunter did a fine job as Captain Pike in the first pilot, and would have been a great star for the show, but circumstances dictated otherwise.* ""The Conscience of the King"" was one of many very thoughtful Star Trek episodes. This one explores whether it is correct to take violent action against some to save all, and whether one who takes that course deserves, or can find, redemption.* ""Shore Leave"" was a surprisingly delightful episode, and could be called the first Star Trek comedy to air ... though it didn't always look like a comedy when Dr. McCoy was getting run through by a knight's lance, and a female crew member was strafed and killed by a WWII vintage fighter plane!* ""Arena"" was one of my favorite episodes, pitting Kirk in a battle of strength and wits against a stronger opponent. This episode introduced one of the two space-faring races most unlike us (along with the later Tholians) that would appear on Star Trek. And once again, the ""monsters"" turned out to be not so evil after all ...* ""Space Seed"", one of the more famous episodes with the rock solid Ricardo Montalban, was of course the inspiration for the second Star Trek film, ""The Wrath of Khan"".* ""A Taste of Armageddon"" explores the utter stupidity of war for the sake of vying political ideologies. By that I don't imply that the people behind Star Trek were doves. They were against senseless war, which I can imagine they perceived our involvement in Viet Nam to be. They were quite clear in other episodes that they felt war was an acceptable remedy to prevent atrocities (as per WWII). You'll see this evidenced just three episodes later in ""Errand of Mercy"".* ""The Devil in the Dark"" is Star Trek's one true ""Monster Hunt"" show. Yet once again, everything is not as it seems.* ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" is possibly Star Trek's most highly acclaimed episode, and the second involving time travel. It was written by the noted Sci-fi writer, Harlan Ellison.There is nothing wrong with the 15(!) episodes I didn't mention above. Those noted are some of my personal favorites from Season One, and I think I'd find a lot of agreement from long time Star Trek fans that they deserve highlighting. And yes, add the 14 I mentioned to the 15 I did not, and you have 29(!!) episodes in the first season. That is a production number not seen for a season of a TV series in a very long time.If you're a Star Trek fan still without a Blu-ray player ... well ... this gives you a great excuse to get into Blu-ray and hi-def. Luckily the road is paved and Blu-ray players now cost what had at one time become common (and low) prices for DVD players. Even HD TVs are a fraction of what they once cost. The ""early adopter"" period is long passed, and prices are good on these wonderful viewing technologies. There is no better way to enjoy hi-def programming than by viewing an outstanding transfer of a long beloved series of programs like this."	5.0	TOS has never looked better	2011-01-13	4	3	1

The brainchild of former L.A. policeman Gene Roddenberry, the show premiered in Fall 1966 only to be cancelled after three seasons due to lackluster ratings. But it may well have been NBC's network executives who were the cause of the low ratings as they allotted a less than desirable time slot for the show. When Star Trek moved into syndication, its reruns captured the science-fiction imagination of an entirely new audience, catapulting the Star Trek franchise to new heights. Its newfound popularity would, in the decades to come, spawn novels, comic books, six full-length feature films, and reams of merchandise as fans clamored for anything Star Trek-related. Beginning in the 1980's, spin-offs of the show began to appear such as Star Trek: The Animated Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, and Star Trek: Enterprise...Star Trek, the original TV series, follows the adventurous exploits of the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise as they ""boldly go where no man has gone before..."" The spaceship Enterprise is led by Captain James Tiberius Kirk (William Shatner), an Earth-born astronaut who often exhibits the charm, leadership, and creativity necessary for the mission's survival. Kirk is joined by Lt. Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), a Vulcan-born retired commander and theoretical scientist. Chief medical officer Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) rounds out the main cast of Star Trek which includes a plethora of supporting crew with multiple guest appearances and cameo roles. Together, the crew of U.S.S. Enterprise seeks to carry out its mission: ""to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations..."" It's this pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative sci-fi worlds, that provides Star Trek with its nostalgic allure - especially these episodes from the original TV series, widely regarded as the most popular of all the TV series...The Star Trek (Season 1) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the series premiere ""The Man Trap"" in which the crew of the Enterprise visits the planet M-113 for an annual check on the residents of its colony. But during the initial landing phase, a crew member turns up dead. Kirk orders an investigation and the crew soon learns that a deadly predator that can assume the shape of any life-form is murdering humans, and the creature now has its sights set on the crew of the Enterprise... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Balance of Terror"" in which a wedding between two crew members is interrupted when the Enterprise is forced to defend an Earth outpost from an attack by an unknown spacecraft, and ""A Taste of Armageddon"" in which the Enterprise encounters a pair of ""war computers"" that carry out an unorthodox form of warfare...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (The Man Trap)Episode 2 (Charlie X)Episode 3 (Where No Man Has Gone Before)Episode 4 (The Naked Time)Episode 5 (The Enemy Within)Episode 6 (Mudd's Women)Episode 7 (What Are Little Girls Made Of?)Episode 8 (Miri)Episode 9 (Dagger of the Mind)Episode 10 (The Corbomite Maneuver)Episode 11 (The Menagerie: Part 1)Episode 12 (The Menagerie: Part 2)Episode 13 (The Conscience of the King)Episode 14 (Balance of Terror)Episode 15 (Shore Leave)Episode 16 (The Galileo Seven)Episode 17 (The Squire of Gothos)Episode 18 (Arena)Episode 19 (Tomorrow is Yesterday)Episode 20 (Court Martial)Episode 21 (The Return of Archons)Episode 22 (Space Seed)Episode 23 (A Taste of Armageddon)Episode 24 (This Side of Paradise)Episode 25 (The Devil in the Dark)Episode 26 (Errand of Mercy)Episode 27 (The Alternative Factor)Episode 28 (The City on the Edge of Forever)Episode 29 (Operation - Annihilate!)The DVD Report"	5.0	An American classic!	2005-06-03	5	4	1

You will see they are forty plus dollars cheaper for a season. Paramount did not clean this set up from the previous two per DVD disc release a few years ago. What you are mainly getting is more episodes per disc and a compact box. I am aggravated because I bought the entire series on DVD when it was two per disc. They took up three shelves of my bookcase. fan of saving space since I buy lots of DVDs I would have preferred to have had the set like this. I don't see any improvement in the quality of this set over my set. Fans that didn't buy the previous set will want this set even though Paramount as usual is asking to much for a series. I have been watching all Star Trek series since the their first telecast in the sixties and I love them. I just wish they had a studio like MGM selling the DVDs. Fans of Stargate SG-1 know like me that it is a great series.  MGM only charges about fifty-two dollars for a season. I only wish this set was that reasonably priced. The plastic box this Star Trek set comes in is nice and it takes up very little space. Several extras come with this set, so if you don't have this set yet, get it.	5.0	Great Series, Lousy Studio	2004-09-17	18	14	4

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AU852OCTFL67U	"Cam T. ""&#34;Reclusive Writer&#34;"""	"Well, blame me for being over-eager if you want.I've just received my copy of TOS-R season 1 on HD-DVD/DVD. I do not have an HD-DVD player, so imagine my relief when they went with these hybrid discs. Very considerate for those of us who can't spend $[...] on every new gadget every 5 minutes.There are 10 discs in the set, in a new design clear plastic container. 5 plastic cards list the details of each disc. Side 1 of each disc is HD-DVD, while side 2 is standard DVD. Both sides contain the same features.When I heard of this set, I was concerned what they meant by 'season 1', since they've been airing the new versions all out of order. This set indeed contains the entire 1st season of TOS, including episodes which have not yet aired in their edited-for-more-commerical-time format. So NUTS TO THE NETWORK!!  Thanks to this set, you won't need to worry about the air-dates for 1st season episodes anymore. You get them complete, and uncut, as opposed to network TV, which brutally chops out 10 minutes of footage to advertise the latest fad.The price is admittedly a little hefty, but Amazon had it for nearly $[...] off the reported $[...] price for pre-orders. I placed mine back in Sept.The menu is fairly straightforward, set in the transporter room (as opposed to the Enterprise bridge, as the original versions did) with characters from each episode in the chamber. On the transporter console are the listed episodes on each disc, while bonus features on each disc are found under ""Additional Data"".CGI remastering can, of course, only do so much for film as old as these episodes, so of course there was some grain in the episodes, but not so much that it deters from the enjoyment of the story.  Thanks to the clean-up work though, the images are also darker, a little more realistically shaded, which is, IMHO a major improvement over the blaring studio-style lights of the original versions.I encourage anyone who reads this to get the set! I will not regret this!Now I just want to know one thing - when's Season 2 due out?"	5.0	ST: TOS-R - Season 1 Set review	2007-11-23	15	12	3

The sound of the shows was much lower than the sound of the menus, leading other people in the house to yell at me between episodes. I agree with others that the menu is hard to figure out when all three episodes on the HD-DVD are not listed at once - and for no apparent reason. My package from Amazon arrived with broken plastic pieces. The case was hard to open, and it was impossible to remove the inner case without putting fingerprints on the first DVD, which had nothing covering it. However, the new effects made the episodes better. You no longer had to wonder how a purple or pink blob of a planet could support life. I probably won't bother to get season 2 or 3, since even the best special effects could never make up for the poor scripts.	3.0	Okay overall, but...	2007-12-10	4	1	3

Kirk, Jr.	"For those of you like me who know the Classic Star Trek so well that you can quote whole episodes, this new DVD set is a travesty!!!! I am speaking of the chopped, missing dialog in every episode I have seen!!! (Of course, it may be the station which airs this show, trying to squeeze in more commercials, but I seriously doubt it because the cuts are soooo subtle, you have to KNOW the dialog as I do.) However, going on my first impression: There seems to be some probably 30 something, Yuppish Newbie to Star Trek, who thinks in the modern day style of only allowing 15 to 20 seconds of a take. EXAMPLE: Take ""The Lights Of Zetar"". Mira says, "" I'd rather die than hurt you Scotty, I'd rather die"".  The last ""I'd rather die"" is cut for some reason. I can hear some stuffy college Prof saying ""that is redundant'!!! to say it twice. But the idea that the emotion is running so high for Lt. Romaine that she HAS to say it twice is, I believe, essential. There are MANY, MANY other example of this modern day editing by someone who thinks they know Star Trek. If you are reading this Mr( or Ms.) Director, let me say this; I knew what Gene and his writers had in mind...you don't, and never will, until you leave your prepacked, hightech, super revved playpen and dwell in the original series for a while instead of trying to leave your mark on it.

""Re-master"" the series using modern effects.Step 3. Release said abomination to the public.I'm sorry, but my memories of Gene Roddenberry's classic have been brutally raped by this horrid, horrid abortion of money-hungry studios.The effects of the original show were always a little lame, but they went with the time period and they did not look out of place. The new effects are pathetic. Almost no money has been spent on them and they look cheap and nasty. What's worse, they stand out as modern effects amid the original 60's sets and therefore pull you right out of any immersion you have in every episode!The DVD's themselves are double-sided. In other words, cheap discs! The last time I saw a double-sided disc was Starship Troopers. Who in their right minds uses these anymore?I know Messrs Lucas and Spielberg have a history of ""updating"" their movies, but please don't ruin shows from my childhood as well!This lot is going straight on ebay and I'm now on a hunt to find a set of the original, un-butchered episodes somewhere.If you loved the original show, save yourself the pain and DO NOT buy this!EDIT: I've just learned that the 2009 blu-ray versions of the original series let you CHOOSE whether to watch the original, or ""enhanced"" effects.

This 8-disk set of the first season is just what I've been waiting for.  It contains every episode from the first season plus bonus features.When first purchasing this I was a little fearful that the production quality would be poor.  Despite a few flaws - I felt the production quality was very good, unlike many single-season sets I've bought of other television shows.The special features were a bit of a disappointment.  None of them are particularly good except the interview with Leonard Nimoy, which I did find very interesting and offered some insight into the shows, its characters, and the actors.So if you are a fan of the original Star Trek I highly recommend this set.	5.0	It's About Time	2004-10-14	13	11	2

While season 2 may represent a time when all the characters were ""hitting their stride"" so-to-speak, season one has quite a few episodes that represent the best of TV science fiction writing. City on the Edge of Forever, Balance of Terror, The Naked Time, absolutely excellent. The documentary about William Shatner's horse business - not so much. I'm a bit of a purist, as well; so while I appreciate the new versions with the updated special effects (they did a great job on them), I really want to see Star Trek the way I remember it.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A7FLEH8R8LSK2	"Christopher David Snyder ""csnyder"""	Well, I have read many reviews on the Star Trek original series HD release. I bought it yesterday even though it was expensive at $129.99.  I don't own any of the original series DVD's, so I didn't feel so bad buying them.  I hear some people complain about having to buy them again, which I do understand.Anyway, I was in heaven watching the episodes last night.  I love the newly recorded theme music and the special effect and everything about the package.  The quality if excellent.I don't have HD TV and so watched it on Standard DVD.  And still thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't care for the fact that I was forced to pay for the HD discs.

It had a diverse crew of different personalities and races during a racially provocative era. It featured an Alien as an important meber of the crew. When you watch these episodes, you reminded that many of these ideas have been used and reused alot since they originally came out. Even today, some of these episodes hold up to today's sci-fi.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1R8DJWH62O56M	Christopher M. Watson	First off let me say that the original series is the best. The stories were exceptional. If only they could incorporate the same sort of inspired scriptwriting in the subsequent spin-offs! The acting wasn't superb, but I think that is part of the charm. The special effects for the time were about as good as one could get, so there really should be no complaining on that point.However, to release eight discs for around a hundred bucks is absolutely appalling.  This is clearly a money grab for Paramount. Consider that they released two episodes on a disc five years ago. They could have as easily put at least four on one disc. The DVD standard has not changed significantly, and the amount of that can be stored on a double layere disc has stayed relatively constant.My advice is to forget this set, go to netflix or somewhere else and rent them, and then burn them. With DL discs just around the corner, you could fit just as many episodes with the same quality. This would only serve Paramount right. If they half the price, I would buy it. But until this blatant price gouging ceases, I will have none of it.	1.0	Hundred bucks, eight discs, one greedy studio	2004-07-08	62	26	36

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AICLKR3EAMETV	Chuck Ruck	"Season One Remastered is a fantastic investment for Star Trek fans who want something different. ALL views of space and ships are redone with modern CGI effects. No longer do we Trekkers have to suffer through gritty stock footage of the Enterprise orbiting the same red planet. Each planet looks different. Even if you do not have HD (I don't, and HD got discontinued anyway), the picture is sharp! Some noticable changes include:-Where No Man Has Gone Before: the Enterprise goes through the galaxy barrier evasively. The nebula colors are beautiful!-Mudd's Women: Excellent effects of the Enterprise chasing Mudd's ship in an asteroid field, where it explodes!-The Menagerie I, II: Star Base 8 looks REAL, not cardboard cut-out. The sky has realistic atmosphere with planets in the background. It's as cool as seeing the Remastered Star Wars trilogy back in the 1990's!-Balance of Terror: this shows the ships entering a comet that LOOKS like a comet, instead of a blue smudge of paint!-Galileo Seven: By far this is THE BEST EPISODE FOR IMPROVED SPECIAL EFFECTS! The green nebula is so real, with cool shots of the shuttles flying in and out of the Enterprise.-Court-Martial: More stunning shots of a starbase. City towers actually have people inside. The Enterprise orbits the base with an extra star ship and shuttles buzzing around.-A Taste of Armageddon: Alien planet's city has futuristic monorails and people walking around.-Errand of Mercy: REAL KLINGON SHIPS, one even blown up. We no longer have to wait until the third season to see a Klingon battle cruiser!-Alternative Factor: Great ship-to-surface phaser blast effects.One other benefit to the sharp picture is that we Trekkers can clearly see the faces of the dying ""extra crewmen."" This means we can appreciate how human they really were, and how life is too precious to waste. Let us now honor their memories by recalling how they died in the line of duty:-The Man Trap: 3 dead on alien planet, 1 on ship, after monster sucked crewmens' salt from their bodies.-Where No Man Has Gone Before: 1 crewman dead after he was telekinetically strangled by a chord, by Gary Mitchell-The Naked Time: 1 Joe ""Red Shirt"" goes mad, stabs self with butter knife.-Balance of Terror: 1 soon-to-be-married crewman poisoned by pink gas-Galileo Seven: 1 crewman stabbed by spear-throwing caveman creature, 1 choked-The Arena: 2 ""Red Shirts"" killed by Gorn disruptors-The Devil in the Dark: 1 slow-moving ""Red Shirt"" melted by angry mother horta.May these twelve brave crewmen rest in peace!"	5.0	Remastered Special Effects and Casualty Report	2008-07-07	9	7	2

Sure, I can see the cheesy special effects, but for its time, this was lightyears ahead of other shows. I can also appreciate the subtle humor better as an adult. And after years of hearing William Shatner jokes, I realized he was a great actor, and the trio of lead actors worked so well together.It is so nice to be able to go back in time with the crew of the USS Enterprise and see the series as it was meant to be seen.

There has been much controversy over anyone attempting to enhance or alter in any way the look, feel and mood of the original series.  I totally get that concern.  What you have in this set is the best of both worlds folks.  You are given an extremely pristine copy of the original series untouched!However, what will astoundingly blow you away is the painstakingly enhanced version of the original series.  There is a most excellent short documentary included that is a must see.  It chronicles in a very interesting way all the care that was taken to clean up the original very badly fading tape of this series and NOT do a cheap colorized glitzy make-over but a very clean update of these films.  We see a number of the original people behind the scenes with Gene Roddenberry who admit that ""THIS"" indeed is the look they and Gene were originally attempting to get but couldn't at the time due to technology limitations.The films truly are spectacular in either version and the sound has really been improved.  Yes, I know many so-called fake & phony purists will say ""but it wasn't done originally in 7.1"".  Yawn!  Duh?, because Gene didn't HAVE 7.1 at the time!  Well we do now and it's great and it works and you'll love it!  Gene didn't do it in Hi Def either because he couldn't, but he sure would have if the technology was there and Paramount gave him the budget.  Well we have it today and it works and works well.  The original magic of this series is very well preserved and I was delighted to see the original people who made it say so!"	5.0	Trek Fans Dream !!!	2009-05-01	3	2	1
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1FD2ZI5US0FDA	Cody G.	Having been a long time Next Generation (TNG) fan and watching everything after TNG, I feel like I missed out on the Original Series (TOS).  A ton of links to future shows can be found in TOS.  I especially enjoyed the Christopher Pike story on Talos IV because in the hollywood reboot Star Trek: Into Darkness movie with Chris Pines, you meet a Christopher Pike.  Although the story lines are completely different (due to some wacky new dimension) the actor in TOS who plays Chris Pike set the stage for the future version.  While im talking about Into Darkness, the on screen tension between Spock and Kirk in TOS absolutely set the stage for future movies.I find myself listening for places or names they mention in TOS, then looking at the Star Trek wiki for details. Again, the relationship between the future versions of Star Trek and the TOS really make the show that much more enjoyable.  I get lost in how primitive the Enterprise is portrayed in Season one of TOS.  I keep thinking about TNG and what Data and Picard would have thought of to get out of sticky situations.Overall, the acting is good and the plots somewhat predictable at times.  I highly recommend this show to any Trek fan out there.	5.0	A Must, Learn about the beginnings of the Trek Universe	2014-06-06	0	0	0

They didn't call the fans ""trekkies"" yet, but that was to come. And boy did it come!If I recall, what happened is that NBC made the huge mistake of cancelling the series due to what in their infinite wisdom they called ""low"" ratings.Well, let me tell you! That single dumb move by the programming department at NBC unleashed a fury that was unparalleled in the history of television at that time. Thousands of letters of protest were sent to NBC, and out of that fan fury the ""Trekkie"" was born.Eventually, the protests became too overwhelming to ignore any longer and the Star Trek series returned to the NBC schedule. Proving once again that in unity there is strength.The rest is history.But it is a classic example of what happens when the ""suits"" at a large corporate TV network can't see the forest for the trees."	5.0	Thoughts from an original, pre-Trekkie fan of the NBC series before the Big Bang	2009-04-28	8	2	6
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1G65O1E8T5AYU	C. Perry	I bought this set to be played on a regular progressive scan DVD player and a 1080i plasma tv.  The new graphics of the ship and the various planets look amazing and like they belong in the context of the show, not like modern special effects stuck in the middle of 1960's special effects.  I then upgraded to a blu-ray player, and the picture quality is even better than it was before (I refuse to buy an HD-DVD player to see the difference on the other side of the disk).  How much better can the picture get anyway?  This show was recorded in the 60's.  No matter how much cleanup of the originals are done, it was still recorded with 60's technology.  I like the extras like the previews for each episode, but I am missing out on some of the extras that are on the HD-DVD side.  Overall I recommend this set to anyone that doesn't already own the series, as a blu-ray set isn't due out for quite some time.	4.0	Not perfect, but still worth it	2009-02-07	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"After having watched Enterprise (Season 4) and The Next Generation (Season 5 - their best season), I have reached one inescapable conculsion.  The Original Five-Year Mission, helmed by Captain James T. Kirk, is by far the best.  The first season is full of gems, the worst of which is better than the best 1st-season show in ST:TNG.  The Original Series takes a lot of heat: deadline issues created William Shatner's stilted delivery (""It bought me time to remember the next line!"") and budget issues led to some very cheesy (even for the late '60s) effects.  But the stories themselves, and the interaction between the Big Three of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy raised the level of the show to levels seldom achieved before or since.  One might question the need to release these shows on DVD - after all, they seem to be on in syndication constantly!  But the clarity and completeness of the shows, not to mention the lack of advertisements (they run 10 minutes longer than a conventional hour-long drama, and are often trimmed in syndication), is reason enough for me to pick up this set.These shows have a timeless quality, because the writing is often a metaphor for the human condition in general.  Often written by the top science fiction (and in the case of Robert Bloch, horror) writers of the day, the actors are given a wide range of emotions and interactions: with the regular cast, with the guest stars, even with blocks of latex masquarading as aliens and robots.  The actors have been panned in later years as being hams - especially Shatner - but such an opinion does not bear close scrutiny when watching these shows.  These are actors at the top of their games (especially when compared other performances of the '60s).  Interestingly, these shows are presented in order of broadcast (not in order of production, as they are always shown in syndication).  This leads to some bizarre anachronisms in the early episodes.  Sulu, for example, has three positions (helmsman, botanist, and physicist), and Uhura's costume changes back and forth between yellow and red several times (and occasionally a black belt appears for no apparent reason).  That said, it's amazing how fast the cast and writers come together - by the time of The Naked Time - the 4th show broadcast - the main characters are fully developed.  This didn't really take place in TNG until Season 3!Instead of listing the episodes in order, as other episode lists do, I've decided to arrange them by importance/enjoyability.  The episodes of Season 1 are (order of broadcast in parentheses:Super-Fantastic Episodes:Where No Man Has Gone Before (3) - The second pilot develops some real tension between the crew members as Kirk must act to save his crew at the expense of his best friend.The Naked Time (4) - a virus causes members of the crew to lose all inhibitions, so we learn that Spock finds it difficult to hide his emotions, that Kirk finds the Enterprise to be a substitute for a real woman, etc.Balance of Terror (14) - The Romulans have a new weapon and a new cloaking device, which they are testing on the Federation's outposts.  Kirk and the Romulan engage in a battle akin to a destroyer-submarine conflict in WWII.The Devil in the Dark (25) - Kirk must find and destroy a creature that is killing miners on a very valuable mining colony.The City on the Edge of Forever (28) - Often voted the Best episode of the series.  McCoy mistakingly changes history when an accident sends him through the time portal called the Guardian of Forever.  Kirk and Spock follow him back to the 1930s to try to repair the damage.  Guest stars a young Joan Collins.Very Good Episodes:What are Little Girls Made Of? (7) - A showcase for Majel Barret as Nurse Chapel, in which she and Kirk are pitted against her ex-fiance as he tries to force his idea of utopia onto the human race.The Menagerie (11 & 12) - the only 2-parter in TOS, using footage from the Cage pilot.  Spock hijacks the Enterprise and kidnaps his former captain.  During the court martial, we find out why in flashbacks.The Galileo 7 (16) - Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and a few others crash-land on a planet in the middle of a nebula.  A great story marred only slightly by the seemingly artificial attacks of McCoy and others on Spock's leadership.Arena (18) - Kirk and an enemy captain are forced into single combat by Superbeings into whose space their battle strays.  One of the few ideas the Next Generation series did better (in ""Darmok""), but this is still a very good episode.Space Seed (22) - the first part of what turned out to be a 4-part arc (this show, plus films 2, 3, and 4).  Ricardo Montalban guest-stars as the genetically enhanced Khan, exiled from Earth, who tries to take over the Enterprise to reinvoke his rule on humanity.Errand of Mercy (25) - the first appearance of Klingons, as the Enterprise and the Klingon war fleet battle for control of a strategic planet.  The natives of the planet seem strangely indifferent to their plight, however....Episodes to which I am fairly indifferent, but enjoy when I see them:The Man Trap (1) - the first episode, suffers from poor development of the Salt Vampire monster, although there is a nice debate about the morality of committing xenocide even to save oneself.The Enemy Within (5) - covers much the same arc as ""Naked Time"" but only Kirk is involved, as he is split into an intellectual half and an emotional half.Mudd's Women (6) - Harry Mudd, interstellar con artist, is transporting women using an illegal drug to make them irresistable to men.Dagger of the Mind (9) - Kirk is taken hostage by an insane doctor in a mental hospital, who is illegally using a machine to wipe out the minds of his inmates.The Corbomite Maneuver (10) - the Enterprise is caught in a standoff with another ship while exploring a new region of space.  Notable as an early example of Kirk talking his way out of trouble instead of shooting his way out.Shore Leave (15) - A neat idea but not a very credible delivery.  The Enterprise comes across a planet where thoughts become reality, sometimes to deadly effect.The Squire of Gothos (17) - One of the first Superbeings encountered by the Enterprise.Tomorrow is Yesterday (19) - An encounter with a black hole throws the Enterprise back in time, where they inadvertantly change the past.  They must correct the error before they can return to their own time.Court Martial (20) - Quite enjoyable for the most part, if contrived.  The ending spoils it somewhat - surely there is an easier way to prove Kirk's innocence than evacuating the entire ship?Return of the Archons (21) - Notable as the first instance of Kirk talking a computer to death.A Taste of Armageddon (23) - A pair of planets is engaged in a sanitised, 800-year-old war, and the Enterprise is listed as a casualty, and is expected to voluntarily destroy itself.  Kirk intervenes to put an end to the society that allows the war to continue.This Side of Paradise (24) - A spore infection causes the entire crew of the Enterprise to choose a utopian sloth over a life of progress that contains danger and struggle.Operation: Annihilate! (29) - A madness-inducing parasitic organism threatens to spread through the galaxy, destroying humanity, unless Kirk can stop it.Episodes I wouldn't watch if they happened to be on in syndication:Charlie X (2) - only ""The Changling"" is a worse TOS show.Miri (8) - again, much of the same material (the tension between Kirk and Rand) is covered in ""Naked Time"", and the rest isn't really that interesting.The Conscience of the King (13) - an ambitious Shakespearean episode that just doesn't come together for me.  Kirk and Lt. Reilly are the last two living witnesses of a massacre when they were children.  Kirk suspects a Shakespearean actor is the man who ordered the massacre, but can't act without proof.The Alternative Factor (27) - A madman and his alternate-universe doppleganger battle between two universes, when a meeting in one universe of the two of them would spell its complete destruction."	5.0	Still the best Trek series - let the voyages begin again!	2007-08-04	4	3	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AGDM76GZY19E1	Cyrus Brown	If you are considering spending $30+ on this you are a real Star Trek fan and it is worth the cost. Each episode is presented in either the original or remastered format. The remastered episodes feature digital noise reduction and enhanced special effects. The difference in some scenes is very obvious, there is big reduction in grain and an increase in clarity. You can see the actor's makeup quite clearly, especially on the men, close-ups on the women are often soft focused as has been SOP for the various Star Trek franchises. You can see parts of the sets wiggle and the costumes are sometimes in need of a few stitches. I really like the enhanced look but if you are a purist and want the largely untouched versions they are there as well. I think you can toggle back and forth using the angle button on your remote to compare looks. So far the best presentation of this series yet.	5.0	Great package	2014-02-10	0	0	0

Many others have expressed the same concerns, but I feel like the booklet attached to the disk case will eventually tear, even with careful use.The video quality is unchanged from the previous DVD releases (at least as best I can tell - I only owned a few of the 1st season 2fers...I assume the rest are the same quality).The sound quality is greatly improved over the 2fers, with Dolby 5.1 giving the subwoofer a jolt here and there as required.My only quarrel with the contents?  I would have liked audio commentaries from some of the principals, or at least text commentary for all the episodes, instead of just a handful.  I thoroughly enjoy the commentaries.All in all, I'm happy with the first season and very excited about getting season 2.  Season 3?

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1PFQ1BKCXL8CY	Daniel A. Wright	"The last time I viewed The Original Series (TOS) was back in 1996-98 when they didn't even have DVD's. So for me to go from VHS to this was extremely significant. I bought this series right away, because I was always a fan of just mainly the original crew (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc.). After seeing the new movie, it renewed my interest, (excellent marketing Paramount!) The HD picture is so much better on this set and the new special effects shots are stunning. I am in shock and awe that this series came out in the 1960's. You will be also when you see the new effects. I also noticed that some of the action is remastered in HD audio. For example, when Kirk throws a punch, you hear it well. The only issue I was curious about was whether they would decide to remaster ""The Cage""(the original pilot) or just leave ""The Menagerie Pt. 1&2"" as enough of the episode. This show is really great and a must see for anyone."	5.0	New Trek, old memories.	2009-06-01	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AUKWDERAY07D0	Daniellon	"STAR TREK - The Original Series, First Season. I stayed to 3am every night watching until I finished the whole episodes! This is Sci-Fi at its best. The Plots in the original Star Trek are almost all story-and-character driven and each story is a classic in its own sense. Time travel? Nothing better than the classic ""City on the edge of Forever"", a story that will remain edged on your mind for a long, long time? Wandering where James Cameron got the ideas for his Terminator Series? The ideas are all there in Star trek starting with the very first episode ""The Man Trap"" in which you see a ""morphing"" character that obviously the T1000 in T2 was based on. ""What are little Girls made of?""  is also a Robot Classic that I believe would have help Cameron conjure up the Terminator Series. By the way the morphing Character in ""Man Trap"" is female, so think of ""T3"".I just wish Hollywood would remake some of the series as full length features with younger characters and bigger special effects. I would definitely like to see a modern remake of ""The city on the edge of Forever"" and ""Arena"" in which the ""GORN"" Monster is given better effects a more viciousness.I just acquired the rest of the Original series and I foresee many sleepless nights ahead for myself!"	5.0	FANTASTIC SERIES!!!	2008-04-08	3	1	2

I can understand the viewpoint of hardcore purists who oppose remastering, altering, or adding CG effects to these classic epiosdes. That being said, from this casual fan's perspective, all changes made to the original series for this DVD release are breathtaking and most appropriate. The color, clarity, and sound is stunning, a modern re-recording of the classic intro theme is ""music to my ears"", and all effects (especially shots of the Enterprise) are a sheer delight to watch. It makes Star Trek better. Sitting through old grainy footage and a soundtrack recorded on now antiquated equipment would be a torture for today's sci-fi audience. The beauty of this ""special edition"" (because that's what it is) is that it blends and works... unlike a lot of what George Lucas added to his Star Wars movies... these changes and updates aren't overdone and integrate seemlessly into the rest of the original scenes. I love Star Trek now and watch every episode with edge-of-my-seat fervor! This was never the case previously.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1XFARQM57SF22	Daufhin Thorndike	"I cannot believe how people are being fooled by this gimmick. This new ""re-mastered"" version of the original series is a travesty. I watched season one just to see what the differences are, and I was beside myself with anger. Not only have they changed the original special effects- but even the classic theme music has been hijacked and re-recorded. On top of that, the dvds come in cheap, double sided discs. Every dvd collector knows that these are less quality than the single sided ones.How does this abomination be let to stand? I can only think of younger people who have never seen the original series putting this on and thinking that this was Star Trek. They have all been hoodwinked by greedy entertainment executives trying to make a fast buck at the expense of American television history. To destroy and subvert such a classic show as Star Trek is just beyond me. CGI is destroying American cinema as it is (who out there can tell me honestly that the effects in Michael Bay's Transformers looked more realistic that the live action models used in the original Star Wars movies?), and to use that to alter the special effects here under the pretense that they are ""improving"" the originals is ludicrous. The new CGI effects look like CGI EFFECTS. And that is a far cry from looking realistic. Special effects looked better, and more realistic decades ago and have been regressing- not improving with the new technologies. A large part of Star Trek's charm was the style it was made in- from the primitive (but effective) special effects used, to the period sets and odd fashion sense, and the iconic theme music. All of these things have been soiled in some way by this new ""re-mastering"" and Star Trek fans should not stand for it. Write the producers behind this desecration in protest and seek out the original now out of print 2004 releases which preserved this great show as it should always be- un-edited, un-altered, and most definitely not ""re-mastered""."	1.0	A Desecration	2010-02-02	67	42	25

The dialogue seems significantly lower than the music. I'm constantly raising and lowing the volume3. No scene selection option4. In memory of Majel Barrett-Roddenberry should have been more prominent considering her contribution to Star Trek. It's buried after ""The Naked Time"" episode. It pops up after the credits, the ""CBS Media clip"", and then a black screen that lasts several seconds. I only saw it by accident. This should have loaded at the beginning of the disc instead of a trailer you might watch once.6. Disc one always starts with the movie trailer.

The people who have given this junk 4 and 5 star reviews are obviously not fans of the original Star Trek series.I assumed 'remastered' meant picture restoration. All of the original special effects, which are integral and gives the series its charm, are gone, deleted, and replaced with awful CGI, even the original title music has been erased and replaced with a newly recorded version. I don't want this; I want the original Star Trek series. I consider this to be vandalism, a desecration, and the philistines who did it talk about wanting to 'respect' the original material, they have had the audacity to change and alter the entire series, just because they think it should look like this, I find this offensive. Why not erase William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and CGI in better looking, modern actors while you're at it?I cannot find any menu, on the DVDs, that allows me to see the original, untampered with, episodes - I have been informed that the original special effects are not included on the DVDs, Blu-ray edition only do you have a choice.This is not ""The original series"" it is a butchered, bastardised farce.  I will be returning this junk and asking for my money back."	1.0	Star Trek vandalized	2012-11-15	15	4	11
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3M2WX6OO7TGZK	David Alan Hall	It was nice to see extra featurettes on the original series DVDs after enjoying them on all the other Star Trek sets.  But they still seem pretty frugal.  The text commentaries by Okuda range from common sense stuff to some pretty interesting material if you can stand to read all the boxes.  But some of them stay on the screen for barely a second and I often had to pause the DVD to read them; also the background they use to make the comments readable is awful--it makes them in many cases very difficult to read.  I sure would have liked to see some real commentaries by surviving cast members--even one episode per major actor would have been nice.  Another thing that bothers me is the order in which the episodes are presented--original airdate order and not production order as they were in the original 40 releases (which for my money are still superior if for no other reasons than they are not as compressed with single layer and as I said presented chronologically).  The packaging is cool looking but got annoying real fast--the actual inside box the discs come in is cheap like the Voyager sets.  And the little booklet listing the episodes is odd--really just fluff.  Don't pay full price for this set.  Grab it at Sam's Club or get it used here on Amazon.	4.0	Extras okay but not great...here's why	2004-09-04	13	8	5
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1INUD4OVDL4PR	David A. Stout	Unlike many reviewers so far, I'm ok with the new CGI. I'm not ok with HD on one side and DVD on the other. I am not sure which format this is but it may be dvd-18, which is well known to exhibit problems. I expereinced this with many other sets, such as The Best of Abbott & Costello volumes 1-4. The re-released box set has no problems and came in single discs per movie.This is a tempting set but once again, a motion picture studio company screwed it up with cheap formatting and packaging.[...]	3.0	If Season 1 wasn't double sided, it might be worth it.	2009-08-26	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A34IBXM7E8CPWE	David Girod	"Once you get beyond all of the junk associated with Star Trek, the ""trekkie"" stuff of dressing like Spock on weekends, or learning to speak Klingon, and just watch the show..you see why Trek has such a strong following almost four decades after it's initial broadcast. ""Star Trek"" really was ahead of it's time. This show took the Science Fiction genre to a whole new level in much the same way ""Gunsmoke"" took the western genre from ""The Lone Ranger"" to serious adult drama. The shows presented in this first season box set are some of the best dramatic TV from the time, science fiction or otherwise. Just watch ""Menagerie"" or ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", both feature top notch writing and storylines, well above your standard weekly series fare, even by today's standards. Sure there are some clunker episodes in this set, ""The Alternative Factor"", and sure you may chuckle at the special effects in epsiodes like ""Arena"" or ""Operation--Annihilate"", but that is what makes ""Star Trek"" really great. It's a product of it's time, so even though the special effects aren't that special, the writing and acting more than make up for it. When you first watch the ""Devil in the Dark"" you might get a chuckle out of Spock communicating with what looks like a giant shag-carpet-scab....but Nimoy is just such a good actor, and the story is so compelling, you look beyond the lousy creature costume and just get sucked into the story. If you are like me, and remember catching the odd repeat here or there growing up, do yourself a favor and pick this up. The shows are all really good, and you can enjoy them even if you have never owned a pair of Spock ears."	5.0	A Non-Trekkie Review	2005-03-01	13	11	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3CDV3YKIAW46F	David Jacobson	Unlike what Lucas did when he digitally remastered Star Wars and ruined several scenes, the Remastered versions of Star Trek doesn't touch the storyline but does clean up the space shots to today's standards of effects.  I grew up with the series on TV both on NBC and later as reruns.  I still love knowing how they used track mounted cameras and models to do all the shots.  Matte painting is a lost art but well used in Star Trek (TOS).  But at least with the Remastered series, I can show my children (born after TNG premiered) what the old crew was like.	5.0	The digital touch-ups are welcomed	2013-05-23	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1J1K3X8ZMB5WD	David Stager	"We've all seen the episodes more times than we want to admit.  However, I simply had to see it in High Definition.  I spent my time scrutinizing the episodes for fine details that only HD can reveal.I enjoyed seeing coffee stains on the shirts and the complete obviousness of Spock's ear latex appliances and the correct hue of his facial make-up.  It was great to see Uhura's plastic earrings and the fine detail of all the phaser and communicator props and all the signs and read outs in freeze frame so I can actually read the text.  It was cool to see the helm of the bridge and all it's controls and be able to see that it was crudely fabricated and see polishing marks from rags and tiny defects.These tiny details are by no means a criticism.  It was a reason to watch all the episodes again to see just exactly what details I could spot.  I'm sure others will spot many more.  I was actually shocked that the Enterprise model looked so good and in all the detail of the planets while in orbit - but as others have pointed out, these special effects were re-done digitally.  And that is a shame.  I would have loved to see the real models and moldy oranges, i.e., planets that were in the original.  Maybe the HD transfer revealed too much and had to be removed -- but I would love to have seen it all anyway.  Wouldn't it have been a kick to actually be able to see a bunch of grapes with oblique lighting as the star field?  The digital enhancements alas took this away.I listened to the episodes with a nice set of Bose headphones and I have to say I liked the sound mix tremendously.  It was a very good stereo mix and I had to marvel at the care that went into it.  I did notice a few differences in effects and music, but it was not distracting at all and I'm sure the changes were a matter of necessity.  The changes simply ressurected old memories of watching the originals long ago.  I still remember the sound of those Talosian plants in the wind from the first time I saw the show.  I knew for sure it was different here - but I had to remember from long ago to realize it.The transfer is not perfect in many places because the colors wash out and distort in several places - possibly this took place on the original source material.  These defects needed to be addressed in post-production.It's a high price to pay for this set, but I have to say the details are the best reason to buy this again and watch it again.  See how many little things you can spot.  It's amazing.  You might even want to re-read ""The Making of Star Trek"" by Stephen E. Whitfield before re-viewing the episodes in High Definition to fully appreciate the craftmanship and skill that went into Star Trek."	4.0	The Devil is in the Details	2007-12-22	7	6	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3UUGZRTBS81YN	David W. Jones	As a lifelong Star Trek fan, I was eager to see the restored version of the original series.  It does not disappoint.  For a television show that was filmed almost fifty years ago, the details are sharp, colors are vibrant, and the sound is strong and clear.  There is very little film grain.  It is so much better than the DVD copies.One unfortunate side effect of the improved clarity, however, is that some of the special effects now call attention to themselves.  The bridge of the Enterprise is so evidently a set.  The alien landscapes look even more fake.  Alien costumes are evidently rubber.  You can now detect the makeup on Spock.  When characters engage in hand-to-hand combat, you can make out the faces of the stunt doubles, etc.  But at the end of the day, I didn't care.  I make allowances for that.  This is the best edition of the show that I have loved watching since my childhood.This version also has an option for improved special effects.  Many of the exterior shots of the Enterprise orbiting around planets and such did not hold up well with time.  So the top menu has an option to watch either the original special effects or digitally enhanced special effects.  Normally, I am purist.  But surprisingly I prefer the enhanced effects on this edition.  They are less jarring.The discs include some special features--interviews, home movies, and the like.  But I have not fully plumbed them yet, and so cannot comment on them.Watching these old episodes has given me a renewed appreciation for the general quality of the writing (there are a few dud episodes).  The three principal characters--Kirk, Spock and McCoy--are fantastic, and the interactions between them memorable.  Good dramatic tension, humor, etc.  You care about the characters.  The stories have held up well over time.  It is also fun to watch how this show anticipated later developments in technology.If you are a Star Trek fan, and you are wondering whether this edition is worth the money, it is worth every cent.  You will not be disappointed.	5.0	Excellent transfer to Blu-ray	2013-07-08	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A18AY69GN36AR8	Deacon Boogie	"I grew up during The Next Generation (TNG) era and was not a fan of the Original Series (TOS). The stories were good but as TV is a visual medium much of the drama of the series was lost due to the distractingly poor quality of the special effects of the era.When I first heard of CBS's project, I was curious from a technological standpoint. Then I saw some official comparison shots and became more interested. As my HD-DVD investment grew, I found myself becoming excited about the release of these discs. When they were announced, I immediately said ""I've got to buy these!""Now that I've watched them, I am amazed at the amount of work and care that they've put into restoring this classic show. I find myself able to watch complete episodes and not be distracted by the fact that it's 40 years old. The clean-up that was done to these 2nd generation prints (frame-by-frame removal of scratches, damage, etc) is spectacular! The new CG effects shots are top notch! I believe the producers when they state that their intent was to create visuals that truly match those which the original writers and designers would have wanted but simply could not in the 1960s. Every new effect shot adds to the enjoyment of the show and fits with the style of the production era.If you always found yourself uninterested in TOS for similar reasons, check this collection out! It's changed my mind completely!"	5.0	Amazing quality, amazing new effects...	2007-11-27	11	9	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1TP6VKVDMHB6J	"dep1701 ""dep1701"""	"I have read all of the reviews ( or should that be PREVIEWS  since the set hasn't even been released yet? ), and have experienced alternating pleasure and dismay over what many people have said about the series and Paramount.First, I too did not buy all of the original DVD releases... not so much because of the price ( I didn't find the $20.00 per DVD THAT distressing, considering I paid about that much per EPISODE when they were first released on VHS ). What I found more objectionable was the enhanced 5.1 audio mix.While I admire the time and effort it took to produce these new mixes, I did not really like the liberties taken with the soundtracks, such as added sound effects, and background music re-tracked with different cues. The example that really appalled me was the changing of music in the episode ""The Menagerie"", which was tracked with music from second season episodes in some places. I would not have felt so strongly against this practice had Paramount seen fit to include the original monophonic mixes as alternate tracks. This practice is common with many motion pictures released by other studios ( 20th Century Fox is a good example... check out the five additional soundtrack mixes on their first DVD release of the 1979 film ""Alien"" on of which was purely music! ), but I guess Paramount doesn't feel it's worth the cost involved.Then I started noticing other imperfections, like the fact that a very small piece of footage containing a line or two of dialogue was missing from the third season episode ""The Tholian Web"" ( for obsessives like myself, the missing footage comes as Dr. McCoy releases Uhura from sickbay ). It's a small thing, but, by golly, these DVDs were supposed to be the ultimate in picture and sound quality... how could they make goofs like that?So why am I buying this release now? Because I've become spoiled by the superior picture quality of the DVDs I do have, and find it difficult to watch the VHS versions anymore. Yes, like others here I find the prices that Paramount charges a bit steep, but it is their property, and they are free to charge what they feel the market will bear. A lot of people seem to forget that it was Paramount who started the trend of lower VHS prices when they first released ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"" at the (then ) ground-breakingly low price of $39.95, back when the average cost of a new movie on home video was $79.95.And to those who are complaining about buying the same episodes again, imagine my dismay after having bought all the individual sets of an old sci-fi series released on DVD by A&E;, only to have them re-release the entire series as one set, INCLUDING an exclusive ""Bonus Disc"" ( only available with the box set ) with three corrected prints of episodes that were less than perfectly mastered the first go around, and a short film, highly desired and prized by fans of that series, at no particular savings in price over buying the individual sets!  So, after that stinging experience I'm not going to complain too much about the fact that Paramount has at least created an entirely new presentation of the episodes. I can only hope that they will correct some of the errors of the previous releases ( although I will not be surprised if they don't )."	4.0	My All Time Favorite Series...	2004-08-23	11	9	2
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2EWIWBG0GHGQS	"DesiluTrek ""Live Long and Prosper"""	"The original Star Trek was an ""HD"" show for its day. NBC kept it on the air in part because it exploited the potential of the new format at that time -- color. Although Trek never did well in the overall Nielsen ratings, special surveys found it to be among the top shows watched by people with color TVs. And NBC had a vested interest in helping its parent company RCA sell color sets.Today I'll bet these Star Trek Blu-ray sets will help popularize HD, especially true 1080p. I've had a 60-inch HD set for three years but never took advantage of its full 1080p potential until I bought a Blu-ray player to watch this first season set. The clarity is nothing short of phenomenal -- it really is like going to see these episodes screened in the best quality at a movie theater. And to this die-hard 40-year original series lover the redone effects are well done, even excellent in many cases -- just watch the Enterprise in the sky in ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday"" and tell me you don't get a chill. The CG Enterprise exterior tour on disc 6 is also a lot of fun -- it affirms for me that the new movie Enterprise should have looked more like the classic original.Right out of the shrink-wrap, I had to watch ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" and the remastering there really pops. McCoy's pale, blotchy makeup, the ""New York"" exteriors, Joan Collins as Edith Keeler, Kirk and Spock in '30s flannel shirts and jeans, Spock's tricorder work using ""stone knives and bearskins"" ... it all looks outstanding, right up to the bitter climax. What the Guardian of Forever said could apply to this terrific Blu-ray set -- ""Many such journeys are possible. Let me be your gateway."""	5.0	Star Trek does for 1080p what it did for color TV in the '60s	2009-05-04	7	7	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	ACK8PPTMGRY7X	D. Harris	Anybody know? The last box sets were the 1970's syndicated versions. The 1960's versions had more material to watch. Anyone remember when SciFi did a special run of the truly uncut 1960's versions? I'm hoping this release has that runtime...The price is pretty step regardless considering I just bought the complete standard def box set for that price about a year ago. I don't own a hi-def player so HD-DVD doesn't really appeal to me right now (I think Blue Ray will become the standard anyway so it will be re-released again in that format).I'll wait until it comes down to around $70.

These episodes from the first season have the added bonus of being just a little more wobbly and unsure of themselves than the next two years, where the show's rhythm had been found. The performances are both less assured and a little more serious (the ""Trek"" crew dove heavily into the inside humor in the later episodes) but the entertainment value remains unparalleled after all these decades. I picked these up just to have a failsafe entertainment option on nights when regular TV falls flat... and boy, are they great!  The show is even funnier and more delicious than I remembered from when I was a kid... Great stuff; highly recommended!(PS - but why are the episodes presented out of order? Seems rather odd...)

Star Trek made a huge impression on me growing up on a farm in the midwest.  It started my love for techlogy and computers.  I believe it's a big reason I'm in the computer industry today.Well getting on to the review.  I recently picked up a PS3 to use as a blu ray player and gaming console.  My first TV episode blu ray purchase was Star Trek:  The Original Series - Season 1.  On a big screen TV these episodes look simply amazing.  I have an Apple TV and have downloaded the remastered episodes from Apple and these look noticably better to me.  Like other reviewers said, the colors and picture quality is amazing.  I started out with one of my favorite episodes ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"".  This looks better than any movie I've seen from the 60's and 70's.  It's a great but tragic story too.  Sally Kellerman and Gary Lockwood are excellent guest stars.  I wish they would have figured out a way to bring them back in other episodes or movies.The Billy Blackburn home movies are a hoot.  It's really great to see the behind the scenes stuff.  You'll notice that Leonard Nimoy is deadly serious most of the time even when off camera.  Blackburn says he rarely got out of character.  Plus there is some other surprises with Blackburn that I won't spoil.If you're a SciFi lover or just a lover of good writing and television.  I would add this to your collection without hesitation.  I hope they do a similiar restoration to the ""Twilight Zone"" series and ""The Next Generation""."	5.0	The Original Star Trek looks better than ever!!!	2010-03-16	2	0	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"I've always been a big Star Trek fan, but being too young, I didn't see it in its original order. I realize now that most of the episodes aren't really shown in syndication--the T.V. stations only like to show a handful of them, over and over. And how many times do we really need to see Shore Leave?That's one of the things that makes this collection a nice addition to the library--it's great to be able to see all of the episodes, and in their original broadcast order, no less. The order is interesting because it allows an insight as to how the show was modified over time.Some things I learned from watching these shows in order:* That McCoy wasn't originally slated to be as crucial (one of the big three) as he eventually became. (He wasn't even the first doctor).* That Vulcans were originally called ""Vulcanians""; also, they had a form of mind-control (not simply the ""mind meld""--much more powerful than this).* That Sulu was originally supposed to be a botanist/biologist, not a helmsman.* That the symbol they wear on their uniforms didn't originally stand for StarFleet, but for the Enterprise; other ships had different logos.* That phaser blasts were originally bullet-like pulses, not streams; and at first there were no photon torpedoes.Also, what I've found interesting is that the show was really an anthology series at first. Things like the Klingons, Romulans, etc., were created, not in order to develop the Star Trek Universe as it eventually became, but to tell simple one-shot stories, usually with a message. Originally, Star Trek was a series like the Twilight Zone, only with a group of recurring characters. It is a series with a different feeling than any of the shows to come later, such as Next Gen or Voyager, because they were interested in telling long-term stories within a consistent universe; Classic Trek was not.What remains true of this series, even in its early, formative years, are the great characters. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty and the rest are all lovable, and all well-acted (even Shatner, who is really quite good). The stories are hit and miss, some great and some lousy, depending on the writer and director for that episode. Standouts include The Menagerie, Court Martial, Balance of Terror and City on the Edge of Forever.In all, I learned a lot and had a good time watching these episodes. I recommend it to Trekkies/Trekkers and even just the curious. I found this season, as Spock would say, fascinating."	4.0	Still a Classic Series--Interesting to Watch in Original Order	2006-01-12	23	19	4

I was a huge fan of the show and could name all of the episodes as well as tell you about each. Over the years, though, other interests replaced my enthusiasm for Star Trek, but now I have rediscovered the thrill of the original series through this remastered edition on DVD. The new special effects do not detract form the show at all. They are tastefully done and in a style that compliments the look and feel of the show. In my opinion they have improved the show and given the original Star Trek new life.There have been some reviews that criticize the disks for not having labels on them. This is true, but there is a set of cards that come with each box that lists the contents of each disc, so I don't see an issue with not having a label printed on each disc itself.Other reviews have stated concerns that the case this DVD collection comes in is flimsy. I have to let you know that I accidentally dropped the case full of it's entire contents, from a height of about 5 feet onto a carpeted surface and it wasn't damaged at all, so I think the packaging for these remastered sets is sturdier than some people may think.I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to relive the magic of the original series.	5.0	Rediscovering Star Trek all Over Again!	2010-08-14	0	0	0

How about a chirping cell phone that looks like the first one ever made. Yet you're to believe technology is good enough to have a sophisticated space ship that goes at warp speed. How about a printer that actually spits out ordinary paper. The ship has to stop every now and then to empty the ship's waste paper basket. It goes on and on.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1TWV867HVZ60	D & R fm VA	By today's standards, the show is seriously lacking in special effects, props, staging, etc...  but if you are watching it as it was intended in its day.  A ground breaking Sci-Fi about a mission in space... it is wonderful.  I often groaned at the dialog or the Styrofoam rocks falling, but this also brought me back to a simpler time when this was cutting edge.  For any Star Trek fan, this is a must see.  If you are going to try to compare it to a 2014 TV show or the latest Star Trek movies...  don't bother.	4.0	To Go Where No Man Hard Gone Before...	2014-07-09	0	0	0

I don't know why they re-recorded the music, but it is like an enhanced version of the original.  There are some interesting interviews and add-on features.They also re-did many of the special effects of the space vehicles. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five - it has changed the show from its original.  Ideally, they would have an option to choose the original effects or the new.All in all, good job by people who care about Star Trek the original series.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AGFG4WD7RB7I	"Dylan Lange ""Dylan~"""	"I purchased this product for my mother for Mother's Day. When I went over to deliver it to her, she almost squealed at me she loved it so much. Now, I will say that I am not a huge fan of Star Trek, in fact I have never seen any of the movies or anything other than late night TNG episodes, but watching this with my mother has made me a huge fan.She opened it up post-haste and instead of going out to eat like I had planned, she just wanted to order a pizza and us watch it. What I watched was some of the best acting for a television show of its time. But enough about that, you all want to know what it comes with it, what it looks like, and the sound and picture quality, right?Well, to that, I will say you will not be disappointed in this purchase at all. The collection itself comes in a very large Blu-ray case that is encompassed by a thin card-board cover. All of the discs are in the case on a sort of ""hinge"" system, on one each side. My only complaint about the set is that the last disc, which is on the backside of the case, always seems to fall out for me, I'm not sure if it does for anyone else. It was out of its holder when my mom first opened up, and even when we place it there and hear the little 'snap' confirmation of it being in, it tends to fall out anyway. There is no sort of book on the inside, the only paper-related things are little ads for up-coming Star Trek releases. Oddly enough, there isn't an ad for the new movie, which I found very weird.The picture and sound quality are top-notch. If you have an HDTV (which, if you own a blu-ray player, I don't see why you wouldn't) that handles 1080p, you will not be disappointed in what you see when it starts playing. If you have a 7.1 sound system, I would assume you wouldn't either. While I have one at my house, my parents only have a 5.1 capable system, and even THAT sounds amazing. In terms of the new ""enhanced graphics"" that they advertise, it isn't really anything to write home about. All it does it makes the ""ship flying in space"" scenes look newer, which creates a stark contrast to when the actual actors are on screen. For the opinion of a an actual Star Trek fan, I will quote my mother; ""It's neat, but I prefer the original graphics myself. I can see why they did it though, for the younger fans.""In terms of the extras added, I cannot comment on it because during my visit we didn't check them out, after I had left and a week had passed, my mother said it's really neat to hear and see the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I'm assuming it's good.Wrap up: If you're a fan of Star Trek and want to own the original season on Blu-ray? You cannot beat this price. You get 24 hours worth of a Blu-ray enhanced classic Star Trek goodness, and if you're as big a fan as my mom, you'll love it. The picture and sound quality are next to none, and the extras included will have you watching the episodes again and again. This is a must-have for any Trekkies, and for this price? You're crazy to pass it up."	5.0	A perfect buy for fans, and new comers alike.	2009-05-20	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO	E. Hornaday	"Finally, Paramount is releasing Star Trek: The Original Series by seasons, rather than in expensive two-episode packs.There are very few TV shows or movies that are so well known that a brief synopsis may be redundant, and Star Trek is one of those shows. Regardless, please bear with a brief synopsis because of the historical significance of the series. Star Trek not only launched a TV franchise with movies and series spinoffs that are still on the air, it had a direct and lasting impact on popular culture here and around the world.When creator Gene Roddenberry (The Great Bird of the Galaxy) somehow managed to get his show on the air in 1966, there was nothing else like it on TV. Its fresh and optimistic portrayal of the future with different races, even species, working side-by-side as equals was nothing short of revolutionary.In those days, not only was an integrated TV cast virtually unknown, women were also seldom depicted as anything but window dressing. Star Trek changed that, and so much more.The above preface was written for those who did not live through those times, and for those who would criticize Star Trek for cheesy special effects and acting. To me, the actual truth is this: Star Trek was both a product of its generation and a show that transcended its time. To look at it solely with the jaundiced eye of 2004 is to do it a great injustice. It was fun, bright entertainment, but it was MORE. It had to be, or it would not have lasted all of these decades or developed the most incredible fanbase in TV history.The story of Capt. James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Lt. Commander Montgomery Scott(James Doohan), Lts. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) and Sulu (George Takei), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barret aka Mrs. Gene Roddenberry) only completed three seasons of missions ---- the shortest run of any of the franchise shows.The premise was simple, the above-mentioned crew of the Starship Enterprise was to explore new worlds, new civilizations, for five years. It was NOT a military mission, but many things occurred that brought the crew into conflict with other species. The stories were well written and included humor with the other dramatic and futuristic, space-related elements.Roddenberry sold it to the network as a ""Wagon Train to the Stars,"" but actually used the show to examine current events and cultural traditions of American society during a very turbulent time.The first season is great fun to watch, as the actors begin to feel more comfortable in their roles, especially Nimoy, whose Vulcan Science Office becomes richer as the series progresses.Here are the first-season episodes, listed in chronological order rather than broadcast order:The Corbomite Maneuver (11/10/1966)Mudd's Women (10/13/1966)The Enemy Within (10/6/1966)The Man Trap (9/8/1966)The Naked Time (9/29/1966)Charlie X (9/15/1966)Balance of Terror (12/15/1966)What Are Little Girls Made Of? (10/20/1966)Dagger of the Mind (11/3/1966)Miri (10/27/1966)The Conscience of the King (12/8/1966)The Galileo Seven (1/5/1967)Court Martial (2/2/1967)The Menagerie part 1 / The Menagerie part 2 (11/17/1966, 11/24/1966)Shore Leave (12/29/1966)The Squire of Gothos (1/12/1967)Arena (1/19/1967)The Alternative Factor (3/23/1967)Tomorrow is Yesterday (1/26/1967)The Return of the Archons (2/9/1967)A Taste of Armageddon (2/23/1967)Space Seed (2/16/1967)This Side of Paradise (3/2/1967)The Devil in the Dark (3/9/1967)Errand of Mercy (3/16/1967)The City on the Edge of Forever (4/6/1967)Operation: Annihilate! (4/13/1967)It is unclear if the series two pilots will be included. If so, they were The Cage (later remade into the two-part Menagerie); and Where No Man Has Gone Before.If you've never seen these shows uncut, or if you haven't given yourself a chance to view them without the burden of the 21st Century, you owe it to ourself to buy this set."	5.0	Where No DVD Has Gone Before	2004-06-28	21	19	2

Better Pricing for Star Trek SeriesI agree with other customers about Paramount's unfair pricing of the Star Trek series. I too refused to buy the single DVD packages that would have cost over $800 ($20 * 40 (2 shows per DVD) about $10 per show as compared to the about $2.90 per show in the box set... plus you get more stuff in the set. Ouch!!!As far as TV series marketing is concerned season box sets are the way to go but Paramount still needs to learn about pricing for success. Take for example the StarGate SG1 series.. very well priced around $52 and a mover in sales.Come on... the material while still good is after all over 38 years old!!!!!!!!We all love Star Trek but the paramount price for the ST series needs work however this new set is a step in the right direction.	5.0	Finally!!!!!

This is an excellent vision of the original ground-breaker, and brings on a warm and welcome set of memories of a better time. I feel like a kid again watching these, and the remaster simply hightens the illusion. It always brings a smile to my face, and warms my heart. I know that those who have gone from us like De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan should be proud to have been associated with this. I can remember when Star Trek is ALL there was to watch, no Doctor Who, no Battlestar Galactica...(before Star Wars, everything else was crap when I was a kid) and this is the ultimate prize for the faithful. Trek is finally receiving it's due. The new effects work is icing on the cake, and NO Star Trek fan should be without this collection! This is a fine presentation of Classic Star Trek. The new effects edit is beyond words. This is fandom cranked to the max.I am an industry professional now, a concept designer, having worked as an artist on the likes of BABYLON 5, STARSHIP TROOPERS, and now the new BLAKE'S 7, and I speak to you on the level of a lifelong fan: buy this!I'll keep this short and sweet: if you remember and love the ORIGINAL CLASSIC, this is a true necessity for your collection.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC	Eric J. Anderson	"I've seen some of the new CGI effects, and some are very nice. Others, flat and artificial. In that sense, they aren't any more ""real"" than the original grainy footage done with mattes and models.But even if the new effects were state of the art, they are married to an old series where the sets are obviously plywood and cheap paint. The heavy makeup is not subtle either. Some of the medical instruments are literally oddly-shaped salt shakers. The rocks on the planet surfaces are a plastic or styrofoam-type material. This show was not meant for high definition. It was meant for standard definition analog television transmission. If you like seeing all the flaws, fine. That's not my bag, and maybe not yours either.For me, the remastering is an exercise in futility. The show was what it was -- episodic S-F done quickly on a relatively modest budget. I loved the show, and spent a lot of my own time and effort trying to get the show revived back in the 1970s. All of you who enjoyed The Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and the motion pictures can thank me and those like me -- who convinced Paramount that there was a real market for the continuing franchise.But I've bought the first DVD sets of The Original Series, and I think they are a better representation of the show. Feel free to buy what you like, but newer is not necessarily better. Higher definition is not necessarily better. Why is it better to see all the pores on Captain Kirk's nose? To me, that's a distraction. The script's the thing. The acting is the thing. The anachronistic sets and costumes and grainy shots of spacecraft models... well, you're going to have to suspend your disbelief. Shakespeare had the worst special effects and sets imaginable back in his Globe Theater days. Imagination beats CGI any day of the week. Ultimately, the CGI does not look ""real"" either. And it clashes with the style of the live-action footage.I fear that many purchases of these remastered editions will be knee-jerk responses by fans enticed by something new and different, without regard to whether it is truly an improvement. If you think the new mastering and effects significantly adds to the joy of this classic series, then that is certainly a valid reason to buy. I only want to caution people that they may have the same tepid reaction I have."	3.0	Another money extraction from the lemmings	2008-10-01	25	18	7

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1SXS2P1B80I82	"Erik Aleksander Moe ""riddion"""	"This set was at the top of my list of titles to buy when buying an HD DVD player and I was somewhat disappointed. The level of detail in the original camera negative after the restoration was astounding, making my old DVDs (I bought the first 40 DVDs released about 9 years ago) look not that good. But. And there is a but here. The digital upgrade that was done to all the episodes were bad, really bad. All shots of the Enterprise in space, either orbiting a planet or treking through space, looked like bad CGI. The ship had no substance and didn't look real at all. In the documentary on disc 10 they said that did it in the spirit of what it would have looked like if it was done today. But it wasn't made today, it was made in the 60's, the greatest decade in American Television. It had groundbreaking special effects and to ""upgrade"" the effects using the technology today is like discarding everything that those amazing people at Paramount's effects department did. The fact that it looks the way it does originally is what I, and I expect many other Trek fans too, love about the show. It's a timecapsule to the what things were done back then and the groundbreaking ideas that Gene Roddenberry had that would make really great television. The next thing I see is people saying that Ray Harryhausen's or Willis O'Brien's work on ""Jason and Argonauts"" and ""King Kong"", respectively, now isn't good enough anymore and redo those magnificent effects too. I look at the effects in Star Trek in the same league as the work of those magnificent people. I would advise people to just skip this set and buy the DVD set with the original effects and music intact.Oh, yes, the music. They even redone the music in the entire season, discarding the really great recordings that Alexander Courage (and his colleagues) did on the show. They also made the mistake of having Kirk saying his famous ""Space. The Final Frontier"" speech in the second pilot (the first was ""The Cage"" made into the two part ""The Menagerie"") ""Where no man has gone before"".Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this set and cherish the DVD set or the 40 DVDs earlier released."	2.0	Really great quality in picture detail but bad CGI upgrade	2008-01-31	26	17	9

Thwaites	There's no pleasing some people... various &quot;reviewers&quot; are content to whine, complain and nit pick about packaging.  The episodes in the ST:TOS box sets look FAR better than the TV re-runs, and the Dolby Digital audio is miles above the original Mono VHS soundtrack.You have to remember that this show is pushing 40 years old now.  There's only so much the engineers can do to clean up the original source video and audio.  The Okuda commentaries, bonus features and interactive menus are very well done, however the menus can be a little clumsy to navigate.  That being said, you get used to them fairly quickly.  The original TV previews for each week's episode are a nice touch.These sets are a little expensive, and the packaging isn't the best, but a couple of $1.99 Ikea CD-Wallets solves that issue.  It's still FAR cheaper than buying the original 2-episode per DVD issues.	4.0	Very well done re-issues.	2005-04-05	6	4	2

Truthfully, ""The Man Trap"" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered ""adult programming"", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young)."	4.0	...When I was very small...	2007-03-03	1	1	0

One thing I keep in mind that the special effects were an &#34;enhancement&#34; to the stories. The interaction and chemistry between the actors is the main focus, not the special effects, as is too often the case in movies and series that came afterwards. It's also amazing to see how many of the items that were sci-fi props actually become part of the technology we take for granted today.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2EIRCMHTO7CUI	Frank Messely	Ah, I watched every episode back in the early seventies.  I was a preteen.  I guess I was what would later be called a Trekkie.  Now I bought the season 1 series on BD.  I was hesitant after reading some negative reviews dealing with the restored version.  As the BD provides us with both the original and the restored version -- the latter CGI enhanced -- one is free which version to watch.  But I want to focus on the restorations.  Well, the original STAR TREK series have never looked as good as they do now.  I like the pure nostalgia of the original visuals, of course, but I also like the restored version, and this for the following reason:  they have chosen the golden mean.  The FX look more 'sophisticated', yes 'updated', but there is no exaggeration here.  Visually, everything perfectly fits.  The question one should ask is:  If the makers of the original series would have had the means to create these effects, mattes, CGI, etc, would they have done it in this way?  I think the answer is yes.  The people who created this BD version probably kept this in mind while working on it.  There is nothing wrong with this restored version.  Overall, it remains faithful to the original atmosphere, I never got the feeling they visually raped it.  And I guess the fact that this new version exists is proof that Kirk, Spock, Bones, etc,  are still very well alive in the 21st century.  I think these BD releases are the ultimate version to own.

This included a look at some of the special features including the methods used to enhance the original film and the re-recording of the the musical scoring. Plus a preview of Season 2.I was a little surprised to see the movie house was packed/sold out.  It was an expensive ticket.Overall, I was very happy with the new special effects.  The Enterprise, as it flew past the planets, seemed much more clearly defined, and the detail was excellent.  The contrast was much improved over the original prints.On the downside, even though it is HD, it is still in the original TV format.  No 16x9 available.  Going to look a little funny on my wide screen TV.As other have mentioned, the price is another drawback.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3187WZPJM61CW	from california	i bought this set from our local big box warehouse after buying a Toshiba HD-D3 player on sale. the HD picture is absolutely stunning and I was completely tickled looking at the new CGI scenes. but the first disc started to freeze and jerk during Where No Man Has Gone Before. I cleaned the disc with a CD cloth and cleaner and the disc finally played fine. then I tried disc two. The first epidose, Naked Time, froze nine minutes into the episode, during the cafeteria scene. I wiped the disc with a CD cloth and cleaner but to no avail. the disc froze even worse than before and I had to reboot the player. i did research on the web and found that these hybrid HD-DVD/DVD combo discs have been notorious for problems with the HD side. I finally gave up on the set and returned it to the big box warehouse. I should say that the DVD side on both discs played perfectly. I also have not found any reviews on digital review web sites that have mentioned a problem with this Star Trek set, so maybe it's an isolated problem. still, i have not decided whether or not to try another copy of this set. i must repeat, the high definition side of the disc looks incredible on my 55' LCD widescreen TV but I wish Paramount had released the remastered Star Trek on single sided HD-DVD discs (of which I have not had a problem with my other HD-DVD movies).	3.0	HD is stunning but discs freeze	2007-12-01	6	4	2

The new improves are well done and very beautiful. There are only two flaws that I could find with this DVD. One thing is that the discs are double-sided, and the other being there doesn't seem to be a scene selection menu on the DVD. Since HD-DVD is worthless and not used much, it being two sided makes this hard to handle and easy to get dirty. It would have been better to have had one side be the original version of the series, and the other side be the remastered version. Oh well, no one knew the outcome of the Bluray and HD battle then.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	ATJLR5VAS2QE5	Garrett Aja	"Even to the millions who dislike it (and the media that seems to love making fans look like losers whenever a convention comes to town), Star Trek is an unavoidable icon of popular culture, surpassed perhaps only by Star Wars, Mickey Mouse, and Bugs Bunny. Its technology (tricorders, communicators, and even the beds in sickbay) have become science fact over the years, with much of the rest of Star Trek's devices poised to someday join that select group of now-real items. Episode plots (""Mirror, Mirror"", for one) and quotes (""He's dead, Jim."") are part of the lexicon of the world.So, now, finally, we see the original series arrive on DVD in season set form (with its sequel series, the widely underrated Filmation animated series, waiting in the wings for a 2005 DVD release). Thanks to the prior DVD release and the Sci-Fi Channel reruns, the series has already been restored to a pristine state (though the processing methods used in effects shots would imply otherwise). A strong Dolby 5.1 soundtrack and a number of special features round out the meat of the set.For the uninitiated, Season 1 includes a number of classic episodes, as well as a number of ""firsts"". The big lure, of course, is ""City on the Edge of Forever"", undeniably the series' best episode (and quite possibly the most controversial episode of all the Treks, as well, thanks to the changes made to the original script in order for it to reach broadcast), ""Arena"" (which features the famous Gorn, a big 'n nasty lizard), ""The Menagerie"" (the famed two-part episode), ""Dagger of the Mind"" (the first episode featuring the Vulcan Mind Meld, and also subject to a parody/retelling on South Park a few years back), ""The Enemy Within"" (the ""evil Kirk"" episode, and the birthplace of the Vulcan Nerve Pinch and ""He's dead, Jim"" line), ""The Naked Time"", ""This Side of Paradise"", and ""Space Seed"", the now-infamous episode featuring Ricardo Montalban as Khan. (And I've left a few out, too.)Of course, the series is now considered extremely cheesy, particularly the dated (but still serviceable) special effects. However, this show is still very smart, even some 40 years later. And, as stated before, these episodes (and many of the moments therein) are *extremely* famous. However, there are still no episode commentaries, save for a handful of text commentaries by Michael and Denise Okuda (the de facto continuity gods of the Star Trek universe). Also, the effects shots still look, and will always look like utter garbage due to the filming techniques used, with lots of dirt, scratches, and grain. Others will decry Paramount's blatant ""double dipping"", the price and the rather shallow special features, but there's little doubt that this set is worth every penny."	5.0	An absolute must-buy	2004-09-02	11	9	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3JBTOZ67XG5M9	GDH	Amazon is the best for bringing this classic television show to Amazon Prime! I love the original Star Trek series because of how it shaped both the sci fi genre and our society. Space theatre in the future was the perfect setting for creating a world in which all races and nationalities were considered equal and working together. Written and produced at a time when our country did not have the same vision for its future. However, Star Trek made people think twice about race relations as well as other social and humanitarian problems of the late 60's. Capt Kirk was not only a decisive and fearless leader, but he was well versed in the planet Earth's classical thinkers and writers, often referring to their works for diplomatic guidance. The special effects are a little frozen in the time capsule here doing the best they could at the time; however, cell phones and automatic doors are just two of the inventions that we use on a daily basis. There are many other inventions inspired by this television show. NASA was even inspired by the show to create the Space Shuttle vehicle in which astronauts could travel into space for longer missions and reuse the same vehicles for multiple missions. My father and grandfather introduced me to Star Trek and I plan to do the same for my children so that this show can continue to live on for many generations as a reminder of our societies progress based on someone else's vision. I hope Amazon keeps this show in their library so many more people can experience it!	5.0	Sci-Fi Classic but a great show written for television regardless of the setting!	2013-07-22	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A14C7CCKL5TJRK	"General Disarray ""_0"""	"Original Star Trek in a beautiful transfer, what else could you want? I have not bought any Star Trek DVDs before, and I am very happy with getting these excellent Blu-rays discs. And of course the first season is classic creative television. It's been a long time since I've seen these all, and unedited no less.People ask if the 60s TV shows are really ""hi-def""? The transfer from the original film is definitely better than standard TV, the colors are beautiful, but the camera focus is not really 1080p sharp. It is actually good that the film focus is not that sharp, I don't think it ruins the illusion of the makeup and props that much. I have a 42"" LCD 1080p.Extras are okay, but the shows are what counts. Would have been good if they had the original ""The Cage"" episode, and if they had lots of extras concerning the two pilots and the early shows and how the show evolved and outtakes, that would have been interesting.Now what surprises me is how people like the redone special effects so much. The new visuals are a very mixed bag. The new visual effects are sometimes done very subtle and follow the spirit of the original visuals, but other times they are basically re-imagining and trying to improve the original. Sometimes the new visual effects stick out and look way out of place, way too digital looking. The new planets do look good most of the time. Some of the shots of the ship are good, while other shots seem way too video game-ish and seem inappropiate.The galactic barrier in ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" has been changed to something much less dramatic with different camera angles, and the shuttlecraft space shots in ""Galileo Seven"" have been changed totally. They should not change the original visuals that much 40 years after the fact, they do not have the same dramatic effect, they do not look constistant with the source material of the original creators, and quite frankly the two examples I give look ""modern"" but second rate, like scenes from a lame video game. On the good side the updated space visuals in ""Balance of Terror"" at least try to be more faithful to the original visuals, and they fit in better. The updated visuals should have been more faithful to the original visuals artistic vision. Remaster and clean up maybe, maybe imitate, but change and ""improve"" by some hacks 40 years later so it looks updated? No! There should have been some restraint. I am glad they have the original visuals on this set also."	5.0	Excellent transfers of classic unedited Star Trek. You can watch the original visuals effects	2009-05-02	7	6	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AI3S4S9UHBYUY	George Megenney	There is no question that this blu-ray set is thus far the best looking and best sounding home video release of the Original Series. The picture quality is superior to the original DVD release issued about ten years ago. And it is superior to the season sets issued a few years ago. The supplemental materials are superb as well. But in my opinion what steals the show is the viewers ability to watch either the original versions of the episodes or the enhanced versions with modern CGI effects. For the purists who insist that this is somehow an insult to the creators, I politely disagree. The improved effects only make the show shine even more brightly. Indeed, the set contains a documentary in which surviving creators of the show explain that the new effects are what they would have done had they had access to the technology. At $65 this collection is a steal. My only problem is what to do with my older season sets? Perhaps I'll donate them to a needy friend!	5.0	Star Trek The Original Series Season 1 Blu-Ray	2009-05-25	0	0	0

True classic Trek lovers get a little nervous when you start messin' with their old 60's episodes. Had to admit I was a little skeptical when I first heard about the ""Remasterd"" version. The imrovements are really only noticeable where the improvements were desperately needed. Such as exterior ship scenes where the Enterprise orbits a planet, or better yet when the Shuttlecraft take off from the hanger deck at the ship's rear. There is even a bit more exterior space scene elaboration of the Enterprise or other ships...such as the ""Doomsday Machine"" episode from season 2. An example of their ""elaboration"" is added cooler shots of the Captain Matt Decker's battle-damaged star ship, which brings home the point better that the Doomsday Machine is one bad dude. You'll even notice some cooler, more colorful graphics on the bridge viewing screens right about where Spock and Ulhura's bridge stations are. These are all areas where the origional 60's series needed ""some help"" from 21st century movie technology. But the movie technos didn't go overboard...they were subtle about their remastering and as a result did not destory the classic integrity of the series.

The insert with content details is a nice touch.Great quality; a bit of a pain as they are not in the order of broadcast. This $35-55 range is fairly reasonable.  But just how many times are they going to release this series?  This is as bad as the Twilight Zone!	4.0	Which set should you buy?  Try rolling the dice!	2008-04-26	1	1	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2309FTHZ5QM1T	Glenn Porter	"ST-TOS Remastered is magnificent!  The images are cleaner than when the programs were first broadcast-I was there.  It sounds better, it looks better, and with great CGI effects, these programs are so much better than ever before.I don't have an HD-DVD player or HD monitor yet, but the SD content is stunning.  I'm way more likely to go HD soon because of what the other side of each of these discs offer.  Clear, rich colors, crisp sound and a squeaky-clean digital transfer make these episodes vibrant and fresh.  The re-imagined effects add depth and impact; no more ""flashing light indicating some alien space ship"", no more muddy, fuzzy animated phaser beams, no more ""we only have 15 stock shots of the Enterprise.""  Instead of what have been called ""cheesy"" effects by people brought up on Star Wars (or even 2001) and other very high budget theatrical productions, current state of the art computer animation, from exterior shots of ships to displays and phaser beams make the remastered TOS episodes as current and fresh as tomorrow's Battlestar Galactica episode.For anyone who's skipped Star Trek because they thought it was lame, keep in mind that the original series was produced for a pittance-and still won awards.  Keep in mind that it tackled serious social issues at a time when television was the purest of escapism.  And keep in mind that if it weren't for the original series we probably wouldn't have Stargate, BSG, Buffy, or really any other science fiction or fantasy series on television.  Take a look at what Star Trek should have looked like in 1966 and 67, and see why it built such a huge fan base.  Enjoy!"	5.0	Remastered and Stunning	2008-02-08	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AVUAK0N5NI9X2	Global Warming	"I am a devout Trekker, I came of age during the time that the original series aired. I found it childish and I had no interest in watching it. However, Gene Roddenberry's vision inspired me, I had the feeling that better things were on the way. I was right, the Next Generation series was proof that his vision was alive. Further proof was provided by Deep Space Nine and Voyager.The fetus, the original series, was simply an absurd ""William Shatner Show"", the acting was ludicrous and Shatner's overweight and over acting destroyed the essence Roddenberry intended.The Star Trek legend was born when Patrick Stewart and company came on TV in 1987. Before TNG, Star Trek was childs play and nothing more. No exploration of characters was possible with Shatner's vanity, he ruined the original series. Majel Roddenberry said that and I agree with her."	1.0	CHILDISH and INFERIOR	2005-01-28	90	4	86

I merely state that it is wrong."" - Spock suggests the computer has been tampered with, but by whom? The computer diagnostic results show no error. Can Spock speculate? Shaw is correct is objecting to Spock's speculation. Spock lacks factual proof to conclude circumstantial evidence is conclusive evidence.

It's finally here and I am not disappointed at all with this product.  The casing is awesome. It's thick and durable and well designed. It opens from the top with a hinge on the bottom. The DVD's are in a separate plastic cd holder inside in book format that lets you flip through them easily and quickly to select the discs you want to watch. The video quality on these is crisp and clear and the sound is awesome... Dolby 5.1 folks!!! The bass has low frequency booms, the red alert comes out of the back speakers, echoes and aliens are thrown to various speakers. Computer sounds, explosions, and ship combat is like you've never heard before. :) If you love the old series, you will come to love it more with the remastered video, sound, and music. Why is the casing yellow for the first season? Because the Star Trek titles were yellow during season one. The season two casing is blue because the star trek titles were blue in season two. Not sure about red yet for season three, but probably just a pick they did since season three was in blue titles also. The set comes with a pamphlet outlining each episode and some other paragraphs containing history and encyclopedic information about the Star Trek universe.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2MGUMM3MW6PC7	"gregoratl ""gregoratl"""	"Landmark television.When StarTrek first aired in September 1966, no one had any idea of the social legacy it would come to represent in the decades to come.  Gene Roddenberry's brave conception of playing out humanity's struggles onto a metaphorical spaceship was deviously bold.  In fact, Roddenberry's brilliance probably was not realized until it was tweaked with the film StarTrek IV and The Next Generation series.StarTrek possessed a social conscience disguised as entertainment.  A woman of color was on the bridge, the ""Prime Directive"" was the rule, and good superceded evil.  Meanwhile, back on 1966 Earth, Dr. King risked his life to advance the definition of ""freedom,"" youth began to seriously question authority, and two nuclear superpowers threatened each other with an expensive and anxious Cold War.Despite its low-budget production, Roddenberry and his rainbow coalition of actors make up for in substance what they lacked in props.  Performance excellence comes through in crisp DVD to compensate for otherwise laughable alien-beings portrayed by a person in a zip-up costume.  Along with StarTrek's creative genious, the original, primary cast must be credited with the successful nearly four-decade StarTrek franchise.The eight-disc set is a long-awaited tribute and record of StarTrek's maiden season.  The interactive menus are clever and even offer a very quaint original television preview of each episode.  Yes, the episodes are in the order in which they originally aired but are clearly marked in case the viewer chooses to watch in chronological order.  This reviewer has subtracted one star for the package design. An outer, yellow plastic case opens like Pac Man to reveal a rather flimsy disc case bound together at one end by a wide piece of scotch tape.Despite the packaging, this DVD set is worth the price considering the number of entertainment hours it contains.  Even the most lukewarm StarTrek fan can appreciate this DVD set because it represents one of television's most bold programing moves that sadly seem non-existent today."	4.0	Boldly Went Where TV Had Not Gone Before	2004-09-02	9	6	3

Nearly forty-five years later, the special effects may look rudimentary, but the plot and the characters are legendary. The acting is superb, led by the triumvirate of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley. Here at last is the first season of the original series 29 episodes in their original broadcast order. That means starting with ""The Man Trap,"" on to many other adventures going boldly where no man has gone before- traveling thru outer space, time or thru a different dimension, confronting Romulans, Klingons, that treacherous Harry Mudd guy, and the unforgettable Ricardo Montalban as Khan among many others.

Although not quite as deep and layered as ""The Cage"", this tele-novella far exceeds even the high standards of the best of the series' subsequent product.  Stellar performances from Sally Kellerman, Gary Lockwood and William Shatner, with Leonard Nimoy very good but still feeling out his role; almost equivalent to the magnificent cameos of Agnes Moorhead, Carol Burnett and Joan Crawford in the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Night Gallery, respectively.  Also pristine production values with the original pilot sets, livery and saturated colors before network money was poured in for the original series renovation.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AEV640MKB3I9J	Hank Drake	"I reviewed most of The Original Series episodes during the initial DVD release which began in 1999.  So, the comments here focus on the new edition.I don't have an HD player or TV, but even at standard definition, the picture has never looked better.  The colors pop off the screen, scratches have been removed, and grain, while noticeable, has been reduced to a bare minimum.  Seeing the new remastering alters one's perceptions of the series.  I had never noticed the tear streaming down the crippled Captain Pike's cheek as Spock reveals his plan in ""The Menagerie.""  Unfortunately, with the improved picture, flaws in the original production are also more noticeable: shadows from boom microphones are detectable, zippers can be clearly seen in many of the uniforms, and a certain hairpiece has never been more obvious.  Still, the picture shows the obvious care taken with the lighting and composition (very different from today's flatly-lit, smash & grab style of television filming).Of course, the primary focus of this new release is the new CGI visual effects.  Most of the new space shots are very convincing, remaining in the original spirit of the series.  Only a few of the shots are major deviations from the originals, such as when satellites are launched from the Enterprise in ""Operation: Annihilate,"" or the addition of a previously unseen ship in ""Arena.""  Restraint seems to be the watchword here.  There was an earlier Enterprise model which was used for a few episodes, including ""Miri,"" and these shots are not as successful as those using a later model.  But as the episodes progress, the quality generally improves.  I would have liked to have seen a little bit more done, such as the replacement of some very dated viewing screen graphics in ""Where No Man has Gone Before"" and ""Balance of Terror.""  The enhanced matte paintings of Starbase 11and Eminiar 7 are simply stunning.There are a number of errors.  The opening credits of ""Where No Man has Gone Before"" contain Kirk's opening monologue (""Space, the Final Frontier"") which was not heard in the original broadcast episode and home video versions, and the sound mix for ""The Menagerie"" is botched, with music from Season Two tacked on, and the Talosian singing plants incorrectly channeled.The discs also include audio tracks in Spanish and French, although my partner (fluent in Spanish) tells me many of the Spanish translations are not faithful to the English originals.Bring on Season Two!"	4.0	Video 5 stars, Audio 3 stars	2007-11-23	64	54	10
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AS4090AMV107O	"Happee the Clown ""Happee the Clown"""	"I just bought the last of those beautifully planned 2 episode Star Trek DVDs. Could my timing be any better? I can't believe they are now putting out a full season one box set. I literally built a DVD shelf out of some old timber I had from the shed just so I could have some room for all these 2 episode Star Trek DVDs and now they come out with a nicely compacted full season of Star Trek. Yes, I have put in an order for this box set, but while I have been waiting, I have slipped into a state of depression. Don't worry, I called my doctor and help was on the way. I started on the antidepressant Celexa, but that made me vomit a lot and then I tried Lexapro, but that caused severe internal bleeding. Currently, I am on a combination of Wellbutrin (working fine so far, fingers crossed) and Zanaflex, which is a muscle relaxer, I can't even grab my Star Trek DVDs anymore without getting angry).I envy the majority of you Star Trek fans out there who can actually go on with their lives knowing they will have both a complete box set as well as several 2 episode DVDs, even though they overlap. For me, I cannot cope and function properly in life knowing that I will now have ""duplication"" and ""overlaptation"" in my Star Trek collection. If it wasn't for the Wellbutrin, I would be in such a frenzy right now, that I couldn't even be able to write this. I just wished that Paramount put this box set out instead of the other 2 episode DVDs so I wouldn't have to go on feeling like this."	1.0	What have you done to me?	2004-08-26	46	20	26

I'm also a first time buyer.This bluray is beautiful. It's almost too good. As we were watching it,we could see the shadow of a boom mike in the background. Also the holes in the lenes of ""Gary Mitchell"" along with some other things.My 16 year old son who loves all the Star trek series, thought the special effects were lame. I had to remind him that it was filmed in 1966-67, and was a very low budget series.I'm very pleased with it. I even don't mind the 4:3 format. It was filmed that way,so there is no distortion by streching it.It enhanced effects do not distract from the story, it makes it better. No more shaky ship circling around a blue, red or green blob.All the colors pop.I even noticed Spock had a slightly green tint to his face in the ""Where no man has gone before"" episode. You can watch it in it's orginal format as well. I like the new effect.It seems as though the episodes are out of order. There is a small problem with the audio.I have to turn up the volume on the dolby 7.1 to be able to hear the dialogue.The stereo 2.0 seems better.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1VQ0MEEFZ8ELK	Henry VIII freak	"I got this for Christmas last year and have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it.  After watching all the spin-off series it's always awesome to go back to go back to the beginning and see where it all began, which would be here.  All in all, a solid season with some memorable episodes but the second seaon was better.Pilot: ""The Cage"" I only saw it once but it was obviously solid enough to start the show on a network.  Kinda weird because they hadn't figured everything out yet. i.e. Spock smiles o.O  Plus, it wasn't Captain Kirk, but his predecessor Captain Pike. 3 starsStardate 1513.1 ""The Man Trap"" Not the best episdoe ever, but as it was the first one ever aired.  It actually gave Dr. McCoy a lot more development than almost every episode since. 2 starsStardate 1533.6 ""Charlie X"" I never saw it, my dad made us skip because it was supposedly awful. N/AStardate 1312.4 ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" The second pilot for the show...slightly more normal than the first and a fairly good episode with an unusual idea. 3 starsStardate 1704.2 ""The Naked Time"" Always one of my favorites.  A lot of character development, but all in all, fairly predictible. 3 starsStardate 1672.1 ""The Evil Within"" Also and intersting idea, and although Kirk was the center of this episode, it was here where we first hear about Spock's mixed parentage, which would become so important throughout the rest of the series. 3 starsStardate 1329.1 ""Mudd's Women"" One of the most fanous episodes of the whole series, it ontroduces us to the series only recurring character,  Harry Mudd.  fairly intersting but his second episode was better. 3 starsStardate 2712.4 ""What are Little Girls Made Of?"" Develops the character of Nurse Chapel, which is important but coudl have been better. 2 starsStardate 2713.5 ""Miri"" This was a good episode and demonstrates why Star Trek became famous.  It had an extremely interesting idea with 100-year-old children and shows the bond Kirk had with his crew. 4 starsStardate 2715.1 ""Dagger of the Mind"" Shows a lot about the way things were done in the 23rd century and, of course, Kirk's reputationa s a ladies' man. 3 stars.Stardate 1512.2 ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" Not one of my favorites, but the alien at the end is played by Ron Howard's brother. 2 starsStardate 3012.4 and 3013.1 ""The Menagerie Parts I + II"" Uses a lot of footage from the pilot, but also shows a great deal of the friendship between Kirk and Spock. A memorable epsiode (only Spock could find the only crime in the 23rd century that could give them death penalty) and the series' only 2-parter. 4 starsStardate 2817.6 "" The Consience of the King"" A lot fo Captain Kirk's history in here. 2 starsStardate 1709.2 'Balance of Terror"" The first episode that features the Romulans, and an excellent one.  Great battle scenes, and the Romulan commander is the same actor who went one to play Spock's father in the second season, and the only actor to play a Romulan, a Vulcan and a Klingon. 4 starsStardate 3025.3 ""Shore Leave"" An interesting look into the crew's characters. 3 starsStardate 2821.5 ""the Galileo Seven"" One of my favorites, becasue I'm a Spock fan.  A really great look into Spock's character, and the relationship between the starship captains and the Federation staff back on Earth. 4 starsStardate 2124.5 ""The Squire of Gothos"" Also one of my favorites. A really intersting theory and I always saw Trelane as the precursor to TNG's Q, who is my favorite recurring character of all time. 4 starsStardate 3045.6 ""Arena"" one of Star Trek's more interesting ideas, and the Gorn are a memorable species. 3 starsStardate 3113.2 ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" The first time travel centered epsiode, and that continues to be a favorite theme  throughout all the series.  They also dealt with the time travel paradox very well, and the little green men from Mars and Capt. Christopher's reaction to Spock was the best part of the episode. 4 starsStardate 2947.3 ""Court Martial"" One of my favorites. I just love law episodes, and the crew really shone in this one. 4 starsStardate 3156.2 ""The Return of the Archons""  An intersting idea, and shows how interplantery missions and first contacts are the most dangerous and delicate operations of the Enterprise. 3 starsStardate 3141.9 ""Space Seed' One of the best episodes of the whole franchise.  Khan is one the best villians ever, and was brought back in the second movie, the best ST movie ever made.  This one is just amazing; there is no describing it. 5 starsStardate 3192.1 ""A Taste of Armageddon"" One the most unusual ideas in ST, and a memorable episodes 4 starsStardate 3417.3 ""This Side of Paradise"" One the most famous epsiodes, and an excellent look at Spock's suppressed emotions (yes. he does have emotions) 4 starsStardate 3196.1 ""The Devil in the Dark One of the most interesting ideas of the whole series...an alien that is based on silicon.  Also deals with the nature of good and evil.  4 starsStardate 3198.4 ""Errand of Mercy"" Fairly interesting, and it's always cool to see the Klingons, but they were better in the Trouble with Tribbles 3 starsStardate 3087.6 ""The Alternative Factor"" Possibly the worst episode of the whole series...could have been an interesting idea but jst failed miserably. 1 starStardate 3134.0 ""They City on the Edge of Forever"" THE BEST EPISODE OF TOS and one of the best in ST history.  Just phenomonal. ST at it's best. 5 starsStardate 3287.2 ""Operation: Annihilate1"" A favorite, centered around bonds of friendship and family.  Acted very well, and is a fitting end to the 1st season. 4 starsA good season and a great start to an even better universe. Note to Paramount: Ridiculously overpriced, stop taking advantage of ST fans!"	4.0	This is where it all began....	2005-07-21	7	3	4

It actually has some super creative storylines and themes each episode.  Almost every episode sees the captain Kirk and Mr. Spock tackling some very dramatic moral issues we don't see dealt with a lot today.  Of course, as it was made in the 1960's, the special effects are antiquated.  However, if you can appreciate how great they were at the time, it is wonderful.	4.0	Classic	2013-08-24	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1Q0QJZXQMJ5W0	"Home Gamer ""Cash Playa"""	"Make no mistake about it.  This is exactly what Star Trek fans, like myself, have been waiting for.The Star Trek phenomenon speaks for itself.  The offspring of the original show--the movies and the series--have been able to keep pace with effects technology. But, the original Star Trek had become an embarrassment.But, now, that's all changed.  Every old effect is gone.  They have been completely replaced, including the opening credits (with a newly recorded theme, to boot).This replacement has not ""butchered"" the series, as one reviewer complained.Nor do the new effects need to be compared to the effects of other Star Trek shows.The fear of re-vamping the old effects to modern standards was whether they would stand out too much compared to the rest of the show.  And that is why the new effects are a happy compromise between today and yesterday. The crew at Paramount has done an amazing job of modernizing all the effects, while staying loyal to the original look.  The effects are not so modern as to make them look out of place, yet they do not look old or cheesy.  There are no longer any ""stock"" shots of the Enterprise, that are recycled from episode to episode. There are new points of view of the Enterprise, and I get a much better sense of how large the ship actually is.  And there are plenty of surprising effects that were never in the original show.  It is, quite simply, breath-taking.In 40 years, I have watched every episode countless times.  But never have I been so excited to watch them as I do now.Besides the new effects, the entire look of the show has been restored--frame by frame.  Scratches, blemishes, skin tones, and lighting contrast have all been fixed.Along with the space shots, there are marvelous enhancements to city scapes, planet surfaces, and even Sulu's chronometer is no longer made of those stupid-looking plastic wheels.No, the sound is not perfect, but it's better than what it used to be.Yes, the packaging is horrible.  My set was broken when it arrived.  But I don't care.Yes, it's a bit too expensive and will probably come down in price eventually.  But I don't care.I have what I have always wanted...Star Trek the way it should be, the way it always deserved to be.It is obvious that this restoration was done with love and reverence.Sure, Paramount is going to make money for this. But they deserve it.And, as a fan of Star Trek, you deserve to see the show the way it was intended.You can now let your kids see the show without being too embarrassed.  After all, there are still the same charming foibles to see:  the sets, the costumes, and some rather silly episodes.If you love Star Trek as much as I do--and I know you do or you wouldn't be reading this--then purchase this DVD set and go where you have always wanted to go before!"	5.0	40 Years Overdue	2007-12-18	14	11	3

If NBC had the data that it has today concerning viewership of a program ST:TOS would have been on for 10 years or more.  ST:TOS was a revolution in TV and SF.  It was positive and it was a way of saying we would overcome the petty little things that are flumoxxing the leaders of this world and we would survive to reach the 23rd Century.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A37R48TO3N9U0Y	"Jake ""JakeSpider@hotmail.com"""	"Amazing that after 40 years Star Trek is just as fresh and interesting as if it were made yesterday.  Most shows from that era look silly now because they portrayed people unrealistically.  I love the way Captain Kirk snaps orders confidently and how Spock assesses situations and advises.  When faced with my own problems through life, I have often imagined what advice Spock would be giving me.  In the special features, much discussion exists about how tight the budget was.  A low budget actually turned out to be a blessing, because instead of expensive and boring special effects, the stories and acting had to be strong, giving the series a high degree of replay ability.  The scarcity and simple appearance of the furnishings and equipment aboard the Enterprise effectively add futuristic aura.  Future man has no need for clutter or complex appearing machinery.While trying to read objective reviews of this new and exciting DVD set, I came upon endless irrelevant and erroneous complaints.  Pay no attention to the whiners who have complained about the packaging or the order in which the episodes appear.  The packaging is unique, and not the problem some here has said it is.  The presentation order is the same as the airing order, or as Spock would say, the logical order.  The episodes are also numbered for the anal folks who are bothered by some personnel switches and want to watch them in their production order.  Others have unjustly opined that the pilot episode, ""The Cage,"" was not included.  These folks need to check their facts.  This odd non-episode was crude and never aired.  Instead it was incorporated into the 2-hour episode called ""The Menagerie"", which is included in this set, greatly improving the pilot and worked it into what we know as ""Star Trek"".  Also disregard the fools who complain about the special features.  Remember the show is 40 years old and had a tight budget to begin with.  Nobody is going to spend millions of bucks creating a bunch of worthless featurettes now that the cast and crew have been spread to the four winds.  For me, the purpose of owning this set is to be able to watch the 29 episodes without commercials and in uncut form, as often as I like.  The studio additionally has provided Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, which sounds nice, and a clear picture, making the series even better.  The human-interest feature about Shatner and his horses is precious.  I may not be as interested in some other special feature articles, but I can ignore them and won't complain that I don't like them.  The DVD set would not be cheaper without them.I look forward to season two!"	5.0	Star Trek:  One of the Best Shows Ever!	2004-10-23	28	22	6

I grew up watching these episodes as they were released and later in rerun and it has been a pleasure to watch them again. While originally skeptical of the remastering process, I found it has improved on the original episodes since much of the remastering process involved the updating of the special effects graphics.Additionally, I've been reminded of just how good these original Star Trek episodes really were: It's no accident that Star Trek has been in rerun ever since they were first made. I'm looking forward to watching seasons two and three of the original Star Trek series in the near future.Thanks to Amazon for making these available to Prime members.	5.0	Great Classic	2014-03-25	0	0	0

The bonus features could have been a little better thou, I was expecting a bit more behind the scenes stuff with the HD aspect giving more room for additional material.

Although the original is dated and suffers from the gender bias norms of its time, this series offers an interesting an entertaining view into the human condition. How do we react when confronted with strangers? How do we determine who's friend and who's foe? How do we treat others who neither look or act like we do?  Of course there's plenty of silliness but that's what makes the challenging aspects fun. A classic that my 13 yr old and I had fun bonding to.	5.0	Life lessons cloaked in camp	2014-07-06	0	0	0

You all are willing to spend $25.00 for a blu ray 2-hour movie, but not $80.00 for 29 hours of blu ray remastered and retooled sesaon 1's Star Trek TOS?  And, they're giving you the original episodes as a bonus, so you can sell your RCS's, Beta's, VHS's, and various incarnations of DVD's.  Come on.  That's not even $12.00 per blu ray DVD.  It's like half the price of a movie.  Get with it people.  Paramount buthers everyone of their TV DVD releases.  At least thank them for this.	5.0	too expensive?  no way	2009-03-30	91	69	22

By then, hopefull they will have all three seasons out on Blu-ray.The other thing I wanted to point out is that many episodes of Star Trek used a blurring lens on them for a ""romantic"" look.  I doubt very much that sharpness will be any different than the last set on standard def. However, the color gamut and clean up of the negative should have a huge impact now that it's on hi-def.I own the last 3 color DVD set.  They are the last remastered version that's unadulterated.

I'm not sold on the special effects as yet. I think there's something so special about the original effects because it was done with real models and there is an artistic-ness in that alone. Thankfully both versions are available which makes this set worth buying.I am very disappointed in the sound level of these episodes. I have to turn my volume up to max on my TV to hear them the way I'm used to watching movies. I don't know what's going on. The preview for the new Star Trek movie sound is loud and great but the playing the episodes sound is way too weak. Switching back to the original episodes soundtrack helps but not that much.

TOS was actually filmed and then transferred to video tape, so when they remastered the series, they were able to go back to the film source. As a result, the picture looks nearly as good as any dvd movie. Much better in fact than any of the more recent star trek series which were video taped. One draw back to this is that you can see how cheesy the control panels on the ship are.	5.0	I had forgotten how good this season was	2006-08-30	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1SNEPDBTSWYTE	J. Duska	This is a review of a single episode, &#34;The Naked Time&#34;, from season 1.*****THIS REVIEW IS JUST FULL OF PLOT SPOILERS, FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.*****I want to start with disclaimers.  One, I'm a TOS fan from way back in the '70s, when I was a kid, probably ten or twelve years old or so.  I have some of the eps on DVD, but not all.  Though I am a viewer and I do like the show overall, I am not just simply in love love love with everything Trek just because it's Trek.  I think that the quality of the show is up and down -- they did good shows and they did bad ones.  So no, I'm not a Trek hater, but neither am I just simply smitten with all things Trek.Two, I write a less-than-glowing review of this episode because a) I think the world of Trek viewer reviews needs more contrary opinions and no more adulatory ones, and b) the story in this episode has so many things wrong with it I'd need Spock's help counting them.The story starts with, and revolves around, what is in my opinion the  whopper of the hour, a plot point which requires that the audience buy into a huge conceit: that Joe Tormolen, a trained officer, in the ship's Sciences Division mind you, violates hazardous materials (hazmat) protocols to scratch his nose.  I submit that the suits Tormolen and Spock are wearing during their landing are hazmat suits, for if they were to dress only for low temperatures, warm coats would do (I live in Buffalo, NY -- we know from cold and even we go out in it without  hats).  Also, it's obviously not very cold on planet Psi 2000, because Tormolen leaves the glove off and keeps working.  Without flinching, he even touches objects which have been long exposed to the conditions there.  In Buffalo in January, if you touch a piece of metal that's been outside for more than a few minutes, you know it, and you don't maintain direct contact with it if you don't really have to.  Tormolen leaves his hand on the furniture and machinery with no evident discomfort; it's plainly just not all that cold there.  So the landing party's suits aren't just for warmth, those have to be hazmat suits, and thus, Spock and Tormolen are under hazmat protocols.  This is borne out by the decontamination procedure on the transporter platform when the landing party beams back.From the production point of view, what kind of hazmat suits are those anyway?  They have loose hoods which enable a doofus like Tormolen to just reach up inside and scratch his nose.  The only reason I can think of for this costume design is so that the character can do this and set the story in motion.  Without Tormolen stupidly infecting himself with a careless scratch, there's no story.Of course when I first saw this episode when I was a small boy these things never crossed my mind, I just liked the ep because I thought Lieutenant Riley was funny.  It was only as an adult that I suddenly realized on one viewing, &#34;Wait a minute, are you kidding me?  Tormolen just takes off a glove of what is supposed to be a protective suit, scratches his nose under his protective suit, leaves the protective glove off and starts touching things, then scratches his nose again?&#34;  What happens afterward is exactly, precisely WHY people are trained in hazmat procedures -- to prevent a story like this from happening.  For a viewer to buy into Joe Tormolen's mistake is a great big giant huge enormous buy, and I don't buy it at all.  One of the show's producers, John D. F. Black, wrote this episode, and he shows a plain disregard for sense.  He decided he wanted to do a script about a disease infecting the crew and came up with a half-baked explanation for it.This is bad storytelling.  A story and its plot are two different things.  A story is a collection of events, told one-after-another.  A plot shows why these events must occur in the sequence they do.  The story is the events, the plot is what connects them in a cause-and-effect chain, moving the story forward.  This is because the universe works as events being causes for later events; it is a cause-and-effect universe.  Black wants us to believe in an unbelievable action as the cause for the entire rest of the story.  Without this huge buy, the rest of the story falls apart; this is the weak link in the chain.That's the biggest problem with this story, but there are other errors.Tormolen threatens Sulu and Riley with a butter knife, then stabs himself with it.  I'm no expert in these sorts of things, but it seems to me he'd need a sledgehammer to drive that thing through skin and muscle (which he obviously must have done, or would not require surgery later).  I can't imagine anyone really being able to do themselves serious abdominal injury with a butter knife.  Why then are Sulu and Riley so threatened by it?  Once again, these are military men; they've been through basic training.  Two of them should be able to easily overpower and disarm a butter-knife-wielding man, yet they stand off, wary of a weapon barely more threatening than a spoon (the only other implement on Tormolen's food tray, by the way -- what food is it that requires the use of a spoon and a knife but no fork?  For that matter, how does one use these two implements together, how would that work?  Alternately, how would one eat with a knife but no fork?  How would the cutting of food [with a butter knife, I remind] work without a fork?  Just askin'.). Butter-knife-as-weapon is the second big buy and I don't buy it either.  There is, in other words, no good reason for Tormolen to die because there's no good, plausible reason why he should be able to inflict a serious injury on himself that way.  Again, with no good cause there's no good reason for the effect.  The plot thins.  Black wrote Tormolen's death into the script because he wanted him out of the way, but we again see disregard for cause-and-effect reasoning.  This is a story without a plot.By the way, there's also the matter of the spray hypo: during surgery on the dying Tormolen, McCoy asks for a hypo without saying what should be in it.  Nurse Chapel hands over a hypo with which McCoy then injects his dying patient.  Then Tormolen dies.  Assuming Tormolen should even be on the table in the first place, it looks like McCoy killed Tormolen through incompetence.  Just a thought.There are other, smaller defects n this story.Kirk orders all personnel who come in contact with Sulu and Riley to be medically checked -- for something McCoy hasn't figured out how to spot yet.  With a dangerous unidentified sickness spreading among the crew, why does Kirk not already have the ship under some kind of isolation protocol to try to keep the infection from spreading?  Kirk, Spock and McCoy are all shown to be incompetent here; by now, someone (probably Kirk) should have ordered isolation procedures. It isn't until much later that Spock, not Kirk, orders &#34;Alert Baker Two&#34;. He then mentions that they are &#34;sealed off&#34; and suggests this may &#34;minimize the spread of whatever this is&#34;.  I'm glad someone thought of it.  Eventually.Riley got into the engine room by running in and telling the engineers Kirk wanted them on the bridge, then locked the door behind them as they left.  The entire engine-room crew, to a man, including Chief Engineer Scott, ALL left the engine room, during a crisis, because a navigator told them Kirk wanted them -- the entire engine room crew -- on the bridge.  And they left a navigator in sole control of the engine room.  During a crisis.  Dumbest.  Engineers.  Ever.The forced-matter implosion is deus ex machina -- it is never mentioned, never established beforehand, but is suddenly brought out with mere minutes to go.  &#34;Sure is a good thing you had that anti-head-chopping ray, Flash.  Otherwise we'd all be dead right now.&#34;With less than fourteen minutes remaining before the ship will crash into the planet, McCoy is still running tests on Sulu to try to figure out what's wrong with the crew -- McCoy still has no idea what the disease is or how it's transmitted, yet before the fourteen-minute deadline is up, he has a working serum literally in hand to treat it.  Another deus ex machina.With mere minutes of life remaining, Spock spends precious time walking, not even running, just to tell Scott to hurry up, instead of using a communicator or wall-mounted comm panel.  Dumbest. Exec. Ever.As they leave the briefing room Spock says to Scott that he'll call in the intermix formula from the bridge.  Then Spock is shown in the Engine Room with Scott anyway.  Why'd Black bother establishing that Spock would go to the bridge, then show him in the engine room?  He wasn't even paying attention to his own script.There's more, oh, so much more, but I'm getting tired of writing.  This is one of the worst scripts in the series.  Hardly any of it makes any actual sense.On the plus side, Bruce Hyde, as Lieutenant Kevin Riley, makes a bad story watchable.  His delightfully goofy performance never fails to bring a laugh.  If the whole episode were designed around drunken Riley it'd be the funniest hour in the series.  This episode would deserve one star, or maybe two, but Hyde's performance brings it up.I think it's hilarious when Sulu calls Uhura a fair maiden and she says &#8220;Sorry, neither.&#8221;  It's one of the best lines in the whole series.Nimoy's not a good crier.  It looks like acting, which is a sin for an actor.  Never get caught acting.Do we need to talk about Shatner?  He ate the briefing room set for a mid-morning snack.All in all, this is a badly written story with one good performance (and not enough of it) in it.In my opinion.  Your mileage may vary.	3.0	"Episode ""The Naked Time"""	2013-11-21	5	0	5

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1MJVF7KU3Y4Y5	"Jean-Yves ""J-Y"""	Hi. The first time I have seen these episodes were on a regular TV in the 70's and in french ! Afterwards, I recorded all of them on TV and bought a few episodes on VHS then DVD. I then bought the HD DVD combo of season 1 months ago. I can still play it on HD DVD as I have a combo player. So after I read it was finally coming out on BD (Blu-ray), I was extremely happy. I have only seen a few minutes of it but I can report it is extremely good. 1) the case compared to HD DVD combo is fantastic now. 2) We can now toggle between enhanced and non-enhanced versions with the angle button. Great ! We have both versions of the show, by the way, even greater ! I personally like the enhanced version better, the special effects are not overwhelming and they look so nice. 3) We have tons of extra stuff on it, PIP features (picture-in-picture) for BD players v.1.1. and it's also BD-Live 2.0. 4) The discs are loading ok in my player and we will not need a firmware update to see this. Thank god ! Paramount/CBS have done it right ! 5) a decent price (80$ cdn), and not in the 140$ cdn range like a few years back ! 6) Sound Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono and DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1. Wow. Can't wait for seasons 2 & 3 coming hopefully this year with the same quality. If Paramount/CBS execs are reading Amazon's reviews, I tell you this: continue on this path and congratulations on this awesome release. My HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS on this BD. Take care all. (ps: my BD player is a Samsung BD-UP5000).	5.0	Star Trek The Original Series Season 1 Ultimate Version	2009-04-30	1	1	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AN0G2CWZJ36YH	Jeffery J. Pimental	I purchased season one of the original series when it was first released on DVD back in 2004 and was very pleased with what I received. When I was watching the trailers at the beginning of J.J. Abrams Star Trek Blu-ray from 2010, I saw the trailer for Star Trek TOS on Blu-ray. I was impressed with the apparent upgrade that the trailer showed. Little did I know how much of an improvement the Blu-ray would be over the standard definition of the 2004 release. At first I was hesitant about the CGI changes to the external shots of the ship, planet and space background, but after watching only one episode, I am convinced that the CGI shots are an improvement over the old shots of the model, planet(s) and background. Admittedly, I hedged for two years because I don't really like the artificialness that CGI is. As long as the technology serves the story I'm fine with it, but to use technology first and put story-telling second is lazy and an insult to the viewer (think Disney's Pirates 2 & 3).I digress.All the changes to the special effects serve to make the Star Trek universe as real as possible. The planets look like actual planets rather than just a planet-like disc with a model moving about it. The biggest change I noticed beyond the altering of the special effects is the picture itself. Instead of the graininess that is so apparent in the Columbia House VHS series and the 2004 DVD version, this high-definition version has been painstakingly remastered from the original film with all the damage and dirt repaired and cleaned, frame by frame into a pristine visual orgasm of its former self. Additionally, the Star Trek theme has been re-recorded using the same orchestral set-up and sheet music that Alexander Courage used back in the 1960s right down to the Soprano singing. I can't wait to get seasons two and three and neither should you.	5.0	Star Trek Season One Blu-ray	2013-11-06	0	0	0

These discs really take advantage of the BD format, with seamless branching (I love switching between the original effects and the new ""enhanced"" effects on the fly!), excellent picture and a dynamite 7.1 DTS HD audio remix. I'm also glad the new BD discs show the enhanced CGI effects in the 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the 16:9 wide-screen aspect the HD-DVDs used; in 4:3 the effects don't seem as jarring as on the HD-DVD presentations and really do ""enhance"" the experience. The BD version also takes advantage of PIP video capabilities to display video commentary tracks on 5 episodes, and uses pop-up graphics for the trivia tracks instead of ""subtitle"" text. I really thought these would be a straight port of the HD-DVD version but CBS/Paramount has done much better than that. I'm looking forward to checking out the new HD special features and now can't wait for Seasons 2 & 3! I hope the feature films come out as good as TOS: Season 1.

The tone of many negative posts seems to center on price vs entertainment value.  The current street price for this 7 BD-50 disc set is $65. That's well under $10/disc.  You receive both video and audio that is easily the best this series has ever looked or sounded.  The option of the CGI and enhanced sound are entertaining, and you can always choose to view the unaltered, original effects versions, which still look great.  The color saturation, facial detail etc is excellent for any program that was fist done in the '60s.  I watched the original broadcasts (I'm old) and the beauty of these BD discs is stunning by comparison.If you own, as I do, DVD versions of Season 1, I suggest there is no comparison to these Blus when viewed on a 1080p screen.  If $65 is too much for this set, then ANY disc, of any entertainment, standard or Blu, is over-priced.This is an excellent product, bargain priced and satisfying in every way. Whether you choose to buy this set, or not, it represents technology advancing the enjoyment of the Star Trek franchise.

It was easy and the quality of the episodes is good.  If you have a wide screen TV, you might not love it, because it keeps it in the &#34;square&#34; shape.

You can see the birth of the Federation as the plot lines develop and they create beloved aliens and and the framework for the Mythos of the Federation.

That was definitly my favorite among them all.. until I started watching the 60s episodes. Shatner is sooo young! and I supposed he was considered Hot back then.

My wait is over! After all these years...I would have given this a 5 star rating. But there are a few things that cut me back to a 3.5. The series itself is 5 stars...don't get me wrong on that. I love this series.Best part, no matter the prices I have seen, this set averages less than $5 per episode. That's a definate great value.But the DVD set here has a few issues for me.The Jewel case the DVDs themsleves rest in is very vulnerable to breakage. I had to return my 1st set to exchange it. I bought mine locally here in town, I could not wait for it in the mail. And for this reason I did not have to go through the time and effort of shipping it back.The next big issue is the horrible William Shatner after Star Trek special feature. UGH! I'd rather see an interview of him speaking OF his Trek Years. I don't care about his personal life and love for horses. This is supposed to be about TREK here.I think each disc should have a ""PLAY ALL"" feature where you can just insert the DVD and play all of the episodes within it.And with this feature there should be an option to play them in ""production sequence"" OR ""Aired Sequence"". But being the aired sequence was so jumbled...you'd have to change discs contantly. Was NBC on crack back then? I feel most Trek fans (like me) would just have rather had the DVD designed in Production sequence instead of the NBC aired sequence.But I am most pleased this is finally available.The wait was well worth it and I am most defiantely not a patient individual.After all these years...

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AL2K9U4ALBKQP	"J. Giles ""kingcrusher"""	One of the things that is the big difference between HD and Blu Ray right now is the price of the movies.  Blu Ray movies are 50% more than normal DVDs while HD is usually around 25% more.  I think this is the only thing that's keeping the race going.The Star trek sereies is great, no doubt, but to charge this much is absurd.  They are alienating those who might be on the hi-def fence by showing them that it's not only a hefty investment in the machines, but that they are going to get taken to the cleaners on the DVDs.Ouch, this is just a slap in the face to not only Star Trek fans (like myself) but a great way to convince people NOT to go Hi Def.These need to be $79 a season for me to even consider them.  I got the original DVDs for $40 a season and love them, and would love to have the new Hi-Def versions... but not at thier asking price.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Joanna Daneman	"The Original Star Trek (referred to as TOS among Trekkies) is long in tooth. I was in HIGH SCHOOL when it was originally aired, so it's now almost a half century old and nowhere near as sophisticated as the popular TNG (Next Generation) with Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard or Deep Space Nine (DS9) which was extraordinarily well-produced and written. But if you are an original Trekkie, the TOS has its moments and it's based on the classic science fiction ""pulp magazine"" writing of the Fifties and some of the writers are actually the luminaries of that age (Robert Bloch, Norman Spinrad, Harlan Ellison, and Theodore Sturgeon.)The scenery was the usual cardboard, plastic wrap, aluminum ducts and styrofoam, with plastic blocks illuminated by light bulbs (in one scene, you can see the incandescent bulbs shining inside what is purported to be a container for a life-force but is a big fiberglass spherical lampshade in reality.) To our sophisticated eyes, it looks dated. And cheap. The rocks are covered by some kind of flocked carpet and along with the fake plants, terribly cheap looking. But the remastered backdrop shots are fantastic. The planets are sharp and detailed, the cityscapes have much more detail and are beautifully rendered. In one planet shot, I was pretty much convinced that the picture was the Amazon basin from the air, as satellite photos and digitally created art were unknown at that time. It looks wonderful in high def.You can also admire the costuming skill. The designers had a fetish for bare backs and gravity-defying bodices that were very amusing. Some don't fit very well (Shahna's bodice in ""Gamesters of Triskelion"" looks ready to fall off at any moment as does Droxine's (The Cloud Minders.) But that may be some of the attraction for the male viewers. Will it, won't it?The acting is full of Shatner's tendency to chew the scenery, and the first few shows have Spock barking orders as if he's on a clipper ship, not a space ship. They get over this pretty quickly, and the first season is actually possibly the BEST season, which goes against the newer formula of Star Treks pretty much being awful until after the THIRD season. It's also nice to admire in higher def how handsome Shatner was in his salad days. And you can also admire the acting skill of DeForest Kelley, who I think was under-appreciated.These are welcome remastered classics and fun to watch if you love older science fiction and Star Trek. For those born in the Nineties, this will seem as corny as the Dr. Whos with Tom Baker. But retro is also cool these days.**I'm reviewing the instant download (not a DVD) fyi."	5.0	Remastered classic is fun to watch	2013-11-27	1	1	0

The audio isn't the greatest and on most systems apparently the ""TrueHD"" audio track is far too quiet (even with my receiver cranked to maximum volume) but it sounds good on the 2 channel audio option.It's funny how some of the ship sets looked like ""toys"" on TV broadcasts but actually look better now that you can see the detail and clarity of some of those colored buttons.Certainly the cheap sets (textures and painted foam or cardboard or whatever) are still there.  But they are enjoyable with a new life due to the enhanced clarity of HD.At a $100 price I find HD Star Trek a good value (and who knows, soon you may be able to get it even cheaper as HD-DVDs get discounted further).Definitely check the firmware version of your player, the audio seems a lot more stable after updating the firmware."	4.0	A fresh view of great old material	2008-03-02	1	1	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"The first season of ""Star Trek"" wasn't nearly as bad as many - including some other reviewers here - have remarked. Indeed, it was far better than the first seasons of its successors, most notably ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and ""Star Trek: Enterprise"". And unlike these series, the original ""Star Trek"" was blessed with having the talents of notable Science Fiction writers such as Theodore Sturgeon and Harlan Ellison, the writer of ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", regarded by many as the finest episode of the original series. Indeed, the quality of the writing on ""Star Trek"", even in its first season, has hardly been equalled since.The eight DVDs comprising this set have the episodes in the order they were aired originally by NBC: The Man Trap, Charlie X, Where No Man Has Gone Before, The Naked Time, The Enemy Within, Mudd's Women, What Are Little Girls Made Of? Miri, Dagger of the Mind, The Corbomite Maneuver, The Menagerie Part I, The Menagerie Part II, The Conscience of the King, Balance of Terror, Shore Leave, The Galileo Seven, The Squire of Gothos, Arena, Tomorrow is Yesterday, Court Martial, The Return of the Archons, Space Seed, A Taste of Armageddon, This Side of Paradise, The Devil in the Dark, Errand of Mercy, The Alternative Factor, The City on the Edge of Forever, Operation: Annihilate! Of these episodes, the best include ""The Enemy Within"", ""The Corbomite Maneuver"", ""The Menagerie"" (which includes most of the footage from ""The Cage"", the original pilot), ""Balance of Terror"" (which introduces the Romulans), ""Shore Leave"", ""A Taste of Armageddon"", ""The Devil in the Dark"", ""Errand of Mercy"" (which introduces the Klingons), and ""The City on the Edge of Forever"". ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" is the second pilot, introducing Captain James T. Kirk, and may be most noteworthy for Gary Lockwood's performance (He would portray astronaut Frank Poole in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".) as Kirk's friend, Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell and Sally Kellerman's performance as ship's psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" features some of the finest acting on ""Star Trek"" from Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley, and a brilliant performance by the young Joan Collins as Edith Keeler. This is inspite of the fact that Gene Roddenberry made substantial revisions to Harlan Ellison's daring, brilliant script. ""Balance of Terror"" may still be the most riveting space battle episode written for ""Star Trek"", with an electrifying performance by Mark Lenard as the commander of the Romulan warship violating Federation space. I would count this episode, along with ""Shore Leave"", and especially, ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", as my personal favorites from this season.I am truly impressed by the picture quality and the sound for each of these. Without question, I would regard this as an essential purchase for ardent ""Star Trek"" fans, and also for those who are devout fans of science fiction cinema and television. My only criticism is the relatively steep price, but I believe that it is still worth acquiring. I am looking forward to viewing the second season of ""Star Trek"" on DVD."	5.0	Superb DVDs of Star Trek's 1st Season	2004-11-16	7	6	1
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1N8EP5TJUABRA	"John L. Kinser ""drzaius3085"""	I have the other star Trek DVD releases and was happy with them. (First the individual 40 DVD set and then the season sets.) Given that I almost didn't buy this set. Once Amazon lowered the pre-order price, I couldn't resist. I am glad I have them! The CGI effects are stunning. Sure it replaces the originals, but for me, it makes the TV series look more like the movies. I don't have a HD DVD player so I can't comment on them, but the standard DVD side of the series looks awesome. They look better than they did when they were first aired back in the late 60's! If you want to see Star Trek better than it has ever looked, this is the set for you! I would have given it 4 stars but I cut back on one due to the price. Although it is an impressive set, the price was still too much.	4.0	Star Trek has never looked better	2008-02-11	2	2	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2IK56BEO9XXI6	John Wray	I was lucky.  I picked up Star Trek: TOS DVD Collection for 79.99 during a two day sale at a local computer store.  I mention this because I don't know if I would have purchased it as I own all the videos of the series, but the DVD format was too much of a lure and the price was right.The transfer is perfect.  Almost too perfect as sometimes the edges of the Spock's ears can be seen for the first time! Overall, we have the complete collection of the first season of the acclaimed Star Trek series.  Sound and visuals are stunning.  The packaging unique (or at least never been tried).  For the price I paid I am a very happy trekker.However, there a few niggly points that would have made me very unhappy had I paid the over $100+ price tag I have seen in retail stores and prevented me from scoring a perfect 5 stars in the Amazon universe.  I list them here in some small hope that someone at Paramount could somehow correct these issues in the next two season collections to come.1.  While the packaging was wonderful, I could have done without the paper sleeve that I must each time reinsert over the main DVD holder.  In time I forsee the sleeve tearing anyways.  Get rid of it or give us a protective cover that folds over like the rest of the disc holders.2.  The videos had the foresight to be released in order of production.  The previous DVD collection followed this tradition.  So, why, oh why, is this collection in order of air dates?  I would rather (and I suspect the majority of us) would rather view the shows in order of production so the true evolution of the series can be seen.  To see costumes change back and forth, Dr. McCoy appear and disappear and reappear again, and Spock being demure and then smiling and shouting and back to demure is bit unsettling.  Also, no where is there production information printed on the disc or in the nifty summary booklet.  I have to put the first DVD in and look at the order and then put each one in to find the next one and back again. At least, put the production number and the airing date in the booklet and on the DVD for viewers to find easily.3.  Menu Selection:  They almost got this one right.  The mainview screen shows the four episodes.  You click on the title to be taken to a detailed selection menu at the helmsman station.  Okay, I am fine with that. However, let's make this easier for those who just want to get straight to the action.  On the main screen give an option next to the each title to PLAY ALL.  Play right through whole episode, preview and end titles. Simple.  Click on the title for those who wish more choices.4. Track Selection: If you click to the next track to avoid the opening titles, you are taken several minutes into the show.  The track selections should be at every commerical break.  Track 1 - Prologue, Opening Title.  Track 2 - Act 1, etc.As I have mentioned, for the price I have paid this product delivers in a grand way, but I would have been in Rigel's Pleasure Planet had the episodes been in production order.  I could have lived with the rest of my nitpicks quite easily, but they just added to my annoyance when watching the shows.  So close, yet so far.  Still, the quality of picture and sound is top notch and so this compliation is a must buy for any Trek fan who doesn't already own the DVD collections.	4.0	Great product that could have been perfect!	2004-09-11	12	10	2

Whether you like the new or old effects, the makers of the show tried their best to integrate effects shots into the dramatic flow, and not to call attention to them as something separate.  The icon takes up a fair portion of the screen, and often lasts for the majority of the shot.So, does anyone know if it's possible to turn this feature off, and just watch the episodes?

It's well worth the price. I discovered this when I didn't have cable and Fox was showing it in fuzzyness. I really didn't know at the time it was a completely different and better show though. I will never have to search for it. If you like the original either get the DVD or Blu-Ray. Depends on your preference and if you have a Blu-Ray player. I do prefer the Blu-Rays cases. They just look like they fit better in a DVD/Blu-Ray collection. Also you might not like the sound if you don't have DTS. but that's not why I bought it anyway. I have Dolby Digital.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2PXOP8AOGXQCO	Jon Folkers	"It's taken more than 40 years, but I think this is a contender for ""best edition of classic Star Trek ever."" I'm too young to have seen the original broadcast run, but I have fond memories of WVIA PBS TV running 3 gorgeous restored, uncut episodes back to back every Saturday night without commercials. These prints were from the original 35mm masters, which were the source for these new discs.Until now, I considered my VHS recordings of those broadcasts about as good as any commercial product out there. Prior sets were either prohibitively expensive (the VHS sets, the later DVD sets), obnoxiously collected (2 episodes per 1 disc in a standard amray case?), or endangered species (HD-DVD? I don't think so).The series is still syndicated on cable TV, but it's typically hacked up to make space for commercials, annoyingly running for 90 minutes because of the extra filler. As I write this, Netflix has this same first season (featuring remastered visuals) on it's instant streaming service, and that's very convenient. The streaming version has sub-DVD picture quality and no extra content, so it really can't compare to this new set.This blu-ray set is everything my late-night PBS marathons were and more. Gorgeous color saturation, no visual noise, a wonderful new surround sound mix, sensible pricing, and tons of documentary extras. By far my favorite feature is the seamless branching that allows you to press the ANGLE button on your bluray remote to switch between the original janky special effects, and the remastered effects that blend surprisingly well. I can't overemphasize how well the new visuals blend into the show -- they aren't overly flashy, and they don't mess with the original timing or sound. It's as if the screen is finally showing what you had in your imagination all along, only hampered by inferior TV resolution until now.I'm thrilled to have such a high quality rendition of this great old show. This presentation significantly raises the standard for other collections to follow. I hope seasons 2 and 3 look as good as Season 1."	5.0	Definitive Season One for Trek nerds as well as the rest of us.	2009-04-28	10	8	2

I totally loved the movies as a teenager. I watched ST:TNG, Deep Space Nine, and some of Voyager, but I never really watched the original series.Having purchased a PS3 for Blu Ray movies, I thought I should plunk down some hard earned change and get the original series. All I can say is ""WOW."" This show looks fantastic in HD, and it sounds very good as well. The updated visual effects brings you into the action more than some guy holding a cardboard cut out of a planet. The new exterior shots of the Enterprise look great as well, and the updated audio track sounds sonic.

One can really see it on the space scenes whether it's the Enterprise itself or the scenes in space. I was really amazed with the remastering in the episode ""The Galileo Seven"". It really stood out in that episode. I do believe if the technology used to make these DVDs was available back in the 1960's Gene Rodenberry would have used it. I have seen reviews from those whom think the remastered DVDs aren't good. They think it takes something away from the purity. Well for that crowd there are Star Trek DVDs that aren't remastered. Buy those. I am one of those who think the remastered versions add something good to the series. So all in all I am pleased with the product.

The three main characters, Kirk, Spock and McCoy, play off each other extremely well. Exudes a level-headed masculinity abandoned by its successors. Shatner was admittedly over-the-top, but it works. Perhaps the only instance of network exec intervention making a creator's vision better. Roddenberry had his way with TNG and, even at its best, it doesn't measure up to the original. Kirk stands with Sgt. Saunders and Gil Favor. One star off for replacing the original FX scenes with mediocre CGI.	4.0	One of TV's Best Moments	2014-06-26	0	0	0

Those are just some of the words I'd use to describe Star Trek: TOS. I watched this series recently because although I consider myself quite the &#34;trekkie&#34;, I never saw the original series all the way through. This review is about the first season so please don't hate me. Taking in to consideration that I watch a 1960's show in 2013, I really liked this series as a whole. The first season was good but not my personal favorite. For the most part, season one is a work in progress. There are some really good sci/fi stories mixed in with a bunch of really dumb ones. When it's good this show is good. When it's bad well...you know. Anyway, science fiction fans must watch this show in order to understand the phenomenon and learn who it was that inspired generations of science fiction shows and movies to follow.

I agree that some films/shows are reissued to death on DVD.  In this case, however, we get something new.  Although the new CGI effects are brief, they make a world of difference in watching the shows.  Certain aspects of these shows will always remain dated, but the original special effects were just crap and really hurt the shows in my opinion.  So, I'm actually quite glad to see these!  I agree with others about the price, though.  I can only view the standard DVD sides.

Whatever the quality of the cast & production, or how quaint the special effects, this is what started it all.  This show presented a future that most people could barely imagine.  In some areas technology has surpassed what is shown here.  Although I am still waiting for 'beam me up Scotty!'  This show needs to be honored for what has come after as much as for what it was to begin with.  It is iconic & is an intrinsic part of our culture.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A10872FHIJAKKD	Just Bill	"I've been a fan of Star Trek, the Original Series since the show first aired. For my money, there's no better Starship captain than James T. Kirk. Sure, they were hokey episodes. I always laugh when someone, usually Scotty, would grab what appeared to be a wrench when he crawls under a supposedly futuristic, ultra-high tech instrument panel to fix something gone awry. And don't even get me started about the incredibly low-tech monsters and special effects that graced the show.Still, when I think of Star Trek, I think of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and the rest of the Original Series gang. It didn't matter to me that things looked hokey. That added to the show's charm.With the advent of Blu-ray, I couldn't wait to see my favorite sci-fi series married to the most advanced viewing medium yet invented.Imagine my disappointment when the first season of Star Trek arrived and I saw a better picture, yes, but also an icon in the upper right of my TV screen that told me I could watch the low-tech special effects if I clicked the ""Angle"" button on my Blu-ray players remote. After spending two hours searching the Internet, reading posts, perusing reviews, and discovering -- much to my dismay -- that the icon can't be turned off! There it is, in every episode, distracting the hell out of me, taunting me from its perch. What Einstein designed that?On top of that, the enhanced special effects look *more* hokey than what the series originally offered. They look cheesy, as if they're from a 90s computer game. The Enterprise looks absolutely plastic and, worse, lifeless. Some of the sets also appear to be newly built, digitally. I'm not 100% sure about that. But they sure do look odd compared to everything else, like they exist as CGI. So they, too, look ""fake"" (as if I was ever fooled into thinking sets on the original series were ""real"").To make matters worse, the sound is dodgy. On some episodes, I have to turn up the volume extremely high to hear what's going on. Then, when the show ends and it returns to the main menu, the sound blasts me out of my seat. To get better sound, I have to flip the switch to ""Mono"" so that the sound is more focused and balanced in the center-channel speaker. So I can't even use the setting the BD player automatically chooses based on the type of signal it's getting from the discs themselves. What's up with that?Is it my equipment? I don't think so. I have a brand-new Philips 42"" TV with 50,000:1 dynamic contrast. Even 70-year-old movies like Gone With the Wind are so crisp it's like watching real people out of a window. My receiver is brand-new as well. It's an Onkyo that makes everything sound terrific. The speakers? They're B&Ws;, wonderful speakers. The Blu-ray player is also a brand-new item, a Philips.So, with all of that equipment, most of it brand new, I should be able to enjoy Star Trek: Original Series, Season One with no problem. But I can't. Between the sound -- that fluctuates between horrible and so-so -- and that darn ""Angle"" icon that I can't make go away, I'm irritated beyond belief. (For the record, I own a few dozen Blu-ray discs, the images on which range from 1939 to 2010. I don't have these problems on any other Blu-ray.)The picture, although much improved (and, boy, does Spock's make-up look strange with such on-screen clarity!), does not offset the rest of the problem I've encountered.I've watched a half dozen episodes so far. I'm not sure I'm enjoying this experience enough to buy Season Two and Season Three, as much as I love those original episodes.My advice to anyone considering this set is to think long and hard about it. The two main reasons to buy Blu-ray are (1) picture enhancement, and (2) sound enhancement. Star Trek: Original Series Blu-ray blows it with both. So what's to gain by buying the Blu-rays? I'm not sure yet.So the choice is yours. Remember: Caveat emptor."	3.0	"Lousy Sound And That Annoying ""Angle"" Icon Nearly Outweigh Whatever Picture Enhancements Exist"	2010-02-11	10	4	6

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1TP1GQFJQYJC7	Kartick Vaddadi	First, if you're a TOS fan, please excuse me, and ignore my review.If, on the other hand, you haven't watched much Star Trek, or have, but haven't watched TOS (The Original Series -- the thing I'm reviewing), this review is for you.I used to watch TOS a long time ago, then switched to TNG (The Next Generation, with Captain Picard) and never looked back. After a half-decade of TNG, DS9 (Deep Space 9), Voyager and a bit of Enterprise, I wanted to give TOS a shot again, and see if I would like it, or if it was as bad as I remembered.I should not have.TOS was created in the 60s, and looks dated now, with the huge oversized knobs, no touch screens, the dark interiors, the dismal corridors, the garish red paint on the bridge, and the electronic devices that are almost as big as the Chromebook I'm writing this on.Sci-fi set in the past does not resonate (unless you're into steampunk and similar stuff). When you find yourself looking down on a starship and associated technology that in some ways is behind ours (no touchscreens!), it destroys the effect. Even TNG looks a bit dated now, in places, but TOS, far more so. The effects, the decor, the look of things... the awe and futuristic feel are gone.The old Enterprise looks ugly and too angular, not streamlined or elegant at all, compared to Enterprise D or E.I much prefer Picard to Kirk. Kirk is a bit of an alpha male. Which is fine, but I much prefer the intellectual, cultured approach of Picard, if I may call it that.Ultimately, every work is a product of its time, and it's hard to transcend that. TOS's days are over, I'm sad to report. Try TNG.	1.0	Dated. Consider The Next Generation instead.	2013-04-27	12	1	11

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A8NCQO0E7M4LQ	KC Coldbrook	Season 1 of the series Heroes on HD DVD has a similar number of episodes and sells for $59, less than half the price of this money-grubbing Trek release.  Furthermore, Heroes is new and was shot directly in HD with the highest possible quality.  Trek is 40 year old celluloid film full of age defects and warmed over with some new special effects which are few and far between.Nevertheless I was looking forward to a high-def Trek release, but I'm not going to pay more than double the going rate for a TV series on HD DVD.  This is the worst type of cynical marketing, I can only imagine their HD-ignorant execs decided that only hopeless fanboys would buy this release and would pay no attention to the price.  I don't care how much of a Trek fan you are, avoid this release to send a message that this pricing is not going to be tolerated, or look forward to similar extortion for future Paramount series in HD.	1.0	DOUBLE the price of other TV series on HD DVD	2007-09-18	46	17	29

But I kept an eye on it and this can now be found for up to 75% off list. I suddenly became very interested and just had to order it. Am I ever glad I did. The first thing you notice is the sheer quality of the picture in hi-def. Now some have complained that the picture it too clear and the plywood sets lose their credibility. I have not noticed this by any stretch. What I am struck with however is how well the performances have held up some 40+ years later. Right from the initial episode the chemistry among cast/characters was fleshed out. To think this originally aired in 1966! Unbelievable. The reworked special effects only serve to enhance the experience. Like the current team explains on the special features segment, they wanted to do something the originators would have done if the technology was available at that time. They made NO attempt to bring the special effects up to current standards. Smart choice as it would have been distracting. My only regret is Season Two is currently not on the Blu-Ray release schedule as the HD-DVD format has been abandoned. I'm sure, in time, this will be released on Blu-Ray and all will be right again with the initial hi-def release strategy. In the meantime I will enjoy Season One in all its hi-def glory.	5.0	Highly recommended!	2008-05-26	4	4	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A29ZR6346NR3O3	Keeping Rational	OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:BuySUMMARY:This DVD set is a welcome improvement to a classic series. Overall the series is well done with only a few minor flaws. The primary issues lie in the DVDs and packaging.DETAILS:The episodes have been cleaned up, sharpened, etc. Even the music was rerecorded. Overall well done. There are occasional minor issues such as the CG being inconsistent, or where they missed cleaning up some scenes. On the other hand some of the effects are stunning. The additional content is also pretty good as some of it explains the remastering and some is interviews with actors, and other key people.The disappointing parts are in the DVDs and packaging. The DVDs are plain sliver disks with very fine print near the center giving the disc number etc. You would think they could have done a silkscreen on them but I guess they are cutting costs. Additionally it makes one wonder who handled the disks. Mine came with minor scratches etc that I've never seen on production DVDs before. The case is ok but be careful with the insert/box the dvds come in, its a bit flimsy.	4.0	Worth it but a few issues	2011-12-13	2	2	0

Yeah it's a cool thing what they did with the CGI, but let's see, they got me for the very first VHS Tapes. Then They suckered me into not only the black and white color mix of THE CAGE but a few months later got me with the full color version of THE CAGE. Then there were all the laser discs. Then the individual 2 episode DVDs. Then the whole series package. Plus all the multiple versions of all the movies.Does this ever end? Well it ends right here and now for me.

The episodes are entirrely out of order. Spock would call it illogical at best. I have yet to figure out what method they used to organize the episodes. I've never seen a DVD box set of a television show that did not order the episodes in chronological order. In addition, this set does NOT include the pilot episode, ""The Cage."" Technically not part of season 1, but still a must."	3.0	Poorly organized!!!	2005-12-06	8	5	3
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AZFSJNYKDHIGZ	Kelvin J. Dickinson	"In a very real sense, this is the one I was 'saving up for'. I own all three remastered seasons of the original STAR TREK but only the first is on Blu-ray. Why? Well, I kind of wanted just one major treat (in its current best possible showcase) so, for me, it became a case of choosing which season had the most magic and created the most impact when I was very young. In the end, emotion won out to cold, hard logic...I love the fact that the first season is clearly finding it's feet (a problem for some fans, admittedly), that everyone involved is giving it absolutely everything they've got and, in the majority of episodes, all that effort really does show - the whole venture feels like a hugely exciting and entertaining step into the unknown. And, of course, the wonderful CGI. The second season, on the other hand, is a little more ""Ain't we doin' good, guys?"", a touch of ego, smugness and better restaurants, alongside the expected hike in confidence. As a consequence, it's a little less likeable. Only marginally, but still. The third season...well it tries hard, but it can't quite shake off a very real sense of fatigue and disappointment at the imposed budgetary contraints and a dismal network-scheduled timeslot.The first season on Blu-ray is also beautiful to look at; the acting, the dialogue, the lighting...it's all first rate and leaps off the screen at the senses. And that's why it (my decision) makes perfect sense. Just one on Blu-ray, the rest on DVD. No dilution of the magic and a major treat by any other name. Anyone who's read my other reviews on seasons two and three will know how I feel about Star Trek, and why it remains the best tv sci-fi ever.EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED - A FEW CHOICE MOMENTS...ERRAND OF MERCYRefusing to divulge information regarding the Federation's military strength, Kirk instead tells his Klingon captor, Kor, to ""Go climb a tree"". Superbly delivered by Shatner, I think we know what he's REALLY saying here.THE NAKED TIMEAs the Enterprise plunges towards Psi 2000, an (alien spore) intoxicated Lt Kevin Riley has taken over the intership communications from another deck and is broadcasting (repeatedly) his dire rendition of the Irish 'classic', 'I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen'. Uhura cannot silence the comms and Kirk is furious, so he tells her off. She instantly returns with, ""Don't you think I would if I could!"" and the captain is suitably chastised. A pause, then he apologises, to which she smiles, instantly forgiving him. The issues of authority and friendship (and stress!) are beautifully played here, rendering the moment incredibly subtle and effective. These are the little things that make Star Trek special.THE GALILEO SEVENThe extended laughter of the entire bridge crew as Spock acknowledges he is a stubborn sod moments before the end credits begin to roll. It's either a complete cheese-fest OR an inspired piece of character-enhancement. Yeah, well it's the latter, ok? Ever the optimist.THE MAN TRAPA fatigued McCoy contacts the bridge and asks Kirk for advice on how to relax a bit. Kirk recommends the same tablets prescribed to him by the good doctor on a previous occasion (they must have worked but had really unpleasant side-effects as he's clearly still narked about them). ""You'll sleep"", he says, before abruptly cutting off the comms screen.WHAT ARE LITTLE GIRLS MADE OF?Ruk is a seven-and-a-half foot tall android killing machine. In the caves below the surface of Exo III, Kirk gets into a fight with him and snaps off a strange, yet familiar-shaped, stalactite as a weapon (cue eyes popping out of sockets as incredulous years-later teenage recognition kicks in: ""OMG, it looks like he's weilding a HUGE, fossilised p-!"") Definitely not something you'd wish to see in the wrong hands...Roddenberry strikes again. God Bless Him.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"	5.0	STEP INTO THE UNKNOWN	2012-05-12	1	1	0

You can tell the people who worked on this project put a lot of love and respect into their work. The picture is awesome! I like just looking at the restored and enhanced Enterprise. We have just one quibble; why aren't the episodes in order. We collected the series on VHS and each tape had two episodes with original air dates on them. The episodes in this set don't coincide.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1WJSI05Z8LI4H	"Kenneth J. Mayer ""Science Fiction Fan ..."""	One thing I noticed when looking at the playlist for Season 1 is that the episodes at the beginning are out of sequence. For example, the VHS tapes I have (also published by Paramount) have the first four episodes listed as: The Cage (not in the set, by the way); Where No Man Has Gone Before; The Corobomite Maneuver; Mudd's Women. The first disc, according to the booklet (haven't had a chance to watch these yet) shows: The Man Trap; Charlie X; Where No Man Has Gone Before; The Naked Time. This is radically different in sequence. While I am not a 100% purist, particularly where the original series goes (since the main characters were all at the same place at the end of each episodes), it is still odd that we have such a huge dichotomy in the sequence of the shows. It's at least slightly disturbing.	4.0	Out of Sequence ...?	2008-09-05	1	1	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A5UGX57EV695M	Kenneth M. Pizzi	"I am elated that the original series is now available in the three season/package format.  The transfers are very clean and look reasonably good and the Dolby 5.1 audio takes the program quality to an even higher level.  The packaging?  Extremely cumbersome and awkard--more printed documentation could and should have been added. Die-hard Trekkies deserve more. Afterall, this is, in many respects, both a science fiction and televison historical artifact, it is not? Fans who are purchasing this set already know which are the finest episodes of this first season, so there is no need to elaborate.The extras are very nice.  I enjoyed the documentary on William Shatner and learning about his new passion--raising and breeding prize horses and his charity work. Other segments hosted by the series' co-stars are also entertaining and informative--Walter Koenig lends some interesting insights into the production of the series and there are some segments with the late James Doohan.  However, I wish the popular ""blooper reel"" could have been included.  Traditionally, this is very hard to find and could only be viewed at Star Trek conventions.People wonder why shows like Star Trek endure and matter today.  Of course, today the special effects are crude, the sets and the costumes imaginative but sometimes laughable, but the answer is rather simple: Star Trek is much like the myths of Homer's Odyssey and Illiad--tales retold to each succeeding generation filled with adventure, danger, and courage that resonate and touch us immeasurably with a sustaining hope that the future is a brighter one.I also like the new way Paramount has done their commentaries for several specific episodes.  Done with animated/written ""pop ups"" that occupy only a small fraction of the screen, these are far less intrusive than the usual ""voiceover"" that drowns out the dialogue of the actual show--Kudos to you, Paramount!"	4.0	Welcome back, old friend....	2004-11-01	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1OXQOQ7C570B4	Kerry Garrett	I have always loved this show.  It was beyond ground breaking.  The restoration looks great except for one part.  The exterior shots of the Enterprise have all been recreated in computer graphics.  They may be frame for frame recreations but it is jarring when they appear.  So many things about this show are 60s television.  The HD upgrade reveals the hand sewn uniforms, cardboard sets and heavy makeup jobs.  Then all of the sudden, when I expected to see the model of the Enterprise hanging from a wire circling a blurry planet I get a 3D computer generated Enterprise circling a highly detailed planet with clouds and mountains.  I wish they would have just cleaned up the old special effects instead of remaking them.Other than that, the restoration makes the show come alive.  A lot of effort was put into the original production of this show to make it a vision of the future with hope and adventure even if they had to do it on a shoestring budget.	5.0	The restoration went a little too far.	2013-04-02	0	0	0

Almost every episode adroitly deconstructs a social or political issue, disguising it in the context of an idealized, almost utopian future.  At the same time, they are simply fun.  In addition, you can watch them with little ones around without having to worry about having to make any uncomfortable explanations.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A14Q3LK731MAXK	Kevin M. Hogan	"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge Trek fan, especially that of the Original Series, since the late 60's/early 70's. I've even slagged-through and enjoyed most of the post-TOS ST stuff, even the really bad stuff, LOL! ""Bad Star Trek is better than NO Star Trek"" I always say, LOL!Pros:1) PQ: The updated PQ is outstanding...ST:TOS has never, ever looked this good before!2) AQ: The new multi-channel audio is excellent and has been seemlessly blended with the original dialogue.3) Added/Updated Special Effects: The new digital CGI special effects are good, but take a little time to get used to after decades of mini model photography superimposed over matte paintings have clouded my judgement, LOL!4) Cool Extra's: Lots and lots of extra's, the new stuff shot in HD vid, are very cool and worth having. The restoration of the episodes, new music recording, etc. are great.5) Stellar Program Content: Of course the actual program content is stellar...great stories outlining great characters with equally great screenplays and relatively honest acting (hammy over-acting in Shatner's case, LOL!). if you're reading this I'm sure there's nothing new to add here that you don't already know and appreciate.6) Dual Episode Content: Both original, albeit visually restored, programming content is present side-by-side with the new visually and sonically enhanced versions of the same episode. One can switch between original and enhanced effects via the ""angle"" function on any BD player.Cons:Price: Relatively high price, although Amazon's current price is not too out of line.Packaging Quality : Packaging could be better on a set this pricy...the multi-disc holders in the smallish case are crappy and allow the discs to flop around inside the case and the lack of disc content labeling and/or graphics is dissapointing as well.Glitches: The biggest problem for me is that the these discs, at least on my Pioneer BDP-51 BD player (with latest FW installed), are glitchy. Besides the noticeable volume drop (somewhat ameloirated by switching the audio set-up on the BD menu), the audio completely drops-out during the transition between the new CGI effects shots and the original program content when playing the ""enhanced"" episodes. A quick FF scan will restore the audio, but then I have to reverse scan back to the dialogue I missed. If I scan back too far, the audio drops-out again. This happens fairly regularly, depending on the episode and the amount of SE shots it contains. In addition, the aspect ratio of the episode seems to switch itself form WS to FS to 4:3 at will when you use the scan/skip functions. I'm assuming this is a BD player (FirmWare) issue and not that of the discs themselves, but, having said that, I haven't experienced this on any other BD to date. As a new Pioneer FW update is imminent, I hope this will address my issues so that I can fully appreciate and enjoy this otherwise wonderful set.Conclusion: Overall, I'd have to give the content, PQ/AQ and extra's five stars. The few cons I've experienced bring my rating down to four stars.Enjoy!UPDATE: From what I've learned on the AVSForum, apparently it's not my BD Player that's causing the glitches. Errors between ""branching"" of new and old shots are causing audio drop-outs in lot's of different players. Apparently, the Blu-ray standard is still being written (or re-written) every day."	4.0	Excellent Pic Quality, Sound, and Extra's but Slightly Glitchy	2009-05-12	9	8	1
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3S2O5DD12JW8X	Kevin Race	"I am in complete agreement with the other posters. If this was the ENTIRE original series the price would be acceptable. OR, if this was the first season featuring both the original and the new Special Edition versions then maybe. But no way is a ""special price"" of $81.00 for just the original 1st season in any way reasonable. Got it on DVD and that's just fine. At least they got the price right for the Original Movie Collection.I've bought a TON of DVDs and Blu-Rays on Amazon over the last few years and I know the prices are generally the best found so this wouldn't be Amazon's screw up. The studio actually expects people to pay this amount. I guess we'll have to wait and see what is available on this set. If it is literally the original first season as available already on DVD with a few new bonus features this set will be a laughing stock at the current price.

I lovethe first disposable crewman,  reminds me of Galaxy Quests Sam Rockwell character crewman number nine from episode 81.  One reflects,  am I already doomed and so can hero out the episode,  or am I the comic relief?So much of the series has become iconic,  and I hope the casts knows that We know.  I celebrate Uhura,  and really I marvel at the absolute integration racially,  far before its time,  and I mean integrated that no one is self conscious as so many shows became ,  all the characters are good and bad no matter their color.  There is an interracial embrace,I believe Kirk and his mirror image girlfriend..  and Uhura herself is dignity and sensuality,  and her hands are alwayson the buttons that make her seem like - more than any other character - she really is 'opening a channel'  Anyone notice how the device in her ear looks remarkably like the prototype for bluetooth ear devices.  ?  And the little computers ship to ship look like the little monitors we would have used in 1999.  What a grave responsibility science fiction really is..  blue prints for the inventors to use as the guide our wee ship through the uncharted future.  I think too,when the series was being taped,  not more than five years after the Kennedy presidency and the famous new frontier..  here we are in the Final Frontier.  The other side of that first step that had not yet been taken when the series was being filmed.

But at last, after three years, I had all 40 discs.By then, this method of releasing TV episodes seemed like, well, ""stone knives and bear skins.""  Everybody else was doing season boxes and this had become the norm.  (A notorious exception is the original Twilight Zone, which ran to 43 discs, later collected into five box sets, but in random order, seasons mixed together, etc.)  Wouldn't it have been nice if I could have saved all that money and shelf space?  Oh, well...NOW they put out season boxes.  Gee, thanks guys.  Too bad I can't get a trade-in on the old ones.  But, let's look at the bright side.  I loved watching these episodes again, in vivid color and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, and I enjoyed the anticipation of waiting for the next pair of discs to come out.For those of you who didn't buy the old discs, you're in luck.  This new set is the same transfer, but I don't think it could get any better.  You do get a few extra features that didn't appear on the old discs (which included only the old trailers), but let's face it --- there are only about 10,000 books on Star Trek if you want background material.  It would have been nice if they'd included the blooper reel.The only real gripe I have is that the boxes will show the episodes in broadcast order, as opposed to production order, as in the old 2-episode discs.  Having watched all of these shows dozens of times over the years, I can assure you that it makes a big difference watching them in the order they were made.  The character development is much smoother and makes more sense.  You also don't have such inconsistencies as Dr. McCoy suddenly disappearing in mid-season for the pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" --- to say nothing of the uniform differences.But, hey, it's not a perfect world."	5.0	Yeah, sure, NOW	2004-08-26	18	17	1

I decided to watch one, because I have a prime membership, and, its free. Every 50 minute episode could be its own movie, so there isnt a huge storyline. The main characters, Kirk, Spock, Scotty, McCoy, and the guy in the landing party who always gets killed kind of set out the plot for every episode. I just cant figure out why after three seasons of evil stuff abord the enterprise why they kept beaming stuff aboard... oh well.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3XS35Q2FJNPQ	K. Nagel	"Enhancing the visual effects takes nothing away from the original shows. There were many times when I was first watching them that I was all too aware that something was a prop rather than something ""real"", like a styrofoam rock bouncing down a hill. The enhancement if anything will allow you to focus more on the story and less on the bad visual effects. And just to make everyone aware I grew up in the 60's and 70's watching these shows and I am actually excited to see them in a more ""realistic"" light. I don't think this will ruin them or diminish my ""fond"" memories of a consumer product that was created for the sole purpose of making money for a TV studio, cripes it's a TV show, not a religion.It reminds me of back when Turner started colorizing B&W; films and everyone started freaking out about how he was ruining the artistic vision of the movie. Well sorry to rain on all of your parades but those movies weren't shot in Black & White to be artistic you simpletons! They were shot that way because that was all they had to work with, or it was very early on in the days of color and they couldn't afford to shoot in color. They wanted desperately to shoot color, other mediums were already in color and they were working hard to bring color to the movies.This is the same thing here. They didn't make the planet's landscapes out of cheesy paintings because it looked good. They did it because it was what they had to work with. Same goes for the plastic models on sticks and strings. And there was nothing less artistic than control panel of cheap toggle switches labeled with a DYMO gun.

Awesome story, acting, everything. Credited to sci-fi author Harlan Ellison but the produced version is very different from his original story. It's still a great tale. Basically, McCoy goes back in time to depression-era America, changes history and the Enterprise, UFP, everything that the crew and captain knows is gone. Kirk and Spock need to go back to stop McCoy from doing whatever it is he does. While back in time, Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler (a young Joan Collins). Don't want to spoil anything, so just get this and love it.

Kirk, played by William Shatner.  Along with Doctors Piper, Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman), and a pointy-eared alien named Mr. Spock - one of the only cast members to return from the first pilot 'The Cage'.  The rest is history...  the Enterprise explored the barrier at the edge of the galaxy which has the strange effect of boosting the mental powers of those with high latent ESP abilities.  Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood - pre-'2001'), and Dr. Dehner are most strongly affected - their mental powers taking on a 'god-like' dimension. Kirk realizes that human jealousy, anger, and weaknesses and god-like powers don't mix well, and schemes to abandon Mitchell on planet Delta Vega.  It climaxes in a fisty-cuffs battle in the desert of Delta Vega, and Kirk's tunic is torn displaying his 1966 network-censor approved 'shaved chest'.  Mitchell and Dehner die, and everyone is strangely at peace with the outcome.  But a TV series that took viewers ""where no man has gone before"" was born.  Check it out for yourself!

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1GTZJFANX76EN	K. Van Kainen	"I can understand the ire of those reviewers who purchased the Star Trek DVD boxed sets, only to have a ""better"" (and I guess this depends on whether you prefer the original or the enhanced) version arrive just a year or two later. I felt the same way when I had to toss out all my expensive 8-tracks and replace them with cassette tapes, and again when those were gradually nudged out in favor of CD's. Audio and video technologies are advancing almost too quickly for studios and fans to keep up, and already my vast collection of video tapes are collecting dust in the basement and DVD's line my bookshelf instead. If I were to dwell on the hundreds of dollars I invested in those video tapes, not to mention the numerous VCR's (and tape rewinders!) I purchased as they went from 2-head to 4-head versions and are now becoming hard to find at all, I could feel as though I had been ripped off somehow. But, in all honesty, I like DVD's better. They take up far less space, don't get devoured by the machine, allow me to skip instantly around the movie and, well, the movies look astonishingly beautiful compared to the tapes. And, just like their CD counterparts, the cost of purchasing DVD's and the equipment to play them on has dropped significantly since their inception. Eventually, these, too, will be replaced with something new and amazing and my DVD collection will end up in the basement, too. I suppose I could be stubborn and resist these changes, but they're going to happen anyway. So, to shamelessly borrow a phrase, ""Resistance is futile.""Regarding TOS, I have no shame at all...I love it. Always have, always will. I'll always get a kick out of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest of the crew. I know all the episodes by rote. They're melodramatic, cheesy, sometimes downright silly, but if it's on, I watch, even the bad episodes. Just like ""I Love Lucy"" reruns, it's just one of those shows I can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time. And even though I feel that the low-grade special effects and cheap props are part of its charm, I've seen some of the enhanced episodes and feel that they were judiciously applied, respectful of the original vision and take nothing away from the experience. So, yes, I will eventually purchase this set, and just as I waited a long time to purchase my first DVD player I'll wait a while for the price to come down.For those accusing the studio of ripping off the public, I see no great conspiracy at work here. Like any other company, Paramount is a business and a business' primary objective is to make a profit. I don't fault them for that, because it is up to the consumer to decide if the product is worth the price. Don't like the enhancements? Think the price is too high? Don't buy the set. For my part, I'll be moving my TOS video tapes to the basement...eventually."	4.0	Time marches on!	2007-11-12	14	12	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"I think the consensus here is pretty clear with regards to ""Star Trek the Original Series: The Complete First Season.""  After waiting for the original series to catch up with all of its descendants and have complete seasons available in a DVD package, it is really disappointing to see such limited extras given the wait (and the price, even with 29 episodes), especially in terms of commentary tracks; there really are not any, just pop-up texts provided by Michael and Denise Okuda on four episodes: the two-parts of ""The Menagerie,"" which incorporates the original pilot into the first season continuity, the second pilot, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" and, for no really good reason, ""The Conscience of the King.""  The pop-ups are filled with trivia and history (not to mention good jokes), but I really would like to hear somebody talk about some of these classic episodes.  I realize the cast might not be willing to do so, given that after 40 years their memories would be strained and their insights limited, and I do not expect the writers to show up, although the thought of Harlan Ellison trying to talk calmly about ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" would be something to hear, but at this point there is no reason ""Star Trek"" cannot go the Criterion Collection route and have honest to Roddenberry ""Star Trek"" scholars talk about some of the key episodes in great detail.What extras are here and pretty good, but having only 80 minutes worth seems really lame given what else we have seen out there on lesser television shows and movies.  The interview segments are okay (Shatner, Nimoy and the other cast members are clearly running out of things to say, although some of these observations have become finely honed over the years), and the more personal pieces where Shatner shows off his horses and Nimoy sets the record straight on his character are better.  ""The Birth of a Timeless Legacy"" looks at those two pilot episodes and gives us a clear indication of what could have been done on commentary tracks.  ""To Boldly Go...Season One"" is on the right trek, so to speak, but could have been longer (again, we have had decades to put together the big picture on this show and its first season).  The same thing could be said for ""Sci-Fi Visionaries,"" which only scratches the surface on the show's use of big name science fiction writers.  Overall, I would rate this at 4.5 stars and end up rounding down because the packaging is not really user friendly because they get too cute for their own good here.I still go with season two of ""Star Trek"" being slightly better than the first, and I think I have a special affection for the 1965-66 season because it represented the time before James T. Kirk became a lover as well as a fighter.  Part of what made ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" so powerful was that it was a big deal for the captain of the ""Enterprise.""  If I got to pick what episode would have been the show's pilot, I really would have gone with ""The Corbomite Maneuver,"" because it had the best sense of the show's mission statement (beyond the boldly glowing bit in the credits).  For me, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" is just as much of an aberration as ""The Menagerie"" (especially once you see ""The Cage"" on its own).  Besides ""City,"" I think the other really great episodes from the first season that would be ""Balance of Terror,"" ""Galileo Seven,"" and ""This Side of Paradise.""  Yes, I have developed a clear bias for Spock episodes over Kirk episodes, but when you are a half-human Vulcan who disdains emotion you have a big advantage when it comes to having dramatic moments.  Other favorites from the first season would have to include ""The Naked Time,"" ""The Squire of Gothos,"" ""Arena,"" and ""Space Seed.""This is not to say that all of the episodes are great.  ""The Man Trap"" and ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" always left me cold (the worst episode Majel Barrett did on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was better than both of those put together), and I can live without seeing either of the episodes with Harry Mudd ever again.  But I think the only episodes that really seem dated are those dealing with criminal investigations, specifically ""The Conscience of the King"" and ""Court-Martial"" (several centuries into the future and being able to identify somebody with a medical record is supposed to be difficult?), because ""Star Trek"" was more about people and situations than science and special effects.  Kirk broke the Prime Directive more often than not, but at least there was the idea that in the future we would have a better way of dealing with strangers and their strange lands.Watching these episodes again the two that stood out as defining the parameters of ""Star Trek"" were ""A Taste of Armageddon"" and ""The Devil in the Dark.""  The former is important because the idea of fighting a war with computers rather than bombs embodies the idea of the double-edged sword of technology.  In the ""Star Trek"" universe science does not solve everything and actual creates rather significant problems.  You can trace an anti-science element throughout the series.  The latter represents the idea of recognizing ourselves in aliens, what humanity has always disparaged as the ""other"".  Accepting a half-alien crewmember like Spock is hard enough for some members of the ""Enterprise"" crew (e.g., ""Balance of Terror""), but when the pergium miners of Janus VI instantly accept the idea they are doing something wrong when they find the Horta is a mother defending her eggs from being destroyed just might be the most optimistic evidence of humanity's nobility in the entire run of ""Star Trek."""	4.0	The 1st season of boldly going around the Star Trek universe	2004-12-15	6	5	1

I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all.I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.	5.0	Great classic for a great price	2006-12-03	7	4	3

Everything about space and traveling with the purpose of adventure was just great. The newer movies didn't do it enough justice despite great casting. The bond between Kirk and Spock really holds the series together, and the whole concept of logic vs. morals. Just a great classic space show that did more to forward the idea of equality as something to discuss than most projects that came after it. I feel like that element of dealing with race issues was untouched by the JJ Abrams films but they could've done that and much more. This is the first milestone in the Star Trek universe and it proves why everything else had to follow it's stellar performance.	5.0	Kirk and Spock Bromance For Life	2014-07-12	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A33DF2LFT38HXC	LG	"After reading Java's review, last edited on Oct 30, 2007 9:40 AM PDT, I decided to ask the following question:Around September 1998, The SCI-FI Channel started airing an episode per night of ""Star Trek"" the original TV series. These episodes were aired in their original sequence, un-cut versions, and each episode was narrated and hosted by William Shatner.  A crew member or guest was also shown doing a brief monologue about the episode being televised.  Each episode lasted about 90 minutes, due to Shatner's narrations and comments (Including blooper revelations), the guest's monologues, commercials and the un-cut episodes themselves.  Are such interviews and monologues included on these DVDs or HD-DVDs?  If so, my decision to purchase will be sealed (although the price strikes fear in my heart).  If not, does anyone know where I can get a DVD (preferred) or VHS collection of all the aforementioned episodes, including Shatner's narrations and the guest monologues?  Your efforts and any guidance with this matter will be very much appreciated!  Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask such questions (Desperation is a powerful thing)!"	5.0	Question: Are Sci-Fi Chnl 1998 monologues of cast & guests included?	2008-08-11	1	0	1

Grassman	"I can't remember how quickly the product was shipped, but the case and all the DVDs were in perfect condition. I bought them new, so of course this is to be expected but doesn't always happen. I absolutely love the Star Trek series for the dynamic and comical trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy; the cheesy but often inspired story lines; and the endearingly low-budget set and costumes. I don't really love some of the ""upgrades"" made to the show in recent times (such as the redone graphics to make the various planets look like actual planets rather than rubber bouncy balls; and the addition of the occasional shuttle craft landing in the landing dock which were never present in the show as it was when it was first airing, etc., dinting the cheesy quality a little), but they don't bother me so much as to make me not spend money on the series. I basically just think they were totally unnecessary.Anyway, I am totally satisfied. Great product!"	5.0	Fantastic!	2010-12-16	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2YWEG35UMPBJ3	"L. Harris ""skytag"""	"I have the first season on DVD and now on Blu-ray and I've compared them using the OPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray player and a Samsung 46"" 120Hz LCD.The majority of the video is sharp as a tack. I don't see how it could be any better. There are a few short scenes that are exceptions to this, but I think those involve effects such as the scene when they beam onto the planet in The Man Trap. If you watch the original versions, all of the exterior shots, such as Enterprise flybys look pretty bad. Exterior shots and flybys seem to comprise the bulk of the new effects shots.The good video is sharper than the SD DVD video upconverted on my OPPO, which uses Anchor Bay's VRS technology, but the difference is not like night-and-day. The bad video on DVD is still bad in original versions on Blu-ray. The scenes redone for this high-def release look great, but they just look ""wrong"" to me. They don't look wrong because they look clean and new, but because they are done from different perspectives and angles. They didn't redo the old shots, they created completely different shots. The Enterprise might have flown by left-to-right at a distance in the original, but in the new version it might be flying straight at you and fill the screen.Furthermore, some of the new scenes seemed out of place. One second you're looking at a state-of-the-art CG shot of the Enterprise orbiting a planet, and the next you're on the bridge looking at razor-sharp images of displays that were obviously thin sheets of translucent material that weren't even flat. I think the overall effect would have been better had they made more of an effort to maintain continuity with the overall feel of the rest of the show when creating the new shotsIn the end the new scenes felt more like curiosities than improvements.In the final analysis for me this doesn't offer much over the DVD versions other than the extras (the DVD releases had none). While there's an enjoyable aspect to seeing everything in ultra-crisp detail, it doesn't really add significantly to the overall enjoyment for me. I watched these shows on broadcast TV when they were first aired in the late 1960s. The difference between what I saw then on a 25"" tube TV and what I see when I watch an upconverted DVD on my HDTV is huge. The difference between that and Blu-ray is far less, and unlike people who seem more interested in state-of-the-art effects than plot and character development, my main source of joy in watching Star Trek doesn't come from my ability to count the pores in Leonard Nimoy's skin.I've docked this a star for three reasons. First, for completely changing shots in the newly created scenes and what I felt was a lack of effort in maintaining continuity with them. Second, because the menus seem kludgey. There's no menu screen with a list of all episodes on a disk. Instead, the episodes are presented in a small area of the screen, one episode at a time. And finally, I'm not convinced there's enough value here if you already own these on DVD. If that's the case, this is an upgrade, but to me not a compelling upgrade. If I'd seen this before buying it I'm not sure I would have bought it.I realize a lot of people will probably disagree with my take on this, as a lot of Star Trek fans seem opposed to any criticism of anything thing Star Trek, but that's my take as someone who has been a fan for over 40 years. Even now, more than 40 years later, it's still about the stories and the characters for me."	4.0	Nice, but overrated	2009-05-21	2	2	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2WKUY956JAW6T	"Listen2me ""PaulG"""	"After reading the reviews here about this movie, I simply have to comment about the apparent cost of this set of disks. This release is not merely a transfer to Blu-Ray, which is, in and of itself, an expensive technology, nor a mere digital remastering of the original masters. This release incorporates total digital re-engineering of the soundtrackAND a totally alternate version on the same disk in which the special effects were redone with todays CGI capabilties. I watched a video with a side-by-side comparison of the old effects and the new CGI. It was very impressive and should be considered a new authoring of the original series. For those purists who say this is a bastardization of the original series, I would have to agreesave the fact that this rendition with the new CGI can be ignored if onewishes. Both versions are immediately available to switch back and forth, thereby rendering that argument without merit. This represents a new enhancement technique which adds entertainment value to the original series, and at no small expense. Probably the ultimate outcome of such change will be the creation a new ""Generation"" of fans who watch the enhanced version while many of the parents will remain loyal to the original cheezy matte-photography effects incorporated in the original.After all, production-values of a particular era are part ofthe fun of watching classic movies and television, are they not?So, as they used to say, ""You pays your money and you takes your choice"". This is an interesting concept which will more than likely be reproduced in other remasterings of original productions."	5.0	You Get What You Pay For	2009-04-24	9	8	1

Sachartoff	I've been a fan since day 1 in the 1960s, and have seen how Paramount has over-charged for the various incarnations of the DVDs over the years of sale. Let's remember that Paramount has long recovered the initial production costs of these products. Back in the '60s, the actors and production crew didn't have the royalty contracts of today (which still remunerate the various talents at a fraction of what the studios make on the products). So, Paramount, in knowing of our loyalty and love of Star Trek, has preyed upon those qualities for many years.Enter the new HD versions of TOS. I have seen them on local T.V.; they're gorgeous! The effects when I first saw them blew me away! The re-worked music brought tears to my eyes; what a treat! However, this loyal fan AND shareholder of Viacom stock will not continue to contribute to the blood-suckers at CBS/Paramount. I will enjoy the TOS episodes on local T.V. and also my TOS DVDs at home; I urge all to boycott this continued abuse of the Star Trek fanbase.	2.0	Paramount sucks more blood from the fans!!!	2007-10-29	20	7	13

Wilson ""Rusted Knight"""	I waited several weeks to order the first season Blu-ray until Amazon decided the reports of problems with the audio were corrected.  Well, the visuals are amazing, the enhanced special effects are all other reviewers have said and the audio is beautiful EXCEPT for the volume levels, those are beyond annoying.  I have to run my levels down to 22 on my receiver when in the menu screen and then up to 54 to hear the program.  This compares to my normal setting of 30 to 33 for music, FM radio, other Blu-ray's and DVD's and over the air network TV (excluding commercials on ABC but that is another story).  As much as I enjoyed watching the first season and as much as I would like to have the whole set I'm going to pass on purchasing them.	3.0	Beautifully done visuals, audio volume is the pits	2010-06-29	6	4	2
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A25KKXUQQ0OLWB	"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher"""	I gave this DVD set to my brother for Christmas a few years ago and now that he has Blu-Ray, it was re-gifted.  It was wonderful to revisit this show and experience the excitement of Star Trek.  I was little when the show came out and I used to lay on my father's stomach while he sat in his reclining chair.  Later when I was older, I used to watch the reruns every day at 5 p.m. before dinner.  Star Trek looks great on DVD and the show was restored nicely.  The first season is definitely Star Trek's best season and contains the bulk of its classic shows such as The City on the Edge of Forever.  Yeoman Janice is on hand in the first episodes and she was one of my favorite characters.  The Menagerie is still my favorite episode in two parts.  A wonderful show.	5.0	Just A Great Show	2010-01-29	2	1	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2KI0LAYW1AM7R	Machina	This is my first time watching Star Trek TOS and I'm glad to see it first in HD. I love Star Trek, and this is a great season. However, I give this package three stars, not the four stars above.Even though the case looks fancy, it isn't practical. Spock would have been disappointed. It takes up too much space, doesn't look good next to other HD DVDs, and requires too many steps in order to access a disc:1. Open the plastic case2. Take out the yellow box3. Slide out the discs holder, being careful not to touch the first disc4. Select your disc using the convenient, book-like discs holder5. Put the discs holder back in the yellow box to protect it from dust6. Carefully place the box back in the case and close it (optional)Second,I don't like the HD DVD/DVD combo feature because all it does is raise the price of the HD DVD. I shouldn't have to pay extra for the feature I'm not going to use. It also means the discs won't have nice cover art, which would be a much easier to identify them.Third, a booklet would have been much more convenient to tell you the episodes in each disc than a bunch of plastic slides. The plastic slides are annoying to slide them back in the case. There are five cumbersome pieces, which can make it difficult to handle.Fourth, this second order, which replaced the damaged first order, is also slightly damaged and defective. I just can't seem to get a good one.Despite the package, the content and image quality is great with few exceptions. Some of the new CGI scenes look a too clean for the rest of the episode, which contains grain. During the intro, Kirk's voice sounds much lower than the orchestra. I still don't understand why the intro is missing the Soprano, which is talked about in the special features. The menu's are a pain to navigate on the HD DVD side because you can't view all the choices at once. The DVD side is better, but why.It's obvious this is a rushed product.	4.0	Star Trek is great, package is not.	2007-12-06	2	2	0

Paramount couldn't (OR WOULDN'T, I bet) get video licensing rights for the song.  So they looped in a dorky song whose lyrics begin ""I remember you . . .""Problem is, the melody for ""Goodnight, Sweetheart"" is also used when Kirk keeps Edith from falling down the apartment stairs, and after Kirk keeps McCoy from saving Edith from being run over.  So, instead, Paramount looped in sappy arrangements of the ""I Remember You"" song.  YUCK!Happy Days!

The images are sharper, and the animated scenes--those of the Enterprise in space, the view screen, and so forth--have been updated.  While they are limited by what they can do for the set shots, individual characters, etc, what they have achieved is to make it a more believable, and less-cheesy science-fiction.  Examples: when the bridge view screen is projecting an aft-view, we see the warp nacelles, something we never saw in the original footage.  In &#34;Space Seed&#34;, we see true derelict vessel alongside the Enterprise, damaged, with meteor burns.  In &#34;The Menagerie&#34;, when Commodore Mendez is showing Kirk General Order 7, we can see the orders clearly on the outside cover, and when he unlocks the document, if you pause the video, you can actually read the document.  This degree of resolution was never present when the show originally aired, nor when it was in broadcast syndication.	5.0	Star Trek Original Series Remastered	2014-01-22	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2M3834208NP3X	Mark Sheridan	I normally only review books but I thought this set was worth making a few comments on. First off I like the packaging and the menu graphics are stunning. However I do have a slight quibble (*no that's not a tribble with the shakes !!!) and it concerns the quality of the video. Now I'm in New Zealand so this may only apply to the Region 4 set, but I have noticed that by comparison with the individual DVD sets the picture quality on the box set is not as good. Five years ago when Paramount released disks with two episodes on I managed to get a couple, and it was stated they were substantially enhanced by digitally reprocessing the original masters. I've compared the visual images of those disks and found them to be much cleaner, with all the scratches, hair lines, and film marks removed. When I looked at the box set version many of the episodes don't appear to have been cleaned up at all, in fact I have commercial videos from a few years back that also have superior picture quality to what appears on this set. I am quite frankly shocked by this and would therefore warn fans to think about what they really want before buying this set (*though as I mentioned this may only effect sets produced outside the US). It is entirely possible that different regions used different masters, which would account for this variation in quality, but personally I think this is a blatant misrepresentation of the product by Paramount since clearly many of these episodes have not been digitally enhanced to the same level as the previously released individual disks. I have always been a huge fan of the Original Series so naturally I am not sorry I brought this box set, from a financial point of view it is still the best way to purchase this material, but for die hard fans I would also suggest you think seriously about buying your favourite shows separately. That way you will get the full advantage of the digital enhancement process. Live long and prosper !!!!	4.0	Love the menu graphics, but ...	2004-09-19	22	19	3

Season One,"" ""The Birth of a Timeless Legacy,"" ""Sci-Fi Visionaries,"" ""Billy Blackburn's Treasure Chest: Rare Home Movies"" and ""Kiss 'N' Tell: Romance in the 23rd Century.""Exclusive to the Blu-ray will be Starfleet Access, which presents picture-in-picture and pop-up trivia tracks on six complete episodes (including the show's pilot, ""The Menagerie Parts 1 & 2"")."	3.0	Star Trek: The Original Series Season 1 Contents	2009-02-26	58	36	22
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2OKKFM01BIUGR	Mark TV Fan	As a lifelong fan of the original series, I was on the fence on this 'updating' of original episodes.  Sometimes, newer isn't better.  But, having seen a handful in syndication, I was happily surprised to see how great the episodes looked and the obvious care taken to stick to the original vision.  The effects are better than ever!  Planets that look like planets!  Ships that look like they belong in the 23rd century!  Flaws from the '60s original have been corrected and enhanced.  These upgrades don't distract from the original; they only make the episodes better!  I look forward to seasons 2 & 3 so my collection will be complete.

A durable set-up that is light years ahead of the cardboard packaging used on other sets that is so easily damaged. Also, I would estimate that all three seasons combined will take less than 1/4 the space of the previous series released in two-episode keep cases.

Sure, save shelf space and some money over the original outrageous two episode per DVD release.  But why buy again unless the additional material is worth picking up?

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"The Program:If I could find something new to say about Star Trek, that would be a feat in itself. Let it suffice to say that it's the most successful TV sci-fi franchise of all time, was a pioneering show in many respects, and is just darned entertaining to watch, whether you're a ""true believer"" or not.Season One of the Original Series is a great place to start for newbies and fanatics alike. We are introduced to the Romulans, Klingons, Khan, Starfleet, the Federation of Planets, and the whole crew short of Chekov, who appears in Season Two. We are presented with 29 episodes, at least 6 of which are absolute masterpieces, and another 10 of which are really, really good. In this package, you'll get classics such as ""The City on The Edge of Forever,"" ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" ""Balance of Terror,"" ""The Menagerie,"" ""The Devil In The Dark,"" and ""Space Seed."" Overall, it's the Original Series' strongest season, and it only has two real clunkers in the group (""Shore Leave"" and ""The Galileo Seven"").There's really not a whole lot to be faulted in this season. It's an absolutely rock solid item for any Trekkie, and indeed any sci-fi fan, to own.The Blu-Ray:So the question becomes, how is the presentation?Well, it should be said right off the bat that the HD transfers of these shows are absolutely sparkling. Detail is through the roof, making every smile line, button and dial, star, and ship detail just pop right off the screen. Black levels are rock solid, especially in space scenes. Color saturation is deeper than deep, and bright colors are radiant in a way that the previous DVDs just can't replicate. The show is presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio - thank goodness CBS/Paramount didn't try to stretch these shows in a manner similar to many ""HD"" rebroadcasts of older shows on cable.The Original Series was shot on 35 mm film stock, which has more detail than any 480i TV broadcast can resolve (or 480p DVD for that matter). Thus, it is truly benefited by a high definition transfer. This isn't a release where you look at it and say ""well, it looks pretty good for what it is."" In fact, it has just as much fine detail and the same superior color as the newest shows currently broadcast on TV in HD. And it really does blow away the previous DVDs, too. There are, of course, a few shots here and there that betray their age. This is just the nature of the beast when dealing with 40 year old celluloid elements. But all told, a good 90% of the shots are competitive with modern HD. So as far as a video rating goes, it's at least 4 star material on average.Audio is a tad problematic. Some of the sound balancing seems to be a bit off - dialogue can have a tough time keeping up with music and sound effects. It's perfectly clear, don't get me wrong. But I found myself fiddling with the volume controls more than I'd like throughout an episode. On the other hand, the audio in general is great. The re-recorded theme song is breathtaking - especially when the Enterprise ""wooosh-es"" by from the front speakers to the rear surrounds. Red Alert klaxons and atmospheric sounds generally are mixed towards the surround channels. It's very cool.Special effects sequences have been redone with modern CGI and in high definition. For the most part they look great, and it is quite refreshing in the era of the ""Lucas-ing"" (or is it Abrams-ifying?) of old material that the producers of the new effects went to such great lengths to respect the original design aesthetic of the 1960's material. I will say I kind of wish they had done new model work, as CG still just isn't to the point where it looks ""real"" (setting aside the fact that this is inherently unreal stuff being filmed...). But I understand that it would never have been done in that case, since it costs so much more these days to do model work as opposed to CGI. On balance, having new effects is much more good than bad.But the kicker, and the reason it would be no big deal even if one hated the new effects, is the fact that the original effects are on the same disc. You can watch an entire show with the old or new effects, or, if you'd prefer to irritate your friends and significant others, switch between them in real time with the ""angle"" button on your remote. Are you paying attention, George Lucas? This is what we want in a Star Wars Blu-Ray! The beautiful new with the respected old, side-by-side. Big kudos go to CBS/Paramount and the Trek team for the job they've done here.Also included are several extra features. Mini-documentaries, mostly reprised from the previous DVD set, are included one on each disc. The ""pop-up"" text commentary from the DVD has been retained as ""Starfleet Access,"" a combination video-text commentary. The videos are nice, but they talk over the audio from the episode, whereas the older text commentary did not interfere with the audio. I wish both could have been included. New features include a mini-doc on the HD restoration and effects, and a set of ""home movies"" from an extra on the Trek set. Especially cool is an interactive ""tour"" of the original series Enterprise, showing many nooks and crannies not often seen or discussed, on the same gorgeous HD CGI model that the new shots use. All in all, a healthy set of extras.The packaging is nowhere near as bad as some previous DVD Trek seasons, but it still has its issues. Why can we not be presented with episode titles on each disc? The discs are just blank silver paint, with loads of empty space that helpful titles could have occupied. Instead, the episodes are listed on the INSIDE of the Blu-Ray insert, and are covered by both the filler material in the front, and by a disc in back. Being required to pop out a disc to see the contents of three more is really not convenient.*****The audio niggles and the packaging stupidity might be enough to make some downgrade this to a four star rating. I am swayed however, by the consistently good (and occasionally astounding) HD clarity of the video, and the wonderful options for old and new special effects. The other things are minor issues in the scheme of things. This is a tremendously good presentation of an absolutely seminal television show and science fiction saga. The respect with which the ""restoration"" was handled is truly commendable.Any Trekkie/Trekker who has a Blu-Ray player should own this set. It's just that simple. If you are just a general sci-fi fan, you also should give this serious consideration."	5.0	Spectacular visuals, nice extras, a few quibbles	2009-05-04	541	523	18

I'll be watching them this weekend since there are really no shows on Friday or Saturday.The reason this got the stars it did: The price from Amazon was perfect.  Maybe I didn't pay attention to the quality rating though.The reason I knocked off two stars from perfect: The quality from Amazon was absolutely atrocious.Now that I'm done with the summary, let me give you some details.  First, there are sellers who are selling this new for about $115 shipped; which is a great price.  I got mine for $107 shipped with Amazon Prime, and I don't regret paying that price as it was almost 25% off Amazon's full price.  The problem, you ask?  Let me count the ways:1: The outer plastic case was not only cracked, it was partially shattered.  Pieces were all over the place.  It's basically unusable now.2: two of the disk holders were fractured at the corner.That's all that needs be said.  Now I can't really complain - the price was right and honestly, all I care about is the movie itself - but I would figure, since this came directly from Amazon that they would quality control it a bit better, or at the very least, refurbish it or something.UPDATE 12/22: So now I've had an opportunity to actually watch some of these.  I stand by my original stars.  The picture and sound quality is superb but both the order and continuity of the episodes leaves a lot to be desired.  Where's the Captain Pike ""prologue"" episodes where Spock was over-acting?  Where he first went to Talos IV?

Well what I say is that I'm still surprised how well this show holds up after being aired almost 50 years ago. The &#34;re-mastered&#34; effects are certainly a welcome improvement here but the writing and acting are still good even after the test of time. Yes, it has some 60's sensibilities but the it is so much better put together than the new Star Trek movies which have weak dialog and character development. With all that's been said over the years of Shatner's over-acting / over-dramatizing he gets a bum rap when it comes to this show. He and the other talented cast &#34;make&#34; this show in spite of low-budget / low-tech special effects (which are made much better in this re-mastered version).	5.0	Still the best Star Trek even after almost 50 years...	2014-06-19	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A27JJILLBKWIR9	"Megarat ""a well-intended critic"""	"If you're considering purchasing this DVD set, then I'm assuming you're familiar with the show (or purchasing it for someone who is), so I won't bother critiquing the content.i've been having a ball with this DVD set.  it's superb.  it's a great collection, complete with the episode ""trailers"" and the whole ball of wax.  it's like a time capsule from the 60s.  for fans of the original series, I can't recommend it highly enough.The greatest complaints about this set seem to concern:  the packaging; the lack of voluminous amounts of commentary; and the fact that the picture doesn't look pristine; that the episodes are sorted by airdate, not stardate; the price.  My opinions, to whit:(1) packaging:  my greatest reluctance about purchasing this box set concerned the packaging:  i have a tight little shelf for my DVD collection, and a big dopey plastic lunchbox probably wouldn't fit.  i was delighted to see that the lunchbox has the same aspect ratio as a regular-sized DVD case, although it is slightly thicker.  yes, the book of discs that fits inside the lunchbox is tape-bound, but i'm not tuned off by that, and the quality seems reasonable.  sure, i'd probably prefer a regular cardboard slipcase for this set, but i think the packaging is only silly, not completely stupid; besides, you're paying for what's on the discs, so you'd be a snob to let the packaging completely turn you off.(2) commentaries:  personally, i think commentary and extra-special gee-whiz features are overrated, so i'm the wrong person to voice up on this.  the pop-up text commentary is amusing/interesting, but on occasion, factually wrong.  i haven't seen any of the extra featurettes.  personally, i'm happy there isn't any voice commentary, as the cost of producing them would drive up the price of the set, and i'm starved enough for time to just watch the episodes by themselves.(3) pristine picture:  give me a break.  this was made for television almost forty years ago.  i'm watching this on a 42"" PDP and i think it looks fabulous.  yes, some of the effects shots are grainy (because of they fact that they had to be re-photographed so many times, such were the special effects of the 60s), and sure they could be cleaned up with many many *many* hours of laborious digital wizardry, but (1) guess who's going to end up paying for that?  you guessed it:  the consumer.  (2) i'll repeat myself:  these special effects are from the 60s.  would hours of digital wizardry *really* be worth it?  personally, i'm revelling in the program's vintage and enjoy watching it in its original glory.  once you start restoring things, you run the danger of crossing the line and becoming a wingnut like George Lucas and bastardizing the original product.(4) airdate vs. stardate order:  you'll either want it one way or the other, and if it's not published to your taste, then just watch the episodes in a different order.  big deal.  personally i think watching the episodes in airdate order is much more interesting.  i'm watching these episodes for the first time in over a decade, so it's almost like watching the series all over again from scratch.  and by watching them in airdate order, i can expose myself to the same chronology as the original viewers, which shapes the universe, character development, etc.  yeah, there's some discontinuity, but i would be surprised if people noticed it much back then.  each order gives you a slightly different perception of the characters, their dynamic, and the Star Trek universe; i find the order in which the series was originally presented to be the most interesting, but that's just me.(5) The price:  let's do the math:  29 episodes, 50 minutes apiece.  that's 24+ hours total; about 16 full-length movies worth of content, and i'm not counting the commentary or the trailers.  if the average movie costs $13, this comes out at twice the value.to summarize, i was reluctant to shell out the big money for this set for many reasons, but i'm exceedingly happy that i did."	5.0	Oh happy day!	2004-12-30	19	17	2

Of course, you need some imagination to get past the papier-mache ""rocks"" on alien planets.  Special effects weren't too sophisticated in those days!That said, the plots are just as much fun, and sometimes psychologically intense, now as they were then.  My husband, who was too intellectual for this show when it first came out, is really into it now.  I've turned him into a Trekkie!I only wish that, in general, they would get this streaming technology down.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A334DYKDLA9K8L	"M. G. Mora ""Bad Wolf"""	Over the years Paramount has charged more than any other studio charges for box sets but being a fan bought them (TOS, TNG,DS9 and Voyager) anyway, reluctantly, because of the high price.So what does Paramount do when they have run out of Series priced at over a hundred dollars a pop? They start remastering the original show and hike the price up even more. This is for product that has essentially been released already so why not a substantially lower price? They want a higher bonus for Christmas this year?The effects themselves? Pretty darn cool and this is coming from someone who thought they would distract from the show itself like Lucas' effects in the Star Wars movies when he redid them.If you have the money, buy them I guess but would rather people Not buy them so Paramount will have to lower the price.	2.0	Paramount sticks it to the fans again	2007-09-14	22	6	16
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"When Paramount Home Video first started to release the original series of ""Star Trek"" in 1999, I was aghast at the fact that only one DVD with two episodes per DVD were being released one DVD at a time at a very high cost.  The cost to own all 40 volumes (DVD's) was staggering.  Of course, this doesn't even address the amount of shelf space required for all 40 DVD's.Now, with this repackaged version, all 29 episodes of the first season are being released together on 8 disks.  This is the packaged version of the original ""Star Trek"" that I fully intend to purchase because even at full list price, the cost of owning the first complete season is less than half the cost of owning its earlier cousin on an equivalent 13 DVD's.  Also, I expect that the packaging itself will be designed similarly to the packaging used for other ""Star Trek"" series released in complete seasons, meaning that it will only require a small amount of shelf space.  It would also appear that extra documentary and commentary material not released originally will be included in this complete season box set.The original series of ""Star Trek"", that ran for three complete seasons between 1966 and 1969, started a franchise that has included six television series and ten big screen motion pictures.  The main original characters of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Lt. Commander/Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard H. 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999), Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Lt. Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Keonig from 1967-1969), Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney from 1966-1967) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) have become an inseparable part of Americana.  Though series creator Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) was not able to keep the original series alive for five seasons as originally envisioned (it was cancelled after its third season), he, along with the countless series fans, was able to resurrect it in the form of six motion pictures beginning in 1979 and the first series spin-off, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1987, which ran for seven years and had spin-offs of its own.  There was also a 22-episode animated version based upon the original series that ran from 1972 to 1974.The most memorable episodes of the first season include ""The Man Trap"", ""Charlie X"", ""Where No Man has Gone Before"", ""The Naked Time"", ""Mudd's Women"" (which introduced the character Harcourt Fenton 'Harry' Mudd, as played by Roger C. Carmel, 1932-1986), ""Miri"", ""The Corbomite Maneuver"", ""The Menagerie"" (parts 1 and 2, which used the original unaired pilot ""The Cage"" as its basis), ""The Conscience of the King"", ""Balance of Terror"", ""Shore Leave"", ""The Squire of Gothos"", ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"", ""Court Martial"", ""Space Seed"" (the inspiration for the 1982 film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn""), ""A Taste of Armageddon"", ""This Side of Paradise"", ""The Devil in the Dark"", ""Errand of Mercy"", ""The City of the Edge of Forever"" (the only Emmy Award-winning episode with guest star Joan Collins as Edith Keeler) and ""Operation: Annihilate!"".  The only truly awful episode during the entire first season was ""The Alternative Factor"".  Since an exhaustive list of what this 8-DVD set has is not yet available, I do not yet know whether the unaired pilot ""The Cage"" is included, but I hope that it is.Overall, I rate the 8-DVD set of ""Star Trek: Original Series Season 1"" with an anticipatory 5 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, this is how Paramount should have released the original series to begin with.  Thank you Gene Roddenberry for taking all of us ""where no man has gone before""."	5.0	Fantastic!

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A35CC8V4H1JN0J	Michael Brown	This isn't really a review of the series, which of course gets 5 stars.  Rather, it's a response to all the whingers complaining about how they got ripped off on the original, two episodes per disc releases.Tough for you!  But, as another reviewer said, nobody put a gun to your head, did they?  If you had more money that sense back then, that's your problem.Want to know why Paramount did that rip-off release in the first place?  Take a look in the mirror!  They knew that suckers like you would cough up over the odds, just as they knew they'd cash in again in the future with proper box sets.  Something else: if people like you hadn't bought those original releases in the first place then we probably would have had these box sets years ago.  So, you were not only fools to yourselves; you screwed it up for the rest of us too!  No sympathy (is that coming across, at all?)Another comment, for those people who say that the episodes are in air date order instead of production order.  They're DVDs!  You can play 'em in whatever order you like!!!  Check out web fan sites, and you'll easily find the correct production order listed somewhere.  Try [...] for instance.  To be honest though, it doesn't make too much difference if you play them in air date order, except that Where No Man Has Gone Before should be your Episode One (at least, until The Cage finally makes an appearance, anyway).	5.0	To all the whingers	2004-08-23	31	8	23

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1GR95DV4QS4BJ	Michael E. Caldwell	"Being a huge Star Trek fan since I was old enough to sit up in front of the TV watching TOS reruns, I was blown away by the remastered quality of this DVD set.  I'm sure anyone who has a favorite episode can attest to that.  Two standouts for me are ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday"" and ""The Doomsday Machine"" (Season 2).  Both of these are captivating in their original broadcast form, but the remastered (read: new) SFX shots of the Enterprise struggling to attain orbit with an Air Force jet in pursuit, and the multiple angled shots of the Enterprise and Constellation, having been attacked by the Doomsday Machine, are of such quality, I felt like I was watching a preview of the upcoming ""Star Trek"" film.  The Enterprise, while not becoming a victim of ""big screen surface detailing,"" now has a believeable mass and weight as she cruises thru space, and the various ""beauty pass"" shots in space as well as in orbit had me jumping up and down like I was at a Pistons game!  The sound quality now lets one feel the danger when the ship lurches violently to and fro, throwing people all about the bridge.  Even quiet moments give new perspective on the characters and guest stars' roles.  I feel that the more adventure-driven episodes pack the most punch, though!  I can't wait for Season 3 to see how the treatment has been applied to those great episodes, especially ""Turnabout Intruder."""	4.0	Tomorrow Is Yesterday	2008-10-02	0	0	0

What I like about it is that they kept the same feel of the show (Like remember when they are on a planet and the background is all one color and seems to stop right at the dried bushes or rocks.  Well that is the same) but when you see the Enterprise it is crisp, clear, looks nice and the planets when they are orbiting look good with land masses and other things.  (In the original because of tech back then it was a green planet or an orange planet,)  You should watch a few of these I am sure you would like them.	5.0	Its Star Trek for God's sake	2013-05-15	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2YFFQQ2100DKO	"Michael Giltz ""Michael in New York"""	"The reboot of Star Trek with a new feature film is just great. I was very concerned when the first trailer had that goofy shot of a pre-teen James Tiberius Kirk ditching a sports car off the side of a cliff. But the movie delivers and looks even more impressive on a second viewing.If you've seen the film three times already, perhaps the best way to satiate your ST fix is Star Trek: The Original Series Season 1 on BluRay ($129.99; Paramount). This has every option I wanted in the standard DVD release. You get the entire first season in sterling new prints and sound (stereo or mono) and best of all you don't have to choose between the classic edition and the revamped all-new-special-effects version (which I despise). The set comes with both, along with a host of extras. It's a little more expensive than the most recent standard DVD version, but since you get both versions of the TV show (rather than just the spruced up new version), to me it's a better value. And it really does look smashing. A host of Star Trek DVDs come out the week after the movie opens as well, including BluRay boxed sets of the movies and ""best of"" DVDs for the various TV shows that only contain four episodes each. (What's the point of that?) But this is the original TV series done right."	4.0	Catch up with the iconic original series	2009-06-19	2	0	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2RON2TEBN7S5X	Michael Mykita	While the original Star Trek didn't have a lot of slick special effects it was, and still is, one of the greatest science fiction series of all time.  Remember that this show was being created when the Earth was involved in a space race to land on the moon.  We believed we were entering the &#34;Space Age.&#34;  On hindsight, we were entering the Computer Age, but the show can't be faulted for that subtle miscalculation.  The writers were concerned with a future set of challenges to mankind, imagining a world where we have peace, ended world hunger, etc. and are now faced with a new set of circumstances and conflicts as we venture into space and discover new worlds.  Of course, many scripts were designed to be subtle statements on current issues, abstracted into an alien story that hides the (then) current social statements being expressed.In a similar fashion to the recent popularity of &#34;steampunk,&#34;  the Victorian view of the future, I find it interesting to see the 1960's view of the future.  The new popularity of color TV caused the show to be presented in bright primary colors (everyone on the ship wears either red, yellow, or blue).  The forward-thinking of the show imagined females serving equally with men, but somehow still imagined them in beehive hairdos, wearing mini-skirts and go-go boots.The show is good sci-fi, good retro TV, and just plain fun.  I can't recommend it more highly.	5.0	A great beginning and an echo of it's era.	2014-01-03	0	0	0

I feel for people who wasted all the money buying the 2 episode disks, but I admit that while it is wonderful to have the entire season in one set and the quality is pretty good, I am thouroughly disappointed with the packaging.  It's less of a hassle than the TNG sets which I can never keep the little book from falling out or I have to set it on the floor to open it to the disk I need to get to, but this pack is junky and doesn't fit in my shelving very well.  Also at the price, I was disappointed they couldn't come up with a audo commentary on each episode.  All the cast but one are still alive and from the interviews so are many writers and directors of original episodes.  Text commentaries are ok, but these weren't all that imformative in any case.  Star Trek needs to take lessons from Dr. Who on text commentaries.  All and all I'd say go for this, but as I noted in some other reviews, there will probably be a super mega aniversary set to include all the stuff I want so you may want to wait until the mega ultimate fan-boy collector's gold trim multi-hold jumbo expanded edition comes out -- ha ha -- mike	4.0	Hate the package and not impressed with the extras	2004-10-05	18	14	4

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3Q83VI243WI7U	Michael Topper	"I, fortunately, waited for Paramount to release TOS in series box sets rather than going through the painful and expensive process of buying all 40 original DVDs, knowing the studio's basic greediness backwards and forwards by that point and expecting just such an upgrade.  Still, for an upgrade it could have been better.  The bonus features are OK but where's the blooper reels (waiting for future season boxes)?  And why is the set so expensive compared to season box sets released by other studios?  Even at a discount price I paid much more than usual for a TV series season box.  There has been no visual upgrade from the remasters done in 1998 but I don't think there will be a need to, as the 40-year old series looks about as good as it can get, I think.  The sound seems to be slightly improved, though.Of course, Star Trek: The Original Series' first season has passed into the annals of TV history as a cultural and almost historical milestone.  The first season is almost uniformly regarded as TOS's finest, with nary a weak episode (excepting the inexplicably edited and weakly acted ""The Alternative Factor"") and a host of seminal ideas, themes and characters introduced for the first time into the mass global consciousness.  The whole idea of a racially mixed crew (and look closely, it's not just Sulu and Uhura--the crewmembers who walk the decks are truly racially mixed in *every* way) was radical enough, let alone the ideas that were represented in each script.  Phasers, Klingons, Romulans, Vulcan neck pinches and warp drive were introduced into our vocabulary for the first time and have stuck for nearly a half-century, and have become so common that most people have forgotten how revolutionary they were at the time.  The attempted rape scene between Kirk and Rand in ""The Enemy Within"" may still send a shiver down the spine even given the context of TV-shock value today.  Overall, highly recommended, although Paramount could--and should--have done more to this perennial classic."	4.0	Could've been better, but still better than before	2004-09-19	17	15	2

There is no 'Play All' episodes mode, and each episode must be selected in a two-step selection process delayed by complex presentation graphics.As a standard feature, I believe that all multi-episode DVDs should support remote skipping and fast forward/reverse play between episodes as well as within episodes so that a whole disk can be viewed as if it were one long movie.I do not discount the utility of an episode selection mode, but I do not think that this should be provided without a general 'Play All' mode as well.

Unfortunately they were completely ruined by some genius that decided to try to &#34;fix&#34; the special effects. 90% of the charm of watching these shows is to see them as I saw them years ago, crappy special effects and all. Why would someone think that  replacing the bad (but charming) special effects of the 1960's with the slightly more sophisticated but utterly annoying, intrusive, and out-of-place effects of a second-rate 1990's CGI shop would improve these classic episodes is beyond comprehension. Every time one of these infuriatingly distracting effects shots would come on screen it was like getting punched in the gut. I had to stop watching. Whoever bastardized these classics with that disgusting CGI garbage committed the highest form of sacrilege. May the sci-fi gods have no mercy on your soul. Damn you a thousand times over.

Back then, it was George Lucas who was raking everyone over the coals with multiple releases of the Star Wars Trilogy--first Dollby, then remastered THX, then wide-screen versions, then remastered THX wide-screen versions with the additional new footage and updated interviews.  Now it would seem that Paramount has decided to revisit this marketing scheme with the Original Star Trek series, as well as the movies.

The HD concept was created to display movies at home -- large and widescreen with good enough resolution to avoid distraction.This is a TV show.  Even though paramount says it was remastered, it must have been shot in 4:3 format.  This HD version is still 4:3.  Why pay a bunch of money for improved resolution?  So, you can use the zoom feature and fill the black, side-bar area?  I don't think so.I LOVE Star Trek and have watched all the series for years.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2F3M93RRLFQNJ	mrliteral	"I sometimes think there are three stages in the life of a Star Trek viewer.  As a child, you're fascinated with all the neat monsters and lasers, especially if you grew up when the show was first in syndication and there was little like it.  When you're in your late teens or twenties, you become more jaded, realizing the effects are rather crude and the acting a bit hammy (or for a minority, you go in the opposite direction and become a die-hard Trekkie).  Finally, you get a little older and you learn to look beyond the faults and re-realize just how fun the show was.The Complete First Season of Star Trek features 29 episodes plus a few bonus features.  For me, many of the episodes were vaguely familiar, even if they hadn't been seen in twenty years or more; others seemed completely new.  Although not presented in original broadcast order, they generally move from the beginning to the end of the season.Of course, the central character in the series is William Shatner's Captain James Kirk, but almost as important are the half-Vulcan, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and DeForrest Kelley's Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy.  These two act as rivals for Kirk's ear, the former representing the coldly logical approach to problems and the latter the more irrational humanistic approach.  In the end, Kirk is the one making the choice, however.  Other series characters are rather minor, even if they recur. Uhura, Sulu and Scotty only rarely add much to any story.Not every story is fantastic, and 29 is too many to individually review, but I will comment on a couple.  The Corbomite Maneuver shows Kirk at his best, taking on a vastly more powerful alien with little more than his wits.  The Galileo Seven features Spock in a key role as he tries to save a shipwrecked crew and realizes that hard choices will need to be made if any are to survive.  Shore Leave and Mudd's Women are a bit on the lighter side, but they never get completely silly.  And The City on the Edge of Forever - considered by many (including myself) as the best episode of the whole series - gives Kirk his greatest moral dilemma.Not every episode is good.  Errand of Mercy and A Taste of Armageddon both are a little over-the-top in their anti-war messages.  Miri suffers from both bad child actors and a huge plot hole:  the story takes place on a planet identical to Earth, but there is no reason why this should be the case.  Most episodes are good or great, however, and even these weak ones are still fun to watch.  In the end, you have to also take these episodes in the context of their time, and in this sense, the show was far above any other science-fiction show out there.  So if you're past that second stage of a Star Trek viewer's life, and you can look beyond the faults, this is well-worth watching."	5.0	Fun Classic TV	2007-02-04	3	3	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1AMVC4V396KER	"M. Shepherd ""Midwest"""	This is where it all began. Star Trek launched science fiction film into a new era. It had many selling points. The stories and plotswere intelligent and thought provoling. Laced with enough action/adventure to keep it from ploding. A great combination for goodentertainment. It also projected the future as a bright, hopeful place. Something that was really needed in the hippie/drug infested1960s. It also treated science fiction as a serious entertainment subject instead of goofy 90% fantasy like it normally was inthose days, and still is today all too often.Star Trek became the benchmark by which good science fiction in film was measured. And still is today. Still the original and bestof the lot.Some complain that the acting was not that good, and in some cases it wasn`t. But it was no worse than acting in general in tv showsof the time, or today for that matter. They may also complain that the special effects were not very good. But this isn`t the case.Remember that this was the mid 60s. For the time, they were pretty good. Especially considering the low tv budget they had to workwith.As far as space opera in tv, it has never been matched. Which is a real shame. It shouldn`t be that difficult.

With the upgraded picture and sound, as well as new special effects (which can be swapped out to see the original effects), make this a no brainer for any fan of the series.

Fans know that Star Trek has always been a little more than &#34;just&#34; a TV series.  Gene Roddenberry's vision has become legendary, and is worthy of such preservation efforts.I haven't seen the original episodes for a long time, and it's been a real kick to see them now in hi-def.  They are not wide-screen of course, because they were filmed in 4:3 for TV format.  But the details really stand out now, and the colors pop.  One thing that particularly stands out for me, is the detail of planet surfaces while in orbit.  I was amazed at how beautiful they look now.I also love having the entire season, watching the characters change over time as the actors settle into their roles and relationships, and build the characters.And just to settle an argument, while I respect Captain Jean Luc Piccard, Jim Kirk would kick his monkey butt all OVER the place, in a fair fight.

I was a bit worried about the enhanced effects I heard they were doing - I really thought it might alter the ""feel"" of the show.  I couldnt have been more wrong!  They really knew what they were doing here.  They enhanced some of the effects and re-did some of them [like shots of the Enterprise] using CGI instead of models to make it look more ""real"" and more in line with what we're used to today - BUT they did it totally in line with the look and feel of the original show.  Watching this I really thought THIS is what Gene Roddenberry would have done, if he could have.  This is really the way Gene intended the show to be seen.I can't imagine anyone who wouldnt be happy with this - as for the price - well, this kind of upgrade doesnt come cheap - but I thought - if you are a ST fan - it's well worth the money.

They could have put some more effort into equalizing the sound. Turning the volume up so you can hear the dialogue will result in being blown out of your chair when they cut scenes with music or throw in sound effects.  Turning the volume down to where the sound effects are acceptable leaves you completely unable to hear the dialogue.	4.0	Worth Buying	2009-05-21	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1NWGYYPOQWFR5	O. Fisher Jr.	"I started watching Star Trek beginning with its first episode in 1966. Then it was on a black & white TV. Didn't miss an episode. Later I purchased all the episodes through Columbia House video on VHS tapes. Until you see this in HD it's hard to explain. First, if you are a diehard and don't want to see any enhancements to the color, etc. you can see the episodes untouched. But for the rest of us . . .hold on to your captain chairs. They went back to the original music score and instrumentation and re-recorded the theme music complete with a Soprano singer and today's sound technology. Talk about depth and separation of sound. They also went back to the master film negative and corrected all imperfections (scratches, missed laser beams, etc.) Then they enhanced the contrast, brightness and color gamma. No more faded looking colors or missed skin tones! They made the planets look like planets instead of colored masses. Added a few extra fly-bys of the Enterprise with enhanced definition and different perspectives. Even added frames of the Enterprise laying probes from working bomb-bay style doors aft(only mentioned not shown orginally). You can also watch the episodes in enhanced and with a press of a button have it go split screen, showing unenhanced on the left and enhanced on the right. They made some additional enhanced graphics / definition in many scenes. I particularly liked the way they redid the ship leaving earth of the past. As they approached the sun it now increases in size as they draw near. It looks like a fireball with solar flares, and the ship ""banks"" around (instead of staying horizontal)just before whiplashing away. There is an additional hour long feature that discusses all the changes."	5.0	A Must Have for Star Trek fans	2009-05-24	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AEU6Z1ZFIRW2H	ollierobbers	It was always the case when the original two-episode DVD's were released that Paramount would eventually release Star Trek as a boxed set. This was reinforced when The Next Generation was released as season sets. So, now we have The Original Series Season 1, and as you may have read already, there's some very mixed reviews as to whether it's worth your hard earned dollars to buy.So, being upfront, I'm not really a huge Trek fan. I've enjoyed Star Trek ever since I was a kid, but I don't go much beyond that, and so it was pretty hard going to stump up the $85 to buy this box set - and that's after a 25% plus discount. Ouch.After coughing up my hard earned cash, I was eager to find out exactly what I got for my money. Well, the answer is every episode - minus the pilot - from the original Season One. I'm not quite sure why the pilot is missing. It would seem logical to include it in the set.Now unlike some others, I'm not bothered how they are ordered, or whether they are in airdate, or production date. I just want to know if they look good, and have good quality sound. And the answer to both of those questions is yes and yes. It's pretty clear that they haven't been restored by a dedicated team, but for what it's worth, the image quality is still pretty good with vibrant colors in some of the episodes, and on the whole good contrast, and a clear, well defined image. Audio wise, there's two soundtracks, one is a remastered Surround version, and the other mono. I always listen to the original mono - I guess I'm a traditionalist. There are no audio commentaries, which is a great shame.There's a single extras CD, which apparently has a few featurettes and the like, but I have yet to really take a look at it. There's also a very poor quality insert that briefly describes each episode, and that's about it. No production notes, or anything like that.The packaging, while on the outside looks good, is actually a huge letdown. On the individual cases, rather than use a push-style release for each DVD disc, Paramount have used horrible, cheap looking plastic cases, where the DVD is literally locked in place, and you end up bending the disc to get it free. No doubt, bending the DVD's reduces the lifespan, and you'll end up after a few years with a season box set that no longer plays. My advice? Get rid of the awful plastic case, and use after-market ones. Or, make a backup copy and use those for general viewing.All in all, it's a shame that Paramount feel that they can charge so much, for what is - at the end of the day - just another 1960's TV program. If it was anything else, you'd pay $50-60, but because it's Star Trek, you pay double that. When you consider the lack of extras such as commentaries and - outside of the gold plastic case - poor quality interior packaging, in the end it all feels like a real letdown.	3.0	A classic show, spoiled by price and packaging	2004-10-29	36	31	5

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1P73N5MSAR5I3	Omer Ahmad	Liking the original Star Trek epsodes isn't a really a debatable issue. You either love Star Trek or you can't stand it. I was raised on re-runs of the original show and still prefer it to all sci-fi since.Once your brain adjusts beyond the low budget effects and props you enter a world full of strange concepts and characters, tainted with the 60s concept of political correctness. The trinity of Kirk, Spock and Bones is the fulcrum of everything Star Trek. As you watch the series you notice the relationships of the actors grow and the roles develop. The is even one episode when Bones addressess the audiance directly, but you will need to buy the blue box set to see that. When I saw Star Trek as a child twenty years ago, I was totally hypnotized by this starnge world inside our television and I hid behind the sofa bacause I was scared of spock. Sincw then I have learned that in the 1960's programs like Star Trek were making social commentaries about all the problems we faced ranging from racism, sexism and politics through to the fear to being made reduntant because they have made a machine that can do your job.One day when I have kids, I will make them watch every episode (with me).	5.0	I am not a geek but I love Sar Trek	2006-04-30	4	1	3

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A12Y3GHRFRXBU	OperablePig	"In terms of content, this set is awesome. The episodes look and sound great, and they're all there.The series starts out a bit awkwardly with ""The Man Trap"", but quickly gets to classic episodes like ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". I would have liked to have ""The Cage"" preceding the first episode as part of this set, but at least it's included in the 3rd season boxset.I also didn't find the documentaries particulary outstanding, but they are at least informative and free of fluff.Two things irk me about this set: First, the menus - I personally get very weary of flashy CGI menus that play dramatic music every time you push a button. I'd like to be able to just choose an episode and watch it with the push of one button.Second, the packaging. It's just a poor design. I thought the Kirk-uniform-colored plastic case looked cool at first, but once you put it on a shelf with the spine out it looks like crap. It's also very awkward to open. Once you crack the thing open, there's a flimsy booklet and a cardboard slipcase inside about the size of a double CD. Inside the slipcase is an ugly hunk of clear plastic - the DVDs sit in jewel-case type trays which are all connected and which you flip through like a CD wallet.It's just too much of a process to get to one of the discs - I keep mine on the shelf w/o the plastic shell. The drawback to that is that if you don't pick it up carefully, the plastic case slips right out of the cardboard and hits the floor. There's also no good place to keep the booklet if you ditch the outer shell. While the booklet has episode summaries, it's very hard to read and quite poorly designed anyway. If money and space was no object, I would have opted for buying these episodes in the two-episode-per-disc format (each disc in it's own plastic case) to avoid this whole mess.Nonetheless, I am very excited to have the whole first season in my possesion all at once! I doubt this will be repackaged anytime soon, so it's worth owning. But try to find it used - the retail price, and even Amazon's price, is totally ridiculous."	4.0	not so sure about the packaging	2005-02-28	10	8	2
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2SA6LR78V49UV	"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!"""	Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, I just cant read anymore nonesense regarding this set or regarding HD in general. Its too expensive, Blah, Blah, HD DVD is Dead, Blah, Blah, Paramount ill come back to Blu Ray, Blah, Blah.....If you are a Star Trek TOS fan then do yourself a favor and stop listening to this kind of drivel and buy this set. It is just mind numbing how much work Paramount has really put into this sucker and the result is nothing short of spectacular. George Lucas could really learn a thing or two from Paramount and how they have handled upgrading this set. I have now had a chance to really sit down and spend a couple days with this sucker and it really is drop dead amazing. I never would have ever believed that Star Trek TOS could look so good and still retain all of the qualities that made it the huge phenomenon that it was. Paramount needs to be commended for not only what they did but also for what they didnt do and thus keeping the overall feeling of the show the same.For those that are complaining about the price, you obviously dont remembr how much these episodes were when they first appeared on SD DVD, and those didnt have any of the scanning, retouching or special effects work done to them that this set does. Considering that this set uses the HD DVD Combo or Hybrid disc and considering the amount of work that Paramount has put into these episodes and the special features that comes with the set, its actually a surprise that they arent more expensive especially given the high prices the Star Trek series has always commanded even on SD DVD. If this price is still too high for you simly wait 9-12 months before picking it up. Everyone knows tat prices on these things continue to drop the longer they are out. Simply be patient and buy other things in the mean time and a few years down the road you will be able to pick up the entire TOS series on HD DVD and for much cheaper. Those like myself that cant wait and have no problem paying this price, BUY IT and BUY IT NOW!!! Its just a stunning release right down to the package design. You wont be disappointed!!As for the people that keep calling HD DVD dead or keep saying to wait until Paramount comes back over to Blu Ray. Keep dreaming. That 18 month figure that alot of BD supporters are throwing around is 100% FUD and was started by some Blu Ray sites that I wont even mention here. The bottom line is you wont find a single soruce on the web backing that 18 month figure up and even Paramount themselves have come out and said that the move to HD DVD does not have a time limit on it and they have no plans to ever support Blu Ray again. As for HD DVD being dead, considering they just sold 100,000 players in a 2 day period and we havent even gotten to Black Friday yet, Well lets just say that anyone who thinks this war is over is simply a fool who is either so blinded by his loyalty to a particual side of this war that its clouding thier judgement or they simply have zero understanding of these markets and of format wars in general. The fact that HD currently only represents 6% of the total market is all anyone needs to look at to see that neither of these formats has won anything and that 94% of the market still has yet to decide what they are going to do.The bottom line is quit listening to all of the FUD spead on these boards by people whos obvious intention is to sway your purchasing dollars one way or the other and let common sense settle back into your heads. Neither of these formats is going anywhere anytime soon so stop worrying about it and enjoy some HD while the powers that be duke it out and what better way to enjoy HD then to pick up this amazing first season of Star Trek TOS. The previous releases of this show are so pathetic by comparison that I sit in awe at what an amazing job Paramount has done. I am so impressed by this series that I am buying 2 more of them for gifts ths christamas for my nephew and uncle who are like myself big fans of the show.So what are you waiting for, buy this sucker already!!! You wont be disappointed.	5.0	Dont Listen to the Haters, Buy This Set!!!	2007-11-21	12	9	3

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1400 minutes per box, you are looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is beautiful. Make sure to retain the cardboard holder that it sits into as this helps stability on the shelf (although the box can still stand alone the bottom is a little narrow). The shell cracks open down the centre to reveal a box. Sliding out of the box is a small booklet insert with discs in a well designed plastic holder that flip from disc to disc. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 8 discs in total. However the last disc, disc 8, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 30 episodes. The rest of disc 8 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Several of the shows come with a commentary. All the episodes have been remastered to the point that scratches and artefacts are hardly visible. The special effects have been touched up slightly (no strings), however they still retain an overall early look and feel, especially the initial episodes that have budget restrictions. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season One, is a fine example of the growing stages of any television series. Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed shows the vision shaping. Spock is the only character to be retained from the pilot episode `The Cage'. Kirk appears after this one. Chekov does not appear until Season Two. Yeoman Smith appears in quite a number of Season One episodes before retiring from the show. The little known Nurse Chapel also appears here as well as the other series. The Enterprise itself is a mere hunk of plastic that does not improve much until Season Two and is funny to see. There are very little space shots in Season One because of the limitations of visual effects. The main viewer of The Bridge looks like a projector screen and is avoided much of the time. When something does appear there it looks completely phoney... and funny. Spock's makeup design goes through a few changes. However, even though we can laugh at much of Season One now, the series does gel and soon we have some fascinating sci-fi theory and execution, even though what we are watching is the equivalent of a stage play. Nobody can critic the quality of the television acting and not since Flash Gordon had the world seen anything like it before. The stories (mostly by DC Fontana) are slightly narrow in their field of vision, however these where to mature in later seasons. Season One of TOS is mostly about alien illusions, shape shifters, psi-power, viruses, alternative universes, intergalactic slavery, military trials, deities, time travel and close hand to hand combat with aliens. There is also the unforgettable award winning `The City on the Edge of Forever' starring Joan Collins. `Operation: Annihilate!' has the flying face huggers type creatures that the movie `Alien' ripped off. Kahn appears in this series. We have both Klingons and Romulans also. The classic `Devil in the Dark' sees Kirk and Spock fight an underground cave monster. Kirk goes hand to hand with a giant reptile in the episode `Arena'. Surprisingly enough very few episodes actually contain all the characters at one time, including Sulu and Scotty.  This does not happen until Season Two and then occurs often in Season Three. In TOS Season One characters are sort of alternated from episode to episode. The bottom line for TOS: Season One is that it is a classic. Although it is not necessarily the best of the Seasons, it works well as a very good foundational study for Trekkies who will absolutely adore seeing the variations in design and theme. All in all this is the funny season for 21st century viewers. You are supposed to laugh at this one more than thinking about its topics. And what a laugh it is! Just watch Kirk roll about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume. How can you not want that!	5.0	THE Sci-fi Anthology of a Lifetime starts right here!	2005-10-10	33	28	5
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2XNORG2FYI43E	ozone	Normally I'd give it 5 stars, but it always depends on your point of view.  For instance, this is classic 1960's television.  The special effects are pretty bad by comparison to today.  They seemed to lack even CPR for dying characters.  Transporter technology doesn't really make sense. You can tear this thing apart in so many ways.  Or like me you can look back on it fondly as one of the few science fiction shows on television when it aired and embrace it's campiness.  Young people probably just wouldn't understand when put up against the new Star Trek movies (which I also love).  However, watching an episode of Star Trek gives me that warm, nostalgic feeling from days gone by.  It's like a little piece of history.  Some of the stories are really great and will remain timeless classics.The reason I gave it four stars is by remastering the originals, while it does make it look better, it takes away from the original graininess which makes it a little less nostalgic.  I'd rather see them as they were made.	4.0	I love the classics	2013-12-13	0	0	0

But all the science and technology and special effects are pleasant reminders of a simpler time in television.  What is important about this series is the human story.  Kirk and Spock and McCoy demonstrate the beautiful interplay of emotion, logic, humanity and leadership -- all at their best.  The crew of the Enterprise, and the entire Federation, were a people of high moral character and ethical behavior.  Never was a mean remark allowed to stand, nor a bad act go unpunished.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	ASRAVYVAANY7T	"Patrick S. Kelly ""Patrick S. Kelly"""	"OK, so I own all three seasons of this great TV program.  I'm a huge Star Trek fan and this newly remastered DVD series is a MUST own for any Trekkie. The majority of television critics (I guess that's who they are) insist that the first season of this program is the best of the three seasons.  Personally, I prefer the second season, but only by a hair.  The box containing the DVD's is a bit cumbersome to open and close, but it does look cool.  It contains ""trading cards"" with the episode menu and while they are cool, it can also be a bit awkward to shuffle through them to find a particular episode.  That's about the extent of any negative criticism that I have about this particular box set.  The revamped special effects and overall improved quality is brilliant and really brings a fresh new look without comprimising the integrity of the series/program itself.  In fact, it makes the whole show even better!  The colors are bright, clean, and sharp and there's no graininess.  I think the program can hold it's own against present television programs with every single special effect being generated by a mouse click on a computer.  I suppose the only other REAL criticism that I have is the PRICE!!!  It's very expensive!  I spent $35 on a new copy!  I can assure you that if it were not ""Star Trek"", I wouldn't pay that price.  I did it THREE times! Once for each season.  Fortunately for me, it's worth it!  I've never spent that kind of money on a DVD.  OK, in summation; If you are a Trekkie or just like the show, this is a worthy investment that will bring hours and hours (Three full days worth if you buy all three seasons and watch them one right after the other)of great entertainment.  As for me, I've finally got ALL the Star Trek (The Original Series)episodes, it's time to work on owning some ""Dr. Who"" now!"	5.0	The 60's BEST Television Program!	2013-08-22	1	1	0

However, I thougt they should have restored the prints long ago, the episodes have been looking quite crappy for years, more than anything all scrached up, worn out. But ""Leave the old visual photographic effects alone!"" I thought, and guess what? They replaced them all with CGI. The big surprise is, they actually help the narrative. They don't always work, sometimes looking too cartoonish, but other times the effects are awesome, allowing the viewer to see what's going on outside the Enterprise in a way that has never been seen before(in the original show), and at the same time, they managed to keep it looking within the style of the old effects. And better yet, the show itself looks better than ever; vivid colors, great contrast and almost no more scratches. Plus, although few people know this, the real reason they upgraded the visual effects is because they wouldn't hold up in HD; you could already see wires holding the models on standard DVD definition. So give this one a chance, sit down and enjoy what was actually improved. And bring on Season 2!"	4.0	Star Trek re-marketed...	2008-01-04	4	3	1

The episodes are *not* remastered. It looks as if they may have cleaned up the opening title sequence and closing credits but that's about it.A little personal nit-pik for me is they have ordered the episodes in their original air date sequence, not the order in which they were shot. I can understand why they would do that but I would have rather seen them in the order they were shot to better see the evolution of the series as it progressed.Lastly, the packaging is pretty flimsy and most likely won't last long under constant use.Overall, I'm glad I bought this set but it could have been *so* much better.	4.0	Star Trek:The Original Series First Season DVD Boxed Set	2004-09-06	13	8	5

The transfers onto DVD are excellent and one could hardly imagine how this could be better presented.The 29 episodes range from average (""Shore Leave"", ""Miri"") to great (""The Devil in the Dark"", ""Balance of Terror"", ""The City on the Edge of Forever""). Many of the episodes are commentary on the concerns of our own times and on the human condition generally, which is one of the reasons why they still resonate with us today while just about all other TV series are mere time capsules.Much of the appeal of Star Trek lies in the well defined lead characters of Captain Kirk and Spock. Their interplay is a highlight of the series and so, to a lesser degree, is the playful sniping between Spock and Dr McCoy - and one can only admire the absolute commitment that all the actors bring to their roles.There are so many nice touches such as the use of sound, music, and costumes, and often imaginative direction, which overcome the primitive visual effects and low-budget sets.

Fortunately, it has proven more resilient than most. When a decision was made to tamper with original episodes, the plan by nature needed to be pretty good. With a little tasteful restraint, the producers have proven it is possible to make a fine old thing better. As others have pointed out, the remastered TOS gets rid of the scratches and graininess, throws in a dose of well-chosen CGI, and quietly succeeds where others have failed. I have watched the original series countless times since it first came out in the '60s. The remastering on these sets is nothing less than brilliant... and I am treasuring watching every one of them (even Season 3). So give away those old sets that do nothing to improve the quality and treat yourself to these eye-catching rebirths.	5.0	Making a fine old thing better...	2013-08-11	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AHYGU5T5XFMKN	"Philip R. Olenick ""Civil Rights and Appellate..."	The first season of the original Star Trek revolutionized the presentation of science fiction on television, bringing to TV's broader audience the literary tradition of addressing political and philosophical issues by setting them in another time and place that had blossomed in the monthly science fiction magazines during the McCarthy era.Sci-fi, like other literature, had a progressive &#34;we're all in this life together&#34; stream as well as a reactionary &#34;every man for himself&#34; stream. Trek was firmly in the progressive stream.By spicing its allegorical tales with the rough and tumble of an adventure series and good old fashioned American optimism and idealism, Trek's &#34;Wagon Train to the stars&#34; (the sales pitch made by its creator, Gene Roddenberry) won not just the West but the East as well.There were many great episodes in Trek's first season, from the poetic &#34;The Devil In The Dark,&#34; in which a terrifying monster becomes an ally, in classic &#34;quest&#34; story fashion, to &#34;The Naked Time' in which an epidemic of madness on board ship gives the audience a window on the inner lives of many of the most important members of the crew.The restoration of the old film that was done for the series' reissue on Blu-ray also benefits the Amazon streaming version. While not full 1080 resolution, the 720 looks very good, and the 5.1 Dolby Digital is good as well. Don't miss this.	5.0	Where No Show Had Gone Before	2013-07-31	1	1	0

I suppose there was some rational for this but for those of us without fancy sound systems, selecting the Original 2.0 Mono under ""Communications"" / ""Audio Options"" provides for excellent sound quality whereas the preselected 7.1 DTS-HD will sound weak and distorted if played without the sound system to support it. I admit it is a little tedious to do this each time you load the disc, but it does resolve any sound quality concerns.

The new effects are, unlike the Star Wars ""additions"", very pleasing and subtle.  My complaints are the menus and packaging.The Transporter Room menus are OK, but the titles are VERY hard to read from across the room and difficult at first to figure out how to use because the fonts are so small.  I would have preferred a larger font and much less extraneous menu area.  Yes, it's a cool menu, but a little overdone for my taste.The disks are packaged in a very flimsy case that has very little ""grab"" area and the only indication of which disk is which is on the disk itself in VERY small print on HD side.  You can't even tell which side of the case to start looking on by just looking at it.  It is impossible to get to the disks without putting fingerprints on at least one of them because there is so little room to grab the case around the disks.  Disk 1 is not even coevered so the only way to get out another disk is to put findgerprints all over Disk1! I can see this case falling apart with a fair amount of use.  Rather than putting the information on the episodes and which disk they are on on one sheet they are on individual plastic collector type cards that have no place in the case itself.If you are older and have problems reading small print (which many of the people buying this will be) be prepared to get out your reading glasses to figure out which disk is which!"	4.0	HD is great, menus over done, packaging stinks	2007-12-07	3	3	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1K2MMM59XT1R6	"Rainer Stehr ""rstehr"""	Pros:- Great restoration work. Really astonishing. Good color, contrast and HD.- Very nice new special effects, done from scratch. Also possible to see both effects: original and new one. I enjoy this feature a lot.- Fully remastered digital sound, but keeping the original music and effects.Cons:- No wide screen. (I suppose this is technically impossible to accomplish, without distorting the image on screen) So you will see black bars on both sides. Not a big deal, considering this is a 1960s TV show!- Sound too quiet. Even if you increase volume, it seems that some details are lost.- Episodes are not in the right order. Can anyone explain why is this? Annoying...Conclusion:- If you are a Star Trek fan (even if you are a Sci-Fi fan), you definitely MUST have this. It is a classic, ...and made in HD.- You can live with the minor cons.	4.0	Great show, with a few minus points	2009-11-26	3	2	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AZ9JWGE1UGKZA	R.A. McKenzie	"""Star Trek"" is a franchise that many people like to dismiss for various reasons.  Perhaps it's the showier acting from William Shatner.  Perhaps it's the 60s music score.  Perhaps it's the costumes and production quality. Perhaps it's the intense cult following it has.  Perhaps it's just because it's science-fiction.  Who knows?  Bottom line is this: I doubt the naysayers have taken the time to digest this incredible 1st season of ""Star Trek"". How could a show with such wonderful questions about humanity, leadership, morality, and discovery be so dismissed?  My guess, people are looking at the surface too much and have watched too many parodies and mockeries.  I've always been a fan, but ever since I took the time to watch this Re-mastered DVD set from start to finish, I am begging people to give this show a serious chance.I've provided an episode-by-episode breakdown in the hopes of convincing you...as well as just for my general amusement and reflections.  I've placed it at the end because this review will be too long for Amazon guidelines.""Star Trek"" wasn't a huge success in the 1960s.  Its 3 seasons only gained popularity when they were re-run in the 1970s.  After watching how strong the show began, it puzzles me that people didn't want to give it more of a strong run compared to other run-of-the-mill programming.  ""Star Trek"" is often remembered for its sci-fi action, alien worlds, strange catchphrases, and occasionally-dated production.  One aspect the show doesn't get nearly enough credit for is its acting.  That's right...""Acting"".  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley make a terrific team as our three lead roles as the strong-willed Captain Kirk, the logical and emotionally-restrained Spock, and the passionately blunt Dr. McCoy.  Nimoy's performance as Spock often got the most recognition for playing a character that everyone could relate to: the outcast whose scientific and distanced way of thinking often made him the go-to guy when situations were dire.  In a way, Spock was the one we all thought we needed to be.  Kirk, on the other hand, was the one we all wanted to be.  His courage and willingness to get his hands dirty and assume responsibility are among the most admirable qualities in a human being.  The great thing about Shatner is that you can tell from his facial expressions that when his crew are in danger, he feels their pain.  There's a terrific episode in which a newlywed has lost his life during combat --- Kirk's expression of pain in the face of duty says it all.  And McCoy is the one to keep us in.  He's our voice of emotion, the one who says what he feels because someone's gotta break the laws of duty and logic.  He's out gut reaction, and Kelley is a very welcome change-of-pace from the other doctors ""Star Trek"" tried to use before `Bones' McCoy.As I hope you'll see in my upcoming episode synopses, ""Star Trek"" (its first 2 seasons anyway) had a great selection of adventures putting humanity and morality to the test.  Although the characters wouldn't endure life-changing events from one show to the next, you can feel what they're feeling during the episode itself.  The most underrated aspect of this original ""Star Trek"" series is its drama and its combination of sci-fi adventure and explorations of morals & ethics.I won't say a whole lot about the Re-mastered effects, except that I think they actually improve the show.  Every single episode with new effects (probably all of them) is better because while they look sharper and less fake, they still respect the original photography and spirit of the 1960s broadcasts.  There's really not much to gripe about unless you're a purist who only wants the original product.  If you're willing to accept a little shine here and there, jump right in.  It's the rare update that works (sorry George Lucas).The third and final season of ""Star Trek"" wasn't very good, but judging from this impressive 1st season, you wouldn't have guessed it would've ended up that way.(Quick Note - Don't let the chronological Star Dates confuse you with your DVD sets.  Just watch the show from Disc 1 onward.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, shoot me a comment.)*****EPISODE REVIEWS*****1) The Man Trap---Sadly, this is one of the weakest episodes of the season, as officers from the Enterprise notice a scientist's wife has a different appearance to each man's eyes.  Suddenly, officers are being found dead on the remote planet.  Gee, wonder who might be responsible for it?  (6.5 / 10)------------------------------2) Charlie X---The Enterprise is tasked with carrying a young boy whose emotional needs grow dangerous when he doesn't get his way.  Starts promising enough, with some good questions about how the crew should handle a young man's struggles with adulthood.  Unfortunately, the psychological strategy to save the ship isn't entirely convincing.  (7.0 / 10)------------------------------3) Where No Man Has Before---This is the pilot that got ""Star Trek"" launched into a weekly TV show, and it's actually one of my favorites.  After encountering a dangerous space storm, an officer and a visiting psychologist begin to exhibit God-like abilities.  I love this episode because it shows the real anguish that Kirk feels with imprisoning and (possibly) killing one of his best friends when his ego cannot control his newfound powers.  And the psychologist's resistance to reason and fascination with power is very well-developed.  The final fistfight is a bit much, but since it helped get ""Star Trek"" on the air, I'll forgive it.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------4) The Naked Time---One of the funnier episodes, as crew members contract a disease from an abandoned outpost, causing madness aboard the Enterprise.  Memorable images include the iconic sword-bearing Sulu, as well as a navigator taking over the Engine Room, giving hilarious announcements about ice cream socials and formal dances.  And how the Enterprise is saved from crashing into the planet is...unexpected.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------5) The Enemy Witihin---A malfunction with the Enterprise strands on a freezing planet below, while the ship is boarded by...Captain Kirk's evil clone!  Aside from some unintentionally funny moments (""IIIIIIIIIIII'M CAPTAIN KIRRRRRRRRK!""), this is a compelling story where Kirk's personality has literally been split into two people, with the ability to command being within the darker side.  While it might feel repetitive to have yet another ""chaos-aboard-the-Enterprise/imposter"" episode, this one manages to overcome those possible slipups.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------6) Mudd's Women---This episode feels pretty dated, but the first half of it is interesting as a smuggler/hustler is transporting three women so beautiful that they distract the attentions of the ship's crew.  The episode missteps when it deals with the truth and consequences behind the ladies' beauty.  I don't want to give it away for new viewers, but I believe most will find the message to be a product of the 60s.  (7.5 / 10)------------------------------7) What Are Little Girls Made Of?---I don't think episode gets nearly enough credit.  Captain Kirk and Nurse Chapel beam down to a famous archaeologist's dig site.  Dr. Corby was once engaged to Nurse Chapel, and then disappeared for 5 years.  But matters get more complicated when Corby's giant bodyguard kills off two security guards in order to imprison Kirk and Chapel.  If you can get past Corby's giant bodyguard and the sexy assistant, there is a great story about how robots can never replace mankind.  There's also some touching moments as both Nurse Chapel and the assistant struggle to show feelings for men who are so unlike them.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------8) Miri---While some very 60s elements rear their ugly heads into the episode, this is still a very fine story as the crew stranded on an Earth-like planet race to find a cure for a plague that will kill them in less than a week.  Things get more interesting when they find a young woman hiding out, while a gang of children taunts and prevents the crew from getting modern technology to research a cure.  The gang of kids are very corny, except for Michael J. Pollard as their leader.  And how Kirk manages to reason with them is a bit hard to believe they'd listen (same problem with the ""Charlie X"" episode).  But overall, this is a very solid race-against-time episode.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------9) Dagger of the Mind---I've yet to find anyone who loves this episode as much as I do.  When a prison inmate stows away onto the Enterprise, further examination reveals he was formerly a scientist working for the reform facility.  Things get darker and more disturbing when Kirk and a former love interest find out how exactly the prison rehabilitates its prisoners.  Throw in the first use of Spock's ability to mind-meld and a thriller that never lets up, you've got a cutting-edge classic.  There are plenty of beloved ""Star Trek"" episodes, but this hidden gem deserves more recognition.  (10 / 10 Perfect!)------------------------------10) The Corbomite Maneuver---This episode has a terrific buildup, a nail-biting premise that goes on a little too long, and a love-it-or-hate-it ending.  A space buoy of great power follows the Enterprise everywhere it navigates in space.  When they finally resort to destroying it, an unknown species threatens to use their power to destroy the ship, leaving them only 10 minutes to prepare for their ultimate doom.  If that doesn't get your attention, I don't know what will.  Kirk comes up with a clever plan to delay their destruction.  What the crew eventually discovers about their opponent is totally unpredictable; whether that's good or not depends on your taste.  I actually liked it, especially after a wonderful final line of dialogue that sums up Captain Kirk pretty well.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------11) & 12) The Menagerie: Parts I & II---This is a tough two-parter to critique.  On the one hand, it's a glorified reason to replay ""The Cage"", the very first pilot of ""Star Trek"" that was turned down for various reasons.  On the other hand, the story of how Christopher Pike (former captain of the Enterprise) was challenged and tested on the forbidden planet Talos IV hadn't been shown to viewers when this two-parter premiered.  There are some surprising elements when Spock deceives and manipulates the Enterprise to return to Talos IV, testing the Kirk/Spock relationship like never before.  Overall, if you've seen or know a lot about ""The Cage"", the new story might not be enough for you.  But if you have no idea what ""The Cage"" is, you're in for a very unique vision of what ""Star Trek"" almost was.  Either way, it's a credit to the writers and production team that they turned they gave this gimmick a few surprising plot twists and a dramtically-satisfying ending.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------13) The Conscience of the King---This episode can't really be called ""sci-fi"", but instead you get a terrific drama with true Shakespearean pathos.  The premise is a bit light at first: Could the veteran actor of an interstellar acting troupe really be a longdead dictator?  If so, is he responsible for a couple attempted murders?  The reason this episode succeeds very well is because of 'HOW' it's told, as it uses a lot of unique storytelling devices.  An engineer gets temporary relief when Uhura plays a beautiful song over the speaker, unaware that he's about to be poisoned.  When Kirk confronts his alleged nemesis (played terrifically by Arnold Moss), their dialogue reveals painful depths about the two men.  How can Kirk know if he's right?  And if so, who cares?  The story begins and ends during Shakespeare plays, and the way the playwright's words are used to punctuate the drama is amazing.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------14) Balance of Terror---Rightfully remembered as one of the best ""Star Trek"" episodes.  In short, the Enterprise races to investigate space outposts that are being attacked along the border between Federation space and the mysterious Romulans.  What ensues is a suspenseful battle in space, as both starships seek to destory the other, before the other can report that a peace treaty has been violated.  Although the Re-mastered special effects make this episode better, the reason it really works is because the camera and script focus on the characters' reactions, rather than just creating a visual space battle.  Also, special credit must be given to Mark Lenard's superb performance as the Romulan Commander.  The finale is also a heartbreaker, as Kirk must deal with the death of one of his crew.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------15) Shore Leave---The best way I can describe this episode is that it's just one damn thing after another.  The Enterprise crew find a lush, beautiful planet that would be perfect for them to relax during their five-year mission.  However, the first few officers who explore the planet find experience some bizarre hallucinations.  It begins with Dr. McCoy seeing a giant white rabbit being followed by a girl who looks just like Alice of Wonderland.  All sorts of craziness occurs from a giant tiger prowling the planet to Kirk being tormented by his Irish bully from the Academy days.  In fact, the Kirk/Finnegan rivalry is one of the most comically insane threads of any ""Star Trek"" plot.  The ending is a tiny copout as everything wraps up a little too tidily.  But like the Enterprise crew, all I could do was just laugh at what the hell everybody just went through.  (10 / 10 I Loved It!)------------------------------16) The Galileo Seven---This one takes a big chance of taking the often-infallible Spock, and making him even more unlikeable than in ""The Menagerie"".  A shuttlecraft is stranded on a planet within a space quasar.  Meanwhile, Captain Kirk's efforts to rescue them are constantly scolded by a galactic commissioner who only gives Kirk a few days before meeting a deadline for delivering medical supplies.  Spock's non-emotional, logical leadership starts to wear down on the other 6 officers who fear they may never leave the planet alive.  With no fuel and attacking creatures, the situation becomes dire very fast.  This episode has one major problem: the attacks on the Galileo Seven party are laughably bad.  Gigantic spears look phony, and the creatures' close-quarters attacks are as slow as zombies.  Plus, the nagging commissioner aboard the Enterprise is very one-note.  This is a very good episode that explores some gray areas within Spock, but the faulty aspects stick out pretty bad.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------17) The Squire of Gothos---In many ways, this is what the ""Charlie X"" episode should've been.  After Captain Kirk and Sulu vanish from the bridge, the party sent to investigate the nearby planet finds that they've been taken from a charming egotistical being who fancies his lifestyle after the romanticising of European wars (Napolean for example).  What's so great about this episode is that Trelane (the villain played with great relish by William Campbell) doesn't have a deep philosophy for his actions.  He's simply a bored unknown entity who just wants some humans to play with and has no moral boundaries whatsoever, despite how well-educated he appears to be.  It's a frightening situation with a great nemesis, and the way the Enterprise crew struggles to reason their way out of this one is something to behold.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------18) Arena---Action-packed is the best way to summarize this episode.  When the Enterprise crew finds an Earth colony has been bombarded by an alien race, Kirk goes on a vengeful mission to lead the Enterprise to hunt down the attackers.  However, his anger will soon cost him as an unseen race called The Metrons force the pursuit to stop.  Furthermore, they force Kirk and The Gorn to battle it out on an isolated planet.  Winner gets to leave, the loser's ship will be destroyed.  I'm surprised how the unlikely story of an obsessive Captain Kirk is very well-told, and his redemption is compelling.  But quite frankly, the one-on-one battle with The Gorn is bad even by 60s standards, and when the Enterprise is conveniently allowed to watch, it insults our intelligence a bit.  I wish this one had trusted the audience more to enjoy the story, but besides those missteps, this one's a keeper.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------19) Tomorrow Is Yesterday---The great thing about this episode is that when the Enterprise accidentally travels back in time to the 1960s, it deals with the consequences seriously.  After saving an Air Force pilot's life and escaping Earth's orbit, everyone must cope with how either the 1960s or the 23rd Century timelines will be changed forever.  The Enterprise can't risk sending the pilot back to Earth because he could use his newfound knowledge to change the world, but wouldn't detaining him be just as wrong?  After all, the unsuspecting pilot was only doing his duty when he stumbled upon their vessel.  There are a lot of great elements.  When Kirk & Sulu sneak into the Air Force base, the story gets a bit ridiculous.  But it's all in good fun.  Like many ""Star Trek"" episodes, it may wrap up a little too neatly and too quickly, but all in all, this one is another strong effort.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------20) Court Martial---It may be a little redundant having two officer-on-trial episodes in this first season.  The difference is that in ""The Menagerie"", Spock was well aware of his guilty actions.  In this courtroom mystery, Kirk is absolutely certain he is innocent, and actually challenges the trial to take him on.  It's a fascinating premise, made more interesting that a former love interest must dutifully prosecute Kirk to the fullest extent of the law.  The lawyer that Kirk employs is also a neat character, a man who tries to get the heart of the law.  The big problem working against this episode is that Captain Kirk is such a believable character that it's obvious that someone made a mistake somewhere with this trial, making his guilt pretty much a falsehood.  And since ""Star Trek"" isn't known for long-term consequences, we trust that all will be well before the hour is up.  But for what it is and how well it sustains its premise, ""Court Martial"" is good from start to finish.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------21) The Return of the Archons---This one's plot has a very bizarre & intriguing start, as people on a planet (dressed like late 19th century Earth) are under a constant trance, speaking in tongues, praising ""Landru"".  Somehow, the investigating crew find shelter with a few people who fear Landru, but speak plainly enough to be of some help.  Unfortunately, I thought this one drags for a while, finally gaining much-needed momentum in its final act.  Furthermore, the cult/religion of the Archons is never fully explained, with Kirk & Spock solving the mystery before we can even follow how they did it.  It's not a bad episode, but I loved some of it, while getting restless during other parts.  (7.5 / 10)------------------------------22) Space Seed---Even if ""Star Trek II"" had never taken place, this TV episode would rightfully be remembered for being a masterful piece of work.  The Enterprise find a wandering spaceship with its passengers cryogenically-frozen.  The one they wake up turns out to be a grave mistake.  First and foremost, Khan (amazingly played by Ricardo Montalban) is one of the best antagonists in all of TV.  As he says, he's superior in every way to the normal man.  Khan is very strong, supremely intelligent, romantically appealing to women (particularly an Enterprise historian), and a man who hungers for global conquest.  The way Khan interacts with any member of the Enterprise crew is well-executed and gripping.  His attempts to gain control of the Enterprise are patient and subtle.  And when Khan begins to execute his plan, this episode is constantly exciting.  And even if we never got a 2nd ""Star Trek"" movie, the final words between Kirk and the crew are harrowing.  If you're gonna watch only one episode of ""Star Trek"", make it this one.  (10 / 10 Totally Mesmerizing!)------------------------------23) A Taste of Armageddon---What a delightfully strange concept this episode has.  Basically, Captain Kirk and his crew beam down to a planet that appears peaceful, but they insist that they've been at war for a nearby planet for 500 years, killing millions of each other's inhabitants.  The catch: They don't really kill each other; instead, the two engage in 'computerized' war games, and agree to sacrifice their own people so that 'real' nuclear weapons won't be used.  There are so many opportunities for implicating society and creating nail-biting suspense, and I think this story takes advantage of all of them.  There is a Federation diplomat onboard the Enterprise who has command of the ship, and for once, it's not a one-note character.  This diplomat wants to sincerely bring good relations between the isolated planet and the Federation, but he has absolutely no idea what he's getting into.  Kirk and his crew beam down with peaceful news, but they are informed almost immediately that they've been chosen to die from the war games.  The action is plentiful, as Kirk's landing party fight to escape their own euthanasia, while the Enterprise must refrain from firing back at a planet who means to destory them.  And the questions posed to us --- Is it better to kill your own people rather than allow someone else's weapons to do so?  Do we have the right to intervene with another people's way of life if the earthly world isn't being harmed?  I loved just about every second of this episode, and I recommend it highly!  (10 / 10 Genius!)------------------------------24) This Side of Paradise---This season continues to show its variety of concepts, themes, and tones.  Evidence: A love story for Spock?!  The Enterprise is ordered to bring some colonists off of their planet to another starbase.  The problem is that they're so healthy and so content that they don't want to leave.  Meanwhile, a woman who's loved Spock for years finally gets her chance when the Vulcan is infected with some plant spores that bring his emotions to the surface.  Soon, everyone but Kirk (conveniently) is exposed to the spores and refuses to keep the Enterprise running and leave the planet.  There's nothing really wrong with this episode, but for some reason, I wanted more from it.  Maybe I was underwhelmed by Kirk being the one who solves the mystery and saves the day.  But if for nothing else, this glimpse into Spock's heart is unforgettable.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------25) The Devil In The Dark---The way this story surpasses its simple premise is incredible: Some miners are being attacked by an unknown creature, and the Enterprise is tasked to stop it before it permenantly stops production & kills everyone on the planet.  But thanks to some smart pacing and a sensible mystery, it all works.  The Kirk/Spock dynamic is well-challanged: The Captain wants to save lives, while Spock doesn't want to miss an opportunity to research an unknown creature.  The way the two friends challenge and ultimately trust the other's philosophies is great stuff.  The cave creature is, at first, disappointing because it's typical monster-movie stuff where people are killed and you can't see it.  But once Kirk & Spock find the creature, it's a surprisingly sharp creation.  It moves convincingly in the way it breathes, the way it creeps, and the way it feels.  Dr. McCoy's involvement in the story is quite amusing, too.  Once you get past the monster-movie setup --- and forgive how the survivors fail to mourn the dead after surviving the ordeal --- this is another unforgettable episode.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------26) Errand of Mercy---Ah, the debut of the Klingons!  I don't think they could've done a better job of introducing these ""Trek"" icons into the universe.  The peaceful planet of Organia is caught in the crossfire between the Federation and Klingon battles in space.  But when Kirk and Spock beam down to convince the primitive Organians to allow the Federation to assist them, they refuse simply because they denounce any kind of violence, regardless if it's in self-defense.  When the Klingon occupation begins, Kirk and Spock are the only ones who want their tyrannical reign to end.  Special credit must go to John Abbott & John Colicos as the Organian Elder and Klingon Commander Kor, respectively, for their great performances here.  The Organians' peaceful reaction to all of this is off-putting to us, which is part of the story's lesson.  And when Kor & Kirk engage in their verbal battles of wits, you can't take your eyes off the screen.  My only big gripe is that I can't decide if the episode's big reveal at the end was supposed to be expected, or if it was supposed to be a surprise.  In a way, I was underwhelmed by either solution because there's a big cheat in the middle of the episode that keen-eyed viewers will notice.  But it still makes for a powerful ending, and makes us question the way we wanted the violent adventure to continue.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------27) The Alternative Factor---Man, this episode really fumbles after a decent start.  Basically, there are inexplicable storms that are causing damage to ships across the entire galaxy.  The Enterprise learns that a maniacal space traveler aboard an empty planet seems to be the cause.  How he's involved with these storms isn't too surprising, because there about 5 of them throughout the story.  But the bigger problem is that they keep leaving this traveler alone when they shouldn't.  Dr. McCoy literally sits by the Sickbay's door, and yet the traveler still escapes and wanders the ship's corridors to cause damage...TWICE!  The whole episode is repetitve, and fails to live up to any potential it had.  I suppose it's watchable one time, but it's a harsh blemish on such a terrific season.  (5.5 / 10)------------------------------28) The City On The Edge Of Forever---This episode is routinely called the greatest of ""Star Trek"", and I can't blame them.  This is one of the most creative, inventive, and dramatic stories from this Original Series.  It's bit chaotic at first: Dr. McCoy is accidentally drugged to the point of madness, and he escapes to a nearby planet with a time-traveling portal.  When he jumps through, the Enterprise realizes that he somehow changed history.  They all agree to jump in, and try to stop McCoy from altering history.  Kirk and Spock arrive in the Great Depression, and while they try to use 20th century technology to research the point where McCoy changed history, Kirk falls in love with a marvelous woman.  Edith Keeler runs a mission, takes in Kirk & Spock out of kindness, and pays them to work so that they can buy supplies for their own purposes.  To me, this episode has one too many coincidences: How in the world can Kirk & Spock be absolutely sure that Dr. McCoy is going to arrive at their point in time?  But the strong acting and moving story make it all work, with special thanks to Joan Collins as the warm-hearted visionary who reaches Kirk's heart like nobody else had before.  This episode is truly a classic among classics, and has earned its reputation as one of the ""Star Trek"" greats.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------29) Operation: Annihilate!---We now know that the ""Space Seed"" episode was the genesis (no pun intended) for the 2nd ""Star Trek"" movie, but at the time, this season finale was the first episode that felt like there could be long-term consequences from a given episode.  A colony's citizens have been going insane.  Their nervous systems are shutting down.  Kirk's brother's family are on this very planet.  And one of his closest officers is viciously attacked by the parasites that have infested the colony, possibly with permenant damage.  The stakes feel greater than ever, because every waking moment shows Kirk, Spock, and McCoy dealing with the possible death of millions of people.  Although this episode isn't one of the season's very best, it's still a very solid way to go off the air for a while.

I even have the previous regular set, and I admit I thought the price too high and bit only with the Amazon discount and my wife asking what I wanted at the Holidays.I agree with all those who cited poor packaging and there is no real episode description or index, I find myself using the regular DVD set one.But many have written in more depth and with more authority than I could. The main reason for posting is like others I did not understand why the sound on Kirk's intros was so muted and the sound in general was low. I did a Google search and someone had already posted an answer on amazon, but only as a reply to a review. Basically you need to adjust the audio settings on your player. They suggested making sure you are set to PCM, but I found I had to be a little more detailed. I had already tried adjusting before with no luck, but I suspect trial and error may be the case. I hope this helps anyone with similar audio issues as that really was the only negative that counted towards detracting for enjoying playing and watching this set. Now the sound and for me at least even Kirk's intro is fine and the picture is awesome.	4.0	Wow the picture really pops but the sound	2008-01-23	3	3	0

Many o the other specials are cool but for a non fan like me or they can go over your head a little bit, it is still nice to see them there.the only real bad thing is that with the dvd you do not get the option to see it without the remastery and also the dvd is just silver and i think it should have had some graphic to let people know which side is to go down beyond that it is a great set for the fan of star trek in general and you can see many of the origins of episodes from Star trek the next gen or other episodes of the numerous star trek series. yet for the non fan it is a great starting point for them.	4.0	i am not a fan of this series but	2013-12-31	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3OQF09LQFQGEB	Resident55011	A lot of reviews for this set complain how much it costs. One thing people need to realize is this is an HD DVD/standard DVD set and most combo sets sell for at least $30.00, considering this is a 10 disc set it could have gone for $300 or more. I got mine at Best Buy for 179.99 and it is worth every penny. The remastered picture is perfect and better than I have ever seen in any Star Trek set including the last DVD realeases. I showed my brother and he was amazed at the calrity of the picture also. The redoing of the special effects is also great, it does not take away from the story or ruin it in any way and most of the effects are even shot the same way as they were back in the 60's but redone in CGI to make it look better. For people who feel this is not right need to consider they have ALWAYS wanted to have better special effects but were not given enough money back then to do them, now they have the opportunity to go back and give each episode what it deserves. I also strongly believe Gene Roddenberry would be very proud if he were alive today to see Star Trek done as well as it is.This set also comes with A LOT of bonus features that I am sure will make any Star Trek fan happy. One of the best is the tour of the Enterprise, while it takes a long time to load up it is great to have. I also love the featurrette that tells you how they have updated the series from the 60's to today. The set also includes 5 cards that have pretty cool pictures on the front and on the back it has a list of the episodes and special features on each of the discs.As I stated before this is a great set and to me worth every bit of money I paid for it. It feels like I am watching the shows for the first time. I wish people could get past the price tag on this and see it for how great it actually is. I am looking forward to season 2.	5.0	Great Set	2007-11-22	13	10	3

At first, I was a little skeptical about the price, and I thought it seemed a little steep.However, I was wrong. This was worth every penny. This show is phenomenal, and the remastered special effects are especially fun. With 29 hour-long episodes, this is a great buy, actually.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AOVSA4VCHMGIO	R. Garland	First the blu-ray version has both the altered effects version and the original version of each show.  I would have given this set a 5 star rating but the original versions of the shows were not cleaned up like the altered versions were.  The original versions of the shows are noticeably hazy and colors are not as sharp in areas of the show.  In the altered version these defects are corrected and look a lot better than the original version of the show. In Star Wars the original versions of each movie were cleaned up then the new effects were added to make the special directors edition but the original versions are also included cleaned up.The blu-ray version is almost identical to the hd version version so I would not waste money on the now defunct hd dvd version, although if you have the hd dvd version do not spend money getting the blu-ray version.Now the question begging to be answered is it worth the upgrade to Blu-ray from DVD.  The new Blu-ray enhanced version is far superior to the original DVD version.  If you like the unaltered version, do not spend your money on the Blu-ray disk.  The original unaltered versions on the Blu-ray disk are washed out, hazy, colors are flat and the picture is grainy in several of the episodes.You can tell the movie studio spent a lot of time making the enhanced version of each episode visually better.

First off, let me say that the colors are clean and bright and I found the sound to be improved over previous releases.  That said, the menu leaves a lot to be desired.  You cannot select a specific episode to watch because there is no episode menu. You have to watch them one-by-one.  The picture only takes up 2/3 of the screen so you have this annoying chopped-off look at the sides, and this is in wide view.

Hyre ""tech leader"""	"Great to watch the whole episodes again - the special effects are dated by today's standards, but the stories still work.  I own about 3 'series' DVD sets now, and this is my favorite in terms of the content.The DVD features require you to wait until the Paramount logo and various warnings - no skipping ahead with the Menu or chapter skip buttons on your remote.  I find this irritating in the same way Spock gets irritated when Kirk points out his humanity.  There's also an encoding problem on the title page for disk 6, where one of the episide titles (shown on the main viewscreen) reverts to blocky grey text due to bad MPEG encoding, apparently.The DVD also provides for selecting chapters of a series, and allows you to enable on-screen commentary or not, but there really should be audio commentary and recollections from the original cast members at this point.I was young when the original series was on - I think our family watched ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" or ""Hondo"" instead - but I remember seeing one episode during the original series run.I was a fan who 'found' the series in syndication, and even made audio casette tapes of the syndicated reruns of the original series 30 years ago.  You could actually follow the storyline with just an audio recording, unlike Mission: Impossible, which was WAY too visual to understand what the team was doing.I've only seen the DVD extras for Season One, and they're OK, but not spectacular...  I would have like to see more of a 'making of' short along with lines of the book ""The Making of Star Trek"".On to the packaging - love the outer case, hate the sharp plastic edges on the inner case - worried about scratching a disk.

The picture has been cleaned up so that it looks like it was shot in high definition. The enhanced special effects are an improvement on the originals, they look like what might have been done back in 1966 if they had the time and money. It is possible to view the shows with the original effects, but those have not been cleaned up like the rest of the scenes.

These episodes from the 1960's were NOT meant to be seen in a ""hi-def"" format.  You can see the fake pointy ears, and all sorts of bad make-up tricks, for example.  I actually enjoyed the poor UHF quality I first saw in the 1970's re-broadcasts more, for their fuzziness and wild colors.The ""good news""?  If you can afford it, the new Samsung flat-screens will amaze you, when you pop in a regular DVD of Star Trek/TOS.  This TV refreshes the image 124 times a second, instead of just 24 times a second, producing a freakish, creepy clarity and unnerving, startling fluidity of movement in these old episodes, which you probably have completely memorized by now on (what will soon seem like) a much more stilted, halting TV image.  The characters, the actors, will seem to begin to stroll right off the screen, and into your living rooms.  It is, quite simply, breath-taking.But, of course, buying a new flatscreen is more or less out of the question these days, for 99.99% of the population.  But trust me, it is AMAZING, to see TOS truly come alive like this."	3.0	Think about it...	2009-04-10	35	4	31
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A1332UYSH5FZBI	Richard	A great deal of effort has gone into updating the special effects in this classic 1960's series, and if that increases sales then so much the better.  However it is the stories that have made this series endure and that is why I watch.  Today, on television, the episodes are so edited it is like listening to a skipping record of your favorite song.  You jump form the middle of one lyric into the the middle of another.  For seasoned watchers is is nothing but annoying.  For the generation the new effects are suppose to attract, it leaves jumbled stories and confusing situations.  Unfortunately broadcast and other commercial stations are just driving us away.  THAT is why I stay with Amazon.	5.0	A classic that stands the test of time	2013-09-10	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3T8ISGIQ27V3X	"Richard P. Shanahan ""I hear and I forget... I..."	This TV series changed my life on many levels. First it was an avenue of hope during a very uncertain time when humanity was looking forward to war, as I was in my teenage years. The diverse crew with members from many different countries including Russia (a sworn enemy at the time) really said &#34;Hey, there may be a future after all.&#34; The technology said &#34;We have things to discover.&#34; The five year mission said &#34;it makes sense to plan for longer than just next week.&#34; Having a black female as the voice of the crew said &#34;We can change.&#34; And an alien Spock with more than human intelligence spoke to things we had not even considered including intermarriage. Although the acting seems less than &#34;Stellar&#34; now, and the special effects were done without the aid of CGI, and the computers were primitive and slow, Star Trek offered hope to a hopeless generation, at least in my case.	5.0	Star Trek Season 1...	2013-04-27	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	ALOI9G09H87IW	Rick Layton	"Maybe it was just my set, but I had some difficulty getting the Star Trek  plastic casing open.  Once inside, the box housing the 10 HD DVDs was dented and scratched.  The plastic disc holders protect all the HD DVDs except for the first one which is exposed.  Because of that, the first disc had some superficial scratches.  Personally, I did not like the packaging at all.Once I figured out the rather odd menu system, I watched the first episode.  The first thing I noticed was that the colors were far more vibrant than in the unrestored edition. The image was quite clean, although there is a fair amount of grain -- which stems from the original master.  The image is also noticeably dimmer than the unrestored version which tended to be a little washed out.  The reduction in brightness is very apparent but gave it a more vibrant look.  There were only a few instances of specks on the print.  The HD DVD version is just slightly more detailed and clear than the SD counterpart.  There is not a huge difference, however, which is somewhat surprising to me.The 2.0 audio sounded full.  It lacked the ""tinny"" sounds of other older 2.0 audio tracks that I have heard.  I did notice the volume levels were quite low using the True HD soundtrack.  I had to turn up the volume about 20% higher than I usually do. Dialogue was very clear and understandable.The commentary tracks and the extras are very good.  In fact, I enjoyed viewing the episodes with the commentary on much more than without them.  The amount of time devoted to information and commentary is extensive.I believe the high price of the set reflects the costs involved in the extras and the restoration efforts.  If you are not interested in the extras or the new digital effects, it would be difficult to justify the price.  On the other hand, if you are a true follower of Star Trek and want not only to view the episodes but also learn large amounts of trivia, it is probably worth the high price.I would give Star Trek -- The Complete First Season the following grades:Packaging - 2/5Menus - 2/5Picture Quality - 4/5 (HD DVD)Audio Quality - 3/5Extras - 5/5Overall:  3.75/5"	4.0	Good Upgrade / Some Problems	2007-11-22	9	7	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3UJJV01HOP8I9	Rishi Maharaj	The restoration work that has been done here is fantastic. Paramount deserves two big thumps up for breathing new life to this classic series we all know and love. But while the new HD transfer and effect are stunning, this set has a few caveats:1. Price. Even with Amazon's $60 off, this is an absolutely shameful price for one season of a 40-year-old TV series. I would accept some premium for the cost of the remastering work, but this is double the price of any other season, even in HD/BD.2. Awful packaging. The case looks nice on a shelf, yes, but it's a pain to have to open the outer shell, remove the discs from the slipcase, then refer to the cards to find the right disc, and then remove it each time you want to see a certain episode. For a $200 list price set, you'd think they could afford more than $0.07 of cardboard.3. Combo discs. Because of this, there is no disc art indicating which episodes are on a particular disc, and most of the supplements are on the standard DVD side. This is a blatant attempt to overcharge both HD DVD fans AND those just wanting a standard DVD.Kudos to the restoration team - but whoever designed the packaging needs to be fired.	4.0	Amazing remaster, cheap packaging	2008-01-12	8	8	0

I clearly enjoy the show as well. Now, if you're new to the original series, then you should, if anything and at the very least, be able to appreciate what a generation without CGI and smart devices must have been like. You should also be able to make some similarities or correlations to Star Trek: TNG....and hopefully you will appreciate what the real Gene Roddenbury vision was all about.My only wish from Amazon is that since you already top Netflix, in my humble opinion, with your extensive and impressive library of TV and silver screen wonders, would it completely bankrupt you to offer more deals and promos on a lot more of your product offering? Maybe have decade-related promos like &#34;'80's for....cents&#34; to rent and $8.00 to buy,  I don't know! but something.	5.0	Star Trek	2014-03-25	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AYZV1PJP6NXPT	"R. Long ""JaminRebel"""	"I previously gave this remastered version one star. I based my review of the remaster on primarily The Doomsday Machine which I saw on tv. The problem I guess with this is that The Doomsday Machine was episode 35 and from season two. Now as I begin this review I want it to be known that I am content and happy with the changes in the remastered version as long as the original non remaster continues to remain available to the public. The original version needs to remain in availability so that fans can own both, so fans can have the improved version and the sometimes dated original version. For instance, the remaster features an eye blinking GORN in the episode titled ""The Arena"". The original version did not have an eye blinking Gorn. In the remaster in the episode ""Charlie X"" the Thasians show up in a green space ship sort of thing. The ship mostly just suddenly appears and it looks mostly like green light. In the original version the ship just looked like a green cloud. These are big differences. The biggest change that I've seen thus far in season one, and I only have three episodes left to watch, was in ""The Galileo Seven"" episode. In this episode the clouds and the planet's atmosphere are very GREEN for some reason. On the one hand, if you like this new GREEN look then ok, but for me to much LOVE and attention was given to this episode. The lavish greenness of the atmosphere and clouds just doesn't complement or continue the continuity of the episode's tone. And the high definition of the episode makes the crashed shuttle craft look very space worthy. One would not know that this shuttle craft had crashed in the new version. And the new graphics, the high definition, and the special effects, do not help this small shuttle craft to look as vulnerable and fragile as it looked in the original version. And if you compare both versions you will find that the original version has the shuttle craft going from left to right after Spock ignited the craft's fuel supply. The remaster gets it backwards and they go from right to left.But for the most part the new images of the USS Enterprise look damned good. Sure, the series has been tampered with in a mighty way but really what has happened is season one has been updated to look more like the modern Star Trek shows. Now the original can more easily stand beside STNG, Voyager, etc. All that has really taken place is all the in space shots have been updated. All the planets the Enterprise encounters are updated with a new look, and not that the original look was inferior. Personally I think the original look was fine. The biggest improvement is the new updated look of the Enterprise. The Enterprise looks more ballsy and beautiful in the Remaster. For a guy who has watched Star Trek to the point to where it's an exercise in tedium, this new look was a reason to pay more attention to the show. No, I don't think all the CGI changes are improvements, but many of them are. That said I don't really like the idea of the alien ships looking updated or different. This is why both versions should be available to the fans, so we can compare and value both versions.Also, the themes song for the show was re-recorded. There is a new ""soprano"" voice, a new female, singing in the newly orchestrated version of this song. I personally think the new girl's voice and the orchestrated version of the song is inferior but the song had to be redone to go with the new images on the screen, don't ask me why because I am not a film student. If you compare the in space images of the original Enterprise to the new version you probably will agree that the new look enhances the series. Gone is the clunky dated look of the past. You would not think the old space images are that dated unless you compared the new images with the old. Kirk, Spock and the gang look way cooler now as they prowl the universes in search of new life and new civilizations.And the changes of the new series are not shrouded in mystery, I know what I know because I watched the ""extra data"" or whatever it is called, on the discs. Most of the discs contain information that explain the changes that were made to the show. I don't think now that it was a big money grab on the part of the owners of the show. Mostly the remastered version of Star Trek was just an attempt to improve on the weakness of prior technology that went into the show. Sometimes the original version prevails in areas and many times, probably more times, the remaster has improved upon the original creation.Don't worry though, the content of the episodes has not changed in any way. I also do not see any areas thus far where part of an episode has been lost. All the character dialogue remains intact. All the scenes are intact. Episodes such as ""The Alternative Factor"" and ""The Conscience of the King"" continue to be just as boring as when they were first televised. Yes, even with all the help that this high tech this age can provide, boring episodes are usually just as boring. I now understand ""The Alternative Factor"" episode better than I did when I was a kid but it doesn't make it any more entertaining. And the same goes for ""The Conscience of the King"". Kodos the Executioner is still one boring guy as is the episode.What the high definition of season one does offer though is the presentation of many fine looking women. Yes, they look better than ever. One thing I also noticed in season one was how various women were introduced. Some how when various women were shown a special sort of lighting was used to make the women look as if they had some sort of special aura about them. This was how the original series portrayed these women, in that special light. It's just something to look for. I've come to expect it now as I go from episode to episode. The special lighting given to key women in various episodes was to make them appear to be even more lovely. After a while though as I've noticed it it begins to look a little cheesy or silly but only because I am watching episodes back to back. One would probably not notice it if you were viewing the show on a weekly basis.Anyway, don't miss out on the new remaster of season one. I have read it is the only season thus far available in high definition, which is really just another name for blu-ray quality."	4.0	Buy the Remastered version and the Original---UnTampered---with Version for Complete Star Trek Happiness.	2013-11-15	1	0	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A22JFC81LANF09	"Robert Drain ""Rob_in_Toronto"""	I first starting watching Star Trek TOS back in the 1970s right after school.  I still remember watching it at 4PM on CTV, and I thought it was amazing.  The monsters were scary, the stories were great, the effects were amazing.  Then over the years came new shows with better effects, and even better effects and Star Trek started to look old, then it started to look silly.  I guess with TNG, VOY, DS9 and Enterprise TOS became really dated.I didn't pre-buy this title because that was my opinion of TOS, old.  Then one day I saw this on display in a store playing in HD and I was amazed.  It looked great.  The content is cleaned up, the effects are current gen, but unlike what George did to Star Wars the effects have been updated but NOT enhanced to show off what you can do with CGI.  So the effects do not take over from the great stories, but effects are not dated and they no longer distract you, they're seamless and current.So I picked up these discs and now am watching Space Seed in HD and it has honestly never looked better to me.  This is just like the 10 year old me watching the show back in the 1970s all over again.  I will pickup season two when it is released, because this is honestly a great show.Well worth the price.	5.0	It is like watching it for the first time...honestly	2007-11-29	5	4	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3GRU9732S4V1U	"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1"""	"At last, at last, at last, Star Trek: The Original Series is getting a box-set DVD release as it so richly deserves.  It's way overdue, to say the least.  I was a bit too young to see the shows when they were first aired, but I grew up on the reruns in the 70's and bought almost the entire series on VHS when they were first released in the mid-80s (and that was expensive for a high-school kid back then, I can assure you).  Since I owned so many episodes on VHS, I never picked up any of the 2-episode DVDs, despite extreme temptation.  A voice in my head kept saying ""Wait for the box sets, wait for the box sets...""  Well, I don't usually do what the voices in my head say, but I am glad that I did this time.  This series struggled in the ratings on the air and actually only lasted for three seasons before being cancelled in 1969, but the show has since taken on the stuff of legend.  The show's impact on American pop culture is obvious today and shows no signs of ever going away.The cast of the show were perfect for their roles and had a lot to do with making the show the success it was.  Featured players for the first season included William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott, George Takei as Helmsman Sulu, Nichelle Nichols as Communications Officer Uhura, Grace Lee Whitney as Yeoman Janice Rand, and Majel Barrett as Nurse Christine Chapel (Walter Koenig did not join the show until the second season).This box set encompasses all of the first-season episodes of the Original Star Trek TV series and were first aired on NBC in 1966-1967.  Today, sci-fi is all over the TV channels, but back then, SF was very rare for an industry dominated by the Western.  In fact, Gene Rodenberry, the series creator, actually helped make his case to NBC to produce the series by saying the show would be like ""Wagon Train to the stars"".  Well, whatever it took, the series made it on the air.  This first season is generally ackowledged to be overall the best of the three.  Some of the more well-known episodes include:""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" - one of the two pilot episodes produced for the series, this show served to introduce Kirk, Spock, Sulu, and Scotty and features a very impressive guest-star performance from Gary Lockwood as First Officer Gary Mitchell.""The Corbomite Manuver"" - This was the first ""regular"" episode produced, and introduced McCoy, Uhura, and Rand, and was the first show to feature Kirk's legendary ability to bluff his way out of the most hopeless situations in the face of death itself.""The Enemy Within"" - The famous episode where a transporter malfunction spilts Kirk into two halves, one good, the other evil.""Balance of Terror"" - The episode that introduced the Romulans and gave us what is still one of the best and dramatic ""space battle"" episodes in TV history.""Errand of Mercy"" - Our first look at the Klingons.  No more need be said.""The City on the Edge of Forever"" - A time-travel episode where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy travel back to 1930 New York City and Kirk falls in love with a social worker (played by a young Joan Collins), this love story is considered by many to be the best episode of the series overall.There are so many other great episodes in this collection, what I wrote above barely scratches the surface.  These episodes are an absolute must-have for any science-fiction fan."	5.0	5 stars isn't enough...	2004-08-31	9	8	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	"I have been a fan of ST for over 3 decades now, in the process of introducing it to my kids in fact - so I won't waste your time on reviewing the show itself in terms of content. If you are reading this you likely are a fan already. But what of the presentation?The HD transfers are amazing. I have the series in 3 forms already: aging VHS tapes (off the air from WUAB in Cleveland in the 80s); Laserdisc (yes, the whole set); and DVD. The difference in quality of this set is absolutely stunning. The level of detail almost is distracting at times, especially knowing that it was never visible in any prior way these episodes were watched as they were never in theaters.I was concerned about the new special effects and whether they would detract from the spirit of the shows I love so much, but IMHO they do not. Watching the video commentary included with Balance of Terror you can see the dedication the team that worked on this had to not destroying the original; even to the point of creating ""proximity phasers"" so that the photon-torpedo looking phasers from that episode would mesh with the sound effects, that could not be altered. The level of attention to detail and respect for the original creative process that the producers had when they were made is amazing. The really great thing they did was to include the originals on the same disc - you can even switch back and forth if you wish (to the great annoyance of anyone else in the room).This set is terrific - buy it now if you love Trek.BTW - the reported sound issues appear to have been solved for Pioneer players with an update; I'm not sure if Samsung has updated yet.

(I don't have an HD player)[...]How can Kirk's voice be so low (and have a weird echo) and they call this ""remastered""?

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	"I was in seventh grade when Star Trek (the Original Series) aired for the first time on Thursday night.  I have never forgotten watching that first episode (""The Man Trap"") because truly, nothing like it had ever been on either television or for that matter the movie theaters, before.  From the first few moments, we all knew that something new and very special was being unveiled before our eyes.After all these years, the original series (first season) still does not disappoint.  The magic is still there, despite the fact that the special effects are no longer cutting-edge, the uniforms are totally sixties, etc.  Many of the episodes are still classics, such as City on the Edge of Forever, The Cage, Balance of Terror, and many others.  Many of the best episodes of first season have a wonderful ""New Frontier"" feeling about them--the viewer truly is transported to a wonderful new era in which mankind is just beginning to really master space travel and explore the Galaxy.  The fact that the crew and cast were truly multi-racial suggested that mankind had solved many of its problems on planet Earth and was now turning outwards.  At a time (1966) of racial unrest and the Vietnam War, this was a wonderful message.  ""The Cage"" in particular captures this feeling, but several other episodes do so as well.  In fact, in my opinion one of the things lacking in the third season was that the series began to lose that feeling of ""newness"" as regards man's exploration of the galaxy.Almost all of the first season's episodes are excellent--there aren't really any bad ones unless you want to count The Alternative Factor as one.  That makes this DVD collection a real bargain.The DVDs come packaged in a clunky yellow plastic case which I guess is supposed to kind of resemble a Tricorder or something.  Personally I found the case annoying because it does not easily fit on a DVD shelf.  Inside is a plastic multiple-DVD plastic jewel case which is more practical, but also more fragile.  A tougher shelf-friendly jewel case would have been a better decision, in my opinion.The user interface to the episodes is pretty good--I found it easy to operate, and it is nice that they included the original trailers--this makes it easy to quickly reference what each episode is about if one cannot recall by the title.  Some of the other extras are interesting, although not all.  Opinions will surely differ on this.For me, this was a must-have.  To get the whole first year of the series in one place at a reasonable price is something I've wanted since the series came out in 1966!"	5.0	Still in a class by itself after all these years!	2004-09-30	3	3	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A5RJ5E5TVSS67	"Ronald L. Griffin ""Ronscifi"""	HD sounds like a good idea, but which one!  Is HD worth the extra cost in any format?  I have over 1000 DVDs (including the standard edition of Star Trek Season 1), I'm not about to purchase my collection again in a new format. Standard dvd has proven itself. I believe this collection is a poor value. Considering I already own the original effects version, I'll wait for the remastered episodes to be released as a stand alone set and in Standard DVD.Review Update 5-11-2009: I finally purchased this set now that the price is reasonable. The episodes look great. I'm quite satisfied with SD quality. As we all know, HD-DVD is dead and Blu-Ray is the HD of today. It figures. After doing some research, I found that HD-DVD was better than Blu-Ray. Compare Beta to VHS: Beta was of higher quality, but VHS held more video, so it won. I'm going to stick with SD.	2.0	Can do without HD	2007-09-05	32	10	22
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3AOIFASWIDCZD	Ron B.	I'll start with the good issues first.1)  The enhanced version is fantastic, extremely clear and sharp.You should try viewing the original visual effects version then go to the enhanced version, it's fantastic.2)  The additional information is very interesting. They have gone to allot of work to clean up and add highlights to the sceans.Now for what's not good.1) The episodes are not shown in the original air date sequence. Example The Man Trap which is the first episode on disk #1 was originally episode #6 when aired.2)  I have had problems with disk #1 & #2 locking up while playing. It plays fine then just freezes up and you have to eject the disk and reinsert it and go through all of the disclaimers and the copy right laws, main menu screen then advance to the area where it locked up and hope it will play through the spot that it locked up on,3) The episode Mudd's Women  will not play past a the spot where the women go down to the planet no matter how many times that I reinstall it.If it wasn't for the couple of problems listed above, this would be a fantastic series.	3.0	Season 1 review	2012-08-19	1	0	1

It has lots of great episodes on it, and it will rarely disappoint. However, the double sided DVDs are really annoying. They get smudged so easily, and its always the side you need. (Say, if you don't have a HD player, and need the regular DVD side.) But besides that, it's nice. It comes in a little nice box-y case. Also, the remastered-ness is a little distracting. Added new computer generated sequences aren't even that great and seem completely out of place. I personally would prefer the old cheesy special effects.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AA6RWYTFUK8RJ	Russ	I'll admit right here, I went into watching Star Trek: The Original Series with a bit of trepidation.I'm not a huge fan of Sci-Fi television series (I'm sorry, but Firefly is not as great as others will make you believe) but I'm also not one to poo poo on something till I've seen it for myself.  I've been putting off watching this for a while because I believed that the amount of hokeyness I was about to watch would put me off.  But like my title suggests, I was surprised to find very little hokeyness and a tv series that is sadly stuck with a lot of viewers thinking that it's only for nerds.The variety of topics covered (some definitely controversial even today), and the way that the cast of characters interact with each other would work so well that at times that despite the obvious sound stage-ness of some of the sets, all that thick manly eye makeup, and a dog dressed as an alien it would suspend my belief enough that I would almost forget that I was watching a television show at all (a sign of a great show).In fact, my only complaint about the show would have to be the length of the episodes.  While an average of 44 minutes works well for some of the shows it certainly doesn't work well for a lot of them.  It often felt like they were filling in the time by either having the crew searching whatever strange thing that is occurring at the time (at the perilous expense of the red shirts) or they were just stalling.But overall this is a fantastic television series despite it being a Sci-Fi series.	5.0	Surprisingly Entertaining	2014-02-11	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A6D5ZA35QYLDA	R. Wall	"Paramount's technical wizards (that are obviously true Star Trek Fans) take STAR TREK's Best Season of the Original Series to a level that it has not achieved before. Never has the original series looked and sounded so crisp and clear.  What really sets this DVD set apart is the imaginative new graphics that give the series a shine that the original producers would have loved to give viewers back in 1966.  Producer Robert Justman mentions in the featurette, ""Spacelift: Transporting Trek into the 21st Century"" that he is very delighted with the new special effects as they are shot in the same manner and spirit as the original 60s show but not with the cheap plywood models.  The new special effects are not overwhelming but really give STAR TREK a look and feel that belongs to the show and brings it up to date with the comparable special effects of space travel of each spinoff series.  The show maintains it's 60s production values with the interiors, sets and uniforms that never looked sharper. While all the episodes look so much better...almost every fan will notice that certain episodes such as ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday"" and ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" seem to get an even greater boost with new looks coming at critical moments. The much improved graphical displays of the Enterprise orbiting planets and soaring through space really give the show a true 23rd Century feel...coupled with the clean crisp look of the original material...really make us believe that the crew of the Enterprise truly are boldly going...at least on DVD...where they have never gone before."	5.0	ST's Best Season Boldly Goes Where Trek Hasn't Gone B4	2008-04-04	1	1	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AK7IDQJN31163	Ryan	"I got this set as a Christmas gift and I hesitated before deciding to write this review.  After all, there's been so much coverage of the Star Trek franchise over the years; why bother?  Two answers come to mind.  I felt it was necessary to pay my respects to the original Star Trek series in the face of 40 years of advancing TV technology.  Also, I think the DVD package itself is noteworthy.Many critics and even some fans and cast members can find numerous reasons to pan this classic television series.  From the low-budget special affects to Shatner's ego and the sometimes-shoddy camera work, this series is definitely outdated, especially when you compare it to later incarnations in the Trek universe.  Still, any Trekker who knows their history knows that Star Trek was a pioneer in the television universe and overcame many obstacles, including network apathy, cast changes and a tiny budget, before making it to the small screen.The premise was really a simple one.  A starship crew lead by Captain James Kirk (William Shatner) encountered aliens and various science fiction phenomena each week as they explored the galaxy.  Kirk was a hero in the classic sense; the adventurous, womanizing and sometimes impetuous figure who cut his way into the final frontier.  But this hero was backed up by an unusual figure who actually overshadowed his popularity in TV fandom, Mr. Spock.  Leonard Nimoy plays the alien Vulcan to perfection and provides the perfect logical counterpoint to Kirk's passion.  We also have Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForest Kelley) who acts as Kirk's heart when necessary, and who wasn't always comfortable with the science around him.  Throw in a gruff Scottish engineer, an Asian helmsman and an African-American woman communications officer, and you have a diverse cast that was unheard of in that day and age.  Star Trek wasn't simply a ""ray gun alien series,"" as was some of it's contemporaries.  The aliens were often threatening, but weren't often evil.  The violence wasn't always necessary and the heroes weren't always right.Star Trek was also revolutionary in some of the science fiction concepts it used in it's TV scripts.  ""A Taste of Armageddon,"" focuses on a society that wages a civilized war based on computer calculations.  ""Devil in the Dark,"" features an encounter with a life form based on silicon.  ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" and ""Tomorrow is Yesterday,"" explore the always-popular sci-fi premise of time travel.  But while concepts were always a big part of Star Trek, character was never lacking as evidenced by such episodes as, ""The Naked Time,"" ""The Conscience of the King,"" ""The Enemy Within,"" and ""The Galileo Seven.""  We are also treated to several first encounters.  We meet the sinister Romulans for the first time in, ""Balance of Terror,"" the ruthless Klingons in, ""Errand of Mercy,"" and Kirk has his first encounter with the genetically engineered Khan in ""Space Seed,"" which would be the genesis of the popular 1982 Trek feature film.  All and all, the first season of Star Trek is it's best with the perfect blend of action, character and story.The DVD package is more creative than most.  I like the hard plastic shuttlecraft case.  The extras rival those of many current day series, featuring interviews with Shatner, Nimoy and many other writers and producers of the show.  I also found it fascinating that the picture is so high quality and the audio is presented in surround sound.  I didn't care for the pop-up text commentary.  I prefer audio commentary as it adds more depth to what the contributor has to say.I doubt that anyone who didn't have an affinity for the series in the past would be interested in it now.  It's probably up to those of us who are already fans of the series to keep it alive on DVD.  Still, I suspect that, when history makes it's judgment, Captain Kirk and the crew of the original U.S.S. Enterprise will be remembered more vividly than will many of their successors."	5.0	The Beginning of a Television Classic	2005-01-31	8	4	4

Ver Berkmoes	Beware, Paramount has made some coding blunders - at least on the set I received - which caused disk three of the set to be unusable. The same problems happened on every DVD player I tried with this disk. Basically menus would not function which meant you could not play the disk (!). The behavior seems more symptomatic of flawed coding than a production problem with my sample. They may need to get a revised disk out.	1.0	Coding Problems on Disks	2004-09-12	30	17	13

He said the remastering was done pretty good for the most part and feels like TV history has been preserved well for what they had to work with.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3917VW7KVZHPW	"Sarah Martin ""Valkyrie777"""	Don't be put off by the hokey sets and costumes, the dreadful special effects, the overdramatic music, and the dated &#34;future technology&#34; - this series is still a gem. It's a product of its time, and yet, it transcends its time to still be fun and meaningful today. It's the character dynamics that make it worth watching. I'm 23, and I absolutely love seeing the three main characters - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy - interact. The dialog is consistently good, and the stories are interesting and usually quite thought-provoking, if not deep. And while, as mentioned, the technology is &#34;dated&#34; (they're still using tapes, for example), it's still marvelous to see such inventive perceptions of future innovations. After all, Star Trek is where the sci-fi genre began.It's really enjoyable to see the crew of the Enterprise get themselves into and out of countless no-win situations through the ingenuity of Kirk and Spock, outwitting aliens and teaching them not to underestimate humanity. For a 60's TV show, there is a remarkable amount of character depth and growth in the leads, though Mr. Spock's may be the most obvious. Nimoy's stoic Spock - Captain Kirk's first officer and true right-hand man (er, Vulcan) - adds needed balance to Shatner's rather melodramatic Kirk while the folksy McCoy's playful conflicts with Spock are, perhaps, the heart of the show.I highly recommend this series for any sci-fi fan, obviously, and also, for anyone willing to look past a bit of 60's cheesiness and experience an epic adventure with the show's endlessly endearing characters.

As a first generation Star Trek fan, I am overjoyed with the makeover the program is getting. In recent years I've watched the unaltered version of the show on Cable and winced with pain at the plywood sets and the same seven stock shots of the Enterprise and the same planet model used over and over again. The special effects of 1967 no longer carry the story and I began to fear that future generations might begin to wonder what the fuss was about. No longer! I love the updated special effects. I think Gene Roddenbury  would like them as well. We saw with Next Generation what he really wanted to do with the original series had he the technology and the budget to do so. Even better, since these episodes are uncut for commercials, I've seen material in some of these episodes that I haven't seen since they first aired. What you see on TV these days are so badly cut up that vital parts of the dialog and story are missing. Now you can see the shows as intended. And somehow it seems fitting that a failed Sci-Fi show that refused to die should be the swan song for a dying format (HD DVD). No doubt seasons II and III will be produced in Blu-Ray format. Since these disks are hybrid, you can watch them on a standard DVD player as well as a HD DVD player. And at half the original price, these disks are a bargain for the hard-core Trek fan.	4.0	To Boldly Split Infinitives...	2008-03-21	1	1	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3KCW9ENWLEHI3	"Scott Mcintyre ""ssosmcin"""	"People just amaze me. I've read over every post here and the only negative comments seem to center around the cost of the set. As I write this, the full season is being sold by Amazon for $78.The reactions are varied but the same: ""Paramount is ripping us off!"" ""$80 for a show this old?"" ""I'd pay $80 for the whole series but this is too much for one season!"" Blah blah blah.Tell me, what three season show can you buy in its entirety on DVD in HD quality for $80? You will never get ""the whole series for $80"". Why even suggest it as a negative point? It's infantile.What does the age of the show have to do with the cost? It's a good show of high standard, has a dedicated and large fan base. It's no less of a show deserving of the best treatment than The Sopranos. Now THAT show (13 episodes a season for over $100) is a rip-off. But, what, that's okay? Please.The main reason why none of these arguments holds any water is very simple, maybe too simple to grasp. Blu-Ray is not standard DVD! It is not part of the ""discount bucket of DVDs for $3 each"" sales you find in stores. It's a new Hi-Def format that is more costly to produce and therefore more expensive than average standard def DVD. Why do people keep forgetting this? Even if it were a bare bones set, it would still run at least 30% more than standard def.The fact is the set is not bare bones. Follow along with me for a second: for $80, you get every episode of the first season (29 in all) in not one but TWO formats: original version or with updated special effects. Not only that, you also can choose to listen to the new surround sound audio or the mono mix from the original airings. It is, for all intents and purposes, like having two sets of episodes to choose from. Not to mention the entire catalog of behind the scenes featurettes.Finally, all of this is on the more expensive Blu-Ray format - and it is STILL LESS MONEY THAN THE STANDARD DEF FIRST SEASON REMASTERED DVD EDITION!!!!! Yet still people bitch and moan about the price? Show me any Blu-Ray set with this many hours of programming, choices and features for $80. Please. Do it now. I fricking dare you.It doesn't matter if you bought the Laserdiscs, VHS, Beta, DVD singles, then the season sets and then finally the remastered editions in the past. None of that has anything to do with the price of this set. It's on a new, higher quality format for less money than earlier sets have been and less money than many current Blu-Ray movie box sets are now.You think Paramount is ripping you off? You won't even stop to consider that the price is lowered because of the saturation of Star Trek sets? The MSRP is $120, but back in the day Voyager season sets were MSRPing for higher.  So, maybe all of your prior purchases did have an effect, but not the one you're complaining about.No, this set is fairly priced to anyone smart enough to consider the whole picture. I'm sorry if you can't afford it, times are tough, I feel it too. But don't bitch about this set on that basis. It's a good value for what they are providing on the format chosen. Again: not standard DVD - if it were you would have a beef. It's not, so you don't. No further bitching will change that."	4.0	The price is right	2009-03-11	245	187	58

Back then, we watched it for the special effects. Now, what I notice most are the excellent story lines and the acting. The story lines must have been cutting edge in their time and they are very inventive as well as involving. The story lines keep you hooked from beginning until end. The acting is top notch, though because I've seen so many caricatures, it takes a while to adjust to William Shatner's style, which is unique. It does work well in the end, as Kirk is supposed to be brash and cocky. It's also a wonderful contrast to the cerebral Spock, played wonderfully by Leonard Nimoy. The rest of the cast are also excellent in their own individual ways. Nichelle Nichols is just gorgeous, so one does have to pay attention to more than her looks. I'm looking forward to seeing Season Two soon.	5.0	As good as it always was!	2013-08-14	0	0	0
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2JFYJZ6Z67ZSU	Scotty	"This is THE Original Pilot [TOP] for Star Trek. Be a real Trekkie Nerd and add this to your collection. I cant believe I'm the first to review ""The Cage"" so thank you to Amazon, Paramount and the millions of Trekkies who didn't want to be the first.Roddenberry pitched every network and studio he could think of to produce the pilot and show finally pitching to Lucille Ball of Desilu Productions. Gene referred to Trek as ""wagontrain to the stars"". NBC censored TOP claiming Spock [Leonard Nimoy] was too Satan-ish, a female Number 1 [Majel Barrett] was ""unrealistic"", and no way could there any women on the Bridge. Because of NBC, we have a TOS that is extremely different than Roddenberry's vision.TOP was produced in 1965 and finally aired in 1986 as filler for Star Trek: The Next Generation [TNG] because of the writers strike.TOP's crew is completely replaced except for Spock. [No Kirk, Sulu, Checkov, Scott, or Uhura until NBC makes him change things.]TOP was re-used as a flashback for the ""Courtmarshall"" season finale cliffhanger.TOP Enterprise is commanded by Captain Christopher Pike [Jeffrey Hunter] and is investigating a distress signal from Talos IV, a planet in the far distant Talos system. During the survey of the signal's origin, Pike retires to his quarters and summons ship's Doctor Boyce [John Hoyt] who makes a martini for Captain Pike and says ""sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor"". You gotta love this stuff, right?? The Enterprise is recognizable on the outside, but inside she resembles a 1950's sci-fi set.Although the dialogue is very 60=ish, Roddenberry brings modern issues [like racial and sexual equality] and relationship building [Pike opening up to the Doctor about his conflicts and concerns] into his mythology as much as action and adventure. This formula is the success of Trek.Once the planet is reached, Pike sends a landing party to investigate. We meet Vina [Susan Oliver], the lone survivor of the SS Columbia, a long lost Earth ship. When Vina meets Number 1, she tries to insult Number 1 by comparing her to a computer [Majel Barrett went on to be the computer voice for all Trek series and movies, including ST09]. Vina refers to Pike as a ""prime specimen"" and lures Pike behind a door that once closed, the landing party and Enterprise cannot breach. Inside, Pike is imprisoned to be Vina's mate, and lead to believe he is reliving events contained in his memory. Here begins the meat of the story.I dont want to give up too much because TOP is only about a hour long and you might want to experience this lost episode for yourself - especially if you've seen every last episode of TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and any [or all] the movies.I hope you all enjoy this discarded episode as much as I have.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2MG95DI29NJTJ	Seth Eliot	"This review applies to Season 1, Episode 14, ""  Balance of Terror"", ASIN B000IAXVGWStar TrekAny fan of The Original (Star Trek) Series (herein referred to as ""TOS"") will enjoy this episode, but let me address you youngins out there that may have enjoyed The Next Generation or any of the later series, but who never saw (or did not like what they saw of) TOS.  TOS could certainly be quite uneven from episode to episode, but this is the episode to watch to understand what made TOS great when it did work.This is ostensibly an episode about a space battle, but it really is a character story.  Primarily about the two captains: our man James T. Kirk and the never-named Romulan captain.  It's a gripping cat and mouse play pitting two men against each other;  Men with greatness and ability, but also with flaws and doubts.  Men who are opposite sides of the same coin.... men who might be good friends were the circumstances different.  It's a story both of strategy and of character.This episode introduces for the first time many devices that have become mainstay of the Star Trek Universe.  This is the very first time we meet the Romulans, and are introduced to their martial, duty-driven culture.  This is the first time we hear of the neutral zone, and the Earth-Romulan ""conflict"" that necessitated its creation.  And this is the first time that we, and the Federation, find out about the cloaking device than can hide entire star ships.  (Also be sure to check out another great episode: ""The Enterprise Incident"" ASIN:B000HKYN7O, where Kirk steals said cloaking device).I may take some criticism for this, but one of the merits of this episode is the acting of Mr. William Shatner.  We are all familiar with his campy, over-the-top style, but in this episode Captain Kirk is a real person and we can see inside his thoughts and feelings.  As an example, right before the first cut-away (preceding the credits) look at Shatner's face as he walks away from the communicator.  This is fore-shadowing... we see only a glimpse, but it is a glimpse of duty and foreboding for the lives of the crew under his care.Sure the special effects will still disappoint if not taken in the context of time in which this was produced, and some of the plot devices are contrived, but in the format and time limitation of this episode it excels in being what it sets out to be: an entertaining and gripping story or conflict between two great men and two great machines of war."	5.0	The Episode to See	2007-01-19	9	9	0

There are some scenes in some episodes that have aspects which are a little dated, but when you consider that these films are 47 years old its amazing. Gene Roddenberry was light years ahead of his time. The &#34;new&#34; versions are not horrible. I have enjoyed them as well.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A12AQBITHJFT85	Shaun Navis	"I'm not happy about the outrageous price, or the decision to make combo discs (I'm staying with standard DVD until one format or the other wins out). For that reason, I'm holding off on this until the price comes way down (or perhaps I'll find them used somewhere).But what I really want to talk about is the new special effects. Personally, I've really enjoyed them! I'm sorry, but for years we've had to watch those god-awful shots of the Enterprise where the nacelle on the left side looks like it's disintegrating. It's awful, and it's always looked awful. Sometimes you'd also get dumb mistakes like a planet being one color, and a few seconds later that same planet would suddenly be an entirely different color (see ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"")! Most everything else, effects-wise, looks dated and cheesy but I won't criticize too much on what the creators had available in those days... It was what it was.Anyhow, while a few of the new effects fall flat, most of them look beautiful. There's lots of great shots and angles of the Enterprise, and other ships, moving in ways we couldn't have seen them doing 40 years ago. I also really like the new looks for both the planets and outdoor backgrounds. Much more realistic, and some of them are just stunning. Anyone catch the new ""Amok Time"" on TV? Those shots of Vulcan (with Kirk & Co. in the distance, walking to Mt. Selaya) are outstanding. If anything, I feel like the people creating the new effects haven't done enough! I'd have gone to the trouble of doing more fixes. The cruddy map of the Romulan Star Empire in ""Balance of Terror,"" for instance, could sure use replacing. I wouldn't be against having new, CGI versions of the Gorn, Mugato and Horta either. I'm sure others will disagree though.Really, this is nothing like George Lucas' tampering with Star Wars. There, Lucas was making wholesale changes -- some that even altered the story -- for specious reasons. In the case of Trek, nothing being done is changing the plots in any way, and it's all being pretty tastefully done. There's no excessive business going on in the backgrounds to distract the viewer. The same cannot be said about Star Wars.Besides, after seeing the same epiosdes dozens of times I got tired of them. Many of the plots just don't hold up anymore (although some of them remain as strong as ever), and no matter how much some may love the show the originals really do look pretty hokey these days. Actually, it looked pretty hokey to me 25 years ago as a kid, but that's not the point. The newly remastered episodes have renewed my interest in this show. That's a good thing, since I haven't been terribly interested in any Star Trek since (the seriously underrated) DS9 ended its run eight years ago.It might help create a new generation of fans. That's also a good thing, since this messed up world or ours could use more Trek's IDIC philosophy right about now.

The actors were different in the pilot and Kirk, Bones, and Scotty are missing.  Worst of all, Spock smiles in one scene.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2K0Y55A5KQSU7	Sloopydrew	This set collects some of the best shows to air on television.  The set also comes with funky retro packaging that would make any self-respecting geek drool in a way that will insure their being single until the next season of Star Trek is released (giving them more time to enjoy this collection).  Sadly, Paramount is squeezing us Trekkies/Trekkers/Addicts like members of the mob would squeeze an inner-city grocery-store, with their outrageous prices.  $85.00 AFTER a 35% discount?  Ironic, being that in the show they're selling, money is no longer used.  Another thing that's bugged me in ALL the Trek DVD sets is the horrendous chapter break that happens after opening credits.  It jumps you about five minutes into the actual episode.  There is no way to skip the credit sequence, without missing a good chunk of the show.  Sure, it's fun the first 135 you narrate along with Captain Kirk talking about the Final Frontier, but it gets old by the 140th session, unless you really start adding variety by sucking in a balloon full of helium before speaking the words William ... Shatner ... reads ... with ... such ... high ... melodrama.  The picture quality is decent.  Probably not what you'd expect for the price.  Paramount didn't send in a restoration team to make this look as pretty as something released today should.  You know something wasn't done right with this set when these shows from the 60s look WORSE than Chaplin movies from the 20s do, in the Chaplin Collection (now THAT'S restoration).  What makes this worth the purchase are the compelling stories, great chemistry between the cast, nifty mini-skirts, cheesy alien outfits and finally getting to own the original episodes on DVD.  Is that worth $85.00, when you can still watch any of these shows for free on television?  It's your call.  At these prices, I've only purchased season 3, 4 and 5 of The Next Generation and this set of The Original Series.  I've rented each season of Deep Space Nine (at a more reasonable price, I would have bought them) and stopped, pointed and laughed wildly at the first three seasons of Voyager, whenever I pass them in the store.  You make the call and make sure you make the right one, because the execs at Paramount would just assume stomp a Tribble with bare feet than they would issue you a refund because you feel ripped-off, after opening the set and realizing you're basically getting a sort of washed-out collection of episodes in neat packaging and nothing more (the extras are weak).5 stars for the shows.  2 stars for the value.  3 stars overall.	3.0	The Trouble with Paramount...	2004-09-07	20	13	7

If You notice in the first 4 episodes the camera angles an the lighting and the stories are very cool an they were written by some of sci-fi best. One episode called "" what are little girls made of ""  involved a Man from Nurse Chapels past, who is hiding something on a planet Kirk talks to one of the imates who name is LETHE, means river of foregoneness  , Ted Cassidy plays a Android an a scary one at that/ Dagger of the Mind episode brings the Enterprise on a routine pick up turns up at a penal colony but  something going on down there. In this episode Spock performs His first mind -meld  . Balance of terror The first time they encounter the Romulans ,  both play like a submarine  tactics against each other until one survives . These are just a few of first season Since HD lost against Bluray, this box set has HD on one side the other standard DVD . One other thing , each disc isn't labeled , so its  hard to hide each disc , but there is fine print on the rim of the disc. Watching this remaster  discs brings a new flair to each episode , no more stock footage of the Enterprise , and she looks lovely as can be. The planets are more defined and detailed , slight added scenes with the shuttle craft such as the episode Galileo Seven , when Spock ignites the fuel as a flare around the planet is awesome looking. The price on these sets are a lot cheaper when I bought mine , Im now thinking Bluray , though nothings wrong with this set , but since I have Netflix , I hardly watch it on DVD.

Star Trek has never looked better!  You can see Mr. Spock's bad teeth.  You can see the detail of Kahn's uniform.  It's simply amazing.  And, you can watch episodes doctored up with new CG special effects or in their original form...on the same disc!!  You can switch back and forth between the two midstream.  The ""Pop-up video"" style to the commentaries is pretty cool.  There are some shortfalls (admittedly, I haven't had time to watch everything).  For example, there are some cast interviews...I think it's on disc 5.  They were recorded back in 2003...at least the portion I saw was.  It was an interview of Shatner and it's obvious it was video taped in NTSC.  It looks pretty bad in comparison to the other materials...but then again, you're not watching the interviews for a super extra clear image of Shatner.  As for the price, I'm blown away.  7 discs for $65.  That's less than $10 per disc...a bargain.  That comes out to $2 or $3 per episode with the extras thown in for free.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2NJ6Q4D2GS7O8	"Spiletta42 ""spiletta42"""	"I love the original Star Trek, and the first season contains many of the best episodes, like Devil in the Dark, City on the Edge of Forever, and Space Seed.  You'll smile at William Shatner's overacting, and snicker at the thought of toggle switches in space, but you will have a good time, and the DVD extras are fun.Star Trek The Original Series is a classic for a reason, and will be enjoyed by all science fiction fans.  It's well worth owning.The packaging, however, is a problem.  Removing a DVD to watch it is a four step process, and the ""collectable"" packaging just begs to be damaged.  It is slightly less ugly than the Voyager packaging, however.  Attention, Paramount:  Cheap plastic shatters in the mail, or even sitting innocently on the shelf if there's a slight breeze.  Use cardboard.  For good packaging, see Andromeda, Firefly, Stargate SG-1, and even Roswell.  All of these are well packaged.  Geez, even the X-Files packaging is better than this -- it's a pain in the, but at least it isn't ugly."	5.0	Awesome DVDs come in hideous packaging.	2004-10-27	18	14	4
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3VEKSH05MY7LE	Spilkman	"What is there left to say about this classic show? The episodes are wonderful and are the foundation for decades more of Trek in its various forms. The PIP feature is nice as well on many key episodes. The remastering is done tastefully, not heavy handedly, and blends in seamlessly with the rest of the shots so you never feel you are watching something new, although it definitely looks better than what you remember. Every so often the shots of the Enterprise scream CG, but basically, these remastered shows are the complete opposite of what George Lucas would do had he thought of Star Trek and wanted to go back and ""improve"" it. For me, that's a good thing. The reason I don't give this a higher rating is the terrible, awful, cheap, flimsy packaging. Honestly, this is one of those times where you ask yourself, ""What were they thinking?"" The discs are housed in a cheap plastic book that is probably cracked when you open the set for the first time because it is so fragile. (I returned this set three times because the packaging was cracked and damaged before I just gave up!) Removing a disc is cumbersome and one has to take great care not to scratch anything. Information about what's on the discs is given in plastic collector cards that look nice, but detract from functionality because you have to remove all the cards from a paper pocket that houses the plastic book of DVDs and search for the one card that relates to the disc you are viewing after you have fumbled through the cracked case for the right DVD and taken great care not to scatch the darn disc! Aaaarghhh!!! For the price on this item, even at discount rates, Paramount should have done better with the packaging."	3.0	Classic show looks great remastered, but packaging is horrible	2008-06-20	11	11	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	"There's little doubt that the first season of ""Star Trek"" is the best of the original series--and arguably the best of any ""Star Trek"" incarnation.  William Shatner is in fine form; long before his performances gravitated toward self-caricature, they were controlled, powerful, and effective, and he imbues James T. Kirk with exactly the right combination of youth and worldliness to make him believable.  Leonard Nimoy gives Spock enough ragged edges in the first season to make the character seem both alien and at war with himself over his human and Vulcan(ian) halves, the perfect counterpart to DeForest Kelley's wonderfully irascible Dr. McCoy.  The excellent cast of supporting players was often joined by terrific character actors, too numerous to mention here.  But what makes the first season so special is the winning combination of a low-key, atmospheric narrative style and topnotch sci-fi premises, many offered by the better writers of the day.  While the series would become more cartoonish as it wore on, the first season remains relatively pure--humor is used to break dramatic tension rather than at the expense of characters, genuine suspense threads many of the episodes, and the audience's senses are dazzled by the efforts of directors, cinematographers, conductors, costume designers, and special effects wizards.  In other words, the show remained evocative of the ""Golden Age"" of television.  The DVD collection includes all of the earliest episodes--minus the original pilot that was not televised during the show's initial run--but lacks many extras.  Still, the opportunity to own ""Star Trek"" at this price makes this set alone worth the purchase."	5.0	Star Trek at its Best.	2004-09-03	10	7	3

Instead, I'll share my opinion and rating of this DVD collection from a physical product standpoint, as well as some of the DVD-collection/presentation elements.PHYSICAL PRODUCTIONPROS:- comes in a single hard shell case instead of a cardboard fold-out box- each disc label has a photo of an original cast member as their characterCONS:- each of the 8 DVDs is stored on a single, clear plastic, uncovered disc-holder. All 8 are held together with a piece of clear tape.- the taped bundle of 8 discs fits inside a tight-fitting paper sleeve- booklet for the DVDs is just a flimsy long fold-out with little informative valueDVD PRESENTATION:PROS:- good sound- decent image quality- episode preview trailer included for each episode- some episodes have text pop-up commentary- all episodes have chapter logs- original broadcast date included- a few extras includedCONS:- being forced to sit through the credits of every episode- being forced to sit through the bridge animation sequence to get to the main menu- bad quality control process on some of episode selection/nav console sequence (for example, I always experience stuttering and visual errors when loading the episode nav console for ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"")- use of prints apparently remastered in 1978 (unless the closing copyright date is simply a studio copyright and not print-related).OTHER STUFF:Price: I bought it new and discounted at $79.99 and thought that should have been the *list* price. Pretty poor value if you pay much more than this."	3.0	Review of product presentation, not the show itself	2004-09-09	70	63	7
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A20Q8XOOHA1TRL	Steve Conklin	Star Trek was the beginning in the 60's of serious science fiction TV series. I watched the first shows as they appeared for the first time on TV & almost 50 years later they are still fun to watch.  Many of the gadgets on the show then are in use today, and many things in the 21st Century are better than imagined by the writers back then. Even by today's standards though it is still far in the future and the possibilities are exciting. I hope younger generations continue to daydream over Star Trek and dare to reach for the stars as it encouraged me to do. I doubt I would have become an aerospace engineer without good science fiction like this to grow up on. Live long and prosper.	5.0	Imagine a Earth without Star Trek	2013-08-16	0	0	0

The special features are many (one per disk minimum) and well thought out.The crutch lays on the case design.  Sure, it looks cool, but it's a pain in the neck to get disks out.  First you open the clamshell, pull out the yellow case, shake out the disk holder (without losing the information sheets, THEN you can flip through the disks and hope nobody messed up the order cause you can only tell the disks by the tiny 5 point print around the center.Not only that, but this case is prone to breaking.  I've gotten one from the mail (here) and the second season from a store and both had cracks in the case.  To put the cherry on top, the guy that sold me his new copy through amazon neglected to tell me his was region 2 (instead of 1 like America).

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A11MWWD2KIYZ3F	swansong	After viewing only a few episodes I could quickly see and hear an amazing improvement in this fantastic Blu-ray edition.  First,  the picture on the Blu-ray edition is shown in it's original aspect ratio with black bars on the outer edges of the screen.  Second, the picture restoration is just tremendous, especially with the use of contrast in order to create more vivid color and clarity, although I did notice some very minor debris still left behind.  That said, the picture here is the best ever for this series. Because I consider myself a purist and a fan since the show debuted, I was more than a little skeptical about the new visual effects, but to my surprise found them strangely compelling.  The new effects in no way take you out of the experience, nor do they feel excessive.  Once I see all the new effects, I may return to the original, but don't hold me to it.  As for the new 7.1 surround sound, I still prefer the original mono mix, but as I've mentioned, I'm a bit of a purist.  The new mix does sound bright with great dynamics throughout.  This is the third time I've purchased this series.  I believe Star Trek fans have finally been offered an edition worthy of this brilliant program.  I highly recommend the Blu-ray edition of Star Trek The Original Series Season One.  It's a wonderful value for the money, and I can't wait to see the next two seasons.  A must have for every Star Trek fan.	5.0	An Amazing Improvement !	2009-04-28	8	7	1

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A9OW8616KJJMT	"swingreen ""swingreen"""	Where, exactly, does one start talking about THE original series that single-handedly launched the TV sci-fi genre like none that came before it and none has done since? What does one say about the one sci-fi show against which all subsequent sci-fi seems to be some kind of lesser imitation or spinoff? Should discussion begin with the original and imaginative concepts and themes - space warp, time travel, alternate realities and universes, powers of the mind and spirit, transporter beams - or should discussion start by talking about how masterfully familiar human interest themes are woven into a technological vision of the future? Or, maybe discussion should begin with how perfectly the show's central characters both complement and supplement each other at multiple levels of the human experience - the decisive commander-warrior, the rational half-human science officer, and the empathetic healer?Ever since I began staying up late Friday nights to watch the original airings with my parents almost forty years ago, viewing rerun after rerun in syndication for the next fifteen years,sometimes twice a day, every day, and watching the spinoffs throughout the next fifteen years, the answers to those questions have always stayed just out of my reach. The problem has always been that my favorite Trek episode was usually the one I happened to be watching, or, if I hadn't been watching one, my top choices seemed to wander from episode to episode from day to day, even from morning to noon to night. I was vaguely aware that it had something to do with who I was, or what I was experiencing as a person at that particular moment.For me, the highlights of season one exemplify my sentiments, from &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, the powerful opening episode (which was aired out of sequence, for some strange reason) where two crew members, one a personal friend of Captain Kirk, become endowed with mental powers that grow to such strength as to make them a danger to the ship and crew, to the question and problem of time travel raised in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, which is regarded by many fans as possibly the best sci-fi episode ever produced.Oh, but then there's &quot;Space Seed&quot;, whose sequel was produced in the feature film, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, where the Enterprise is commandeered by a rogue group of genetically-engineered super-leaders from the 20th century. Ricardo Montalban may have turned out the two most memorable performances of his career as the charismatic but overly-ambitious Khan. It is even more impressive when one considers that genetic engineering was barely a blip on the scientific radar in 1965 when the episode was written and filmed.Who can forget &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, which was Trek's rendition of the movie classic &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;, which tells the story of two seasoned commanders playing a deadly game of cat and mouse in in deep space? This episode features Mark Lenard, who would also act the part of Spock's father in several future TV episodes and the feature film, &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;.Season 1 also gives fans the first glimpse of the mischievous but lovable space-rogue Harcourt Fenton (aka &quot;Harry&quot;) Mudd in &quot;Mudd's Women&quot;. Viewer beware - do not allow the episode's light-hearted tone to obscure it's message, that physical beauty is merely an outward manifestation of one's true, inner beauty.As I watch all these episodes again for what must be the eighth or ninth time, I still see things for the first time I somehow managed to miss throughout all my previous viewings, and I still find myself pondering the large questions of life: who and what is man?, love and hate, war and peace, faith and reason, and all the other issues related to our purpose in this life.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AGVVIT1FKTBKO	Swubird	Star Trek: The Original Series - Season One, was absolutely a best buy. The image was clear and sharp and we experienced no problems. I couldn't be happier with the product and will gladly buy more of the same. If you are an early Star Trek lover like me, I'm talking about the original series, and you wish to relive the experience, the excitement of sitting down in front of your television and watching that very first episode, you'll be more than happy with this package, and viewing it will take you right back to those old days just as sure as if you were in a time machine. Remember Jeffrey Hunter as Christopher Pike, the first captain of the USS Enterprise? What about Ricardo Montalban as Khan? And Nichelle Nichols as Uhura and Spock and Bones and Scotty and Sulu? They're all there, young and vibrant and adventuresome, just as you remember them. And, of course, there were too many guest appearances to count. I understand that others have had problems with these disks, but our copy was great. I give it five stars. Now beam me up Scotty!	5.0	BEAM ME UP SCOTTY!	2010-02-06	0	0	0

The colors turned out wonderful. I've never seen this show look so great. The audio sounds okay, and they've redone a lot of the special effects with new CGI and 3D technology. I think that the new special effects look great, but if you're a purist and would rather view the original versions, you can switch back and forth between the two.There are some nice extras included as well, and the packaging is nice.

This is a next generation format for the next generation editions of this series.  I personally think the episodes look amazing with the HD transfer, and new CG FX.  It makes the classic series blend better with the 90s TV series, as well as the new Star Trek movie coming out in 2008.  Move out of your parents' basement and accept that time moves on people.Let me say I was not intending to offend Trekkies, as I've been an avid fan for decades.  The Trekkie stereotype is so well known I thought people would get the joke.  And yes the original versions have been released countless times, so obviously if Paramount paid for the high def remastering, there are going to release the new HD versions.  Maybe eventually they will release the old school versions, for completists and to take more of our money, but I like the new changes.	4.0	Get With the Times People	2007-10-21	21	4	17

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AJM5FQBRCQJ2	Tellyman	I love this episode (except for the excessive reactions of Mr. Styles), and the strategies of both captains as they try to outwit each other.  They are enemies but respect each other's skills.  However I dislike the changes with the special effects.For me, many of the remastered episodes use inappropriate computer generated views of ships, shuttles, or stellar phenomena.  Many changes don't fit in at all and detract greatly from the overall look of the show.  If they ever put out new DVDs, they would be wise to offer the option of viewing each episode with the original scenes.Update:  I thought to be fair I should take another look at multiple episodes to see the variety of special effects updates. It was quite interesting.  In some episodes, the changes were subtle.  The ship and other special effects were tastefully done and looked beautifully updated yet seamlessly integrated into the show. Bravo!  In other episodes it seemed the team (a different group?) took much greater liberties, e.g., shuttles that wobble, ships turning when they were not, the doomsday machine tipping over when it was destroyed (in space??). Those effects just looked out of place.Anyway, even if our views of the remastered shows differ, we're still all Star Trek fans.  I love this show and really respect how ahead of the times it was (previews of flip cell phones and IPads way back 40+ years ago?  Amazing stuff!!).	3.0	Remastering detracts from episode	2012-07-28	1	1	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A25QJBK33C4O0R	"terpfan1980 ""Barry"""	I passed on buying the individual episodes (or multiple episode) DVDs when they were first released, and then passed on buying the DVD sets that were released, but when this HD DVD set was released, I knew I was going to have a hard time passing.Cleaned up images, touched up (but not ruined or destroyed as Lucas did with Star Wars) special effects and prop images, and so many extras that a Trek fan could be busy for weeks watching all of the content on these discs.Besides the fairly high price tag (which isn't all that bad once you average the price out among the 10 Combo formatted - HD DVD on one side, DVD on the other - discs included in the set), my one real complaint is in the packaging, with a couple of nits to pick.First, since the discs are combo discs, there's no 'face' to the discs with episodes noted on that face.  Instead there's a set of plastic cards that fit into the neat-o Trek type case.  Ummm, ok.  I can buy that, but... the cards all came in one little sealed plastic package that was inside the bigger package.  I guess it is assumed that the cards will not slide around that way.  Buyer must open the set of plastic cards themselves and then insert back into the neat-o Trek type case.The discs themselves are kept in a book type clear plastic casing with a binding on one edge.  The plastic book that holds the disc folds open for access to the discs in the set.  Unfortunately there's no plastic cover over the top most disc (disc 1).  That means if you aren't careful, as you take the book type case out of the bigger package you'll be fingerprinting the DVD side of disc 1. D'oh!  The back of the inside plastic case does have a plastic cover so you won't be touching the HD DVD side of disc 10.  I wish that the 'pages' of the inside plastic case each had a copy of the plastic cards discussed above, or at least had some documentation about what is on the discs in those slots of the case.  Again, something that would be much bigger and more visible to show me what episodes are on which disc.One final nit -- while the menu system is fairly intuitive, I am somewhat disappointed that there's no written notes in the package that tell the buyer of the various extras and options that are available.  There are some fairly cool extras there, and I fear I might miss something I'd want to see just from not knowing it's there.  Poor job of marketing the final product for customers.On the actual images of the episodes on the HD DVD sides of these discs, beautiful.  Simply beautiful. Nice clean images that are bright and sharp.  Nice use of the pillar bar areas for showing icons noting extras that are available at various points while watching the episodes.  Nice picture and picture splits for showing commentary information alongside the original episodes.  About the only thing missing that I could speak of is the commercials that used to pop-up at the moments of maximum drama while watching these episodes.  Expensive HD DVD set, but well worth it for this Trek fan.	5.0	Expensive set, but a must for Trek fans	2007-12-12	2	2	0

Favorite is TNG, but like Voyager and the rest of the series too.  I hadn't watched the original series episodes in years and years - literally, probably since they were played on regular network TV stations.After watching all of the movies in a row I decided, initially reluctantly, to get the original series on Blu Ray.  A lot of people view the original series as outdated and somewhat cheezy.  I thought I may think the same.These are great shows!  I found that even though I remembered most of them (and forgotten about some) for the most part they were all really good.  The picture quality was awesome!  It made viewing the episodes even better.  On the third season now and so far everything is great - no hang ups or freezing issues, nothing.  Glad I ended up getting these.  At least it's one more Star Trek series I can throw in the mix of re-watching all the series repeatedly.  My advice - if you are like me and haven't watched the original series in a long time and are worried they'll seem kind of boring - go ahead and get it.  I was very pleasantly surprised and the much improved Blu Ray picture quality made it even better.	4.0	Way Better Than I Thought It Would Be	2014-03-28	1	0	1

What I noticed was that it is not perfect, there are numerous scenes [mostly in the closing titles and stills] with visible dirt/debris and scratches which could have been removed.  There are also quality differences from scene to scene which some viewers may find distracting [me among them]- one scene is crystal-clear, while the next scene may be comparatively fuzzy, with visible film grain and multigenerational losses visible].  Another curiosity is why they had to drown-out William Shatner's opening narration [""Space...the final frontier...""] with so much reverberation.  Other than those quibbles, I found the colors to be as garishly oversaturated [with almost a day-glow flourescent quality] as I remember from watching it on its original run [circa 1966] on an old-fashioned Setchell-Carson 25"" color console TV, but with vastly improved fine detail - the make-up was VERY apparent, also I could see ear hair/peachfuzz on some actors! Every shaft of hair was clearly visible, along with acne scars and the border of Captain Kirk's hairpiece.  The motion-animated digital insertions were seamless and greatly enabled the enhanced ""versimilitude"" the producers were after.  BTW, this review applied only to the standard definition side, I have not been able to watch the HD side, as I have no HD player - this said, I am amazed they were able to make the standard-def picture so sharp and finely detailed.I remember watching the digitally reworked ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"" and [at the time] wondering if anybody would ever do the same thing with TOS, and now they have.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AUCYGXXZD64X0	Timothy J Walburg	First off let me say that I have all 40 of the 2 episode discs and that I'm not at all happy that these are being released as season sets at a substantially cheaper price.  Conservatively, I've invested $600.00 in the series original release compared to $255.00 from Amazon for the 3 season rerelease.  That being said I would like to offer a possible reason as to the release as it initially was done.  All these episodes are old. They were all remastered and had a Dolby remix added.  This costs money (obviously) and requires time, so to recoup some of their losses they released them slowly over a period of a couple of years.I'm glad I have them. I've thoroughly enjoyed them over the past few years.  I would LOVE to have the rerelease,not the least that my storage space is limited too.  But for financial reasons it just ain't gonna happen. So, in conclusion, it would be nice if Paramount made some concession to us die-hard, loyal, original series fans who bought the original release, (I can't stand any of the later incarnations, either) but I'm sure that ain't gonna happen either.P.S. You REALLY want to get sick about this release?  Just check out what the Japanese release is going to be!

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AUOERKGK4Z8DP	Timothy L. Smith	All the basics of the characters and plot are unchanged, but scenes of the Enterprise, planets, etc. have been subtly upgraded. For example, where the original showed a three foot model of a building in the distance, now you see various vehicles moving, lights on, and people moving inside the windows, making it appear more real without distracting from the original, quirky classicStar Trek look. The color throughout is vivid, unlike the gray sunglasses look of TNG. I feel the subtle upgrades made the series much more &#34;watchable&#34; for new generations, and the footage with the classic characters has been kept untouched except for the restored color balances.	5.0	Subtle but effective upgrade of original special effects	2013-08-11	0	0	0

There's not much else one can say other than for $64.99 at the moment of writing this it's too good to pass up.

I love how I have the option of seeing it as originally released or with the space scenes effects updated/modernized.No matter which view I choose, I can switch back and forth whenever I want. I still love this collection (can't wait for season 2 & 3 to arrive) and would recommend it to anyone who loves Star Trek and wants to see TOS it as it should have been from day one.My only nit is that they didn't clean up the pictures with the end credits. Since they could have easily replaced them with the exact same pictures from the cleaned up episodes & just put fresh text on top, this seems a strange omission. It doesn't make me hate it, it's just a minor annoyance.Update: I've just gotten through watching ""Court Martial"" on Disc 5 and noticed a 'pulsing' in brightness that went from annoying to almost unnoticeable. It hasn't happened on any other episode as yet. I'll contact the studio and see if they've had that problem and have replacement discs."	5.0	Best view of ST-TOS ever, but...	2011-04-05	0	0	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2YHU2LV32CKNO	Todd Bradley	"Giving the original ""Star Trek"" a rating with one to five stars is sort of like reviewing Shakespeare. The television series changed science fiction forever, made a pop culture impact worldwide, predicted the future, and kicked off a franchise that is still making billions of dollars today. Yes, the show is schlocky, yes the effects are bad, yes the acting is overwrought, yes some of the plots are cliche (and probably were 40 years ago). But we love it anyhow.The only reason I'm subtracting one star from what would otherwise be a perfect five out of five is this: In this set of recordings, someone felt the need to go back and redo many of the visual effects with mediocre CGI. The original bad effects are part of the appeal of the series. The new bad effects look just as dated, but dated to 2006 instead of 1966. Today, in 2013, they already look bad and out of place. I guess some executive figured if George Lucas can do it to ""Star Wars"" then they might as well do the same to ""Star Trek."" Personally, I'd rather have the original bad effects. Nobody's ""updating"" the dialogue or hokey costumes, so why update the shots of the Enterprise circling the planet below?(By the way, unlike in the JJ Abrams ""reboots"" any lens flares you see in these episodes are real authentic non-simulated happy accidents.)"	4.0	how are you supposed to rate a classic like this?	2013-10-14	1	0	1

New Frontier book series by Peter David)DVD-wise since I'm not rich enough to buy DS9 or TNG DVD collection, I broke down and bought this set and will probably buy the remaining 2 sets.  It was seeing old friends with their familiar jibes and quirks.  The episodes are presented 4 per DVD in the order they were shown on TV (unlike what some other poster said).  The picture is decent but there are episode gems like ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and ""Menagerie"" that made it worthwhile to get this 38 year old TV set.But as I watch, thoughts of GalaxyQuest keep creepin in..The new featurettes are amusing but feel alittle flat especially the Shatner one where he just goes on and on and on about his horses.  The cast interviews are done in isolation.  I guess they can't hang out together anymore.I dock this one star for not having the cast members provide commentary for the episodes.  At least, one episode?  They don't even have to do the same one!  Favorite ep or something.  Come on!  With ""Bones"" and ""Scotty"" (essentially) gone, this would be an ideal time to immortalize.Unless they are saving those in the vault until the 40th anniversary.Hmm.

I watched the first-run shows on TV when I was 8 years old. Unfortunately, on a black & whit TV. Never got to see them in color until re-runs in the 1980's.I am responding to the guy who rails on ""whiners.""  To quote:""Want to know why Paramount did that rip-off release in the first place? Take a look in the mirror! They knew that suckers like you would cough up over the odds, just as they knew they'd cash in again in the future with proper box sets. Something else: if people like you hadn't bought those original releases in the first place then we probably would have had these box sets years ago. So, you were not only fools to yourselves; you screwed it up for the rest of us too! No sympathy (is that coming across, at all?)""I've got news for you and your ilk. It so happens that you would not have this box set if we hadn't sprung for the originals. Star Trek was one of the first series to be put on DVD in its entirety. Back then there were no complete season boxes of any shows. It was the success of this disc-by-disc issue that proved that there is a market for complete-series DVDs. The next step was to package them in less-expensive less cumbersome boxes to appeal to an even wider audience. You should be thanking rather than mocking.That said, I will probably buy the boxes to regain a yard of shelf space, get the extras, etc. Maybe they're better transfers too. I'll unload the others at a big loss, knowing full well that I did enjoy watching each and every one."	5.0	"If It Weren't For the ""Suckers"" You Wouldn't Have This Set"	2004-08-24	4	2	2

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A6VXZ1EEPRTLV	trebe	"This Bluray set may not be perfect, but it's pretty darn close, as after restoration, visual enhancements, and special effects upgrades, the season one episodes of Star Trek (1966-67), look absolutely amazing in high definition.  Although there are some signs of age, that a television program over 40 years old can look this good, is quite amazing.  Paramount Studios, and those who participated in this 2009 release, deserve much credit for this ""stellar' release.  Anyone who can remember when Star Trek was available on DVD's with just two episodes each, can fully appreciate the beauty of this set.  The nice set of bonus materials is certainly commendable, unfortunately the cherry on top, a commentary track or two from one of the cast, would certainly have delighted the fans.Star Trek came to television when the space race was burning white hot, as America strived to get to the moon, and the exploration of space was in the consciousness of the nation.  Although the technological capabilities of television in 1966 may seem crude today, they were sufficient to produce what were then, cutting edge special effects.  And being a color production was simply huge, and something that Star Trek's production staff took full advantage of.  Just imagining how the program would look in black and white, it's clear that so much would have been lost, had the series come to television just a few years earlier.  Those familiar with the history of Star Trek, probably know that getting the series on the air was an arduous process, but it apparently happened with support from Lucille Ball, of Desilu Productions, who believed in the show's concept.While The Twilight Zone, and The Outer Limits, occasionally explored science fiction in a serious manner, Star Trek took the bull by the horns, routinely dealing with themes like war, justice, aliens, duty, personal rights, survival, and the nature of man, and other lifeforms.  Although preceded by Lost in Space, which was set on alien worlds, Star Trek dealt with space travel, and the universe, in a consistently ""realistic"" way.While there usually wasn't much time for romance, the element that Star Trek did feature in a BIG way was ""sex"", and predominantly in the female form.  Never before, had so many beautiful women been featured in space, and on alien worlds, with a wide variety of attire ranging from skin tight Federation uniforms, to flowing gowns, to exotic costumes of the future.  The emphasis on glamour was very deliberate, as in close-ups, the faces of males often exhibit stunning detail, while in contrast, the women often appear to have been shot through a glamour filter.  Males were not objectified in quite the same way, although Kirk was often shirtless, and Sulu also makes a notable topless appearance, in ""The Naked Time"".Enhanced visual effects are available as an option, and give the episodes a fresh new look, and do a good job of keeping the program from looking too dated.  For those that prefer them, the original effects remain available.  The only major flaw in the high def package, is that the audio drops down in a number of the episodes.From the very start, Star Trek featured outstanding stories, with soon to become iconic characters, facing provocative moral dilemmas.  These would prove to be key factors in the franchise's enduring popularity, as Star Trek's fan base grew during its run in syndication, providing the momentum for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and so very much more.  The genesis of all this, is right here in the first season of Star Trek.  All three seasons on Bluray are essential for any Trekkie, but with so much that is essential, Season One is probably the one to acquire first."	5.0	at long last, Star Trek receives the royal treatment it rightfully deserves...	2013-04-14	1	1	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AZAH84SERW5GR	Troy	"If you recall, the original Season 1 DVD was released for $140 MSRP. I bought mine for $115, so the price for this high-def upgrade is not bad at all.  (And if you think the current price is still too high, just wait for the price to drop. Like all the other Star Trek discs, it will eventually be available for half its current amount.)As for the CGI upgrades:- They really didn't impress me too much. There's maybe 30 seconds of new footage per episode (on average), which is nothing to get excited about, and the only episodes where I think CGI adds to the storyline are the Doomsday Machine (aka the Horn'o'Plenty) and the Ultimate Computer in later seasons.  In some episodes the CGI is so sparse you can't even see it (like Devil in the Dark).- In fact, I actually prefer the original episodes with NO upgrades of any kind (just clean the negatives). I liked the model effects/ hand-painted landscapes that were used in the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and the Original Series.  They were the result of artists giving months of their lives to bring us entertainment, and those original scenes should be preserved.  (Same goes for the unaltered Star Wars movies.)Oh one more thing:- Star Trek's first season is the most solid season of all the series. Gene Roddenberry imported lots of talented writers from the world of science fiction novels (like Harlan Ellison), and both Gene Roddenberry & Gene Coon had many fresh ideas that they had been working on for roughly two years time (1965-67), such that the end result was a fantastic ""boom"" on the screen. Nearly every episode I would label as ""great"".- Plus, you don't get a skimpy 20 episodes of only 40 minutes (like today's modern shows). You get nearly 30 high-quality episodes, each 51 minutes long! A great deal.:-)"	5.0	Comment on the price and the CGI upgrades	2009-06-22	1	1	0

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3MP4G8N3RMDWV	T. Welch	I'm not sure why this set was made. Honestly I can't think of anyone who wanted updated CGI added into the original Star Trek. Look at Star Wars, no one really wanted the SE but they came and now there's only one crappy DVD copy of the originals. Now Star trek TOS has been released on DVD twice already without being tampered with, so that's good BUT these are now harder to find. I hope that the original versions won't stop being produced on DVD leaving us only this monstrosity.Back to the remastered versions. I saw several episodes of it on TV, it looked terrible. The original models looked much more realistic (because they were real). The CGI models look like they were meant for an N64 game. They don't fit in and stand out. The 60s charm of the show is completely destroyed. Skip this set, its expensive, odd and lets be honest nobody wanted it.	1.0	Oh no the Star Wars disease!	2013-09-16	5	2	3
B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	ACF8824LDSIBL	twokiloseven	I am a huge Star Trek fan and already own all 3 seasons of TOS on dvd so I was a unsure if I would pick this up. I was concerned that the new special effects would be a distraction away from the content of the epesodes. I did alot of internet reasearch reading reviews of both professional critics and everyday consumers to get the best idea of if it would be worth owning or not. I waited long enough that the price on amazon.ca went down to about 55 bucks! At that price I had to go for it! I have watched about half of the epesodes now on my hd dvd player and they look incredable. The show looks like it could have been filmed last week. It is almost impossible to believe that what you are watching is 40 plus year old content. I noticed the new special effects for the first few epesodes or so but after that they seem to flow effortlessly with the rest of the show. The only problem with this release is the packageing, there is no other way to describe it other than it sucks! Packageing aside if you are a true star trek fan and have been waiting and wondering if you want to make this purchase, wait no more! Even If you are concerned about HD DVD being a dead format the discs are combo format so the same content is on the flipside of the disc and will play in any standard dvd player in standard def.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"It's ironic that a ratings failure gave birth to eight movies and four series, spawned the concept of a ""franchise"" in the TV world and numerous spin offs. Without ""Star Trek"" it's unlikely that we'd have gotten ""Star Wars"" or the explosion of science fiction movies and TV shows that have dotted the media since then. In the 1960's the year 2265 looked quite a bit different than the current crop of Trek shows and movies. Unlike later Trek series, ""The Original Series"" focused as much on the adventure element as the vague science. It's what sets the original apart from the technobattle of later series where the science of an episode could drive the action and also average viewers batty. When creator Gene Roddenberry first proposed  ""Wagon Train to the Stars"" there had been only two series that successfully put science fiction on the screen-""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"". Both series were anthology series with only the former a big ratings success. So Rodenberry's idea was a novel concept at the time. Many people contributed to the success of Roddenberry's original vision adding elements that have carried over to the current shows. The only question that remains for me after watching the numerous is how do they put on their shirts when they zip from the side and the back?Using the same digital masters as those for the previous releases (which were remastered for the Sci-Fi Channel debut), the image quality is extraordinary considering the age of the series and grain caused by the optical effects. There's minimal analog blemishes due to the use of digital filtering effects. The colors are remarkably vivid and bright highlighting designer Matt Jefferies unusual color schemes for the bridge, sets and costumes. It's so good looking that you can even see what looks like a metal stud hanging on one of the rocks for the second pilot episode. Is it perfect looking? No but Paramount has done a terrific job of restoring the images and pumping up the original mono sound. There are analog flaws in the soundtrack on occasion including most prominently on ""Where No Man Has Gone Before""Thanks Paramount for including a booklet with a brief summary of each episode. This is something that should have been done from the beginning with ""The Next Generation"" boxed sets. The packaging, although not truly an extra, is a huge improvement over ""Voyager"" and comparable to the sturdy boxes for ""The Next Generation"". With its plastic clam shell yellow container, the box for this set makes this one of the best designed I've come across. The interactive animated menu is also outstanding and imaginatively done.There's five featurettes on the series with interviews from the actors, writers and surviving production crew. ""Sci-Fi Visionaries"" looks at how Roddenberry's approach of mixing established science fiction writers with established TV writers made the show unique (much as ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" did with their writers). Actors William Shatner , Leonard Nimoy , George Takei, William Campbell, Richardo Montalban & and producers John D. F. Black & Robert Justman along with story editor/writer D. C. Fontana are interviewed for the featurettes giving a nice background on the nuts and bolts of producing the series. Again, nasty stories are avoided so for those looking for dirt, it ain't here.""To Boldly Go..."" reflects on the first season of the show including the difficulties that Roddenberry and his production crew had meeting deadlines because of the extensive visual effects, editing and music effects that were necessary for the show. As Associate Producer Robert Justman accurately points out, the average TV series never had that disadvantage. Shatner & Nimoy reflect on the strong writing quality of the series and how that made the difference in selling it as a serious program.""The Birth of a Timeless Legacy"" features interviews from 1988 where Roddenberry discusses the birth of his creation. Justman, Shatner and Nimoy discuss the difficulty in selling the networks on the show. CBS rejected it because they felt they already had their token science fiction series with ""Lost in Space"". That series created by Irwin Allen actually had a strong first season before degenerating into parody and comedy. NBC bought the series with some doubts. Seeing the first pilot featuring actor Jeffrey Hunter (""King of Kings"")as Captain Christopher Pike NBC felt that Roddenberry's script was too intellectual. They also wanted Nimoy's ears dispensed with at first.  Roddenberry asked friend Samuel Peeples to write the second pilot with a more action oriented approach. We get the background on both from Roddenberry again and Justman/""Reflections on Spock"" features Nimoy discussing the development of his character and how it impacted on his career. ""Life Beyond Trek: William Shatner"" focuses on  Shatner's love of horses, horsepacking riding and competition. We get a peak of Shatner's ranch, footage of him riding and demonstrating a wide variety of riding techniques. We also get a number of Easter Eggs scattered throughout the set. Look for the ""red alert"" light and you'll find a couple of short featurettes that focuses on background on a couple of memorable episodes.  The only thing missing from this set is a featurette on line producer Gene L. Coon. Coon helped Roddenberry develop many of the first season episodes and was a tremendously talented writer/producer who had won a number of Emmy Awards for his work. While Coon only worked on the first two seasons (coming on board after the first two pilots had been shot) of the series, his influence as a writer and producer extended far beyond that. Hopefully Coon will be highlighted in one of the upcoming sets. The original upcoming TV promotional trailers are included here just as they were on the first dual episode sets released a couple of years ago. Finally, we get a photo log with behind the scenes pictures from the series and some of the publicity shots for the show as well.While there isn't any audio commentary, we do get a quartet of fact packed text commentaries from Michael and Denise Okuda. Both have contributed to a number of previous Trek releases including the recent ""Voyager"" boxed set and the ""Special Editions"" of the motion pictures. The three episodes that have commentary are the ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", ""The Conscience of the King"" and the two part episode ""The Menagerie"" (which incorporated the story and footage from the original pilot and also won the Hugo for Best Science Fiction Program in 1967).A great job in packaging the first season of ""The Original Series"", ""Star Trek"" finally gets the treatment and respect it deserves in this DVD boxed set. The outstanding featurettes, text commentary and image quality make this an essential purchase for Trek fans. Paramount also does a terrific job with the packaging. On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd have to give ""Star Trek: The Original Series Season One"" a 10."	5.0	The Enterprise takes off at Warp Speed in new set	2004-08-31	15	12	3

It commonly surpasses all modern television in moral compass and ethical consistency. Most shows pass the Bechdel test as well. Though a little campy and dated the basic storyline and plot for each episode is compelling and makes you feel like there is hope for humanity (a feeling I don't get from watching a lot of newer stuff).Guess my point is that Star Trek is great and it shows just how shallow and sad our entertainment is today that I have to go back this far to find a show that does not make me hate my fellow man.	5.0	Best Trek yourself.	2013-06-30	0	0	0

I've heard and read criticisms of the digitial enhancments from many of the purists, but I am quite sure Gene himself would approve of the changes made.  Many of the scenes added are stunning, and my favorite episode, The Doomsday Machine, needed this badly.  In some ways, I feel the CGI was too conservative.  For instance, I would have enjoyed seeing something on the overhead bridge monitors other than stock footage, perhaps Hubble images or computer graphics.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A2OEZ15UXTRRXW	"WherenTear ""WherenTear"""	Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?As a TOS fan I had to get season 1, it's the best season of a great old show, but I won't be buying season 2 or 3.  The price of the set is about twice the normal price for one season of a TV show.  Given the price and the cult status of Star Trek, I'd hoped to see lots of extras.  Instead it was a pretty skimpy transfer to DVD IMHO.Only 4 episodes (counting Managerie as 2) have optional text trivia tracks.  How hard would it have been to include them on all the episodes?  Given how much this syndication has been milked by all involved over the years, you'd think somebody involved would have volunteered to to an audio commentary track or two.  I guess they were too busy pursuing their writing and singing careers.The plastic case is original, but not very convenient.For some reason, the episodes have a tendency to default to closed captioning.	2.0	Expensive and few DVD extras.	2005-02-17	14	10	4

I think they actually enjoy the pain. I did not let Paramount rip me off before. I may wait until all 3 seasons are put into a condensed-packaging set, but that will be the end of the wait for this fan. I will jump on this set when the complete series is released. And Paramount did good by putting BOTH originals and re-special-effects versions out in the same set. Why did the price-conscious nerds all neglect to mention that coup de grce, and the fact there are finally extras with a Trek set.	5.0	Bring on the complete series and I'll stop passing on these sets (and stop your crying)	2009-04-22	7	0	7

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A3Q4XAQXKKV6V	William Smith	"Sorry. Couldn't resist. No one else thought to use that since HD DVD died? lol.Anyway, I broke down and got this at the 50% off marker. I would be more thrilled with this purchase IF the other 2 seasons would be on this format.. yes, I'm sensitive like that. This is a tough call. I'm not really wowed by the picture.. there is often a lot of grain that I didn't expect. The upside is the new effect shots are CRYSTAL CLEAR.. and then.. you get back to the show which varies from shot to shot. I'm surprised they didn't go farther with the effects tinkering; which is generally relegated to ship flyby's and planets, which do look nice but they are all too brief and not much footage. On the other hand I'm glad they didn't butcher up what had come before.I haven't dug into the extras but I'm sure they are decent. Can't say I'm thrilled with the box design but I do like the ""art design"" of the various inserts. The look of the case is also handsome on a shelf but not very practical. Lastly, I could have done without the ""combo format"" and knock the price down another 1/3 and some disc art could have made this a 5'er."	4.0	"""It's dead, Jim!"""	2008-02-24	5	2	3

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	"What a treat it is to have Star Trek on DVD. Spock, Jim and Bones in digital quality.I grew up watching Star Trek. Every aspect of the series worked in near flawless cooperation with one another. The music, acting, drama, fight scenes, romance, politics, ethics, etc., merged into one big hour of television that was impossible not to watch.Star Trek was literally a culture changer, opening up a new genre of television and movies. Sure, we had space aliens and space travel in movies and on television, but Star Trek was so much more. It was human drama - real human life - in the midst of chaos. And the setting just happened to be space.The cast and stories of Star Trek could have been ported to any other genre and the show would have been successful. After all, Star Trek was about the human condition. After watching any given show, I was always left feeling that I had been right there in the midst of the crew's struggles and triumphs. I was sucked into the stories, and they became a part of me.The first season is timeless, and should not be missed. It ranks among the top 10 ""first seasons"" in television history. It was more than a good program, it forever changed sci-fi culture."	5.0	What a Treat	2005-08-01	7	4	3

I didn't actually remember the episode I watched, so it was like seeing it for the first time. I loved it.  It's so neat being able to pull up these videos on my Kindle anytime I want.

This is the first thing I've watched on Amazon Prime Streaming and I hope this isn't par for the course.I give the original Star Trek series 5 stars, but I give the way this was encoded 1 star.  It's as if the original 4:3 content was encoded into a 16:9 format, so when viewed on a 4:3 screen you get a black frame around the picture.  Instead of a 20"" picture I have a 15"" picture.  I hope they correct this in the near future.Edit:Now that I've watched a majority of these ""Re-mastered"" episodes I want to comment on what a good job they did with the re-mastering.  The new special effect cut scenes and models integrate beautifully into the original content.  You barely notice that something is different, which means it's in perfect balance.  The cut scenes of the enterprise in space are there to add to the story line and transport you to that far off place, not a ""wow"" factor, and they work marvelously.

B0002I831S	Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"When the first season of Star Trek: The Original Series debuted in 1966, it completely changed the face of television.  Whereas shows in the 1950s and early 1960s focused on Western and Variety themes, Star Trek introduced mind-bending plots and alien (literally!) concepts to viewers.For those of you new to the show, it is set hundreds of years in the future, when humans travel to distant worlds via spacecrafts in search of ""new life forms and new civilizations"".  This show focuses on the mission of one ship, the U.S.S. Enterprise, and her crew as they explore the vast regions of the galaxies (or show creator Gene Roddenberry's very creative imagination!).  The main characters include William Shatner as the swashbuckling Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as First Officer Spock (a human/Vulcan species mix) and Deforest Kelly as Chief Medical Officer Leonard ""Bones McCoy.  There also exists a strong ensemble cast (whom I will not mention here individually) that support the ""main three"" in various episodes.As I mentioned earlier, by exploring the ""distant reaches of the galaxy"", Gene Roddenberry was able to introduce new and thought-provoking concepts into the minds of his viewers, who would then tune in again the next week to see what mind-bending adventure was in store for them.  Though each individual episodes have their own supporters and critics, here are a few of my favorites of this First Season:The Enemy Within: Kirk's consciousness is split into dual personalities...one evil, one docile.  Which will ultimately prevail?Shore Leave: Strange things begin to happen on the crew's vacation. (This episodes showcases the comedic presence of the entire cast brilliantly!).Space Seed: The Enterprise encounters a ruthless dictator from another world.The City On The Edge of Forever: When McCoy travels back in time and alters the entire course of history, the Enterprise crew must also go back and set things straight.To conclude, as a kid I loved this show because of its action/adventure plotlines.  As a more seasoned TV viewer, I can now appreciate the show for being the first vehicle in which certain plot devices were ever used in TV drama.  If you are a seasoned sci-fi viewer who wants to relive the ""good old days"", or a sci-fi newbie who wants to start ""from the beginning"", this is the perfect show for you!"	5.0	Groundbreaking Television	2008-06-07	2	2	0
