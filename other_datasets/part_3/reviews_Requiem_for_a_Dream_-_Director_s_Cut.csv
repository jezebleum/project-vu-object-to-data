B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A26XZ1Y2Z2K7MC	2scoops	"The strong message i got from this film is that the four main characters in the movie are no different than you or I. We are all addicted to something.  That something is the fix that acts a ""crutch"" or a ""reason for getting out of bed in the morning"" as Sara Goldfarb put it.  Whether its coffee, alcohol, nicotine, sex or heroin we are all addicted and have our own addictive daily routines that we follow.  It made me really look at my own life and my own addictions which luckly arn't the same as the vices depicted in the film.I certainly wouldn't describe this film as a cautionary tale.  Some people have reviewed this film as if it something kids should be forced to watch to scare them from ever taking drugs in the future.  It couldn't be further away from that, it shows the highs and the lows of drug abuse and how even though a drug may be legal it can have the same if not more damaging effects that some of the most talked about illegal drugs.If your a serious film fan you must watch this film, watch it on your own and have a serious think about what the movie mean't to you."	5.0	Special film	2004-11-24	4	2	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AAKF9UNZU7AFO	"""aaagew"""	After being shown endless drug-propaganda films in high school (&quot;Gee, Jimmy, I don't think we should hang out if you're gonna do that stuff.&quot;), it's no wonder so many teenagers use drugs.  I've never used heavy drugs and I can't say this is the exact effects of them, but it's very convincing.  There's nothing sugar-coated here; it is very disturbing and dark.All the elements that made Pi a crossover success are here; hallucinatory camera effects, well-developed characters, and even Sean Gullette himself.  The movie's best moments aren't even the ones that center around the main character, Harry.  Instead, we are most enthralled by the side story of his mother, Sara, played by Ellen Burnstyn.  She has addictions that are just as strong as her son, the only difference is hers are politically correct and socially acceptable.  Instead of heroin and coke, she is controlled by sugar and diet pills.The movie doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending, as is such in the real world.  The movie never goes into prententious satirical-land, either.  It's just an unrelenting vision of the effects of drugs. If schools insist on trying to control others' lives, they should show this movie instead.	5.0	An honest portrayal of drugs	2001-02-25	4	3	1

The film was creatively put together and well acted, but felt lacking in the script. I would not recommend the film to anyone who's looking for a ""family film"" or a feel good movie. The sex scenes will be inappropriate for most anyone so if you are sensitive, get ready to fast forward. Some of the movie also felt drawn out like more should have been happening. Overall I felt it was a great ""prophetic vision"" for who we are as ""potential addicts"" and a reflection of some of our societal and moral dilemmas. The most unfortunate thing about this film is there is no Savior, rather it is a simple vision of addicts walking down a slippery slope toward a cliff..."	3.0	Mirror, mirror...	2013-11-12	5	2	3

The acting, cinematography, music, editing, script ect are all world class.  This is not an easy film to watch by any means, in fact, it's pretty rough stuff.  But it also rings true.  No other film has shown the horrors and degredation of drug addiction as well as this one does.  The final 20 minutes of this film are astonishing.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A5210EDS2LAZ7	A Consumer	With little doubt &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel) is a relentlessly bleak and austere film that left me breathless and emotionally devastated after I left the theater.  I don't believe that this film is about heroin addiction per se, but has much more to do with addiction in its many splendored forms.  On the one hand you have physical addictions (i.e., drugs, sex, and money), and on the other you have addictions of a far more intangible variety (e.g., irremediable attractions to unattainable dreams and desires).  Obviously the characters portrayed by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and that actress whose name I can't seem to remember appear on the surface to suffer from physical addictions (i.e., heroin), but below the surface they suffer interminably from delusions of grandeur, i.e., the American Dream.  The more dope they shoot into their veins the more palpable this absurd vision of opulence becomes, until finally the rug gets swept from underneath their feet and they lie prone and helpless amidst the devastation that surrounds them.  But even when Leto, Wayans, and the girl eventually become aware of the imminent fall they still manage to convince themselves that their dreams still possess that chance (no matter how slight and insignificant) of coming to fruition.  This naive presumption, in my opinion, is the driving force behind this remarkable film.  Most Americans think that by the time they've reached a certain age (say, 35 or 40) they should have a pretty firm grasp on life and not vice versa.  However reality, in most cases, tends to rub most people the wrong way leaving them either 1) disappointed with what they have or have not accomplished or 2) generally angry, depressed, or downright perturbed about their miserable existences.  Now I don't believe that the primary message in &quot;Requiem&quot; is as trite as &quot;be happy with what you've got and be careful when you pause to think about what you haven't&quot;, but I do believe that it runs closely along those lines.  It's no secret that the media and our democratic &quot;theology&quot; has a lot to do with injecting people with this bankrupt notion that anyone can achieve monetary success so long as they try their damnedest.  Many individuals obviously do prosper and flourish in this incomparable republic we call the United States.  But for every &quot;one&quot; there are hundreds of thousands who fail ignominiously and perish without even so much as uttering a whimper.  Selby's novel (and Aronofsky's excellent cinematic adaptation) brings the hammer down on these misconceptions and shatters them with a force that will not soon be forgotten.	4.0	Requiem for a Dream	2001-01-19	8	7	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A31Q4YS979R1IZ	Adam Dugas	This movie is lame. It does not provoke thought, provide insight, or tell a good story. If you find ghastly wounds and sexual abuse to be entertaining and worth your time, enjoy! Aronofsky's earlier film, PI, was similarly clever is its execution and hollow at its core. This movie is just a relentless barrage of shock tactics masquerading as a meaningful cautionary tale. Ugh.	1.0	Pointless Shock Trash	2001-06-09	29	13	16
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2GKJ4OZDOGANG	Adam	Requiem for a Dream is filmmaking at its height and glory. Instead of repeating what has already been said in the other reviews, I'd like to quote a passage given in the DVD case by &quot;Ain't it Cool News&quot;:&quot;This film should be REQUIRED VIEWING for every friggin High School kid in the country. It should be unleased upon them. This movie is brutal...brutal in the most aggressively harsh reality moments we have in society. Are you happy with where the characters are at the end...NO....should it be any different...NO. This film has an absolute moral center. And I know for a fact that I'll see this film at least 10 times before the end of the year. Not because it is a happy film. Not because ewwww I love dark stories. I'll see it repeatedly because it is just BRILLIANT filmmaking.&quot;I myself have a new standard as far as a lead actress is concerned...Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb. It takes alot to make me cry in a movie, but I have never helt so intensly about a characters demise than in Requiem. She is the actress to which all other actresses will be compared.I can't stress enough how important this movie is to see, and how important it is to spread. Amazing...simply extraordinary.	5.0	Phenomenal Beyond All Belief	2004-06-24	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A22DXEFAD4NYBR	Adam	This film is exquisite.  There are very few films I can think of that literally change the course of your life and this is one of them.  I assure you that you will be moved if you see this.  The editing is something that I have never seen before and the acting is top notch.  As an actor, I would love to work with this director as he is on new ground here.  Ellen Burstyn SOOOOO deserved the Best Actress award, her performance is like nothing you have seen.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AL3A3YL9LGC94	Adam J O' Connor	There really wasn't the best acting in this movie, but the impressions, camera work, and direction were amazing!  The use of sound and color really added something special to the direction.  For anyone who's actually done drugs before, this movie is like a chemically-induced experience.  It makes you understand and feel like you're involved with the movie.  There was a lot more here than just Jennifer Connelly's pretty face (although she is the most attractive junkie I've ever seen).

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3SG02U3ATBJZ5	Adam R Martray	Some reviews I have read about &quot;Requiem&quot; stated that the film had nothing to say, did not add to the dialogue about drugs or drug films, and served merely as a cautionary tale about how drugs are bad.  I completely disagree with these ideas.  I felt that the heart of this film is very socially concious.  It examines a culture where drug addicts are put in prision while drugs are handed out like candy on Halloween to solve even the smallest problems.  This film seemed less about the evils of addiction then about the evils of our cultures hypocritical attitude towards drugs and drug addicts.  More thought provoking than, say, Trainspotting, but not for the weak of heart or mind.	5.0	Mind Warping and Thought Provoking	2001-06-17	0	0	0

I also felt the camera work felt a big 'gimmicky' early on. The split screens, etc. felt a bit cheap and distracting.Ellen Burstyn, the mother, did a remarkable job...great,great acting all around. However I didn't vibe with the setup though..with the exception of the mother, all the Black characters seemed to to be 'vicious, evil ones' to bring drugs and destruction into the ""innocent and wholesome"" caucasian's lives..which I found a wee bit absurd.Good job!"	4.0	Good movie...the mother did a good job	2010-11-08	4	0	4
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3IAP2JMTP5YBN	"adriana ""alisa"""	Requiem for A dream isn't absolutely perfect.Jared Leto is miscast and not up to the emotional range needed to portray his character's downward spiral into the perils of hell.And sometimes, the visual effects get a little too crazy.But the film so stomach churningly,heart-wrenchingly, unbelievably powerful, that you really won't care.Ellen Burstyn is absolutely magnificent.No, that's not right.She's fearless,and uninhibited, and simply unbelievably powerful.I knew she was good, but not this good.Her performance deserves to be studied, and it is the most powerful female performance that I've ever seen in my entire life.Her downward sprial into addiction is the single most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen.Horrifying,but heartbreaking.Jennifer Connelly manages to remain subtly,quitely emotive, even in the role of a junkie.She's a good actress.Marlon Wayans came off as a surprisingly affecting dramatic actor.The movie creates a hypnotic and dazzlingly horrific vision of the hells of addiction through visual affect.By the end, you'll be dizzy,This film is so much more than an anti-drug movie, though.It's a bloody and intense study of the crumble of human decency.This movie will make your heart beat a thousand miles per hour, it'll make you sweat and weep and shake and swear you'll never watch it again-even though, deep down, you know you have to, because in this movie's undeniable emotional potency lies an addiction in itself.Not in the sense that you need to watch it all the time.I'd think you were absolutely nuts if you did. But in the sense that the film(along with it's stunningly pulsating soundtrack), never ever ever EVER EVER leaves your head and heart.This movie follows me daily, more so than my own shadow.Requiem is the most depressing film I've ever watched.My mother couldn't sleep for a whole night after seeing it.It is an absolute nightmare-graphic and shocking and visually uninhibited to the very extent.It's not so much the content of the film, as the entire atmosphere of it-you'll be so depressed by the end that you'll wonder whether there's a meaning to this life.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie at night-it's hard to get a good night's slep afterwards.I cannot stress this enough-it is nothing short of a living nightmare and will leave you on the verge of a suicide attemptThat said, this movie can be summed up in two words-horrific and heartbraking.It is so heartbraking, that your stomach hurts and your heart aches, and all you can think of is these characters' descent into their own private hell.But that's what drugs are.I believe it impossible to make a witty, or darkly comic movie about drugs.Drugs are a nightmare-they take over your soula and mind, and destroy every shred of humanity within you-addiction in general is just that, although that all depends what you're addicted to.That is like watching a film about rape and complaining that the rape scene was &quot;too difficult&quot;.Did it ever occur to you that maybe rape is a little difficult.By the end, Requiem no longer feels like a movie, but like a living nightmare with a very sad core.It is the most stunning,powerful, horrifying,heartbraking, unbelievably mind-numbingly,heart-achingly,stomach-chrningly unforgettable film I've ever seen,	5.0	A modern masterpiece of unquestionable truth and power	2004-05-12	5	4	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	The first time I saw Requiem for a Dream I was a little shaken to my core, the second time I watched it, I realized what a work of art this movie is. The story of four very different drug addicts is disturbing and yet fascinating to say the least. The last 10 minutes are the most graphic but the most important. Jared Leto's performance is the best I have ever seen from him, and of course it's Ellen Burstyn who steals the show. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are superb as well, Requiem for a Dream is a film no one should overlook. It's gritty, heartbreaking, honest, and this movie stays with you, now that's a great and profound film! I highly recommend it!	5.0	"""Feed me, Sara..."""	2007-09-04	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A125F7UXJABDN	A. J. Anagnost	Although coated in a patina of melodrama, this story of the unwinding of dreams and potential is difficult to watch but satisfying. The performances deserve the praise they got in the popular media and this early work from Jennifer Connelly may actually have been her best. The directing and music clearly increase the tension as you watch addiction destroy the lives of the four main characters. Some might see the directing as a bit gratuitous, I think it was well synchronized to the rhythm of music and the film. One of the strengths of this film is the overt grittiness...remember, this film was originally released NC-17 and you can see why. The story will likely haunt you for a few days after you watch it because you know - despite the melodrama - that characters like this are spiraling down their lives in the real world right now...right in this moment.	4.0	A dark but well crafted film	2013-06-01	1	0	1

Never have I been so moved by a film in my entire life. I walked out of the theatre both times I saw it crying so fiercely I began to scare myself. This beautiful story of love and addiction lit a fire within me and not a day goes by when I don't think of this movie or it's passionate, haunting score. Kudos to Mr. Aronofsky, Mrs. Burstyn and Mr. Mansell for affecting me in such a way. I could only hope to be able to thank them one day and show my appreciation. If you are hungry for a movie that will touch, and maybe even inspire you, go see this film or buy the DVD when it is released. And we can only hope that Mrs. Burstyn takes home the Oscar for a performance that will (and should) be talked about for years to come.	5.0	I have never been so moved...	2001-03-15	5	4	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ALOASKC3N1KDR	Alan Soyars	I just watched this movie today after a friend had told me how fascinating it was. It was just that. The film deals with several characters who are dealing with drug addictions. Jared Leto plays as Harry. His girlfriend Marion is played by Jennifer Connely. His best friend Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans. And his mother Sara is played by Ellen Burstyn. Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are pretty much heroin addicts. Sara is an older woman who feels alone, and one day she gets a call that tells her she is going to be on television. Her t.v. is really all she has, and she becomes obsessed with losing weight to look good on tv so she will feel special and so people will like her. She even starts taking these pills that a doctor prescribed that are uppers. She becomes addicted to them and she slowly is slipping. I have never been exposed to people doing hardcore drugs. I've been with some friends while they were smoking pot or something. I've never seen any of them do heroin or anything like that, so this movie was a shock to me. My hands were shaking after this movie, and I was so upset over what ends up happening to Sara, that I almost broke down.I would recommend this movie. It is very thought provoking and artistic.	4.0	Blew my mind,,,	2005-08-21	2	2	0

I highly recommend this film and personally believe that every parent should allow their children to view this film in the hopes of installing some kind of fear of drugs in them.	5.0	Requiem for a Dream	2001-09-02	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A108YIXZC8WJNB	Alex Collins	I first heard about this movie, I was in a comic book store,had to check it out for myself. Just the title of this film tells you that this is going to be one of those movies that will blow you away. This film is cut up in 3 sections,&quot;Summer&quot;,&quot;Fall&quot;,and &quot;Winter&quot;. This film focusus on 4 main characters and how their lives go from good,to just hanging on to the hard wretching fall. In the very beginning &quot;Sarah Goldfarm&quot; is one of those ladies who is lonely and recently lost her husband &quot;Seymour&quot;.She finds some great news that she has been selected to be on television.She becomes obseseed with fiting in her red dress she wore back in her son's high School graduation she will do anything.&quot;Harold&quot;,&quot;Sarah's&quot; son, is a dope fiend and tries to do whats best for his mother and his girlfriend &quot;Marion&quot;,he was told not to use the same arm to shoot up with.Its too late for him to change things...his life will now drastically change. 'Marion&quot;, &quot;Harold's&quot; girlfriend is to the point where she doesn't want to be with her parents,and just wants to be with &quot;harold&quot;. She too is a dope fiend will do anything to get money when times are getting tough,soon at the end she will realize the fear of being alone.&quot;james&quot; i believe thats what his name is,he strives on making things work,so he could go head the road to the easylife,he realizes,that he better stop what he's doing or his life will quikly end.I noticed in this film,it showed shots of him and his mother meaning,he can't depend alot on himself without thinking back of his mother comforting him during his troublesome times or pain of lonliness. This film is brillant,and the camera shots and angles fit right with this film.The music,all together really fits how the movie is played out.I did notice during 'Summer&quot;,&quot;fall&quot;and &quot;Winter&quot; you see how thing in the beginning are going well,then begin to fall,towards the end,suddenly thing turn for the worst.When &quot;Sarah&quot; is hooked on them pills,she doesn't listen,in the end its too late for her,she put away and taking &quot;EST&quot;. &quot;Harold&quot; is told to quit doing the drugs,in the arm his arm is amputated.&quot;James&quot; thinks he can make it out there selling and buying drugs,when in fact he has a close encounter of death himself,but is sent to jail for a longtime in the end.&quot;Marion&quot; thinks things are going great but she winds up taking things for granted,and ends up being alone.I love how this movie focuses on these main four characters,this film is supurb,wonderful,just what they went through makes me feel sorry,and sad.This film is brillant and tragically sad,somewhat disturbing.......all in all very powerful and tragic!!!	5.0	A Powerful Tragic Film	2003-12-12	4	1	3

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ARAEP182GXSYD	alex	Ok, after hearing things about this movie such as &quot;The most realistic depiction of drug addiction ever!&quot; and &quot;Number 1 movie of 2000&quot; I decided to pick up this &quot;Masterpeice&quot; and after viewing this 102 minutes of eyes dilating..I decided something..I do not like this movie.Ok, to start off with, I was under the impression this was supposed to be completely realistic. Off the top of my head I can think of quite a few scenes that I feel have insulted my intelligence, for instance:The constant shots of pupils dilating as the characters are shooting heroin..I may not know a whole lot about heroin..but im pretty sure it causes your eyes to contract, not dilate!Also, when Harry and Tyrone arrive at the hospital and Harry's arm is practically rotting off, what does the doctor do? He calls the police and they are sent off to prison. Would a doctor really do this? Especially without treating him first? What a load.Oh yeah, I didn't know that when they amputate your arm blood splatters all over your face, all yeah, and you're still conscious!Well ok, a movie does not have to be completely realistic for me. But what it does have to be is at least a little fun or interesting to watch. This movie was neither; I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. There was no development, just some stupid druggies, they never showed there family lives, except for the exception of Harry. The only character I felt the least bit sorry for was the mom, that was the only story, which I thought, was the least bit effective. I mean come on is a bunch of flashes (The exact same flashes, at that) of dollar bills rolled up and eyes dilating supposed to shock me? Maybe I'm just more into slower paced movies that allow time for character development and explain things more. Almost this whole film is shot in hyperspeed..It's just a mess of quick flashes, and that does not excite me. If you want to see a good, realistic drug movie, watch Trainspotting or Traffic.	2.0	Overated, and Unrealistic	2003-12-11	22	15	7
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A32GCOTGFJ9XC3	"Alex Honda ""onyx575"""	"Darren Aronofsky's film, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, is one of my favorite all time films. Not only is it visually stunning--making use of clever editing and fliming techniques like split-screens and special effects--the story is one that will stay with you for a long time. Although the movie will leave you breathless and coming away with that feeling of ""damn, that was a good movie,"" it's not for the faint-of-heart.The movie is aptly named as the story follows a mother and her son, both on parallel tracks into drug addiction, and his best friend and girlfriend, and how their dreams disintegrate with the passing seasons. All four characters descend into the depths of hell, making choices they wouldn't otherwise make, just to score some dope.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, and the fantastic Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. Why this film didn't sweep the Academy Awards is beyond me.I wasn't going to buy it on Blu-Ray, because I already have the DVD version, but since it was on sale here on Amazon, I couldn't resist.I'm so glad I got the Blu-Ray edition. The transfer looks great and the scenes are even more horrific in 1080P.Unfortunately there aren't any extra features on the Blu-Ray other than the ones that came on the DVD Edition. In fact, the 05:35-minute Sundance Featurette ""Anatomy Of A Scene,"" where Aronofsky describes the shooting techniques in the film, is missing. Not sure why it was left off.SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:*** Commentary by Aronofsky and DP (Director of Photography) Matthew Libatique*** ""The Making Of Requiem For A Dream"" 35:23-minute documentary--showing footage of filming behind the scenes and Aronofsky comments on what is going on.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AF1VHA7BVWLO1	Alexia Komaux	Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly unique film. Not just because of it's subject matter (drug use is hardly infrequent in films these days), but because of the feeling it gives the viewer during and for a long time after the film has ended.The best word to describe Requiem is 'heartbreaking'. It is shocking, disturbing, moving and heartbreaking. I won't give too much away but the feeling you get once the film has ended is one of extreme emptiness. I didn't know how to feel after the first time I'd watched it. I cried like a baby, but I felt more than just sadness. The second time I watched it, I watched the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the last fifteen minutes. The contrast is incredible, and it was this that made me feel so empty.The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans was excellent in a serious role, Jared Leto was perfect as Harry, who wants to do right by his loved ones and get rich at the same time. Jennifer Connelly portrays strong-willed Marion, who ultimately loses her dignity to get her fix. One of the most shocking things other than the film itself is the fact that Ellen Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. How the Academy could have thought anyone gave a better performance that year (or any other year for that matter) is beyond me. Her portrayal of Harry's desperately lonely mother is the key to this film being so powerful.Requiem for a Dream is a tragic film that grabs your emotions from the very beginning, takes them on a roller-coaster, then squeezes the life out of them before battering them to a pulp. The most incredible, breathtaking and ultimately heartbreaking film I've ever seen, and one that will remain at the top of my favourite films list for a long time to come. You may not be able to watch it more than once but I urge anyone to rent it out and give yourself the cinematic experience of a lifetime.	5.0	Heartbreaking work of art	2005-02-05	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2GARPSATCEW4S	Amazon Customer	One the best movies of 2000 if not the best. It's visionary in technique and storytelling. Aranofsky leads us through hell and doesn't bring us back. It's not a cautionary tale because everyone already knows where drug addition leads. These characters are lost at the beginning of the story and they are lost at the end. The viewer knowns that the story can only end one way. It's the journey that makes it interesting. The directing techniques are wonderful. It's very rare that a director can make his work apparent to you and yet not make it feel invasive. You're aware of the editing and directing, but they only serve to enhance the story. All the performances were wonderful. They all could have been nominated for Oscars and I would not have felt them undeserving.This is not a movie for everyone. Obviously the subject matter, language and frank sexuality make this an adult movie. And only for adults who are not squeemish or easily upset by the subject matter of movies. I personally give it my highest recommendation. If you want to see what the best of todays filmakers are capable of, then check this movie out.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2AVV9LV9UXT6F	Amazon Customer	"Despite the brief nudity and the decidedly adult themes of this movie, this ought to be required viewing in high school or junior high.  It's so hellish that it might just manage to scare some people away from drugs.  The four main characters start out seeming not so very different from people you might know.  But they gradually descend into a nightmarish downward spiral of drug addiction, and have their lives so thoroughly destroyed by drugs that it leaves you shuddering in mixed revulsion and sympathy by the end of the picture.(Spoilers) Ellen Burstyn's character ends up being literally driven insane by her addiction to speed-laced diet pills.  One of the last scenes of the movie is a heart wrenching scene of her friends from her neighborhood visiting her in the hospital, slack-jawed with shock and horror as they view the electro-shock treated, almost catatonic shell of the woman who had been their old and good friend.  Her son Harry, played by Jared Leto, nearly dies from his experience, and ends up losing an arm - he avoids going to the doctor so long for treatment of the infection that he's gotten from using dirty needles (out of fear of being arrested) that gangrene sets in and doctors have to amputate.  His friend, played by Marlon Wayans, ends up doing hard time when he's caught by the police.  But worst of all, perhaps, is the fate of Harry's girlfriend, played by the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly.  In her, most of all, you can see the terrible degeneration take place.  She starts out a normal girl who simply likes to have a good time.  Then at one point, when her addiction really starts to assert itself, she becomes desperate enough for drugs to sleep with a man she dislikes for money she can use to buy drugs.  She rushes from her liason with him, and barely makes it outside his apartment building before she throws up in disgust and revulsion at what she's done.  Yet by the end of the picture, so great has her desperation for her next fix become, that she is not only willing to give oral sex to a complete stranger for drugs, she performs live sex shows on stage in front of a howling mob of drooling perverts - and she is so far gone in moral degradation that her revulsion, along with her dignity, is a thing of the past.As I said, this film is grim and very adult oriented.  But so many young people are being hooked on drugs these days that it ought to be required viewing, for it is a harsh, unflinching look at what REALLY CAN HAPPEN TO YOU if you start using hard drugs, but it's one that isn't as alarmist and overdone as the infamous movie ""Reefer Madness.""  For the past few of years, I have worked on the Norfolk Police Department, and even in that short time I have seen enough addicts to see how realistic this movie is."	5.0	They ought to show this in school.	2004-10-03	3	0	3

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AY4KQBKC8QXRF	Amazon Customer	"I am unable to understand how many intelligent friends of mine have heaped endless praise upon a film that is so artistically immature, that sprials down into a mountain of overacting and cheezy bombast that I would expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  This film started off very strong, so its unravelling at the end is just all the more disappointing.  I was pointing and laughing at Burstyn's character at the end and throwing my popcorn and soda at the screen.  I have no problem with all over-stylization.  Indeed, many times I do not mind cheezy schmaltz either.  In Lord of the Rings, for example, it is a useful and necessary tool for such an archetypal theme.  In Bruckheimer films too (as disposable as they are).  But Requiem's subject matter would evoke a style similar to that of Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, or Aliens, which is does at first, but then attempts to utilize Coppola's grandiosity, with laughable results.  Directors always mismatch music with a scene whose drama would otherwise not need it, and the frenzied montage at the end is a perfect example.  (Go see the Cave Troll scene in LOTR... NO MUSIC!)  In other words, everything at the end of this movie is so overdone; there seems to be a complete loss of sense of pacing and subtlety.  Yes Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, and Aliens are not subtle movies, but there's never any scene in any of those films like the end of The Godfather or the opening to Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Therefore ""Requiem"" is stylistically confused, as it begins raw and tries to be sturm und drang at the end.  It is very hard to make good cheeze.  You have to know what you are doing.  Coppola did it; Peter Jackson did it. Aronofsky failed miserably.My complaint has nothing to do with the content of the film, merely the manner in which it was executed.  Most thought the film shocking, disturbing, whatever.... but for me it was so preachy, so over the top, and dripping with cheeze, that it made no impression on me and i could not take it seriously.Look, most people will probably like this, as those who agree with me are far and few between, and, like I said, many who enjoy and praise it are intelligent people versed in the field of cinema.  So by all means, see it and come to your own opinion.  It's worth it just to see the beautiful Jennifer Connelly and I must stress again that the first two thirds of the film are quite competent (after the refrigirator starts dancing around and Christopher McDonald comes out of the TV the spell was broken for me).

I did not move for about 5 minutes.  The power of this movie overwhelmed me.  Darren Aronofsky creates a 5 star-film with all-star performances, based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s compelling novel.  Masterfully put together, this movie is classed amongst my Top Ten list of Best Films of All-Time.  In fact, it is #1 presently.The film's depiction of drug-abuse is overwhelmingly accurate as far as what drugs do.  But never did they really say what drug it was the four characters (Harry, Marion, Sara, and Tyrone) were using.  Drugs seems to be the device used to both promote and steal each of the entity's `dream,' thus the dreams of the four were already doomed from the beginning.  It was as if the drugs themselves were teasing each one, giving them the instant gratification they were seeking, then took everything away once they reached the a point on the road where it was too late to go back.The musical score plays a significant role in the whole film's success.  Its bold and pervasive style composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet help establish the film noir quality.  It truly plays a role that strengthens the viewer's emotions and attentiveness towards the film.First time viewers, prepare your minds for an explosive rendition of the effects of drug-abuse.  Starring classic legend Ellen Burstyn, the appealing Jarod Leto, the exquisite actress Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, generally known for his humorous films.  This is a film that will strike the eye, mind and heart.  Embrace yourself for a movie unlike any other!  And most of all, enjoy. :)	5.0	Perhaps The Most Powerful Film Ever	2004-02-18	3	2	1

Everyone, go out and rent this movie, watch it to get the experience, but don't buy it. You won't want to see it more than once.

Contains some of the most artistic and imaginative uses of special effects since ""Fight Club."" Altogether, it's very vivid and intense.*Characters are good and well-developed.  Good focus on their drama (without being too sappy).  By the end of the film, you can really feel for their losses.  It's quite emotional.*Strong anti-drug message.  Even though everything seems cheery at first, it quickly becomes dark and frightening.  It's even more effective than any other drug movie I have seen (all of the ones I've seen have been upbeat for some wierd reason).  The characters, music, and imagery accentuates this central moral very well.*Excellent music.The Bad Things*There are a few graphic scenes at the end (and a few bits of nudity throughout the middle).  I didn't think it was as bad as everybody else says, but it's still not reccomended for the squeamish.Next to ""Children of Men"" and ""The Passion,"" this is one of the few movies that makes me want to cry.  It is a deep, dark, and powerful downward spiral into madness and despair.  As intense as it is, it truly makes me feel for the characters (and scares me away from ever doing drugs).  Above all, it sticks out in my head as one of the best, most stylish, and most memorable films made in the past ten years.  Everybody should watch this film at least once, for it is intense and somewhat thought-provoking."	5.0	Shattered Dreams	2008-04-08	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	If ever there was a movie that exposed drug addiction for the horror that it truly is, this is that film.  `Requiem for a Dream' is understandably a very hard film to watch.  Everything from its intense subject matter to its sporadic and chaotic direction is set to either draw you in or push you away.  I don't think there can be an in between for this film.  You either love it wholeheartedly or you loathe it and consider it a waste of time.  It's a film that will leave you feeling dirty, feeling depressed and maybe even feeling bad about yourself but I feel that in the right context these are all good feelings for us to have because they force us to consider things we may never make the time to consider.Drug addiction is painted in most films as devastating but beatable, something that can ruin lives but can be overcome.  In so many movies today we watch our main character suffer at the hands of his addiction only to watch him rise above and overcome the adversary, turning over a new leaf and moving forward on a new path.  If that is what you are expecting to see then be forewarned, there are no happy endings to be found in `Requiem...'.  In fact, `Requiem for a Dream' paints this picture so harshly, so unsympathetically one is forced to realize that not all addictions are beatable.  Sometimes, well, most of the time there is no coming back.  The reason I feel that `Requiem for a Dream' is such an important film is because it shows the audience the ugly truth behind a very common and widespread problem.  You won't walk away from this movie and think lightly of the occasional drug run.  You won't think that there's nothing wrong with a high here or there.  You will be repulsed by the very idea of a manufactured euphoria and will cringe at the thought of ending up like any of the characters portrayed in this film.This film is designed to prevent drug abuse.The film follows the lives of four individuals all connected to one another.  You have Sara Goldfarb, an elderly lady who lives really for nothing except the off chance that she could be on television.  She watches her game shows and thinks of nothing else.  Her son Harry is so dependant of drugs that he's willing to steal his mother's belongings to get the money for a high.  His best friend Tyrone is just as guilty and his girlfriend Marion is along for the ride.  The film follows each of their addictions (Sara becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to lose enough weight to fit in a dress she's determined to wear on television) and fleshes out the pain, degradation and hopelessness each addiction leaves it's host in.What helps propel this film along is the stellar performances by the entire cast, most notably its two leading ladies.  Ellen Burstyn rightfully was awarded a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars for her brilliant portrayal of Sara.  She really gets inside this woman and makes her delusions so real to the audience.  She takes something that could have, in the wrong hands, gone camp or been comical and makes it so raw and emotionally stimulating.  Her pain is essentially our pain and this makes the film so much more real to us.  Jennifer Connelly is flawlessly stunning as Marion Silver.  Her character has such a subtle yet moving arch towards the closing of the film when we watch her desperation grow to the point of no return.  It's heartbreaking but also extremely realistic.  Jared Leto is also remarkable here.  He has a lot of misses as an actor but when he hits it he hits it out of the park.  His portrayal of Harry is emotional and resilient.  Marlon Wayans blew me away.  I didn't know he had this in him, but he succeeds with flying colors at making his character real and moving.  I still can't get over this performance, so utterly unexpected.A lot has been said for Aronofsky's visionary style.  I'm going to say a little bit now.  His direction of this film is a perfect compliment to the subject and depiction he was going for.  The chaotic editing helps keep the audience in the right frame of mind, further embellishing the mental state of our protagonists.  As we watch the screen shift back and forth violently with each depiction of drug intake we get the sense that this is really destroying the characters from the inside out.  Aronofsky expressed brilliant judgment in his decisions while making this film.So, like I mentioned earlier, this is not a film for everyone.  It is brutal in many ways and very hard to watch both emotionally and visually if you are not prepared for it.  If you can sit through this masterpiece though I highly recommend it because it's a film unlike any other and one that we all should take notice of.	5.0	Dark and unsettling yet richly rewarding...	2007-12-07	3	3	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A35237X8NYNDM0	Andrew John Dickens	Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction. Requiem for a dream focuses on four people bound for a downward spiral of addiction and sheer terror, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embraces the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an ridiculous self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're sliding toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines.I am one of those people who, when they hear a movie is extremely shocking and disturbing, get a burning urge to see it as fast as I can to see if it shocks me (especially if it's R-18+). So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it. The performances in this movie were truly unbelievable. The characters' miserable pursuit of their misguided dreams grabs hold of you in a way wich crushes your spirit and rips you inside out. You know what's going to happen but can't stop watching, as though you just want to be their for them, for Sara, for Harry, for Tyrone, for Marion. It's far from some corny anti-drug movie. It's a raw, gut-wrenching, unforgiving look at the by-product of a society that has chosen to dull its senses with an assortment of nightmarish addictions and which feeds on empty images of glamour, high life and leisure.Darren Aronofsky has pushed this movie to a disturbing extreme, forcing conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized people pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host. Darren Aronofsky himself compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The colors and angles he chooses make the film very beautiful. His use of split screen, cameras attached to actors, and close ups are simply a work of art. The fast paced cuts blew my mind. most teens should watch this movie because I guarantee they will have think twice, even three times before taking drugs. I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but I have never seen a movie that made me feel such undisguised emotion.The soundtrack adds to the psychological and physical havoc displayed on screen. This movie, along with the music, will send chills down your spine. One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. The last twenty minutes of this film are terribly powerful and shocked me into silence, I've never before felt physically ill after a movie. Aronofsky is a cinematic artist, as well as a mastermind madman. This movie will stay under your skin for months, after viewing this remarkable film you feel totally numb.	5.0	This movie will be with you forever	2001-10-25	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3I5TWKLZQVQYX	"Andrew Kotwicki ""akotwicki123"""	I was familiar with Darren Aronofsky after seeing 'Pi' on video some years back.  When I heard he had a new film under his belt, I was more than eager to catch up.  What I didn't know was that I was in store for both one of the great movies of our generation and one of the most unexpected horror films you're likely to ever see.  I remember walking into the theater surrounded by warning signs about the film's unrated content, and ran into a 'Pi' fan in the lobby.  I sort of expected it to be uncompromising given 'Pi' and it's own excursion into madness and possible death, but I don't think one can ever really say they were 'prepared' for what 'Requiem' had in store for it's viewers.  Based upon the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr.(Last Exit to Brooklyn), it tells the story of 3 addicts, Harry Goldfarb, Marion Silver, and Tyrone C. Love, seeking backdoor success in the drug underworld, paralleling the story of an elderly woman and mother of one of the addicts, Sara Goldfarb.  While it cross-cuts between all 4 characters, the film is really about Sara Goldfarb and her innocent, naive foray into self-destruction.  The ultimate aim of the film, of course, is to show how all the characters are clinging to a notion and thus bury their heads in the sand even as the natural forces of the world start to erode them away.  When Harry Goldfarb, for example, shoots heroin into an open wound, it's both shocking visually but thematically illustrates his surrender to a notion that everything will wrap up nicely in the end.  It'd be easy to dub 'Requiem' an anti-drug film, but it's about addiction period, consuming until your own addictions start to eat you alive.  Everything from television, coffee, chocolate, sun-bathing, losing weight, etc., are all used by the characters to give their lives a sense of purpose.  Marion Silver, after snorting cocaine, says to Harry 'you make me feel like a person'.  These are people who don't know how to live with themselves, before and after their inevitable tragic downfall.In the years since, I feel writer-director Darren Aronofsky has indeed gone on to make greater films ('The Fountain' is my personal favorite of his), but he has yet to make a film quite as dark and unforgiving as 'Requiem' a second time, if ever again.  In the 12 years since it's initial release, it still has the power to horrify, enthrall, and deeply move all who come into contact with it.  Bravo, Mr. Aronofsky!  Bravo!	5.0	A Heartbreaking Masterpiece.	2012-10-23	2	2	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3QF5IUOH437KL	Andrew Loviska	Requiem for a Dream is one of the best, and least understood, movies about drugs ever made.  It is not a cautionary tale about the evils of heroin and diet pill abuse.  It is about people who refuse to let go of their dreams, amd when those dreams fall the characters fall with them, hard.  It is about how American society and the media twist our desires to the point where we must become drug addicts and criminals to make our little lives seem meaningful.  It is about how we are then demonized and destroyed because we dare to dream.this is not a movie for the faint of heart.  it contains some of the most shocking images i have ever seen on film.  not shocking in a Pink Flamingoes way but shocking because you care about the characters, and so the things that happen to them are that much more horrific.  Aronofsky is a visual stylist almost without equal, and no matter what you think of the film, you cannot help but be affected by its visual language, the world doesn't look quite the same when you're done watching it.  it is both a dream and a nightmare, and will affect the way you look at both.of course, what brings it all home is the performances, especially Ellen Burstyn's, who deserves every award in existence.  in a movie like this it would have been easy for the actors to go over the top, but it is because they stayed grounded in real human desires that the film resonates as deeply as it does.  every member of the cast approaches their role with a heroic level of commitment and intensity.anyone who cares about film should not miss Requiem for a Dream.  it shows us the best and worst of love, drugs, and the desire to live life passionately.  it does not ask that you feel sorry for its characters, only that you recognize that they are a part of you.  and it does it in a way that will continually shock and amaze you.	5.0	This film is not a cautionary tale	2003-09-04	4	2	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2W602R54OV7VE	Anglo Jackson	"Straight off: Ellen Burstyn puts in a wonderful performance.  No one could say otherwise.  And none of the actors let the side down.  (Although I have reservations about the casting.)Requiem is about drugs and how we all take them and how they mess us up and specifically it is about one family, a mother and a son, both addicted to their own drugs and the preservation of their own too glamorous world visions.  Darren A swallows Aristotle's line about tragedy hook line and sinker.  Small flaw, BIG fall (well, ...how many kids do [drugs]? how many moms pop valium? and survive without ruin, disaster, shame).  Loss of limb, loss of sanity, loss of life are all in the goody bag here and no one goes home without picking one out.Now drugs CAN do horrible things to people.  Obviously.  And movies like ""Drug Store Cowboy"", or even ""Trainspotting"", which on the face of it are far more fantastic (ie unreal) handle their subject with a greater realism and they treat their audience like grown ups who can take a little smooth with their rough without getting the wrong idea.But Requiem is just a fable at heart; it's about Beautiful people (leto and his girlfriend) destroying themselves.  It puts the audience through [agony], close up scenes of injections, of diseased wounds, of mad, distressed, old women, and for what?  To tell us that drugs kill pretty people too?  Yes, not only that, but just because you're a pensioner your not off the hook because if you start a habit then you've got it coming too.  Come on.  It's not enough.  And it's absurd that we should go to a movie theatre and be emotionally beaten up and made to feel reverential as if we were watching eye witness testimony of the horrors of the Trenches, D-Day, or Vietnam and leave with a little nifty camera work and an oh-so-subliminal message: ""Kids! Don't do drugs.""But it's worse than that. Because at the same time that Darren A. forces us to take his sordid little world seriously he doesn't.  he uses these pretty boy and pretty girl actors and he uses techno camera work and all manner of slick fancy stuff.  And he uses it all very obviously.  And that's dealing in double standards.  And if it is trivial, and I maintain it is, then scenes like the disgusting sexual self-abasement of Leto's girlfriend by a pimp-dealer and his party guests are actually offensive.  I don't know why more people don't think so."	1.0	Disagreeably self-indulgent [stuff]	2001-09-07	44	23	21
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ACZMBQ83WBUFA	Annette Barbeau	I knew Ellen Burstyn was good - but not this good. There was no performance that lacked. The issues are numerous. Unwanted older women in our society with only their past to &quot;look forward to&quot;; diet doctors; addiction; the medical profession; men and their base sexual perversions - just a myriad of thought provoking topics. Starts out as a sort of quirky, even humerous movie, and gradually you are caught up in a tense, dramatic, chair-gripping, fearful tale. It should be shown in schools.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3VGFJD2GCL1QB	Anthony Brown	Darren Aronofsky has now proven himself to be a brilliant director.  With his first film, &quot;Pi,&quot; Aronofsky created a dark, disturbing world plunging the viewer into the chaotic world of mathematics as it relates to the main character's insanity.  In &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; (based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the same name), he has once again created a disturbing masterpiece (&quot;Requiem&quot; is easily one of the most disturbing films ever made), however he has grown in his filmmaking techniques.  &quot;Requiem&quot; is a masterfully made film following the drug-addicted lives of four main characters.  Ellen Burstyn deserves an Oscar for delivering the best performance of the year and quite possibly her carreer (she acts better than she did in &quot;Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore&quot; - for which she received an Oscar prior to this film).

They kill focus, they kill the wish to live, they kill the humanity of attitude but most damningly they kill hopes and dreams. Ironically enough, the lead characters of Requiem for a Dream are drawn to drugs seeking a short cut to a life which is beyond them but which they yearn for. Eventually this very short cut paves the way for their downfall.An old lady's dream to be on TV, a young man's urge to be rich and happy, his friend and girl friend's need to tag along while aspiring to live a rich life - all these dreams die an untimely death. However, the audience is not subjected to any drama. The narrative is evenly paced, and realistic with some exceptional cinematography making the viewing experience a delight. The end is tragic, realistic, and painful but every bit true. Conforming reality to art is as much a challenge as conforming art to reality and on both counts this movie comes out on top.A must watch movie for the young aspiring generation regardless of which air they breathe in.	5.0	Of Dreams and their Death	2007-05-03	9	8	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A595T15OO91DC	"A. Ort ""aorto"""	I picked this film up having loved the director's prior film Pi.  I had no idea what the film was about.  I think that was why it had such an impact.  Cinematically, it is brilliant.  The camera angles, the way the film is edited, the movement of the camera in lucid dreaming fashion.  The effects of the filming draws the viewer into the hallucinatory haze of the actors.  Absolutely amazing.As for the story, it is one, long graphic portrayal of the descent into addiction.  Viewer beware: it pulls no punches.  It shows the worst that can happen (especially Jennifer Connelly's character -- horrifyingly brilliant) when your addiction rules your life.  Ellen Burstyn is simply stunning in her role and reveals another facet of drug addiction we often overlook in our chemically laden society.The movie does not preach nor does it present a Pollyanna solution to affects of addiction.  It merely lays out the stories with a gritty realism that left me stunned and disturbed, quite literally, for days.  I can't say this is a bad thing but the movie affected me as few movies ever have.	5.0	One long hallucination...	2002-12-26	9	8	1

As a big fan of Pi already, I was very excited to see this movie. Not being 17 at the time, I didn't see it in the theatres, so I rented it when it came out (the edited version.) I bring it home and start up my self-deconstruction. A few friends that had seen it were discussing it and talked about how intense the movie was. I go through Summer and Fall not understanding how they could think this movie was intense... I was rather confused. Then Winter set in and I realized what exactly they were talking about. I could try to explain how this movie had me crying in a fetal position or how I couldn't sleep because all I could think about was the movie. It wouldn't help, I have tried it before, reccomending this movie to all that I thought would understand the impact of this work of art.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1XHVW22L0IVDC	"""apollo71"""	This movie is one of the few pictures that accurately portrays drug use. Aronofsky uses a few stylistic elements, from the split screen to the quick cut, in perfect sync with the tone and matter of the movie. It has style WITH substance. A rare treat in an age of pictures aspiring to be MTV montage videos. A lot of the same effects he used in &quot;Pi&quot; are incorporated into this film, only this time around, he perfects his technique.The picture centers around parallel stories of a mother and son. At first, you watch these characters and wonder what's so wrong with drugs. Midway, however, you come to realize why it's best to just say no. Things go terribly wrong for these characters. Terribly, Terribly wrong. Because of this, the picture might come off as a bit too moralizing or preachy. This is not a subtle movie. Still, it avoids the pitfalls of most junkie movies like &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; by visceralizing every detail wrong with drug use.Great performances throughout the picture, most notably Ellen Burstyn. She demands your pity in this movie. Definitely one of the better pictures of this year.	4.0	a trip gone wrong	2001-07-13	1	0	1

It is a hard, hard film that is easy to admire and difficult to love, which is probably why it was nominated for, but didn't win, many awards.Aronofsky's direction is continually inventive and surprising, jarring us, shocking us, and shoving us into the psyche and guts of these people.  It is a tough trip.  The cinematography and editing is exceptional. The DVD surround soundtrack is especially effective.The story of a Brooklyn housewife/widow becoming addicted to diet pills while her junkie son &amp; his friends self-destruct in their own ways, is a descent into the mouth of hell and no punches are pulled.  It is all too achingly real and sad.Should be shown in every high school in America, and on Oprah for the stay-at-home pill poppers.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1KKHE3R5PBZ7Q	Aron Hsiao	Requiem for a Dream is a technically sound and quite compelling experience that can be called a cautionary tale (at least) about the dangers of substance abuse.The film builds very nicely; we fade in with comedy-noir cut scenes in which two of the main characters are pushing an ancient television set on a cart across various urban setpieces. As it turns out, one of the main characters is hawking his mother's television set to pay for his habit. By the end of the film, his mother will have developed a habit as well, from seemingly innocuous beginnings.After the relative silence and lightness of the early scenes the film begins to develop a darker, much more aggressive and hopelessly bleak march, climaxing with rapid cut scenes of the characters' interwoven stories that show the impending moral and emotional deaths of each. The cinematography is powerfully executed and the rising, harrowing soundtrack becomes a metaphor for the rising sense of hopelesness that permeates every frame. Five star composition.My only gripe is with the plot. There are four major characters in this film, each of them an addict. While the junkie lifestyle certainly has its pitfalls each of these characters somehow happens on the worst of all possible circumstances at every crossroads.The script could have been satisfied with the demonstrations that junkies often end up serving for posession or that junkies often end up turning tricks to support their habit. There was no need to take the heavy-handed approach. In this world, black junkies from Brooklyn go to all-white Klan-run prisons in the south, young wealthy female addicts end up in live lesbian S&amp;M shows for chanting mobs of white-collar criminals, and aging suburbanites with amphetamine prescriptions end up getting electroshock therapy until they're vegetative. The law of averages clearly does not apply here. These extremes do contribute to the overall effect, but they don't stand up to reflection once the smoke has cleared; this dilutes the film's message to some extent.Four stars for a brilliant piece of film, but one star is lost for being so heavy-handed as to abuse the substance (so to speak) of the film for intelligent audience members.	4.0	Technically good but problematic.	2003-08-30	8	4	4

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3UF6Y57Q4RBAT	Art Turner	I just watched REQUIEM FOR A DREAM this morning and have two seemingly contradictory things to say about it: (1) It's one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. (2) I'm reasonably sure I'm never going to want to see it again. Director Darren Aronofsky orchestrates every element of this cinematic meditation on the horrors of drug addiction so perfectly that I was completely overwhelmed. I watch a lot of ultraviolent and explicit films (Tarantino, Scorsese, and Abel Ferrera are among my favorites) but this one was hard to take even for me. Highly, highly recommended, but, as they say, caveat emptor.	5.0	Devastating	2011-02-28	6	5	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2QXWBO7I5DXEI	"Ashlee M ""Ash"""	I think if you yourself have dealt with addictions, you will be able to watch this movie and feel the pain and hardships these people go through. The actors & actresses do an amazing job at portraying real addicts.. props to Burstyn who looked absolutely delusional in the ending hospital scenes.The ending however (last 15-20 minutes), is really rough and intense- lots of stuff happens in the end- in all of the four main characters lives. It is really hard to just sit and watch, you want to help these people so bad. Or, you sit there knowing exactly what they are going through- feeling their pain and struggles. This movie is depressing, but it is so real life. It doesn't attempt to sugar coat anything, drugs-diet pills-sex- are all real elements that are explored to the extremes in this movies.	4.0	extreme, shocking, real life...	2006-04-26	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3PYIMNF2QJHE	Ashley	"Addiction. I'm sure everyone has felt an addiction to something or other. Caffeine, chocolate, tv, sex and drugs, even, but there's such a rainbow of things people can feel addicted to. I have never seen addiction portrayed in a better, more haunting way than it's done in this movie. It may seem easy to not sympathize for these characters. ""It's their own fault they got all muddled up in drugs, that could never be me,"" or ""this movie is stupid, the entire plot is about letting yourself go deeper and deeper into despair."" That may just be ignorance talking from someone who clearly doesn't understand just what addiction can do to people. This is a movie that's not supposed to be about confusing you with twists and turns and a whole gigantic plot that you didn't see coming, but it's supposed to make you feel, make you think, make you reminisce about your own life and the lives of those you love. It does just that perfectly.Take Jared Leto, for example. Most people only see him as this one-dimensional guy who just happens to have a popular, talented band. They may not have realized that the skeletal Harry Goldfarb is actually Mr. Leto himself in a heart-wrenching role played to perfection. And ""whoa isn't that the guy from those Scary Movie films?"" Yes, yes it is. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar that year, in my opinion, her story may just have been the saddest one yet. She deals with feelings of abandonment, self-worth, and loss.This is a movie with a message that's more than ""drugs are bad, k? Don't stick things in your arm."" We all learned this in the fourth grade. It's obvious. If a movie just pounded that into your head, I don't think it would be as well-liked as Requiem For A Dream is. The same can be said for the novel as well, really, which is also completely fascinating. There are differences between book and film, of course, but it's certainly one of the best book-to-movie endeavors. If you're easily squeamish or have a closed mind you may not like this film, but you really should give it a go. Even if you don't literally like it or if you get freaked out by it, you'll certainly still appreciate and admire it."	5.0	you are my dream	2007-10-13	4	3	1

I know that there are many movie out there about the destructiveness of drugs. However, I have never seen one hit at the core of peoples emotions the way this one does. The people in this movie, do everything they can for their addictions. You travel with three seperate people, and get to see every stage of their drug addictions. It shows you the effects of several different drugs. You watch the entire process of these functioning adults who turn into a complete mess that have literally ruined their lives, making it even more dramatic. It was amazing to see what these people would go through just to get a fix. The drugs altered their mindset and completely destroyed there sense of perception. This movie is not afraid to show people the worst of the worst. There are certain scenes in the movie that provoke such strong emotions because of the horrible things that are happening to these people. So many times in the movie these things could have been prevented, but were not because of drugs. This movie does an awesome job at allowing you to feel the pain (on a much smaller scale obviously) these people were experiencing.  I think that this is an awesome movie for a coming of age person to watch. Maybe, it could scare some people away from the harmful effects of drugs.	5.0	one of my personal favorites - UNCW student	2011-03-21	3	2	1

I almost didn't bother even watching the whole thing, it had me yawning.  The music is repetitive and annoying.  The focus was on the character's downward spiral thanks to drug use, and didn't accomplish portraying the tragedy that is the death of dreams well at all. The characters failed to move me.  It seemed to me they never had anything going for them to begin with, and thus not really anything to lose.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	Viewed: 7/07, 6/11Rate: 107/07: The movie starts off slowly in a dumb way that would have resembled an ordinary picture, but its freefall into despair is extraordinary. The infusion of style through Requiem for a Dream makes it an unforgettable picture. Quite possibly Requiem for a Dream may be the most haunting picture I've seen. The performances, save for Marlon Wayans, are thoroughly outstanding. There have been some pictures that deal with drug use and chemical dependency, and quite many of them glorify the shattering experience. But Requiem for a Dream is the exception. It elevates the elements of Sid and Nancy while incorporating the motivation with regard for neither nihilism nor gratification. No question, the most outstanding performance of the picture is Ellen Burstyn as she combines the delicacy of Vivien Leigh from A Streetcar Named Desire with the madness of Bette Davis from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Jared Leto is an actor of limited abilities, but in this one, he digs deep and pushes himself farther than he has never been. For Jennifer Connelly, she is usually a blank person with a lot of faade that turned in many mediocre performances, but in this one, she fits in flawlessly of her role and transforms herself into the character that blended in what the content demands. A veteran of many bad, bad movies, Marlon Wayans makes an appearance in a film that's quite unlike him, and he does well staying within the level of others. Is it the performances that make Requiem for a Dream the picture it is, or is it the work of a director? Hmm, I think it's more of the latter. Darren Aronofsky shows that he had learned a great deal from his first picture Pi and transfers its style into Requiem for a Dream plus adding more inventive ways to take his vision to the next level. The result is a smashing one. It starts off, as I said, leisurely, begins its ascent with endearing performances, and lights up a fuse that promises to explode with lots of fireworks. When all are said and done, the effect of the picture has stayed with me mentally because it becomes, to a certain extent, impacting. Requiem for a Dream is a film that is waiting to be recognized as a venerable classic in decades to come, and it deserves to be held in high esteem. It's so unlike anything I've seen. I think that the movie had enough to make a compelling in-look of what would happen to a person if s/he started to get into hardcore drugs. Yeah, Traffic fails to portray it because Steven Soderbergh spent his time excessively juggling with so many characters in an overly ambitious picture. Darren Aronofsky avoids that mistake by keeping the characters small and simple. It is also at the point that their past backgrounds ceased to matter, so I am instructed to watch the decaying effects of the present characters to the point of finality. I must say, the title Requiem for a Dream is very intriguing. To dream of something big is to swap for something else just like how Dr. Faustus did? Seems to be like it. Some of the scenes in Requiem for a Dream are painful for me to watch, but I saw every second of it. When I could think of the most hollowing part, it has to be either the black circular bruise on Jared Leto's arm or the double sodomy sex scene in a machine gun rapidity. Giving the film a `10', it is easy for me to do so because when a film fails to invoke feelings, then it is not considered a good picture. But Requiem for a Dream pretty much takes away all of that from me, and I may have been speechless already afterwards. Surely, to show evidence, the fact is I usually write a review the day after I finish the movie, but for Requiem for a Dream, it is three days after. I may have to wait years before I will take interest in watching it again. To repeat, Ellen Burstyn's performance may be just the best of her career.6/11: Requiem for a Dream is the ultimate anti-drug picture. Show this to kids, and you'll get the desired effect because I don't know, except for junkies, who can not be repelled by Jared Leto's black circled arm. Also, it is the ultimate ADD picture because of the extensive editing where an average film would have 600 to 700 cuts, but Requiem for a Dream had 2,000 of it. I just love the camera style throughout; it's bold and innovative. The pacing is extremely fast and to the point, magnifying the extremeness per scene by 10 fold. As a result, the ending is one depressing maniac finish. Although the cast does very well collectively, it's Ellen Burstyn's show. She steals every scene and makes for one sad, pathetic character. If there is a reason not to do drugs, legal or illegal, and then abuse them, see Requiem for a Dream. It's worth every second. Forget the idea that there are extreme scenes; the film is meant to tackle an extreme subject in an extreme way. All in all, Requiem for a Dream is forever a classic.	5.0	Can You Look Away????	2011-06-20	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1KTX2X4PSII1N	"""autophobian"""	No, I couldn't think of another title for this review; Requiem.. is a picture of brillance. Darren Aranofsky shows us our fears by showing us our wonders. It is light; it is dark; it is balck and white and red and blue. What he does in this movie is impossible to comprehend. Art is never lifeless; it is just dead sometimes. The 4 people dwindling away by addiction is depressing and scary. They lead lives which are hectic, insane visions of monotnous routine; they are only 4, yet they die 1. I cannot go on. This movie is too much. It expresses too many emotions, too much art, too much truth for me. I only view it in dream.	5.0	Despair beautifully shoved down our throats	2001-06-14	2	2	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3EI94I4G6PB8Y	A. Wallace	It seems that as human beings, we are concerned with an image that we try to uphold and/or a lifestyle that we wish to live out.  However, by some philosophical measures, happiness is an acrasia that is never truly obtainable.  After all, death is the only guarantee from life.  So what is this movie about?  To numerous people in the world who find themselves easily entertained by shallow and face value explanations, it's simply about drugs, addiction and the pain the characters go through.  But to those so very few fortunate movie viewers like myself (and I hope you are one as well) you will understand the movie at so many levels that you can sympathize with the characters for what they have been cursed with: being human.  But this is reality folks.  And the performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Waynes and Jennifer Connelly make it that much more realistic.  The direction and choice in cinemetography of Darren Aronofsky is undoubtbly higher than the accepted, cliche norm, allowing one to connect and view the movie as an individual; something that is increasingly becoming more and more difficult these days to be.  And if you don't see this movie, at least do yourself the favor and read the book that it's based off of by Hubert Selby Jr.	5.0	Welcome to reality...	2002-01-13	3	1	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3CKPNSGA7JOLK	"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;"""	"This is the response to Alex Proyas's ""Dark City."" What if you go from a small patch of light into hell? Darren Aronofsky repeats his seven-rapid-repeated shots technique from Pi in this painful film, ""Requiem for a Dream"" adapted from a story by Hubert Selby Jr. by Selby and Aronofsky. He also plays tribute to the shot of Jennifer Connelly at the end of a pier from Proyas's ""Dark City"" (it is even the same pier).The film is painful to watch, but difficult to call ""beautiful,"" for it fails to say anything new. Its soul message: drug addiction dehumanizes you and kills relationships. This film documents four character's abandonment of hope, and ends at the twilight of their despair.The four principal actors do excellent jobs, and in a better world Ellen Burstyn's performance would have been carved out of this film's context and awarded an Oscar. Jennifer Connelly also delivers an excellent understated performance of how drug addiction can affect the shallow.Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn) is a lonely widow who has invested all her dreams in the success of her worthless son Harry (Jared Leto), and passes her days fixed on television. In a dream of some self-fulfillment, she hopes to go on television herself, and begins a prescription drug diet plan at the hands of an unscrupulous doctor. Hell follows, and Burstyn's performance is so realistic you will weep real tears.Harry is a wastrel crack fiend with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) (her attraction to the colorless Harry is never explained, and to me is unlikely). Harry has a moment of limited insight and becomes an entrepreneur on the crack scene, with predictable results. But his intentions are good: he is trying to finance a store to feature clothes designed by Marion.The setting is Brooklyn Beach and the collection of lower middle class second generation Jewish immigrants and their widows clinging to the old neighborhood (look for Louise Lasser in a cameo role). This neighborhood and residents was made famous by Victor Niederhoffer's ""Education of a Speculator"" and it was nice to see many details of his reminiscences captured on film."	3.0	Not for the squeamish.	2009-04-19	1	1	0

Morris ""BeansMommy"""	"The acting in this movie is AWESOME !!!The film revolves around 4 people.The characters are Ellen Burnstein (who plays the mom) Her son(Jared Leto), her son's best friend(Marlon Wayans), and her son's girlfriend(Jennifer Connely).The son and friend start out selling drugs, and become thier own best customers,the girlfriend also becomes addicted, followed by the Mom.She starts taking prescribed diet pills to lose weight, because she believes that she is going to appear on a talk show and wants to fit in a particular red dress, and her 'dieting' does start out innocent enough.As this movie progresses we watch them become empty shells of who they used to be throughout a one year time period, as thier addictions progress.(The film is shot in 4 parts, 4 seasons:Winter,Spring,Summer and Fall)It starts in the spring andby the time Winter comes around, they are all living in thier personal hells as full blown addicts. Mom on her ""legal"" prescription speed, and the other 3 on Herion.The acting in this film is top rank.I think it is right on the money the depths to which these four sink.Addiction is not a pretty thing,and even though the empty shells of the addicts they become is disgusting to watch, it is also hard to turn away.The Mother's ""bottom"" that she hits in her addiction will make you cry, you just have to see it to believe it. And I felt the most sorry for her character too, because she was so naive' and  innocent when she began taking the prescribed diet pills, and because they WERE prescribed, she didn't see anything wrong with her use, and it continued until she was a raving lunatic at about 70 pounds, and getting shock treatments.We witness all 4 characters in thier spiral downward, and it is very sad to see.I will have to say that it is about the most depressing movie I ever saw, but this is not totally a bad thing, as there is a lesson to be learned, and that lesson is that no matter who you are,rich or poor, black or white, girl or guy: ANYone can become an addict.Some make it back from the bottom, and others don't.That is the reality of the situation, and this movie captures that perfectly."	5.0	A raw  (and realistic)  look at addictions.	2006-11-17	2	0	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3EUSH8DPW75LR	barry	The first thing that needs to be said is that REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is honest and raw.  Nothing is held back here.  It is not a story told to lightly touch on the subject of addiction.  Instead the entire film is living in the life of an addict with nothing held back.  Being in recovery I see how true to life this film is.  It starts right off with our main characters using.  We have Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly all giving the performances of a lifetime.  The characters are likable and shown in enough of a perspective that we can care for them but the downward spiral that will continue throughout the fim begins right at the start.  Jared and Jennifer are boyfriend and girlfriend shooting up to escape, get a high or just relax.  Ellen Burstyn is the mother who goes to the doctor to get pills to help loose weight.  All starts innocent enough but the film quickly turns into the never ending descent into hell that is the life of an addict.  It realistically shows how what one thinks is a chosen act for escape becomes a psychological and physical addiction for which the user will do anything.  The hell they endure is self inflicted but they cannot stop due to the addiction.  This movie is scarier than any thriller or stalker film for it is about real life.  Many don't want to see or even imagine the life of a true drug addict and the ends to which our characters go to get their drug gets more and more horrific as the film goes on.  The scariest part of it is that it is all a realistic portrayal of the life of an addict.  There is no joy here.  The film is a descent into hell and it ends with a wallop.  For most one viewing will be enough for this film.  It is a masterpiece but how often does one choose to go to hell.On the other side, this film truly is a masterpiece.  Even though it is 10 years old it is the most honest, realistic depiction of drug addiction ever on film.  The reason to view this film again is the amazing performances by the main three and the superb directing by Darren Aronofsky.  The blu ray transfer is amazing.  You would never guess that the film is 10 years old and the transfer makes all the colors crisper and video more vivid.  The audio is amazing.  Bottom line, the blu ray transfer holds strong to the integrity of the film. It is grainy where need be and the clarity to the rest brings the message and horror of this film that much stronger.  I highly recommend this film.  Be prepared and aware of what you will be viewing.  This is a tough fim to watch - bottom line.  But it is an amazing film and when a film  so honestly and truthfully tackles such a difficult subject you must view it.  And as I said, you will be so awe struck by the performances that you may want to view it again.  The blu ray version is superb.  The film is hardcore and an experience you will never forget.

THE SOUND OF MUSIC, now THERE'S a movie that scarred me for life.However, Darren Aronofsky has crafted a movie which is visually stunning, and puts the old split screen technique to creative use. The soundtrack is strange, to say the least; and features a bizzare combo of strings, techo and distortion.  The cast is good and also includes Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons. But if you're expecting something ""disturbing"" you'll be disappointed."	3.0	THE SOUND OF MUSIC is more disturbing	2002-10-15	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ATRYKR4C51VUJ	"Beast ""Eric"""	"Requiem for a Dream contains a vast world outside drug use.The movie starts out with Harry (played by Jared Leto) locking his mother, Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn) in the closet. He pawns the television, and as we find out, he has pawned it many times as shown in Mr. Rabinowitz's checkbook, which if you look closely, is titled ""Sara Goldfarb's TV."" The reason for pawning the set is so Harry, and his friend Tyrone C. Love, (Marlon Wayans) can purchase a hit of heroine.Harry also has a girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connolly.) The three friends launch a scheme to buy a pound of pure, uncut heroine. While this is happening, Sara Goldfarb recieves a phone-call where she is told she will be on her favorite game show, even though it is most likely merely a deceptive advertising scheme. Being elderly and naive, Sara Goldfarb is excited by this offer, and becomes addicted to diet pills to lose weight. The three friends, slowly become addicted to their own drugs, and are unable to become big time dealers with a pound of pure.We see the characters crash and burn, but with the vivid characterizations, it bothers and challenges the viewer, rather than makes the viewer feel superior to what would be mere ""junkies."" We see that these four people are human beings, led askew by their addictions. But the film would be mediocre if it were merely about drug addiction.Instead the drugs are a powerful symbol of suffering. On the DVD's extra features, Hubert Selby Jr. is interviewed by Ellen Burstyn. Hubert Selby Jr. is the author of the novel, which this movie was based on. He explains that suffering occurs when pain is avoided, and when we venture into escapism, the suffering grows stronger.This is not the only superior aspect of the film. The camera techniques make use of Selby's idea of the resistance to suffering. There is a brief, surreal escape when the characters use drugs. It shows a close-up of the needle, the spoon heating, the blood flow, and the pupils dilating. Then soon after we are jolted back into reality, to show the temporary high, and the inescapable agony of real life. But the characters do not want to face this reality. They pursue their ""dreams"" until it ruins them. Avoidance of suffering causes more pain. Illegal drugs are among the most obvious forms of escapism, and it works beautifully and terrifyingly in this movie."	5.0	Drugs as a Metaphor for Suffering	2005-09-24	0	0	0

I had seen many movies about this subject matter, but this one, and only this one, managed to knock you out, making you watch even though you wanted to turn away.What makes &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; a great movie exactly. Well, everything about it. From Aronofsky and Selby's script up, this movie is pretty close to flawless.The acting is indeed flawless. Ellen Burstyn should be suing the Academy for giving Julia Roverts her award. This is a performance that shoudl be studied, and is one of the best in the history of movies. Jared Leto, from here on out loses his &quot;poor man's Johnny Depp&quot; stigma with a great performance. Both Jennifer Connoly(the last few minutes of her story pretty much sucked away my will to live for a few hours after the movie) and Marlon Wayans(???) completement the leading cast perfectly in understated performnaces.Arnofsky uses all the tricks in his bag, and uses them well. This is sort of like an Mtv video from Hell: quick cuts, playing with slow-motion and artsy angles, but by the end, you see what it was all for.This movie is most certainly not a movie for everyone. If you thought &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was too disturbing to watch, for example, then you really should avoid this movie with all your life. But if your not weak of heart, then you should defintley seek out this voyage into a sort of Hell. You will not regret it.	5.0	Where Do You Start?	2004-03-01	4	3	1

Imagine students' reactions to the graphic display of the torture that drugs and addiction/obsession induce. Films such as Requiem For A Dream, American History X, Kids, Bully, and American Beauty are often frowned upon by society because they are merely holding up a mirror. Society never likes to see what it truly is. When the ignorant and soft-centered hypocrites are finally woken up to a real look at our society towering films, such as this will get their just rewards.Just for starters, Ellen Burstyn. I would love to meet the people who voted Julia Roberts Best Actress in 2000 and have them watch this film again. A powerful and deeply gripping performance is given here. Easily her best since ""The Exorcist"" or ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" (the film that captured her first Oscar). Portraying a woman whose obsession with a diet program, a red dress, and her social image can only bring the worst for her.Jared Leto gives an equally powerful performance as her son, Harry. A young drug-dealer who struggles at his mother's question ""how is your work going?"" I mean, who could look their elderly mother in the eye and say, ""It's great, I deal drugs."" A sickening addiction to heroine and its grisly consequences leave the viewer inspired and hopefully enlightened.Jennifer Connelly was certainly overlooked at the Oscars as well. An Oscar-worthy performance certainly is given in this film. Marianne, whom will do just about anything for what her mind desires. The rage in her eyes and the burning in her tone bring the viewer as close to the mind of a sickened, sexual drug addict as is possible.Finally, Marlon Wayans. Who knew he could act? He gives an absolute amazing performance in this film as Harry's friend Tyrone. He gives a small yet adequate dose of humor that prevents the film from being 2 hours of depressing cinema.Darren Aronofsky brilliantly directs this, certainly an Oscar-worthy directing job throughout. Various new techniques are employed, split screen scenes, sudden fast motion, slow motion, and just about simultaneously showing 3 different scenes at the same time make this a trip that the view will not easily forget.Finally, Clint Mansel's menacing score is a must-have. A simple theme is repeated but altered enough that you don't get sick of it. Haunting synthesizers and a special performance from the Kronos quartet dominates this film.So, I find that when films like this are released, society shuts them away because we don't wanna hear what's wrong with us today. Well, we can't fix what is wrong until filmmaker's like Darren Aronofsky, Tony Kaye, and Sam Mendes truly and brutally show us. But when will we listen?"	5.0	One of the most educational and eye-opening films ever made	2002-06-17	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1QK5GN0FV07YZ	Benjamin Volio	this movie is hardly a masterpiece. Please don't preach about the directing in this movie, it doesn't take a genius to build up suspense with such a blantantly obvious plot. How could things not go wrong with a group of people all getting mixed up with drugs. This is like a childrens book mixed up with Shakespeare. The only reason it is so popular is because anyone including my 4 year old nephew can piece together the symbolism and themes of this movie. This movie reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, although a thousand times better than this movie, because it is so widely read and hailed only because it is the easiest Shakespeare to identify with and analyze. I feel bad even comparing Romeo and Juliet to this horrible movie because it has that much more meaning and storyline to it than RFAD.

I have heard of other people vomiting during the watching of this movie, while me personally, I can't honestly say that after watching this I was shaken as most other people who have watched this claim to have been. But you MUST watch this film, a truly eye opening movie into the world of drug addiction. The film focuses on Harry (Jared Leto),a surprisingly well-acted Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), Marion (jennifer connely) harry's gorgeous junkie girlfriend, and in easily the best performance of the movie is Ellen Burstyn as Sarah Goldfarb, harry's mother who get's hooked on diet pills. The imagery, directing, and editing in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen, as Aronofsky does not make any attempt to surgarcoat or water down the horrors of drug addiction. The scenes where they're shooting up will blow your mind because of the quick cuts. Also the music is just amazing. All originally written for the film by Clint Mansell and performed by him and the Kronos Quartet, the music pushses the film to an all new level as it works so well with the action on screen you feel compelled throughout the movie. All in all this movie is definitely worth a watch, definitely if you're wondering about how drugs will mess up your life."	5.0	A fantastic assault on your current state of mind!!!	2002-06-13	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2YAABMT80RLYA	Ben Rowland	"There are two kinds of drug movies: movies that depict drug abuse as a trandy undertaking, and movies that show it as a descructive force in every life it becomes part of. Darren Aronofsky's ""Requeim for a Dream"" takes the later option, pointing to the clear lesson that drugs are a dead end, with a benefit that is only in the short term.At the center of the movie is Sara (Ellen Burstyn, is a knockout role), as a lonley widow who, following the path of her heroin-addicted son (Jared Leto), becomes addicted to drugs in order to loose weight for her appearence on a tv talk show. Her slow descent into madness and drug addiction is the most disturbing aspect of this film. Leto's character has his own problems, with his years of addiction and selling only reap minimal results, and he and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) must survive and feed their addiction, which ultimately ruins them.The movie is filled with symbolic nuances, like the drug taking montage and the surreal editing which drives the viewer into the same depth of madness as the characters. This is further tempered with spurts of graphic violence. ""Requiem for a Dream"" succeeds as a character study, and pushes the bar further in terms of depicting the horror of drug abuse. Unlike Trainspotting, which is trendy and upbeat, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a depressing, often upsetting experience for some viewers. Personally, I think it is a pure work of art. With so many druggie movies, it is nice to see that Darren Aronofsky cares as much about building characters rather than making a music video, as was Trainspotting (mind you, I loved Trainspotting too).For this movie, the DVD Director's Cut is the only format to go with. It has a nice documentary on the making of the film, insight from the makes on how they made those amazing montage scenes, and the best picture quality. Sadly, do to the film's limited release (it was unrateable by the MPAA), not many people had the opportunity to see this movie. I highly recommend everyone who loves movies see this at least one in their lives."	5.0	A punishing and compelling work of visual art.	2002-08-26	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A33693RRRFK55Q	"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted"""	"I don't know.  ""Requiem for a Dream"" is basically well-conceived.  There are some insane performances.  Cinematography rocks.  But I really wasn't blown away by it.  I was unnerved by it, and that is most definitely what Aronofsky was shooting for, and therefore it's a successful film, but I'm not putting it on My List.  Maybe ""Pi"" - maybe - but not this.  This movie just seems kind of unnecessary.  Did we really need another drug-glam-death movie?  Its images are appropriately revolting: the brain-splattered face of a fugitive Marlon Wayans, the gangrenous injection site of a smacked-out Jared Leto, the krypt-keeper complexion of a detoxing Ellen Burstyn, etc.  She deserves some props for being able to let go like that, by the way.  And cinematographically we are made to empathize with her the most.  We get more from her POV under the influence of crazy diet pills, with the trails and sound-distortions, than we do when Jared and Jennifer slam coke or heroin and we watch them in 3rd-person as they buzz around the room or gush sickening dope-tripe to each other.  But none of it is necessary.  I've seen this before - all of it.  It's done exceptionally well here, and that probably should be enough, and maybe it will be in the long run.  Or maybe Aronofsky just raised the bar too high with ""Pi"" to chase it with an exceptional treatment of a run-of-the-mill story.  I mean, we all know what's gonna go down here.  Naive old lady, slightly wild young kids.  Drugs.  Old lady starts popping pills prescribed by shifty physician cuz she thinks she's going on TV and she wants to be able to fit into her red dress and feel like a worthwhile person.  Young kids start chipping on C&H; cuz they deal it, cuz they're trying to get out of Coney, and how do they know how much to cut if they don't sample the wares.  The ironic thing is that they are all fundamentally well-intentioned.They're doomed.It's way more brutal than any War On Drugs campaign I've ever seen (except that really sickening ""I fund terrorism"" one), but the ""message"" is essentially identical, even though this film seems to speak from first-hand experience with substance abuse.  Stylistically it excels.  It's extremely depressing.  My arm literally started hurting when I watched it.  It's grim and unflinching and unconsoling.  It doesn't really suggest that anybody should've or could've done anything differently - this is just what happens.Like I said at first, I don't know.  My reaction is probably more emotional than anything: the film is effective, but I don't want to put myself through watching it again.  All I can really get out of it in the end is ""don't do drugs"" or at best ""if you do drugs you're playing with fire.""I will admit one thing though - the ""infomercial"" menu did screw me up.  I thought I still had the TV on, I didn't even bother to read the flashing text, I just visually revolted and wondered why I couldn't change channels.  hahaP.S.

What followed next was an hour and forty minutes of pure insanity.  I knew I was in trouble when my friend said that they &quot;should have installed seatbelts in the theatre for this movie&quot;.  But that was an understatement.  This movie starts with a bang, the score instantly drawing you in, and never lets up.  The director applys UNHEARD OF tactics to this film that help make it the most jarring, disturbing film that I have ever witnessed.  The message is mainly about addiction and the effects it has on the mind and body.  There are four leads and they are all connected.  We get to see what happens to them, over the course of a year, as they spiral downward into their own personal hell.  At times, it is extremely difficult to watch and we get to know the characters so well that we actually feel their pain.  It's like wathing this happen to your best friend.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1PHIRHDCA1IJR	"Bill C. Woods ""Bee Cee"""	Much is often mentioned of this film's depiction of drugs and the people addicted to them. To focus one's criticism solely on the negative depiction of drugs in this film is a shallow interpretation of what is ultimately a movie about addiction in all of its forms, even the seemingly 'harmless' addictions of common people. From a TV set, a box of chocolates, the exploration of intimacy between lovers, or the need to be accepted among peers, There's much lurking beneath the surface of this film that is unsettling with regards to human desires, and the lengths to which people go to achieve them.What I found most fascinating about this film, was Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of a lonely widow, who after receiving a phone call from a telemarketer promising her an appearance on a television show, becomes slowly obsessed with trying to fit her overweight body into a red dress. What starts as a diet, slowly devolves into a pill popping nightmare, which decays even further into hallucinations and neurosis to the extent that her refrigerator emerges as a monstrous entity slowly preying on her fragile sanity.Where some found this movie to be disturbing, I found it to be spellbinding. The photography was amazing and the overall film has a meticulously 'crafted' look to it. Darren Aronofsky's inspired use of split screen, clever editing cuts and motion speeds elevate the film visually to the point that your eyes are actually drawn to what at times, can be some fairly repulsive images.The soundtrack punched me in the chest the first time I heard it. The central cellos grinding their melody over various ambient sounds, beats and orchestral rhythms was truly unique. Since this film's release, i have heard its soundtrack used on trailers for other movies (most notably, 'LOTR: The Return of the King' TV spots).I would never say that this film is for everyone. It seems like a movie people tend to either love or hate. I'd be amazed to find anyone 'riding the fence' in their opinion of this movie. I'm obviously one who loves this movie. I was completely amazed by the look, sound and feel of this film. Ellen Burstyn gave the performance of her life in this film, which is really just one bullet point on a movie which i found to be brilliant in numerous ways, from start to finish.	5.0	A work of art	2005-08-18	5	4	1

But ""powerful"" doesn't automatically equate with ""great,"" and 'Requiem for a Dream' doesn't even constitute a near-miss.Darren Aronofsky may have all the talent in the world, but he still has yet to deliver a fully-realized film. For all of the evocative hopelessness in his work, he's too caught-up in his own ""brilliance"" to render well-drawn, deeply felt characters. As game as the efforts of his actors are - Jennifer Connelly deserves credit for the big chances she took - only Ellen Burstyn's performance suggests anything remotely like a real person. Jared Leto's Harry is a cipher. And to anyone who would argue that you don't need great characters to make great films, even a technician like Kubrick makes his performances paramount.So yeah, it is visually stunning. The fast-cut editing style is pretty neat. But 'Requiem' hollows you out with its sheer manipulative force, rather than the strength of the drama on screen.If you want bleak, desperate cinema where the manipulator gets great performances from his cast, check out 'Nil By Mouth,' 'Naked,' 'The Dreamlife of Angels,' 'Rosetta,' or 'The Life of Jesus.'

Her dream of being on television (her only companion) seems to be answered when a phonecall tells her that she has been chosen to appear on a gameshow. There's only one problem.

I know many people would say that is irresponible but hey this movie is about the truth behind not just drug addiction but about addiction in general. What make this movie so powerful is the amazing performance of Ellen Burstyn. Had she been omitted the story would of taken on a fantastical element, similar to Trainspotting. Jared Leto gives and amazing performance as does Jennifer Connely and Marlon Wayons. It is inspiring to see such a young director take on such an ambitious project and then succed in handling it brilliantly. I was not at all surprised to find out that Hollywood wanted no part of this film. Everything from the cinematogrpahy to the original score is an inspired work of art. And ofcourse hats of to the brilliant James Chindlund.	5.0	Fury	2001-06-24	2	2	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A12SX0WIMTTKKH	"""bleedingpens"""	So basically the point of this movie was, don't do drugs.  It was obvious halfway through, maybe even before then.  But even though you've realized that, you just can't stop watching it.  I saw it at a friend's house and it will not leave my head.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is most definitely the saddest movie I've ever seen.  I tried to read the book about a year ago and could not get through it, however the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  The camera angles, first of all, completely astounded me.  I loved the way they portrayed the drug-use scenes and when they used screen splits and whatnot.  The characters were very, very well portrayed, especially Sara.  She broke my heart the most.  I can go on about my favorite parts but I won't spoil it.My only advice is, this is not a movie for those of you who get sad easily and don't enjoy it.  I'm one of those sensitive types and I love movies that screw with my head so that's sort of a bad combination...and this was definitely a movie I shouldn't have seen.  I loved it but, now that I know how horribly miserable it is, I will never see it again because it depressed me so much.	5.0	Turning your brain to a pile of anti-drug goo	2004-03-05	6	4	2

The tragedy of this film was so sad because it reflects off the realities of real life which is usually not a perfect happy Hollywood ending and I appraise it for being so. The plot was very well done and had me cheering for the characters to reach their dreams they have set to pursue even though the world around them was beginning to collapse. It was as if every time something bad happened to one of the characters I would say to myself ""It can't get any worst than that"" but tragically, it does.

The first Character Harry wants to sell drugs for a living but of course selling drugs in New York City is not easy because everybody sells Here.The Second character is Marion Harry's Girlfriend will do anything for drugs even sleep with other men to get it.The third character is Tyrone who's Harry's Best Friend and helps harry sell drugs but things don't look good for him when he gets arrested.Then their's the last character with the strongest Proformance in the movie Harry's mother who loves her son as much as TV she always wanted to be on it and finally gets her chance but she also wants to look good on tv so she goes to the doctor to see how can she lose weight and he gives her pills to do that but the problem is she starts to get addictive to it.The end of the film you'll have to see for yourself and sometimes it is kind of boring but thats just a very small portion but other wise then that it's a must see so buy it now.	4.0	It's Good, It's Good	2005-08-03	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ACDUAD0W7L4H5	"B. Miller ""Brandon Miller"""	Requiem For A Dream is not for the faint of heart. If you buy this movie thinking you're getting just some conventional, nonchalant film, you are sorely mistaken. Never before have I seen a film that displays the deterioration of people's lives as a result of substance abuse so realistically before.The story of the film follows four characters: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone are heroin addicts who want to get into dealing to make some real money. The reason Harry wants to make money is to help his girlfriend, Marion, open a store where she can sell her fashion designs. Sara Goldfarb is Harry's mother. She gets a call one day to invite her to be a contestant on a TV show. She is old and out of shape and decides to go on a diet to fit in her favorite red dress to wear on her big day. The diet is futile because she can't handle not indulging herself in the foods she used to eat. So she sees a dieting specialist who gives her diet pills (methamphetamines). At first she loves them and loses a lot of weight, but as time goes on she builds a tolerance and begins taking double, and even triple doses...To be frank, Requiem For A Dream is an assault on you. After you've watched it you feel both mentally and physically drained, much like the characters in the film. Viewing the deaths of these people's dreams is a trying experience, but honestly, it teaches you the true horrors of substance addiction.To me, a powerful film is one that can alter your view on things and change the way you act. Requiem For A Dream affected me in that way and I honestly believe if more people viewed this film it would greatly decrease the likelihood for experimentation with drugs.	5.0	The most powerful and original film I've ever seen	2004-05-26	4	3	1

It is not for everyone, yet I believe that everyone NEEDS to see this movie to at the very least put their own life into perspective.All I can say is that I sat on my couch for almost 30 minutes unable to move, speak and absolutely overwhelmed - and I can truthfully say that at that point in my life I absolutely needed that.	5.0	The most heartwrenchingly beautiful movie I've ever seen	2006-06-27	5	4	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AF9U2FRE35BM9	Brandon	Requiem for a Dream is a very well directed movie, as it is very visually stunning.  The acting is also top notch, although there is very little depth to the characters.  The problem I have with the film is the fact that everyone seems to proclaim this movie as the most powerful film of all time.  For a person who has actually been apart of, or knows anything about the heroin scene, Requiem for a Dream will not be effective at all, in terms of scaring them away from drugs.  Realism is completely sacrificed for shock value, to the point where it seems like Requiem was produced by the government as an anti drug film.  Though it has setbacks, Requiem is, however, worth watching for the acting and the slick visuals.  The film also makes you think.  I would give Requiem 3.5 stars if I could, as it is a good movie.  Just think for yourself and do not take the happenings of Requiem as the gospal.	3.0	Good, but very overated	2004-11-23	5	4	1

While I love both of them, and own both DVD's, I have to say that Requiem for a Dream is a visual, magnificently written, shocking, provocative masterpiece.  I loved this movie.  It is so real.  It is strange, becuase there is no real hero in this film.  The hero seems to be their addictions to their dreams.  Everytime they are doing good, they fall flat on their faces, and worse, are spit on by the people around them.  Libatique and Aronofsky teaming up with classis novelist Sleby Jr., seems odd, but they are all epxerts in what they do, and they made something that will become a standard in every way.  Burstyn's performance is phenomenal, as is Connely's Leto's and even Wayan's.

Arnofsky is definitely a director to look for in the future. Selby has created a giant of a tale, but one that is all too familiar to America. Requiem grabs you by the neck and forces you to observe the crashing spiral of four people, all diluded by their estranged desires. All seeking a hapiness out of reach, by any means necessary. Even as their paths lead them to inevitable damnation and misery.This film gives us an introspective to ourselves, whether or not you are involved in drugs.

Though making an 'anti-drug' film is nearly impossible these days aside from some rediculous after-school special, this film dares to fly in the face of convention and portray a realistic picture of the awful effects of addiction. Every kid in America over the age of 13 should see this movie-- the director's cut, not any edited version!It is truly sad as one follows the characters' lives as they sink to one unimaginable low after another, unable to think beyond where their next fix is coming from. This overshadows even the strong sexual content, which serves only to make the characters' plight all the more pathetic. Do NOT hold out for a happy ending.	4.0	required viewing...	2004-04-29	1	1	0

"(1) Drugs are bad, m'kay.(2) Anyone can be addicted to anything, therefore anything is a drug, and that addiction to whatever can ruin your life.These are the two main themes in Aronofsky's vastly overrated masterpiece for the MTV generation.  The film reeks of it's generation's thorough shallowness; flashy jump cuts, those obnoxious noises (yeah, it's supposed to be unsettling,but it's not, it's just boring and obnoxious.), overly intense cinematography.  It's gritty if your idea of a confrontational film is Bowling for Columbine.It's certainly one of the most heavy handed films in recent memory, not to mention completely and totally biased.  There's only one side of the coin here, folks, or maybe the coin only has one side?  Nah, that's just ignorant.  There are plenty of people who engage in ""health risking"" addictions who don't end up with their arm amputated or resorting to prostitution for rich guys.It's tagged drama, but I think it's quite possibly the epitome of melodrama, as everything is so overblown it's laughable.Like Fight Club, another film popular with the youngsters who would kill themselves if they had to sit down for a film far more unsettling, not to mention vastly more realistic, and that's John Cassavete's Faces, it's all about shock, trying to scare the bejeezus out of you with, again, overblown scenarios.Well, Selby was a hack writer, so a hack film for a hack writer I suppose."	1.0	An overlystyilized after school special	2007-07-11	29	6	23

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1FTOX0CKR4DW7	Bruno S.	In a year of mega hyped flicks, and mega bombs, it was very refreshing to stumble upon a wonderful peice of filmaking. &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; has tight direction, a great story, and the best acting.Can a film about drug abuse really affect the new cynical seen-it-all audiences of today? Well let me tell you this, the film made me and my date actually cry a couple of times. The Ellen Burstyn monologue in the middle of the movie, about being alone, wins the Oscar for her. Julia Roberts? Whatever. It would be a shame if the academy mistaked her clevage baring and mega watt smile for acting in &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, and ignored Ellen.Another flick garnering raves is &quot;Traffic&quot;, a longer, all star flick, that after watching &quot;Requiem&quot; bored me. It paled in comparrison to &quot;Requiem&quot;. Jared Leto, looking very emaciated also plays his part very well. He shows how desperate a drug addled person can be. I don't like revealing too much in my reviews, but those who saw it, the scene in the car when Jared revealed his arm to Marlon Wayans was disgusting, but I could not keep my eyes away from the screen. Jennifer Connely also turns a shockingly great performance. The film I really remember her from is &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. With this movie she proves she does indeed have acting chops, The scene where she goes to her therapists apartment made me feel for her. Marlon Wayans, after a horrifically awful performance in &quot;Scary Movie&quot; rebounds with a steady performance here. The scene about him not letting his mom down was sweet and sad. This performance should help him shed his goofball image. But with &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; comming out he is just moving backward again.Now all my praises to Darren Aronofsky. A man who should win Best Director. His subject matter was harsh, he picked under the radar stars, he adapted the story from a book, and did it all very well. This guy knows what he is doing. The movie is very vivid and to me looked real. I live in NYC and I have seen people affected by drug use. And I know that rarely there is a happy ending. Like &quot;Traffic&quot; with it's stupid Michael Douglas ending about his daughter, who was a super addict having ... for ...., who then turns out to be chipper and happy in the end. Yeah right, only @ the movies. The ending in &quot;Requiem&quot; was far more realistic, and it haunted me for days.The Best Movie Of 2000! I highly recommend it.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1F3GOUFG7Y73U	B. Son	A portrayal of life in its beauty, harshness, it's pure form of reality. It's dark, haunting, and depressing. The little joys in life is something we all share, as well as the indifferent, and the evil. A brutal assault of images, scenes, and memories.The definition of requiem is a mass for the dead, in this film's title, a mass for the death of dreams. Each character in this movie has their own desire.We all have dreams, as do the characters in this film. Sara Goldfarb played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry (Jay Leto). Now a elderly widow living on her own, she has nothing but infomercials as her companion. Harry is a drug addict, getting by on unknown monetary means, using what little money he does have for riding taxis and buying drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) plays his best friend and his girlfriend is played is Marion (Jennifer Connelly).Sara gets a call that she is eligible to win for a spot on the show that she religiously watches. She belives she will get a chance to be on the show, something she is dreaming of. Wanting to fit into a dress, that she had worn years ago to her son's high school graduation, so that she may wear it on the show. She attempts to follow a diet to lose weight to no avail. The cravings are too strong and she resorts to taking advice from her friend: diet pills prescribed through a doctor. She wants nothing but to be on the show, to be loved by millions through telvision, to have them love her son, to love her husband. Being able to wear the dress to her is being young again, to be thin again, to regain the feeling she got from being with her husband. An escape from her lonely reality to one where all her wishes come true.Harry, Tyrone, and Marion do drugs together and are dependant on them. Harry and Tyrone try to sell drugs to make more money. Marion is an artist and Harry wants to open a space for her drawings. He is attempting to make money to open the space so they may achieve this as well as be together. Tyrone seems to only share one memory of his mother as a child that seems to plague him increasingly. Harry wants nothing but the ones he loves to be happy: his mother and his girlfriend. Tyrone longs for his mother's arms. Marion is detatched and has nothing but money.With amazing director direction and cinematography, the story increases in its drama and intensity. A roller coaster of their lives, drugs and addictions, their individual dreams all leading into a fall that is inevitable-- that some might not be able to handle. Only turning for a requiem, for all their dreams.So much emphasis put on drugs, though that is the vehicle on which their troubles ride, is not the entire movie. Whatever it is, is for you to see in this film.It is traumatic to watch, yet fulfilling. Because of its highly graphic and extremely difficult content, it is only recommended for those who can handle it. The director's cut leaves nothing out, the full edit of constant scenes that lead to the group of character's downfalls and leaving you stunned and speechless. What we are willing to do for what we want and think we need-- and how far we will go to get it. Even if it means losing ourselves in the fury of it all.	5.0	It's not a movie-- it's your life.	2005-01-12	2	1	1

It's like a train wreck-terrifying, disgusting and utterly spellbinding.Previous to this movie I had always had an aversion to drug flicks. You know what I mean,they're either preachy or flashy, filled with glamorous, talented people or crummy low-lifes. Then I heard about the movie when I saw the Oscars and a couple of months later the name was still stuck in my head. I hadn't heard too much about the plot except that it had to do with drugs and that it was good. Four stars from pretentious critics good. So I decided to check it out.The cover made it seem like arty, stream-of-conciousness garbage and I almost didn't rent it. Thank God I did. I have never considered taking drugs in my entire life, but if there was even the tiniest doubt that I might, this movie obliterated it. At first the interesting camera work caught me off-guard but slowly I started to get into it. As I did, (wonder of wonders!) I started to feel for the characters. They aren't crummy low-lifes. Jared and Jennifer's characters really do love each other, Marlon Wayans is a lost mama's boy, and Ellen Burstyn just wants her life to be like the &quot;as advertised on TV&quot; version. But slowly as addiction takes over, their lives collectively spin out of control.This movie is watchable for the last sequence alone (pathologically disturbing) and I highly encourage everyone to watch it. You won't regret it (except maybe for the second when Jared Leto is injecting himself in his gangrenous arm).	5.0	Scary as hell, and I saw the edited version	2001-09-16	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	It's as if Darren Aronofsky filmed your very own worst nightmare, assuming you had anything to do with drugs or drug addicts.  If ever a viewer wondered about the interior state of being of drug addiction, this is the movie for you. Aronofsky used Hubert Selby Jr.'s book and screenplay as his source material and the source material is brilliant.I love movies which explore surreal states.  This must come in part from my fascination with surrealist art. Aronofsky's film probably owes more to the late Salvador Dali than to any other film director. I'm also fascinated by movies which move as if you were viewing them in a dream state.  We do spend a great deal of our lives in a dream state and see life from an entirely different perspective in REM time. Aronofsky seems to understand this very well. Aronofsky and Selby, in intended irony, load their characters with dreams of their own which are destined to remain unfilled in large part because of their drug addictions.Ellen Burstyn plays the easiest addict to understand and she does her usual masterful job.  She wants to lose weight so takes diet pills (speed) to do so.  Her dream is to be on tv which is what spurs her to the speed. Her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone use the outright illegal street drugs and dream of becoming big drug dealers instead of low level pushers.  On the way to drug fortune, they themselves become addicted.Jared Leto as the son Harry Goldfarb does a first rate acting job.  Frankly, prior to this role, I didn't think he had any acting talent. There is a growing problem with his injection infected arm which will remain visually with you long after the movie is over. Jennifer Connelly as Marion Silver is every bit as wonderful as Burstyn in this film. She is Harry's girlfriend, soon to enter a life of degradation due to the nightmarish descent into drugs.Because this film is so visual, it is an ideal one for seeing in the best possible format available.  Blue-ray was invented for just this kind of film.	5.0	Darren Aronofsky's Best Film, a Sublime Surreal Nightmare	2009-09-05	39	32	7

The trouble is, Harry's a junkie; whenever he's jonesing for junk he and his partner Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) take Sara's TV to Coney Island and pawn it. All the yentas (Louise Lasser, et al) on Sara's block know that Harry steals her TV, but Sara won't turn him in. Even the pawn broker, Mr. Rabinowitz (Mark Margolis), wonders why she lets him get away with it time after time.Once she gets her TV back she'll most likely be watching an infomercial by Tappy Tibbons (Chris McDonald). It seems like he's always on. Like a poor man's Tony Robbins he whips the crowd into a frenzy--and there are prizes. He claims his regimen will change your life. All you have to do is stay on it for 30 ""Days of Fury."" He sells motivational DVDs. Sara Goldfarb is happy just to watch it on TV, but then she gets a phone call that says they want her to be on the show.-----------------------Sara Goldfarb: Harold, I'm gonna be on Television.====================She gets carried away by the idea of being on TV. It is kind of ironic to have Ellen Burstyn playing this role, because she is a veteran actress from the Golden Age of Television. She's been on TV a lot. Burstyn has had 5 Oscar nominations and won the lead actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Sara Goldfarb, on the other hand, has never been on TV. Sara Goldfarb gets so taken by the very idea of being on television that she goes on a diet so she can fit into her red dress. An unscrupulous doctor prescribes pills that get her hooked, just like her son, Harry--but with the extreme side effect of psychosis and paranoia.-----------------------Sara Goldfarb: And you should see my Harry on Television. We're giving the prizes away. I JUST WANTED TO BE ON THE SHOW.====================Requiem for a Dream is mainly about Sara and Harry Goldfarb, Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love, and Harry's girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). Gold, Silver, and Love. At first they all have gleaming bright dreams, but everything goes dark.This film is based upon a book by Hubert Selby Jr.. He also wrote Last Exit to Brooklyn, and that was made into a film years ago. Selby has had a hard life and his writing is very dark. Very, very dark. There are a couple of conversations with him in the bonus material on the DVD. Selby didn't use any apostrophes in Last Exit to Brooklyn. He would write ""dont"" instead of ""don't."" I thought that it was kind of an affectation, but nevertheless, his writing holds a dark power. However, no matter how dark it gets, there is always compassion for the characters. Though Harry has pawned his mom's TV so many times they've lost count, once he gets ahead, he buys her a new TV.-----------------------Sara Goldfarb: I love you, Harry.Harry Goldfarb: I love you too, Mom.====================But this is a Hubert Selby Jr. story, so you know the good times won't last for long.The Bottom Line is that Director Darren Aronofsky (Pi, The Fountain, The Wrestler) was true to the spirit of Hubert Selby Jr.'s book, and the performances by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans, as well as the other cast members, were excellent. Aronofsky shows the exhilaration, but isn't stingy showing the high price they will pay. For that reason the last half of the movie grows increasingly grim, and it may be disturbing.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2DF325SNSGH2R	Cedric's Mom	"Requiem for a Dream may be the kind of movie appreciated for its effective camera techniques, but it's not the kind of movie one likes, at least not in the sense of liking a feel-good, thrill ride, or big-fun kind of a movie.  Requiem for a Dream is, at its core, about the horror of drug addiction and the degradation of the using life.  Only the purist masochist would choose this life if he knew what it held in store for him.  The characters in this tale unwittingly go down the gradual but steady road to hell and complete derelection, a decline that becomes more steep and takes on greater speed until it hits its inevitable bottom.  Take the most intense moments of Leaving Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Jacob's Ladder, and roll them all up into one to get an idea of the movie's climax.  Thank God this is the edited edition.  I can't imagine how much more sordid the director's cut is.Requiem is a modern-day object lesson for those who would glamorize drug addiction and its captives.  The subject matter is quite grim, and on its own, the story is not particularly original.  What gives Requiem its appeal to critical acclaim is the incredibly effective camera techniques that director Darren Aronofsky gives this work.  Truly, it is an elegant piece of work in the way that many have called Einstein's Theory of Relativity ""elegant""; once you see it written down, it's so obvious, so clear, so simple.  And so dead on the money.  In fact, Aronofsky's effective filming of the story to bring to life, for the viewer, what it feels like to be caught up in that drug-addicted hell, is so perfect and so right-on that it must have already been done, but I can't remember when or where.For students of film making, this movie is a definite must see.  For those pondering the idea of relapse, this movie may very well take the wind out of your sails, and for that reason alone, it is worth the price of admission."	5.0	A 5-Star Deterrent to Using	2002-11-10	0	0	0

You felt sorry for her, for her loneliness as an elderly woman with a lousy son and no true friends. Her story was the only thing going for the movie.However, the unrealistic portrayl of everything grawed at my brain. How come a lawyer didn't JUMP on the chance to sue the doctor for not treating the arm, instead of just reporting it to the cops? Or the prison authorities for not, during the absolutely REQUIRED medical exam prior to incarceration treat the arm? That made absolutely no sense. And, uhm, when was their trial? Their court-appointed lawyers? Even strung out ""yankees"" don't get thrown into jail in the South without evidence - where was that? Or was our perspective too drugged to preceive any of that?I'm also more inclined to believe the other poster about the inaccurate portrayl of the old woman's treatment in the psych center, as the movie, possibly the author, was just trying to go for the most shocking scenario, rather than the most realistic.Oh, yeah, drugs are bad.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2MYG0R8B1FBNB	cfitz@webzone.net	Requiem for a Dream is the story of the drug induced transformations of junkie turned dealer, Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), best friend (Marlon Wayans), and mother (Ellen Burstyn).  This is a bleak and quite unpleasant film; still there is much to recommend it: good directing, camera work, special effects, editing and acting--particularly Burstyn in the role of Sara Goldfarb, whose addiction to television leads to something stronger.  Burstyn's slow metamorphosis of the meek Sarah into a blithering psychotic is just a masterpiece of acting.  Jennifer Connelly shows she's not on the silver screen just for her looks and handles a complicated role as the degenerating junkie girlfriend with real style and color.  Leto and Wayans turn in memorable performances too as best friends turned failed drug dealers looking for one more good score to put them back in business.  The fault with this movie is that it is virtually a manifesto of nihilism; compounded by a lackluster script and a tendency for certain scenes to run on too long. This said, I still think writer/director Darren Aronofsky should be applauded for an imaginative and unflinching treatment of an ugly subject.	4.0	Joyless in Babylon	2001-09-24	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AUDIJM3VUULS7	Charles Tatum	"I really thought director Aronofsky used his cinematic tricks to keep ""Pi"" interesting just so the viewer would not notice a really weak story. With this film, the director finally finds material suited to his style, creating a harrowing journey about drug addiction that makes ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""Panic in Needle Park"" look like Muppet movies.Ellen Burstyn is a TV junkie who gets hooked on speed while trying to lose weight. Her son and his gorgeous spoiled girlfriend are hooked on heroin, and spend most of the film trying to score more drugs. The entire film is watching these lives spiral out of control, with the final thirty minutes, where everyone hits rock bottom, being the most intense, hard to watch scenes ever put on film.Burstyn shows she still has it, and should have beat Julia Roberts' cleavage for the Oscar. Jared Leto makes you forget ""My So-Called Life,"" and every other role he has had where he is the dreamy eyed high schooler all the girls want to date. Marlon Wayans, as Leto's best friend, takes the kind of turn from comedy to drama that must have Jim Carrey pulling his hair out in jealousy. Jennifer Connelly, one of the most beautiful actresses working today, proves she is not just another pretty face in a very difficult, humiliating role.I saw the uncut director's version of this, and I see why Artisan released it unrated. This is an amazing film, and I look forward to Aronofsky's next work...with a little trepidation.The unrated version contains strong physical violence, gun violence, some sexual violence, strong profanity, strong female nudity, some male nudity, very strong sexual content, strong sexual references, strong drug abuse, strong drug references, and strong adult situations."	5.0	Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream	2002-05-29	8	7	1

So many (too many) books and films try (and ultimately fail) to give us a sense of our drug culture, but this film succeeds on every level. Its take on the insidious presence of drugs, of one sort of another, in all our lives, sounds a loud cautionary note. And Hubert Selby, the author, has always taken a very hard, penetrating look at the views around him. This time (perhaps because of the film desecretion of his fine book Last Exit to Brooklyn) perhaps his involvement played a significant part in keeping the film so on track.With stunning performances by the entire cast, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, this is a scarily accurate view of how drugs, of whatever kind, can creep in and overtake our lives. A film about desperation, loss, and illusions, you must see Requiem if you have any interest in (a) an outstanding bit of filmmaking and (b) how all-too-easy it is to follow the rabbit down the hole.	5.0	Wrenching	2001-06-09	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A23MZ5EULW2GHH	"C. Heinrich ""wsidechris"""	"I would actually give this 3.5 stars, but I can't justify bumping it to the higher value of 4 stars.I really wanted to like this, but the thing I kept asking myself during this movie was ""was there a screenplay written for this thing??"".  But the movie was so hell-bent on frenetic editing that even if there was a screeplay, it didn't matter anymore!  I could forgive the filmmakers if they hadn't *tried* so dang hard.  (Watch ""Taxi Driver"" for an excellent example of being real, gritty, and powerful without having to beat you over the head with it.  This movie is an insult to any adult's intelligence.)But the biggest flaw in this film was the fact that the characters were badly underdeveloped.  This is a serious problem when your film is supposed to be a character study (wait, what WAS the purpose of this movie?).  This serious flaw becomes even more obvious when you don't have a brilliant cast to pick up the slack in the writing.  But, I'm being more forgiveable here because Mr. Aronofsky did score big-time in getting Ellen Burstyn to play the leading role.  She saves it from becoming a complete mess.  For 20 years now I have been saying that Ellen Burstyn is easily among the top 5 actresses of her generation.  That cannot be argued (with me, that is).  She doesn't have a huge list of film credits, but she's given some of the finest performances ever captured on film:  ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""The King Of Marvin Gardens"", ""Resurrection"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Same Time, Next Year"", etc. etc.  She's brilliant, and she is remarkable here, and her strength as an actress is what holds it together.  But the rest of the cast cannot make heads or tails with this script, and it shows.Jared Leto, first of all, cops probably the worst New York accent I've ever heard on film.  It's so bad that I either have to laugh or cringe during the many moment he ""toughens"" up his accent (usually whenever he raises his voice).  But his dullness otherwise seems fitting for playing a drugged out slacker, but it's still a dreadful performance.  Jennifer Connelly may or may not be good; heck, I don't know, because I don't know a stinking thing about her character.  Ditto for Marlon Wayans (and what's up with that girlfriend?  she just disappears from the movie.  why bring her out in the first place?).To top things off, the movie barrels into a noisy 15 minute finale that is laughable and ludicrously WAY over the top.  It takes everything to a total extreme (this side of having everyone die), but to say what, exactly?  Shock therapy, amputation, prison, and degrading sex acts for money (and degrading is an understatement for what happens at the end, by the way).  If I felt the movie had taken me somewhere before the finale, then maybe it wouldn't be so ridiculous.  Even the one character that you kind of get to know--Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb--is pushed into a situation way WAY over the edge of credibility.  It's downright laughable.I say this is strictly for the kids because I can hear them saying ""whoa, this is [messed] up, man!"".  Some of us grown-ups, however, will just sit there rolling our eyes.  It is clear evidence of the influence of technology and MTV on popular moviemaking.  I do have to give the filmmakers some kudos for creativity, but they also made this film seem like too much of an experiment.One other good thing I can say about this is the music score by Kronos Quartet.  It's very chilling, and was a nice surprise since I had feared this movie would have a noisy techno or hip-hop score (which it does at times).  But their bass-heavy strings help keep the atmosphere of the film from going completely over the edge."	3.0	Where's the screenplay?!?  This is strictly for the kids.	2002-02-12	13	3	10

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1JPFRUJ91FGSG	ChMont	It's the most heartbreaking movie I've seen by far.Harry and Ty are drug-dealers. But they are also good kids, one bought new TV for lonely mom once he got money, and one always thought about his happy moments with mama. They might have made a step wrong sometime in middle school, then their life slowly slips from delinquency into abyss. Harry wanted a normal business with his girl Marion. Harry is not the sick drug-dealer in many movies. He is just a kid lacking guidance, a kid who has chosen a wrong way...Marion. She starts as a rebellious girl and ambitious designer-to-be, but ends up selling body for drugs. Her father did not ignore her. She could have made her dream. But it did not turn out well.What's wrong with these young people? What's wrong with their dreams? and what's wrong with our society allowing this mess to happen? They have weakness and they make mistakes, but it's too severe punishments for them, almost pointless, considering the chance their life eventually make a turn-back.Finally Sara the mom, a weak person on whom life has cruelly joked. She is a victim of herself and the cold environment. She loves her boy, has not bad neighbours... She is an average empty-nest mom. She is tricked into drugs, but is lost furthest.The heart-breaking part is not how bad things happen to people. It's how fallible persons like us can fall. Life is just crueler on them, and it is hard to blame anyone.Dark as life may be, but we still need to steer through it, fighting our own weakness and addictions.	5.0	Lost in life	2013-08-25	1	0	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ULBTRYFWU0GP	Chris Acuna	Wow!  After I saw this movie it left me kinda numb but I couldnt wait to watch it again!  This is in itself a great movie!  I personally think that this movie is much better than Pi although dont get me wrong Pi was a very good movie too.  Darren Aronofsky is a great director.  I love all of his techniques that he uses such as the shot in front of the actors face while they walk/run and the camera just moves with them.  Its great.  And I have always said that 30% of any movie is the soundtrack and this one had a great soundtrack.  I personally think that this movie should be shown in health classess in high schools.  I love the message that it sends.  Overall all great movie!	5.0	&quot;I Love You Ma!&quot;	2004-05-25	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AH5Z0XEQHQL0W	"Chris Bundoc ""filmmaniac"""	'Requiem For A Dream' is one of the many films that I have been wanting to see for a long time. It must be because of the wild controvercy surrounding the film.To tell you the truth, I have not seen Darren Aronofsky's other films, but, after seeing 'Requiem', I'll try to get a hold of his other movies (such as Pi). His directing style is very chaotic, but seems to flow very well with all of the Frightening things that are happening on screen. I have got to agree, with other viewers, that the last 20 minutes of the film is the most Shocking scenes you will see in a movie, for a while. The film starts out easy, giving us tame shots of what each character goes through to get their daily 'fix' or to make their 'wishes' come true, but as the film runs along, be ready.Also, speaking of Performances, the actors and the actresses are Excellent! In particular, Ellen Burstyn. She handles her role (Sara) very well. In one part of the film, she is talking with her son (Harry) and just explaining what it is that makes her 'smile'. That scene is very heartbreaking, where we notice that she just wants to be loved.The supporting cast (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans &amp; Jennifer Connelly) are Outstanding. They capure their characters in a way that is very real. Each of them put their best performances forward, and it showed, GREATLY.Worth mentioning is the Effects of the film. It's a star all on it's own. Filled with strobe lights, handheld cameras, quick editing and split screens, these effects really highten the theme of the film of being in a high or hallucination.After watching 'Requiem For A Dream' I have noticed that even though it's Shocking and Scary, it's at times Beautiful. Each of the characters wanted to get something out of life and that is what they got, but they paid in a high price. Overall, the main message of the film, as we all know by now is DON'T DO DRUNGS.	4.0	An Intense &amp; Disturbing Ride	2002-11-25	1	0	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AOBBSOPL2ICXB	Chrisco Cardin	I came across this movie by accident at blockbuster. I put it in the dvd player really not knowing what to expect. I don't know what to say about this movie. I have never been affected so much by a film. After the film was over I was kind of paralized. I was filled with so much emotion. You cannot help but feel the characters pain. I must recognize this film for what it really is, a piece of art. If you watch this film sit down and be ready to let it sink in.Harry crying: No....She won't come.I can never expect to feel the same way after watching another film.	5.0	I will never forget this movie.....	2007-08-30	4	2	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A29E9ZBWRG6A5T	Chris Flannery	Critics have come to label Requiem a MTV movie that is only targeted to youth.  Other critics have dubbed Aronofsky's use of fast-paced music montages as being another association to MTV's usage of similar visualizations in commercials, videos, as well as in programming.  This has led to even more criticism of the film as being just another youth-appealing drug flick.  This association is incorrect and derogatory to the true nature of the film.  It is unfortunate that this film has been classified in the youth drug genre with films such as Up In Smoke, Half Baked, or Go, which are truly what the genre sets out to be.  Requiem was set out to be as timeless as possible, and to appeal to all generations.  MTV is style over substance, while this film is substance through style.  Drug culture is a part of all generations no matter how it is expressed or repressed. Aronofsky's technical creativity can be see through the use of atypical camera techniques such as split-screens, time lapses, fish eyes lenses, surrealistic dream sequences, multiple exposures, and digital effects.  The uses of theses techniques are both cinematic eye candy and flaunting.  Requiem For A Dream is a perfect example of how character development can be achieved throught the most intimate subjectivity.Don't rent it, just buy it.	5.0	DVD Director's Cut:  5 STARS	2002-01-08	4	3	1

I'm really surprised that it got such good reviews...I actually bought it based on the reviews but this time, I think the reviews are wrong.  This movie tries to use symbolism and random camera moves so much that it's laughable.  It basically is the sort of movie images that is for the idiots.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3GW9E1B6YEH9F	Chris Nance	It is absurd yet comforting to, as the amazon reviewer has, relegate this film to the destruction of hope when it is sought through back-alley dreams. The character played by Ellen Burstyn is as absurd as that of her drug addled son and as absurd as reality however you choose to experience it. One should be left hopeless after this film and to transpose this ennui onto mere drug addiction is to deny the truth and beauty of this film and to create one's own illusory sense of life. We are all lost in the same mist, heroin, television, whatever and this film is universal, not a condemnation of particular lives, but of all life. This is, however, why this film will never gross 100 million in the box office, it is not a film the populous could or should comprehend. It is a film for the existentialist.	5.0	Beauty	2001-06-12	2	0	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AAOMG1YP0VNP9	Chris 'raging bill' Burton	When a film has a repuation like that of Requiem For A Dream, its fair to say that there will be plenty of naysayers in the crowd. And while I'm not one of them, I can't say I'm in a rush to join the hardcore fans either. Ultimately, I'd say that RFAD succeeds in what it is trying to do. Set around Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sarah, girlfriend Marion and best friend Tyrone, the film is a exciting yet simplistic look at drug addiction.There's really no denying the power of this film. Though many will say that the arty directing techniques have been done before and the characters are poorly developed (both fair criticisms, mind) this film completely blew me away the first time I saw it. Its intense, fast moving and ultimately depressing. So why am I refering to it as entertainment? Because really, that's all it is. Visually its incredibly impressive but the storyline and the themes in the film are weak and simplistic. The whole 'don't do drugs' thing makes this film come across as a piece of government propaganda at times. You'll end up in jail! You'll poison yourself! You'll become a prostitute! You'll go mad! All in all its far too politically correct for its own good and so busy shoving its own agenda down your throat that you're left with no room to breathe. I'm not looking for a film that attempts to justify heroin use or deny its dangers but I don't need to be reminded of its dangers 24/7.RFAD will impress and depress you with its powerful imagery and fast moving pace (not to mention Ellen Burstyn's stunning performance as a lonely widow) but after two or three viewings (by which time the shock value will have fallen) it comes across as little more than entertaiment for the mentally masochistic. If you want a film about drugs, Trainspotting is the one you want. If you want a film that plays with your emotions, then Irreversible is superior to this. Requiem For A Dream is in some respects a must-see, but it doesn't make you think nor does it present any ideas or themes that you've never seen before. It still gets 4 stars because if I said I didn't like it or that I wasn't very impressed when I first saw it, I'd be lying. But then I'd also be lying if I said it was anywhere near as good as the likes of Fight Club, Mulholland Drive or Memento.	4.0	A great film, though hardly genius	2005-02-01	4	1	3

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ZAL5910PGBW	Christian Artman  (Health Nut)	This is a midly entertaining film that explores addiction. It also shares the same downfall as &quot;Magnolia&quot;.  Requiem for a Dream is a much better film than Magnolia however in the sense that there is purpose and a statement in the film.  Magnolia OTOH, was a beautifully directed terrible film with characters that nobody can hopefully identify with (&quot;Magnolia&quot; had no real meaning or plot to anybody but the self-serving director and a few others who managed to hallucinate some meaning out of &quot;Magnolia&quot;.  Traffic was an outstanding movie on addiction, while Requiem for a dream relied on too much hyperbole and SHOCK effect, as if it were an MTV video.  I think it was worth watching once, perhaps, but it is does not have a lot to offer.  Traffic OTOH was either 4 or 5 stars out of 5.  This film does not deserve more than 2 to 3 stars.	2.0	Hyperbole Galore with MTV Video style director	2001-06-10	8	1	7

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3IIH7NHG4FHVO	Christopher A. Love	Requiem is one of the best films I've seen this year.  It's also the most disturbing.  I simply can't get it out of my head.  Though there's not much difference between the video edit (done by larger video outlets in an attempt to water down the movie experience) and the original theatrical release, I would suggest seeing the latter to get an understanding of why the MPAA refused to rate the film. It's not for the faint hearted.  I was surprised by the performances of Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connely.  This has to be a career-best for all three.  Who knew Marlon Wayons could act...for real? However, Ellen Burstyn's performance was the definite stand-out.  How in the world did she lose the Academy Award to Julia Roberts?  I've seen both movies, and Burstyn's performance, by far, outshined that of Roberts.  The only conclusion I can make is that the Academy is rigged!  I cannot put into words how I feel about this movie, but I will say that it's not for everyone.  Those who like summer blockbuter-type films will probably not enjoy Requiem, as nothing blows up and the main couple doesn't walk into the sunset.  However, if you love cutting-edge cinema that evokes every emotion humanly possible, this one will work.	5.0	Julia Who?	2001-06-15	9	7	2

I love a great story, and I love movies that are about the troubles of kids that occur these days in age. Overall, I thought this movie to be very dark, and highly disturbing. When someone tells you this movie is unforgettable; for about the first two days after you see it, it is. I tossed and turned in my bed after I watched it thinking about the ending. While I love the disturbing aspects of the movie, I didnt enjoy the story or the dialogue. The dialogue and conversations in the movie are highly unintelligent and sound like nothing I would of said six years ago when I was in high school. This movie is one of those movies where they take you from scene to scene to watch events unfold, but you are constantly asking yourself &quot;how can these kids make such stupid decisions?&quot; and &quot; why the hell are they doing that for?&quot;. In the end, other drug movies like Trainspotting and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas bury this movie alive. I recommend everyone watch it at least once, but leave your brain, and your food at the door :).	3.0	Great.. but not classic...	2001-05-18	2	0	2

It is especially difficult when many of the reviews give away important plot details, which I avoid since I believe in letting the viewer make up his or her own mind._RfaD_  tells of four people, who will all be conquered by addiction, living in the Brighton Beach section of New York City.  There's Harry Goldfarb (played by Jared Leto), a rather unmotivated man in his late twenties who somehow gets by without a job or any prospects of finding one.  The opening scene involves Harry pawning his mother's television set.  There's Harry's friend Tyrone(played in a surprisingly fine dramatic performance by Marlon Wayans), who like Harry dreams of obtaining financial security without having to work hard for it.  There's Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), an aspiring artist who comes from a well-to-do but emotionally remote family.  And finally there's Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn delivering one of the most courageous performances ever captured on camera), a lonely and slightly obese widow who pines for the days when her husband was still alive.  _RfaD_ chronicles the addictions of these four people throughout three seasons: Summer, Fall, and Winter.What all four of these people have in common is that they all have dreams, none of which come true because of the addictions of these people.  Harry wants to make himself and everyone happy around him. He believes that by selling and using drugs, he can achieve that goal.  Tyrone seeks the happiness he knew as a child with his loving mother, and a lot of money on the side.  Marion is trying to find the love she feels she is not receiving from her own family.  And Sara believes she can ""be somebody"" by appearing on a self-help infomercial.  She tries to lose weight so she can once again wear a red dress that was symbolic of better times.  If there is a point to all this besides the obvious ""just say no to drugs"" message , it's that you can't live your dreams by living in Dreamland.As many reviewers stated previously, this is not easy viewing - nor is it meant to be.  When I rented this from my local Movie Gallery, I had to go back and rent Caddyshack to pick myself back up.  Anyhow, there are entirely too many out there who say this film delves into only worst case scenarios.  Hello!!!  Drug addiction, be it illegal or legal drugs, in itself is a worst case scenario.  Life is not a made-for-TV movie in which every one who is addicted kicks the habit before things get too far out of control.  If _RfaD_ had one fault, it was that it UNDERSTATED the dangers of addiction.  Yes, you read that correctly.  There are horrors from addiction worse than what we see in this film as hard as that is to believe.  Nonetheless, I strongly applaud director Darren Aronofsky and writer Hubert Selby Jr. (based on his novel by the way) for not sugarcoating anything."	5.0	Birth song of a nightmare.	2005-04-21	5	4	1

This is definitely one of those movies. Requiem for a Dream is quite possibly the most emotionally powerful, and viscerally disturbing film I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky certainly proved his talent as an auteur. There's so much to say about this film. It's extremely well acted by everyone involved, very well written, the story is deeply tragic and poignant, the editing is crisp and inventive, and the cinematography is dark and unsettling. Fans of Aronofsky, or even Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, will definitely want to feast their eyes on this masterpiece.	5.0	Maybe the most emotionally powerful, and viscerally disturbing film I've ever seen	2012-04-21	3	2	1

The directing and adaptation from the book are both the best I've ever seen. The movie tells the tale of four characters slowly destroying their dreams by the thing they need most. Jared Leto has never stood out in my mind as a big actor, but after seeing what he is capable of doing in this movie he is definatly a good actor in my mind. Marlon Wayans surprises me with his oustanding ability to play a serious part in a movie, and shows that he can really act. Jennifer Connelly did a good job in acting her part as the addicted lover to Leto. Ellen Burstyn is by far the best in the movie when it comes to acting. Burstyn's character is an addict to TV and speed throughout the film, and Burstyn plays the part perfectly. The film moves your emotions along with the characters right up until the very end. Not for the squeemish, easily disturbed, people who like happy movies, or inconsiderate arrogant cold hearted people.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3D7QNGPZ6DHKP	Claudia Alonzo	I saw 'Requiem for a Dream' in a very small theatre with about 20 strangers.  During the entire film, i was fastened to my seat, my mind and body enraptured in it all. Ellen Burstyn deserves to snatch that Oscar away from Julia; her performance is one of the few rare ones that I've seen by a lead actor that is so hauntingly real and exhibits beauty and realism that few actors possess, especially nowadays. The refrigerator scene is marvelous, and brought me to tears. She is a beautiful woman, and very brave; not many actresses would throw themselves into a movie that requires them to look about 50 pounds heavier and 25 years older. I never thought Marlon Wayans would move me as he does in this movie. The story about his mother is heartbreaking. Both Ellen and Jared were willing to transform their bodies (Jared lost quite a lot of weight), and were not afraid to fall apart piece by piece, so realistically, so devoted to look for a way out that would destract them from what is lacking in their lives. Jennifer Collenny is also outstanding.  She is a delicate beauty, surely not the 'ideal' picture of a junkie, yet she goes through an agonzing process to feed her habit, and like the rest of the actors; puts every blood cell and heartbeat into her role. The scene where she screams while in the bathtub made me jump out of my seat. It was also intresting to notice two actors from 'Happiness' having roles in this film. It's sad to notice the lack of recognition that this film has received, but critics and Hollywood usually miss the mark anyway. So open your third eye, take a deep breath, and enjoy the ride.	5.0	Horrifying and Beautiful	2001-04-11	2	2	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Just because a movie features characters dealing with alcoholism or drug use or both, does that mean that it's automatically ""one of the best movies of the year""? Don't get me wrong, I liked Requiem (well, parts of it) but there's enough to recommend a viewing but I always wonder whether people say these movies are masterpieces simply because it tackles a hard subject matter. I mean, have you ever heard of someone outright bashing a war movie? And so we have Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to the rightly praised Pi; a no-holds barred and unflinching look at drug use and the deterioration of them.The film follows 4 characters: Harry, his girlfriend Marion, Harry's friend Tyrone and Harry's mother Sara. The former 3 are drug users who pawn TV's to get money while Sara; hearing of the news she'll be on TV, takes diet pills to fit into her old dress. Pretty soon all 4 of them find themselves given a good mind **** about what it is to be addicted to something and the realization you ran out.The film uses many different filmmaking techniques to lend different images to its story. We have the snorricam (a camera attached to the actor, commonly seen in those night-vision haunted house TV shows), a camera shaking violently complete with warped sound, split screen, quick editing, dissolves and shots with fast-motion mixed with slow motion. This makes the film certainly visually packed with stuff but there's barely any substance. In other words, we don't care about these characters when we should; aside from Ellen Burstyn's character, everyone is just simply plot puppets as I call them. They're not fleshed out characters but the amount of visuals being used and the subject suggests we should care but we don't; we just see these drug addicts turn into something with no care about how they'll end up, we just watch them do it.Not to say there's nothing to recommend here because there is. Burstyn, as Aronofsky says in his commentary, is so all over the place within the same scene that it's sad she lost to that wench from Erin Brockovich. Hell, Juliette Binoche in Chocolat was better than her. And it's surprising to see Marlon Wayans doing a dramatic role and being good although he does at times do stuff that seems ""Marlon-esque"". Jennifer Connelly is of course good while Christopher McDonald plays a great send-off of those bad motivational speakers you see on TV.While I am recommending the film, I hate the kind of self-knowing importance the film has.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3AVWKAJK2P00P	C. Nueve	Alright the plot is simple.  A movie about four individuals who are junkies.  Three are addicted to illegal drugs and one is addicted to prescription drugs.  This movie has been done before.  But what sets it apart is how the movie reflects the four seasons.  The movie starts with the excruciating heat of summer where the four characters becomes agitated, restless, due to drugs.  Then Fall, which means when their lives starts to unravel before being doomed to the the dark uncertainties of drugs.  Winter becomes their death.  When we think of winter we think of bare tress, lifeless like the characters.  The director associated the lives of the four individuals with the four seasons.  Except at the end there is no spring because spring is hope, spring is a where life starts again.  For them there is none anymore.  A simple plot based on how we live our lives with the seasons of changes.	3.0	Another film about what happens when you do drugs.	2004-07-17	3	0	3

I loved trainspotting, but this is so dark and real, so frightening and extreme, you have to see it!The movie portrays three conected characters, who all are hooked on drugs. Just one year changes their lives so imense, that it is almost surreal, but the director has the skills to package the whole thing so good, that you believe it is happening and you feel the pain.It was a real nightmare seeing the missery, especially the things Marion has to go through.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AN3NYKNLJT0A	Colleenie Weenie	I adore this movie. I know people in my life who could easily end up like these characters have. It's sad and pathetic. You feel for these people. They're addicts but they're human too. I hate when it's automatically assumed that addicts are horrible people - they're not. This movie shows how it can be anyone - even you. You can't lump addicts into one category - they're all different people.This movie is NOT for anyone who likes to turn their eyes away at the site of suffering, struggling people; anyone offended by drug use; or the squeamish. Also note that you will probably cry.I know one thing is for sure, this movie certainly makes me never want to do drugs again. That is, until a few hours later.In conclusion, this is an amazing story you will never forget.	5.0	Breath taking.	2005-09-08	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3AQDK1F0YQKAS	"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado"""	Extremely powerful film. It shows how low humanity can sink in the search for happiness, and how people can fool themselves into thinking that their actions bring them joy while in reality they are on a self-destructive path. An incredible cast and everyone of them gave a solid performance, especially Ellen Burstyn.The film's strong point is how it satirizes modern day society's obsession with material values, the need for speed, immediate gratification and always seeking the quickest way for success rather than working hard for it. People may think that we live easier lives now than we did before, but despite our technological advancements and pharmaceutical aids, the lowest common denominator will always keep us down and prevent us from achieving happiness. Mankind's stupidity is on display in this film, in all its infamy and unholy glory.The scariest part of this film is that it speaks a great deal of truth about our species in the most honest, uncharacteristically clear and untainted point of view. Perhaps in a sense the pace of this film makes an indirect comment on how we rush through our lives without realizing how incredibly easy it really is to find, reach, grasp and hold onto happiness, but without anyone to tell or show us what it is, we blindly go on seeking that which we cannot find for the life of us. In this case it's the most extreme circumstances, but sadly it's not that uncommon, and it gives the audience a chance to maybe recognize some of their own flaws, strictly on the principle of the ideas presented.The manner in which the various characters transgress rapidly on the slippery slope of poor choices was superbly portrayed and directed.  It really doesn't take much for people to go from relative normalcy to complete and utter chaos and debasement, so this film serves as a warning to maintain a modicum of moderation throughout our lives, in all aspects of it.'Requiem For A Dream' was not very palatable for the public at large, hence it is not a very well known film but for any fan of movies as an art form should watch this movie for the skill contributed by the director's unique approach, not to mention the wonderful performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans and the magnificent Ellen Burstyn who gives the performance of her life.  As I previously mentioned, the message of the film is quite poignant as well.I highly recommend this film, but be warned, it's graphic, raw, disturbing and its memory will haunt its viewers.	5.0	A Shocking, Haunting and Brutally Honest Urban Tale	2006-02-25	7	5	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3L0M1P4EXRLV4	Cooper	Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel is all about humanizing what we view as something inhuman.  When people think of heroin addicts, or old ladies addicted to diet pills, they rarely attach any emotion to it.  It's something that's done in the most ghetto of ghettos, far away from our safe homes.  This movie very artistically portrays the users as humans, feeling the same things that everyone else does, and the effect is wrenching.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AF50ULMYITS9J	Corey Slack	The only way I could describe 'Requiem' is the most brutal and horrific downspiraling I have ever seen happen on film to its characters.  This movie uses imagery, color, and editing in ways that mix and combine their various powers and lash out, leaving you almost senseless after watching it.It takes place in Coney Island, NY, and follows the relative descent of four characters, seperately and together.  On one side, you have Jared Leto, his best friend, Marlon Wayans, and girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly, all trying to structure their futures while shooting up heroin.  Then you have Leto's mother, in an courageous and flawless performance by Ellen Burstyn, who thinks she is going to win a junk-mail contest and be on television.  That ignites a flame in her to lose weight as quickly as possible, and in doing so she becomes addicted to physician-described diet pills.There is a nice, slow buildup through the film, showing a combination of complete utopia of the drugs, and the destructive results as well.  The interaction of an amazing script, direction, acting, scoring and editing holds up every seen, and your eyes are locked, horrified but not able to turn away.  Slowly, things break down and all hope is lost in this psychotic assault overload.Darren Aronofsky follows up 'Pi' in a way I wish I could describe with doing justice.  To think that this film is only his second shocks to me as to what his future might hold.  He creates moments of rapture which he easily discards for pieces of vague, hallucinogetic, nightmarish visions.  Every scene is carved to near perfection, and they are stacked in such a way that you couldn't walk out if you wanted to.Beware of this film and it's bravery, and make sure you keep away from the sure-to-pop-up Rated-R cut.  I imagine it will butcher the film, even if only seconds are removed.	5.0	Psychotic Assault Overload	2001-02-24	14	13	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a stark, graphic and troubling depiction of the horrific fall into the abyss of drug addiction by four people.  Set against the panoramic background of Brooklyn's Coney Island using some amazing cinematography courtesy of Matthew Libatique, the story surrounds a trio of young drug addled adults played respectively by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly.  Leto playing Harry Goldfarb and Wayans playing Tyrone Love are low level drug dealers hoping to make that one big score.  Connelly is Leto's middle class girlfriend who has aspirations of becoming a fashion designer.  They find their dreams however slowly dissolving as their heroin habits increase and their existence becomes seamier and seamier.The unquestioned star of the film was Ellen Burstyn stupendously effectively portraying widowed housewife Sara Goldfarb.  Burstyn spends her days enthralled with an inspirational game show.  She receives a phone call informing her that she's been selected to appear as a contestant.  As a result she convinces herself to lose weight to improve her appearance.  Unable to diet she resorts to visiting a diet doctor.  Amazingly Burstyn gets hooked on diet pills and undergoes an astounding transformation with the help of a talented make up artist.  Her fantasy of appearing on TV gets replaced by drug induced hallucinations culminating in institutionalization.This is not a pretty movie but is very effective in elaborating how drugs destroy the hopes and dreams of the main characters.  The musical score and the special effects chronicling the ingestion of the pills and heroin were an excellent augmentation to the storyline."	5.0	Descent into the hell of drug addiction	2005-09-24	2	2	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"After watching this for first time, I thought to myself, ""Wow, with some appropriate editing, this ought to be required viewing for high school students as it's probably one of the best ""anti-drug"" presentations one could ever see.Young filmmaker Darren Aronofsky takes a depressing subject and makes ""entertaining,"" if that's possible. Aronofsky uses stop- action/fast forward techniques, sound effects, hallucination scenes, etc. all to make this a good movie for the senses. A warning, though - a couple of scenes are anything but fun to view. It can get rough.Ellen Burstyn is outstanding in this film and many people who viewed this thought she should have won an Academy Award for her performance. Boy, if she doesn't scare you away from taking diet pills, nobody can. She's the only one in this film that is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly can be one easily ogled by us guys but she plays so many sleazy, unlikeble roles, it's tough to warm up to her.Jared Leto, meanwhile, does his best to show us the horrors of what could happen when you hooked on junk which involves needles. In the last 30 minutes there are a few horrifying scenes with him. It is grim, very grim but maybe that's what all of us need to see once in awhile."	4.0	Should Be Required Viewing	2009-04-17	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1N9U0RAV120L6	Crapshoot_101	I first saw Requiem for a dream in a college auditorium at Carnegie Mellon; a bunch of college kids watching an interesting movie. By the end of it, people were on the sides throwing up, others were having mental breakdowns, and tears and a sense of shock were the rule. Requiem is not for the innocent or gentle; it is a look at a path of destruction that is most fearful in its apparent inevitability. Aranofsky makes us care about every character, only to roll them down the slippery slope. The end result is one of the most brilliant movies I can recall seeing; you can't take your eyes of the screen, no matter how much you want to. Requiem for a Dream can only be watched once though; anyone who is brave enough to watch it a second time has a strong sense masochistic desire. Aranofsky is reportedly directing the next Batman movie; if he can make the character interesting and explore the darker roots as he has in both Requiem and Pi, it should bring back interest to a flagging franchise..	5.0	Requiem- haunting	2002-05-31	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AG5RAVN4WSXXJ	Crash999 a PC and XBox gamer	I would have to agree with Jeff Shannon, to watch this film more than once would be masochistic.All the actors are excellent in their roles and the 2 central characters, Harry(played by Jared Leto) and Marion( Jennifer Connelly) a drug addicted couple, bring forth the chilling realities of addiction,exploitation and self degradation to the point of discomfort.This film gives you the sensation of not wanting to see but having to.Connelly,as beautifull as ever seemed almost too pretty and I wondered why she took the role until I had thought about it after seeing the movie.This script would be hard to turn down for any serious young actress with her great talent. The story points out a very disturbing fact in our &quot;cozy&quot; little world:how one human being can so easily exploit,degrade and throughly de-humanize another when the situation arises.Again, for the open minded and stout of heart only,this film is a must see but it will stick with you for awhile.Very true to life,but takes it to the limit.	4.0	A giuded tour through Hell	2001-11-14	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3FRNE6UG9KS5U	Cthulhu	I only saw this movie once, on cable a few years ago, so my memory of it is not crystal clear.  Except for one scene, which I have never forgotten.  It was the one, near the end, where Ellen Burstyn's character receives shock treatments.  Her amazing performance, along with the brutal, unwavering camera angle and direction, combined to produce the most electrifying, riveting sequence I can recall ever seeing in a movie, the effect seeming to put the viewer inside the character in that instant.  It was as if at that point the movie reached out and grabbed the viewer, dragging them down onto that table, as if the frantic, primal screams of the observed were pulled from the observer.  I marveled at the fecund cynicism by which this was concocted.  I found myself laughing heartily, my guffaws born of admiration for the sheer outrageousness of it.  It's the truth, I will not lie; but to those who may find this a callous or inappropriate response to the scene, I should remind them that this is acting, on a make-believe set, which is how I saw it, and my appreciation was for the filmmaking technique itself, and the manner in which it was executed.  All is illusion on the screen.  It's not real.  She wasn't really having megavolts of electricity run barbarically through her brain by an apparatus more at home in the Dark Ages (though still in use).  But the acting!  Stupendous!  Magnificent!  For me this was the climax of the movie, the catharsis, the axis upon which the entire production turned, and well worth the price of admission.  Bravo, Ellen Burstyn, et al!As previously indicated, Requiem for a Dream made an impression---so much so that I went to some length to find out the name of it, having forgotten.  I'm going to avoid all the phony moralizing about drugs that seems to attend some reviews of this movie, on this and other sites.  In life, stuff happens.  You can blame it on whatever fetish you choose.  I'll just say that I intend to see Requiem for a Dream again.In my humble opinion, any movie worth seeing twice is a good movie. 2009 RAPWreckerds	4.0	Ellen Burstyn's performance was cathartic	2009-12-08	1	1	0

The other actors performed very credibly, but Burstyn is what made this film special.As many other reviewers at this site have pointed out, this film powerfully displays the hazards of substance abuse.

I have seen sexuality of that nature in many other movies. For example ""Eyes Wide Shut"", it has much more nudity in it than Requiem, and Eyes Wide was realy bad! This movie is so good that I watched it twice in one night. I was blown away by Ellen Burstyn. I loved her in ""The Exorcist"". She is such a good actress, that she is so powerful years later. I think this movie should be seen in High Schools everywhere. I am 15 and this movie is a learning experience. I can't even think of how good this movie is on a big screen.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	I watch this film and everytime I feel like I'm watching art moving across the screen.  The direction here is brilliant and breathtaking...brutal and stunning and just infectious all at the same time.  The film, an adaptation of Hubert Selbeys novel of the same name, Requiem for a Dream follows the lives of four people, interlocked by blood, friendship and addiction.  Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn in an oscar caliber performance) has resorted to couch-potato status as she wastes her life away in front of the television with massive amounts of diet pills and coffee to make it through the day, her favorite gameshow always on to take her mind off her addiction.  Her son, lowlife Harry (Leto) has resorted to pawning his mothers things just to support his heroin habit, a habit he shares with best friend Tyrone (Waynes in a performance I never knew he had in him) and girlfriend Marion (Connelly).  The film helps to show the massive effect that addiction has on a person, one of the best scenes involving Sara imagining a carniverous fridge, and it also shows the self deterioration a person undergoes when giving themselves over to feeding their addiction.  With their whole world spinning out of control the four addicts, the four losers as it were, fall to pieces and theres nothing there to put them together.  One of the most heartbreaking scenes involves Marion giving herself away sort-of-speak in order to feed her habit.  You can feel her inner morality sink and her pride get pushed aside all for a high she can't find anywhere else.  Aronofsky is a brilliant director with an eye for imagery and a passion for the brutality it takes to tell a story of this magnitude.  Major props to everyone involved, especially the director and cast for creating a brilliant adaptation of one of the best novels around.	5.0	A Masterpiece of Mind and Eye	2006-02-01	4	2	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2U22M4AXDZDYU	Dan Balogh	Just as FATAL ATTRACTION is required viewing for any person who has ever contemplated an &quot;innocent&quot; fling of infidelity, Darren Aronofsky's latest assault on the senses is required viewing for any person who has ever considered experimenting with drugs. The lessen here is so unsparing and so unglamorous, one wonders whether it should be part of every high school curriculum.  Using every cinematic trick in the book, Aronofsky once again laces his images with the cinematic enthusiasm of an eager film school graduate anxious to show the world everything he has learned. But unlike in his other film PI, where his enthusiasm often crosses over into gratuitous overuse of cinematic gimmicks, his tricks here are much more suitable to the material.It's the tale of Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), a Brighton Beach youth who, along with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is hopelessly addicted to drugs. Harry's widow mother on the other hand (Ellen Burstyn who is bound to be nominated for an Oscar for her performance) is addicted to food and TV, and to pathetic daydreams of appearing on TV in front of adoring masses. As the seasons pass from summer to fall, their lives quickly and irrevocably degrade.Dispensing with nearly all character development, Aronofsky and co-screenwriter Hubert Selby Jr. dive directly into the despicable addictions of the four main characters, visually and aurally bombarding the audience with an ever-increasing milieu of unpleasantness. And though the narrative starts off a bit slowly, once the pace picks up it never slows down, ultimately speeding to a stunning orgy of cross-cutting between the four downward spirals of the main characters, finally grinding to a halt when they hit rock bottom.Uncompromising from beginning to end, it's not the most entertaining film in theaters today, but it certainly teaches a sobering lesson.	4.0	Fatal Drug Attraction	2001-03-28	1	1	0

I never really developed tears it was more of an explosive cry in one of the Electro Shock Treatment, amputaded arm, Jennifer Connelly's happiness for money, and Mr. Waynes' banging his head against a jail bar did a cry break out of me.It wasn't that I even would've gone out of my way to see one of the 3 or 4 best movies that I've seen in recent memory.  I actually am doing a project on school on Drug Addiction, and while reading Naked Lunch, Fear and Loathing, and Drinking, a Love story.  And watching Trainspotting, Traffic and Half Baked have I seen more effective and emotional attachment to drugs.This is an excellent but sad and creepy movie, oh but that uplifting ending!	5.0	An Excellent Portrayl	2002-05-13	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AEK2F5IOIYPBX	Daniel E. Fox	"This movie is not a feel good flick.  Do not rent or buy this if you are looking for a good time, a laugh, or any type of happy ending.  It is a serious, intense piece of art which examines drug addiction at close range, showing the devastation it causes in several people's lives.  The acting is incredible (I'm not sure if Jennifer Connely has matched this yet) and Aronofsky's direction is idiosyncratic (his use of repetition can be annoying, no doubt, but incredibly effective).  I have worked with addicts for many years and there are two things this movie does better than any other movie on this subject:a.  it shows that drug addiction is not limited to any one age range; there is no ""typical"" addict, it crosses boundaries of age/race/genderb.  this movie shows how addiction can completely change the type of person you are and induce you into doing things you would never otherwise dooh yeah---it is also beneficial that people understand that certain diet pills (although ephedra is now off the market) and caffiene pills (no-doz) etc. are addictive and can certainly be dangerous if abused.  This movie seems to have helped people be aware of this fact.To me, this movie stands as one of the very best ever made about drug addiction."	5.0	Brilliant and harrowing	2007-05-20	7	6	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ATS7LYGLUX34L	Daniel V. Reilly	Movies like Requiem For A Dream are like giant arrows that point out the flaws of voting bodies like The Academy Awards....this film should have swept the Oscars, should have won Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress....instead we get safe pap like Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts.....Requiem For a Dream follows four characters as they follow their dreams...and we see their dreams become nightmares. Ellen Burstyn gives maybe the best motion picture performance I've ever seen. Not HER best ever...THE BEST EVER. I have never seen an actor or actress lay themselves bare like this before. Watching the sweet, lonely Sara Goldfarb become a speed freak is bad enough, but the paths followed by her son Harry (Jared Leto), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, a true revelation..), and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)are equally harrowing; By the end of the film I felt like I had been sent through the wringer.....The DVD has some of the most clever packaging I've seen in quite some time: It's presented like an infomercial for Sara's favorite TV personality, Tappy Tibbins, played by Christopher MacDonald. There are a lot of extras, and I was particularly happy to see Ellen Burstyn interview Author Hubert Selby, Jr.- it was VERY illuminating.As an unflinching portrait of addiction, Requiem ranks right up there with Trainspotting, and should be required viewing for all High School students thinking of experimenting with drugs.	5.0	Ellen Burstyn Got Ripped Off!	2002-06-23	11	9	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1R60K9D56XYL	Danny Rizzi	"And hands down the best film of 2001. Many GREAT films, and ""Requiem....."" is without a doubt one, are tragedies and viewing them a second time is for some of us not an option. I do agree with the one editorial that this is grim stuff and not easy to sit through. But well worth it all the same.Aronofsky, after the success of ""Pi"", a film I found much more impressive than enjoyable, actually has a cast to work with this time. The acting in ""Pi"" was sub-par, one of the things I didn't like about the film. However, ""Requiem....."" has Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, & Shawn Wayans giving what will surely be the very best performances of their respective careers. Burstyn I've never seen better and her losing the Oscar to Julia Roberts underscores once again how much of a popularity contest those awards are.Bustyn plays Sara Goldfarb, an aging widow starved for companionship and feeling cut-off from her only child, Jared Leto. Her loneliness finds her addicted to television. She fills out an application to be a guest on an infomercial-ish type show and then waits for the call. A call she will never get. In the meantime, in order to look her best on the tube she begins dieting. One scary aspect of the film is how easy it is for her to obtain what is basically speed from her apathetic physician. Before you know it, poor Sara Goldfarb is a total speed freak. At the same time, her son & his girlfriend along with the sons best friend, descend into harrowing addictions to heroin. In this superb film all of the characters are three-dimensional....they live & breathe. The film also makes the obvious but no less impactful statement that drug addiction cuts across all boundaries of the economic stratum. You will not soon forget some of the images of the characters going through withdrawal. Aronofsky is relentless during this part of the film and I think the editorial that describes the film as ""a relentless sensory assault"" cannot be any more perfect a description.  There are two harrowing scenes with Jennifer Connelly's character showing where her addiction has taken her.  I think it's important to mention that there is some comic relief in the form of Goldfarbs neighborhood friends.(it was especially nice to see Louise Lasser again) And Thank God for the humor or else I don't know if I could take it. If Aronofsky's ""Pi"" had some of the off-hand humor of ""Requiem...."" it may have been more successful.So if your tastes lean more toward challenging, thought-provoking outside-the-mainstream fare, and you aren't especially squeamish ""Requiem....."" is a viewing experience you won't soon forget. Like I said, this is powerful stuff and I wouldn't suggest viewing it alone. I did and found it hard to shake the disturbing images and depressing outcome for all of the characters. As a matter of fact, as I write this I can still see Burstyn's Goldfarb going through her withdrawals. Creepy. Lastly, if you decide you want to view this film do yourself a favor and be sure to rent the directors cut. The impact of a film this powerful can only be diluted by cutting and censoring."	5.0	The Best Anti-Drug Film Ever Made!	2003-05-23	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A36QD7SW0Y7DPS	Danny Scruton	One word described the way I felt after viewing this movie---finally.  Finally, someone had the guts to make a depressing movie, that will leave the viewer sad yet satisfied.  Finally, someone made a movie without using a lot of special effects, but still told a story with innovative and unique camera techniques (not to mention a horrific yet capturing soundtrack).  This someone mentioned is Darren Aronofsky, and I believe that he is one of the best new directors in film today.  I love both of his movies (Pi being the other, don't miss that one either), and I am looking forward to his new project with Brad Pitt.Back to the subject at hand, Requiem for a Dream is a great movie with very believable characters played magnificently by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, and Marlon Wayans.  The simple plot is magnified by the camera work and acting.  This movie is a must see.  Go out and watch it now....heck watch it twice.	5.0	Finally	2001-09-17	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3PF2NF7LX3CAB	"Dan Seitz ""cinnatusc"""	The original novel by Hubert Selby Jr. was saved from cliche by the immediacy of Selby's writing and Selby's own style.  It also touched on the fact that everyone is addicted to something, that nobody lacks a jones for something, be it heroin, alcohol, television, friendship or simple hope. The movie isn't cliche thanks to a stunning ensemble of performances and Darren Aronofsky's direction.On the surface, it sounds like every &quot;my drug hell&quot; movie ever made, insofar as Harry Goldfarb, his girl Marion, and his buddy Tyrone are concerned.  What makes it work is that the script (by Selby and Aronofsky) introduces us to the characters, lets us get to know them, actually get to like them.  As their lives decline, you're THERE.  You see it, you feel it all.But the plotline of Harry's mother, Sara, is in a class by itself.  Done by Ellen Burstyn, it's a truly astounding piece of work.  Sara starts on a downward spiral when she's given a simple piece of hope.  It's truly horrible to watch.All of this is helped along by a truly stunning score by Clint Mansell, who scored Aronofsky's first film (also an excellent work) &quot;Pi.&quot;  Mansell, with the help of the Kronos Quartet, proves he's going to be a powerful force in film scoring.Don't be turned off by the NC-17 rating, or think this is inappropriate for teenagers because of it, this, along with &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, is the best filmed argument not to use drugs ever made.

Not only is the plot deeply shocking and fascinating, the cinematography is spectacular, with rich colours and sparely (but effectively) used CGI to emphasise the drug hallucinations. However the thing I liked most about this movie that really ""clicked"" with me was its repetitive image sequences. It had a strangely hypnotic effect and also tied in SO well with the drug theme. Every time one of the characters hit up, so was the audience hit up with a visually interesting image sequence which repeated throughout the movie. One interesting point to note is from memory, a drug injection was only shown once in 'real life'. The rest of the times, the image sequence was shown. I liked this because although the movie did not avoid the unpleasantness of drugs (far from it), it did not gratuitously sicken the audience by directly showing the shooting up all the time."	5.0	The best movie I have ever seen	2001-05-13	0	0	0

No, correction: let's take a stroll down the big broad generous boardwalk of Coney Island, down past the Carousel of Dying Dreams, pausing a moment to stare at the Ferris Wheel of Decay and Death and Dissolution.No. Don't stare. Darron Aronofsky's sophomore effort, ""Requiem for a Dream"", is a subversive instrument. It should be regulated by the secret police. It is a vicious sucker punch to the unprepared, unsuspecting kidney masquerading as an anti-drug flick. Be warned, this godawful thing has teeth. You will cry. You will blanch. Your face, virtuous, untainted by human sin (relatively, in our Relative World), will get all white and taut. You will get sick at your stomach. You might puke.OK, there; disclaimers out of the way. Ma Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn, amazing, truly, descended from Heaven with a fiery sword of Truth, I sh*t thee not) is a pudgy, rugose widow who dreams of getting on the game show she watches with cultic fervor. She lives in Brooklyn. She's aging, bored, flabby, tired. She is Hungry.Her son Harry Goldfarb (the incomparable Jared Leto): living on the fringe in Brooklyn, hooking up with his needle-romancing friends on the fringes of a decaying Coney Island. Harry wants to be rich. He wants to fly. He wants to do the funky chicken dance only unrestricted ""H"" can bring about. He dreams of the big score. He wants to buy Ma Goldfarb a huge-a**ed Tee-Vee, where she can watch Gameshows Valhalla-style. He is Hungry.Oh, but there's more: Dreams are like that. Like wars, they have dictionaries of casualties. There is an infinite supply of fresh, warm-blooded young meat for the grinder. Shall we continue? We shall. There's Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans, redeeming himself), who imagines himself to be a better man---for his own life, for his progeny---than he is. He wants a quick, fast, fat, profitable score. Who can blame him? Who wants to eat catfood in retirement? Hungry.But now, we can't forget Marion Silver (the astonishingly gorgeous Jennifer Connelly). Can we? We cannot. She is gorgeous. Her skin pulses with life. She is a rebel. She doesn't care. Ah, but she does. Youth cares, yes it does, for maybe it doesn't know of old age, but it can feel the thing's stinking corpse-breath. So yeah, Marion will deal---but she'd prefer not to. Which is why she goes along with Harry Goldfarb's ""score"". Hungry? Yup.Half of the horror is watching a field of roses go up in a napalm strike: in that spirit, I won't spoil anything for you. Well, other than to say this: Love, as some sage once observed, is the most furiously dangerous trap of all. Darren Aronofsky has set horror to celluloid: the horror of a billion lives of quiet, and noisy, desperation. Be afraid: be very afraid.JSG"	5.0	When I put a Spike into my Vein	2005-10-06	15	11	4

This coaster ride of addiction is a one way ride to hell and you have a front row seat.Although the outcomes of the addictions are the same, I like the general contrast between the young people using the street drugs and the older Ellen Burstyn hooked on her more ""socially acceptable"" diet pills (which are portrayed as nothing more than a legal form of speed because ""the Docta prescribed them!"").Kronos Quartet with their hypnotic fusion of classical, jazz tinged compositions add immensly to the sensory experience of this movie.

The movie's point will hit you hard, whether you want it to or not.That aside, this movie is hell. To call it intense is the greatest understatement. The director creates for the audience four friends. We get to know them, we feel bad for them, we want for them to be happy and succeed. And then before our very eyes, he throws them into a hellish meat-grinder of emotional and physical destruction and violation, and drags the audience down right along with them.

Before watching this movie be warned that it is ultimately very depressing with shocking graphic imagery.The story revolves around young New Yorker Harry and the most important people in his life - his Mother, girlfriend and best friend. Whilst Harry, his girlfriend and best friend are addicted to drugs as a choice of escaping from their lives, his Mother is addicted through medication prescribed by 'health professionals' and because of this, it is the saddest story of all. Whilst for a short time the drugs increase the success of their lives, they soon fall into a downward spiral, though at no time does the film become preachy.The film depicts drug taking as a fast-edited series of shots that works brilliantly. The downfall of the characters produce some of the most realistically harrowing scenes I've seen on film, especially those featuring the girlfriend.

If you watch it a second time, you'll know the happenings much better; therefore, you'll understand it better.  The director has a unique style of expression which is seen most with how he expresses the characters' drug use.  He probably did this to show us the gruesome realities of their behavior.  It worked.  This is one of the most daring films released in a long time.  It graphicly explores what many others wouldn't dare: drug use, weight issues, prostitution, etc.  Ellen Burstyn performs in the Oscar nominated role of her career as an ethedryl and television addict.  Jennifer Connelly was dissed for many major awards for her role as a prostitute, as was the movie in whole.  Marlon Wayons marvelously shows his serious side of acting rather than his usual comedy.  Jared Leto portrays a drug addict and trafficker in the best acting role of his career.  &quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; may not be for those who are sensitive to such graphic material.

The degree to which the emotion is evoked should be the primary gauge.  Oh boy does Requiem for a Dream succeed in doing so.  Never have I had my mood so extremely affected by a piece of art.  Such intense emotional reactions are ordinarily reserved for real life personal tragedies.  Sure I would've of basked in the euphoria of a happy ending, but in turn I'd have been deprived of a purely visceral experience that only a once-in-a-lifetime movie can deliver...this happens to be that one in my lifetime.	5.0	Love it or hate it, you won't forget it	2007-04-23	8	7	1

Granted, the majority of the population would find this harrowing film offputting, however, because drugs and addiction are so woven into the framework of our society it is important that this film be seen by as many people as possible.  When the film started, I didn't no where it was going.  Once it established it's rhythm, detailing the high highs and low lows of chemical dependency this film takes hold of you and doesn't let go.  Credit for this has to go to director Darren Aronofsky who establishes himself as a new and creative force in film-making.  It seems like this film was made a long time ago and I eagerly await viewing his next project(that said, I wasn't too partial to ""PI"").  The ensemble acting in this film is superb.  Jennifer Connelly is a stand-out as a heroine addict who ultimately succumbs to the worse kind of degradation to support her habit.  The ultimate praise, however, is reserved for Ellen Burstyn.  She not only gives a great performance but an acting performance for the ages.  Her character breaks your heart from start to finish.  The movie begins with her enabling her heroine addict son by allowing him to steal her beloved TV and ends with her being subjected to drug-treatment for becoming adicted to amphetamines because she wanted to look good for the all-important TV.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Writer/director Darren Aronofsky's (with co-writer Hubert Selby, Jr., based on his novel) harrowing film is a study of addiction in all its forms-not just addiction to drugs, but also to television, dreams, fame, sugar, and sex.  Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple buddies who hustle drugs and get high together; they even manage to set money aside and feel like they are making successes of themselves in their own way.  They discover how precarious their position really is when the supply of drugs in their area dries up and they are forced to go on the road to find more.  Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is Harry's beautiful girlfriend, who squanders money from her wealthy family while she feeds her addiction and dreams of opening a boutique with Harry's help.  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's nave mother, whose belief that she will appear on an infomercial leads her into an addiction to diet pills in an effort to lose weight.Each of these characters is sustained by a dream that enables them to use drugs, believing that it is a temporary stage on their way to a brighter future.  By the end of the film, all of their dreams have been cruelly but unavoidably crushed and the characters themselves have spiraled into their separate lonely hells.  It's not easy to watch because the talented cast invests their characters with much compassion.Don't see this film if you are one of those people who believes that all movies should make us feel good.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A36L1F0YECOAW8	David Grant	Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to his acclaimed indie debut 'Pi' is an expertly made nightmare, chronically the lives of four characters, woven together through addiction and tragedy. It does not sugar-coat it's subject matter. It is brutally frank in it's depiction of drug use and the ultimate physical, mental, and emotional deterioration that comes from losing control of one's own life to drugs. Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman whose husband has passed away and whose son, Harry (Jared Leto), only comes to visit when he needs to take her television set down to the pawn shop for drug money. She is addicted to television and sugar, eating chocolates while watching her game shows, day in and day out. She receives a junk phone call one day, a call that misleads her into thinking that she is going to be a contestent on one of these shows. She is ecstatic. She will wear her red dress, the one she wore to her son's high school graduation. The problem is, she no longer fits into it. So she tries a diet, but her need for sweets is too great and chooses diet pills instead. Harry spends his days with Tyrone (a straight and wonderful Marlon Wayans) who is the man with the connections, and his nights with Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his girlfriend. Each of these three characters is already addicted to drugs, not one in particular, rather anything to keep them feeling right. Harry and Tyrone devise a scheme by which they will become dealers, insuring the constant income of money and the possible score of something really, really good. Aronofsky's technique is brilliant, using every cinematic trick in the book to fully realize the effects of the drugs they're shooting, snorting, smoking, or swallowing. Over and under-saturated colors, quick jump cuts, overexaggerated sounds, slow motion, fast motion, steady cam, split screen... everything blazes by in a strange hallucinatory way when the characters are using. Everything seems skewed but yet right. When they come down, the film's look seems to slow down with them and the illusion fades. The world becomes dank again, becomes dull and hefty, the weight of normal life is felt. The film is not a happy story, the characters go from bad to very, very bad to beyond rescue by it's finale. Each character ends up where they should and not because we want them to. Each character is a tragedy, they are glimpses of lost dreams, abandoned hopes, failed promises, and needless depressions. By the film's end we feel sorry for them, not because they were addicted to drugs and suffered the consequences of them. But rather we for the fact that they even shot up in the first place. What a waste of life. 'Requiem For A Dream' is a masterpiece of cinematic direction and is a tough, unflinching film. It should be watched by parents with their teenage children. It's probably the best deterrent to drug use that exists right now. A cautionary tale that is both heartfelt and heart breaking. One of the best films of 2000.	5.0	Briliant, powerful filmmaking.	2001-05-02	18	14	4

But I've read two separate reviews (apparently quite helpful to folks) lamenting the R-rated editing of the movie.  Problem is, while one review was written for the regular version (rated R), another impassioned review was written for this Director's Cut (unrated = NC17?).  Is this cut indeed the version seen in theaters, or is this one step down from the theatrical release (the R version being two steps down)?  Could someone clarify this?

This film is beyond comparison, and puts a great twist on the way we view many people.  It takes the &quot;put yourself in the other person's shoes&quot; to a whole knew level.  Not many videos leave me feeling with a tingling sensation after I'm done watching them, but this one definently did just that.  This movie ranks up in my top three movies of all time, along with Starwars, and Matrix.  I continue to watch it over and over again, learning more about the characters as I go along each time.  I don't know how else to put it, but this movie is beyond many editor's grasp.  If you like to listen to other people's opinions, and you would buy a movie or not buy it based on what others think of it, and not what you do, then don't even consider buying this video.  You aren't worthy of it.  If you are to view this video, please do so with a clear mind, free of bias or opinion.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2MQQI4UYT9C11	David Zimmerman	A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke, shoot and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not.	4.0	Love it or Hate it	2006-10-31	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2K4HVJ9NI9IAY	"""davscokno"""	"Starring Ellen Burstyn (Playing by Heart, The Exorcist); Jared Leto (Fight Club, Girl Interrupted); Jennifer Connelly (Pollock, Higher Learning); Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie, Senseless); &amp; Christopher McDonald (The Perfect Storm, Happy Gilmore).I don't even know how to begin to describe this movie.  It's the story of 2 guys who try to start a drug dealing business.  One guy's mother ends up hooked on television and uppers.  Trust me, it makes sense in the film.This movie got one nomination at the Oscars and it went to Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress.  She didn't win and I believe she acted circles around Julia Roberts (who did win).  Burstyn was sensational and more importantly, completely believable.  The Academy screwed up on this one.  They screwed up bad.This could possibly be my favorite movie of the year.  The acting is incredible and the cinematography was just breath taking.  Some of the shots that were chosen actually made me say, ""Now that's a cool angle."" The editing during one of the last sequences was also really impressive.  Do not rent this movie if you want a pick me up.  It's depressing and tough to get through.  However, I can pretty much guarantee you'll be happy you saw it.Things To Look Forward To: Okay, who knew Marlon Wayans could be a serious actor?  He makes a transformation in this movie.  Also, consider this fair warning.  Some of the scenes are graphic.  Not awful, just graphic.Overall Rating: Solid A"	5.0	A WAY TO TELL IF YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE	2001-10-10	1	0	1

The movie is at times a little hard to follow, and watching it more than once, I understood it a little more and was able to catch a lot of things that I did not catch the first time around.  The characters were very well done.  They all tried to remain together in their struggle to make money in the drug world, but all it did was pull them further apart and deeper into addiction.  Whether by accident or on purpose, the drug use and its affects makes a person seriously rethink any thought of taking diet pills or, worse, more addictive and illegal substances.  The soundtrack is equally as chilling, setting a beautiful background to the character's ultimate attachments.  This movies is a thinker, recommended to anyone who wants to have a movie to talk about and recommend to people for months and years to come.

The reason is that it is so intense.  Contrary to most films about drug addiction, this movie utilizes tremendous direction to create a creepy, uncomfortable atmosphere.  After you see this film you won't want to take a tylenol, or drink anything with caffene in it--it's that scary.  The performances all around are rock solid, but the major attraction is definately the direction.  An oft repeated montage that is meant to simulate a high is beyond discrption and the black spot on Jared Leto's arm leave nothing unsaid.

It is clearly a work of art, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to loved ones to see because it is so very devastating and soul-wretching.  Not since Shindler's List and Born on the Fourth of July, have I experienced such a shattering film experience.I felt such empathy for the Ellen Burstyn character!  So naive and such an innocent dream - to appear on her favorite tv show and be able to wear her favorite dress!  The Marlyn Wayans character tugged at my heart, too.  He was clearly a good guy who got caught up in bad things.  The other characters were clearly not evil.  Yet, they all ended up damaged beyond redemption - no happy ending.  Death would have been merciful, yet they were cursed to live.After I saw this movie, I could not sleep for a week, cried at inopportune times, and my family thought I was nutty.  A friend of mine saw this film, also, and every time we discussed it, we were almost in tears.Many of us know characters somewhat like those in the movie.  Such a cautionary tale - if one goes too far, one might not find one's way back.  SUCH a powerful movie, yet I have no desire to see it again.  Once was enough!	5.0	Devastated	2002-02-10	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2FEJIORC1MBG3	D. Hartley	Another overrated entry in the Quickly Becoming Tiresome &quot;junkie chic&quot; genre. A lonely widow (Ellen Burstyn) gets strung out on a &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; regimen of diet and sleeping pills prescibed by her quack physician. Meanwhile, her son (Jared Leto),his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his buddy (Marlon Wayans) are busy destroying thier lives with heroin. And that's our &quot;plot&quot;...Drugs Are Bad (ho-hum). With neither a compelling central narrative nor sympathetic character in sight, be prepared for a VERY long 2 hours. I was roped in by the hype surrounding Burstyn's performance, and while she is excellent as always, this is nowhere near her best work (check out &quot;King Of Marvin Gardens&quot; just for starters). Director Darren Aronofsky appears to be more determined to showcase his own visual technique over performances, so any subtle acting nuances are bludgeoned by annoying camera/editing tricks. There are far too many gross-out scenes (unless your idea of a good time at the movies includes watching beautiful Jennifer Connelly vomit into the camera, or a lingering close-up of a needle spiking into a pus-swollen abcess). The &quot;What...that's IT?!&quot; ending really puts the capper on an alltogether unpleasant movie experience.	2.0	Aronofsky's a genius...just ask him.	2001-12-18	18	8	10
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A34INXBU6J6CCY	D. Heliot	"This is an amazing movie. Sure, when you look at it from afar, you see some flaws - for example, a lot of important plot points flash by very quickly, and one can even say they are glossed over. One example of this is the feud between the Italians and the blacks, which gets a passing mention but is the reason for Harry and co.'s financial problems in the story (they got Tyrone arrested, Harry spent all the money they'd earned getting him out, etc.). However, these problems are minute when compared to the strengths of the film - its sheer power over the viewer, the hauntingly beautiful music, and the top-notch acting and directing.The IMDb entry for this movie has an excellent one-sentence summary of this movie: ""The hopes and dreams of four ambitious people are shattered when their drug addictions begin spiraling out of control."" Because, really, that's what the movie's about. Addiction, whether to drugs or daytime TV or chocolate or what-have-you-not, is the downfall of these characters, and this movie has been made (well, and the book has been written, as well) as a requiem for their dreams.Another thing I love about this movie, and it's just a personal thing, is the relationship between Harry and Marion. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly have incredible chemistry. Not only that, but I like how their relationship had already been established before the movie, so it's not a boy-meets-girl story.

Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connolly, and Marlon Wayans are just brilliant.  I was so engrossed in the story that I was a bit shocked when it was over.  The film's drug use sequences are genius.  They are fast, shocking, and consistent.  This film had the potential to be a bit confusing but the drug use sequences tied everything together beautifully without becomming too graphic.  Jared Leto's performance was stunning.  He goes all out for this film and it makes every painful moment of Harry's life worth watching.  Ellen Burstyn was completely believable considering what a classy lady she seems to be in real life.  This film does not glamorize drug culture and the addictions of every sort are brought to us in all their gritty truth.	5.0	Indie Gold	2007-05-07	5	4	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	The phrase &quot;nerve wracking&quot; earns new meaning with Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem For A Dream,&quot; a complex film that deals with the physical, mental, and emotional consequences of drug use on variously striking levels. Aronofsky handles the material in a heavy manner, throwing all the style, all the sensory imagery, all the bone-chilling sequences he can muster up into the film, giving it such a rush that when the final frame rolls by, it was all I could do heave a sigh of relief. Or was it bewilderment?Undoubtedly, this is one of the best movies to come along in years, relying on a strong, gripping plot to achieve a high note of urgency and importance. It moves at various speeds, from that of a narcotic-induced high, to that of a delusional nightmare, but it never loses its momentum or its tightening grip on its audience.It chronicles the lives of four people, average citizens hoping to make something more out of their dreary lives. Harry Goldfarb wants nothing more than to live a life of happiness and luxury with his girlfriend, Marion. Together with his friend Tyrone, he sells narcotics, reaching a point where he feels nothing can overcome his newfound wealth. The three of them live and interact together in a frenzied, drug-induced euphoria that casts a veil over their lives, one that is as inviting as it is foreboding.Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), is so overcome by her loneliness that she practically goes off the deep end when she receives a call from a game show inviting her to appear on television. She grabs her favorite red dress from the closet, dyes her hair bright red, and goes on dietary drugs to fit into her dress.Thus begins Aronofsky's setup for a final act that becomes more than just a conclusion for the characters, but an awakening for audiences everywhere. When their supplier becomes cut off, Harry and Tyrone become frantic, as does Marion, who is enveloped by her addiction to the point where she is willing to sacrifice her dignity for smack. But it is Sara's downfall that becomes the centrifuge for the film's message: in the beginning, we see her without the drugs, as opposed to the remaining three characters. The movie allows us to follow her in her descent, as she begins to obsess about her weight, popping more pills than she can count until she imagines her refrigerator moving on its own.If you think a moving fridge is nothing to get excited over, you'll reconsider. Aronofsky sets up such scenes with deluded visions and wraparound shots of his actors, casting them as well as us into a whirlwind of mass hysteria that carries us into the very heart of the movie's many dilemmas. He brings to the first two-thirds of the film repetitive cuts of drugs, bloodshot eyes, narcotics and various other paraphernalia, which act as a metaphor for the quick thrills as a result of the use of drugs. As a result, the final act's impact is made that much more engrossing, and a sudden sense of intensity and subtly chilling suspense washes over the entire film, stemming from our wanting to know what will come of the characters as a result of their choices.The cast for &quot;Requiem&quot; also enhances the movie's overall appeal. Leto, Connelly, and Wayans each turn in the performance of their careers, separately portraying different aspects of the effects of drugs. It is Ellen Burstyn, however, who steals the show in a forthright, unrelenting performance that is the highlight of the Best Actress category for 2000. She pulls out all the stops, portraying Sara's fall from grace with a terror that is made all-the-more chilling because of its universal truths.&quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; isn't just a movie: it's a message, one that screams itself into the hearts and minds of any who happen upon it. Aronofsky helms the project with a superiority unmatched by most other films of its kind, evoking a tense, mind-bending journey that is a must for fans of character-driven dramas and those considering the use of illegal substances. By choosing to focus on the personal results of the characters, the movie takes on a whole new meaning, rising out of the depths of its own depravity to become one of the best and most memorable pictures of 2000, as well as all time.	5.0	One of the most powerful films in recent memory.	2001-10-14	0	0	0

When director Darren Aronofsky called ""cut"" and confronted him about it, he realized the reason Libatique had let the camera drift was because he had been crying during the take and fogged up the camera's eyepiece. This was the take used in the final print.There's nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"First of all, I simply wish to say that Ellen Burstyn's performance in this movie was probably the best piece of acting these old eyes have ever seen.  Playing lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, an insecure woman with a loser for a son, Burstyn delivers this role so powerfully and emotionally--particularly as the character succumbs to diet pill addiction--that the viewer is overwhelmed with sadness and compassion.Unfortunately, Sara Goldfarb is the only character worth caring about, as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM tells a parallel story about three heroin addicts.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his best bud Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are hedonistic junkies that only live for their next fix.  Harry is Sara's son, thus the bridge between the two stories.  We're given little or no explanation as to why these three people are strung out on drugs, and when the movie begins, when Harry and Tyrone steal Sara's TV (again) to pawn it for drug money, I said to myself, ""I really don't care what happens to these characters.""Whatever admirable qualities these three people possess are rapidly dissolved in the face of spiraling addiction.  When each one of them ""hits bottom,"" I was unmoved.  Also annoying was Harry ruining his left arm by continuing to shoot heroin into it.  Did it ever occur to him to use his other arm, or other veins of his body?  And what could have been a very interesting side story--Tyrone's fond memories of the closeness he shared with his mother--was never developed.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is as powerful as the pills and smack being consumed, yet director Darren Aronofsky's movie falls short when only one of the four primary characters is salvageable.  For a comprehensive story depicting addiction, I recommend ""Leaving Las Vegas"" instead.--D. Mikels"	3.0	Powerful, But No Sympathy For The Addicts	2003-04-10	40	14	26

Whoever made Ellen Burstyn look THAT MUCH like a basket case should be recognize for his or her outstanding effort. Burstyn was great in her role and was very convincing.  There are far more better drug themed movies than this.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A32ZZ5N8TR2UEZ	"Drake Dorson ""ilwitchgrrl"""	Wow. I just saw Requiem For A Dream for the first time. I don't really know what to say about it. What a stunning film. Gorgeously filmed, beautiful visuals...wholly depressing...crystal clear filmmaking. Excellent performances by the cast. The story almost seems inconsequential somehow (even though it's not)...mostly, I felt like I was was watching a moving painting.Ellen Burstyn's performance as the mother, a lonely widow whose hope of being on TV (so that her loser son and deceased husband would be proud of her) leads to an addiction to diet pills and a severe case of dementia, was one of the finest moments of acting I believe I've ever seen.The film style itself employs a variety of different camera angles, split screens, and some truly beautiful juxtapositions. The scenes become darker, more jagged and frantic, as the movie progresses and the four main characters spiral steadily downward.The music and the sound in this film is also extremely powerful. The popping of pill bottles, the quitly mocking laughter of the empty mailbox...those are the two sounds that really stick out for me. Then the music, the haunting background theme that plays nearly constantly over much of the film, will stick in your mind and haunt you long after the movie has ended.I believe everyone I know that has seen this movie has loved it, and I have to say that despite its disturbing content, I really loved it too. That said, this is definitely one of those films that people will either love or hate...it's really not a middle-ground type of movie. It's truly an example of movies as an art form. As you can see from my first impressions of it there, first viewings of it seem to lend themselves more to the art of the filmmaking itself rather than the actual content of the movie...it was so clear cut that I don't think there's a lot left to 'understand', but at the same time, repeated viewings will likely be necessary just to let it sink in.I resisted watching it for a very long time because no one could tell me why they loved it so much and I had it in my head that it was going to be 'just another of those stupid drug movies'. I understand now why they couldn't explain it, and I only wish I could explain it myself. :) Unfortunately, I think I'm going to fall short of that wish tonight.	5.0	a beautifully tragic film with stunning visuals	2003-09-20	3	1	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A33QWSDGRMW8CV	Dr. Hartmann	"The ultimate junky film....  If you're thinking that heroin (or similar drugs) are recreational, hip, or that you can control your use (abuse responsibly and even make some quick cash, this film might just scare you straight.  All the characters, from the upper class beautiful and talented girl with dreams of being a fashion designer to her gorgeous boyfriend (who just wants to make some money so he can change his life) to his best friend, who actually comes out lucky as he might get some rehab while in jail, begin as good-hearted people.This film truly shows how easy and quickly one can fall from the ""grace"" of occasional chemical euphoria.  The main character's fate is worse than an O.D.  As is his girlfriends downfall from creative, happy, beauty with everything going for her to a life of degradation due to her desire for drugs and fear of getting sick from withdrawals.Recommended for any young person who thinks that he or she has self-control and a ""those things only happen to uneducated, poor folk from the ghetto"" attitude.The only thing that shows that the director or someone has no experience in abuse of heroin is in the artistic editing depicting the injection of opiates (heroin, in this case), the pupils of the guy getting high are shown dialating (getting huge!)  post injection.Heroin, as well as all other opiates, constrict the pupils and cause Pin-point pupils, even in dim light.  In fact, one way doctors can tell if someone is detoxing or withdrawing from high doses of opiates is that their pupils will dilate.  Drugs that dialate pupils are cocaine, some psychedelics, and other compounds that I don't know about.Great Film, very intense, and quite sad.  But....  If you are thinking about experimenting with opiates, this is a must see.  It could save your life."	4.0	&#128137;  Poignant and sad realistic story	2012-09-22	0	0	0

Tille"""	The is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals, families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life.

That is a matter of what criteria you decide to use in making the evaluation. All I am saying is that I disliked it intensely and blame only myself for not finding out the nature of it before viewing. It is the most depressing movie I have seen in many a year, being so very typical of the 'social realist' movies of the past, only with the latitude for showing behavioral patterns once forbidden by the industry's self-censorship mechanisms.

I will stand by that whole-heartedly until someone can tell me why I'm wrong.If not, they're just squeamish.  Requiem is a glimpse of what happens when hope clouds the mind and narrows one's line of sight.  The message of the film, much misinterpretted by the majority of the reviewers on this site, is not blatantly anti-drug.  All four protagonists are driven by dreams, working toward happiness the only way they know how.  None of them stops to think about the means by which they are trying to get there; the ends they desire will justify anything they have to do along the way.  Or will they?Aronofsky's cinematography is fantastic.  His ""hip hop montages"" that string together the parallel plots are aurally and visually refreshing, although semi-reminiscient of Pi's pill-popping sequences.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and deeply moving, most notably the chilling ""Summer Overture"" that begins and ends the film.  Everything about the movie is beautiful.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly pull off their parts superbly.  Hell, Marlon Wayans is surprisingly incredible as Ty, Harry(Leto)'s right hand man.  I can't say enough about the quality of this film.There are scenes that, no matter how often I replay them, strike a chord within me that brings a wave of tears to my eyes.  The emotion is the real star of the story.  Do yourself a favor and watch it.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"...only in slow-motion, with lots of MTV-ish intercutting, speeded-up sequences, and a pulsating soundtrack as the carnage unfolds and the blood splatters the lens.Only here the carnage is not only physical but more unbearably, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and sexual.  In a nutshell: onrushing catastrophes at every level.This is one of those films, in the tradition of ""Breaking the Waves,"" where during the first 10 minutes you see very clearly that the main characters---quite sympathetic, unfortunately---are going to be on a fast-accelerating downhill slide for the rest of the movie.  Unlike similar films that chronicle a steady process of chemical-related self-destruction (""Trainspotting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" come to mind), ""Requiem for a Dream"" will never be accused of ""glamorizing"" or ""romanticizing"" substance abuse.  Director Aranofsky seems to take special pains to capture every excruciating torture and suffering that his protagonists undergo---in fact, he even uses film and sound techniques to amplify it and shove our noses into it.Unfortunately, while the film is fairly bold as art, and probably quite accurate as social documentary, as an aesthetic work it simply is not very enjoyable to watch.  Both ""Trainspotting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" had similarly bleak and hopeless storylines, yet managed to tell those stories in creative and interesting ways, rather than just straight-up, visually-enhanced journalistic docudrama...i.e. both were far more enjoyable because they were much more multi-dimensional, their characters were far better developed and far less predictable.  Leto, Connelly, Wayans, and Burstyn are all talented actors and appealing characters but they are barely developed beyond the black holes of their addictions and compulsions; instead they are presented as basically 4 hopeless and helpless lambs about to be tortured and eaten alive before our eyes in myriad ways.About the only truly original and insightful character drama is that played by Ellen Burstyn, in that we are all too rarely shown the more mainstream addictions that is sadly predominant in American society: food, television, and prescription (diet, in this case) meds.  She was the most interesting of the bunch by far, the other 3 leads are all cardboard characters we've seen a million times before, albeit played by very competent actors.This film could've been far more original, interesting, and insightful if it had simply focused on Burnstyn's character as a case study for mainstream America---lobotomized by TV, living isolated miserable lives in a dysfunctional community and culture, bloated by junk food used as pleasure substitutes, getting their fixes from the local pharmacy.Three stars for visual/aural stimulation but shallow and cliched storyline."	3.0	Like watching a train wreck...	2004-11-10	13	12	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AJQDDDILUGP07	el dangeroso	"Much like Darren Aronofsky's first film, Pi, Requiem deals with humanities extreme obsessions and addictions and the inevitably dire consequences on the soul suffered through self inflicted damage. Unlike that quite good first feature, Requiem is quite a dissapointment. Often choosing style over content, Aronofsky has put forth an MTV worthy pastiche of quick clips and throbbing 21st century music to depict a nightmarish world of drug abuse with time honored plot cliches firmly intact. Starring such notables as ""that guy from In Living Color, and that guy from My So Called Life,"" Requiem is perhaps the most freakishly exaggerated account of drug abuse since the infamous public service film ""Reefer Madness."" At one point a senior citizen imagines her refrigerator trying to eat her and later recieves electric shock treatment to cure her obvious insanity, all because of an addiction to doctor prescribed diet pills. Last I knew, diet pills were not hallucinogenics. Aronofsky's like that weird guy who keeps telling you the story of his friend who took too much acid and is in a hospital thinking he's a glass of orange juice and can't move or else he'll spill, even though you know it's not true. Perhaps the only difference is that Aronofsky takes two hours to tell the story. Just once I would like to see a film about drug addiction where the characters are worth caring about,where there's no blaring techno music or artsy clips of floating .... Darren Aronofsky may still go on to make some outstanding features, but stay away from this one."	2.0	Requiem For A Wasted 102 Minutes	2001-08-11	9	5	4

Reviewers below do the movie an extreme disservice by comparing it to popcorn flicks like ""Half-Baked."" At risk of sounding elitist, this movie is a work of art, and you must be patient with it in order to get meaning out of it.""Requiem for a Dream"" has been cast, deservedly, as a drug movie. But ""Requiem for a Dream"" goes beyond that. It follows the stories of four people forgotten by society: an old woman condemned to a 'home' whose son has abandoned her (Ellen Burstyn in probably one of the most powerful on-screen roles I've ever seen); her son (Jared Leto) and his heroin-addict girlfriend (Jennifer Connely), and their 'associate' (a hilarious performance by Marlon Wayans).All of them have their dreams - the mother's is to be young and trim again, and to see her son married and successful. Marlon's is to be with his own mother, Jared's is to forever frolick with Jennifer. The short term goal of the three of them is to score some dope, make a bunch of money in order to score more dope...it's a vicious cycle. They live out their dreams through the drugs, at least for a while.Ellen's character, meanwhile, as resorted to getting prescription pills from a doctor in order to help her loose weight - as she thinks she going to be on Tappy Tibbons' motivationalshow (the only thing she does to pass the time is watch television). She becomes addicted to them; as they are methamphetamines. And she, too, lives out her dream through the drugs - in her hallucinations, she sees Harry (Jared's character)a successful, married man and herself as the young and sexy woman she probably once was.That's enough of a backstory to get a feel for the film, to go on would be to ruin the ending, which I won't do. Needless to say movie ends in complete catastrophe - this is a requiem.We find that drugs exist in more than just the forms defined by society. In this movie, television is a drug, and everytime we see a doctor, they're just propping up the system, and are completely devoid of compassion.This movie is a damning criticism of society for allowing, and even encouraging people to turn to the quick fix, to the drug. Television 'inspirationalists' and crooked doctors are the quiet, under-the-radar dealers of our society, and no dealer that I've met is compassionate. We have collectively sold our soals to the devil, and the devil is ourselves.This story wouldn't be nearly as remarkable as it is without the film's truly astounding visuals. Liberal use of splitscreen gets us inside two different characters heads at the same time. The cuts are quick; the dream sequences are truly terrifying. Lots of other little goodies are going to make you go 'woah,' which I won't ruin for you.Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet provide an extremely fitting score for the film - of electronica and real strings. He also worked with him on Pi.This film is also a treat for Brooklynites - I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the familiar sites of the Coney Island boardwalk on screen.Tappy Tibbons' inspirational CDs are $39.99 - last I checked, this DVD, chock full of special features, are only $8.97, one of the truly great bargains on this site. You owe it to yourself to own this film.Be warned however: this movie is rated NC-17 for a reason. A minor, yet important portion of the movie has a gratuitous stripper/sex section. That said, use your own discretion when you show this to others, and don't deny yourself this film based soley on a couple of seconds of hardcore sex."	5.0	Powerful commentary on our society.	2005-12-10	9	7	2

I never knew that movies could be used in such a way. Not to mention that the story is very compelling, albeit very dark.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2YVDU8LD3SOOL	ellie	So I went to see this movie not expecting much of anything at all.  And I left the theater in awe- on the verge of seriously damaged, introspective and with much to think about. Not only was this film asthetically breathtaking, it was one that made you question a lot.  It pains me to hear it passed off as &quot;just another one of those 'drug movies'&quot; because it  was so much more than that.  It was a commentary on The American Dream.  The dream that has been glamorized in this society, was bashed and proven self-destructive and unrealistic in under three hours.  Yes, addiction did play a major role in this film but so did the idea that life is giving rather than getting (to loosely borrow the phrase from Selby) And it was the characters obsession with recieval that led to their downfall.  Asthetically- the movie was mesmerizing, haunting, addictive... the colors, the angles, the music- every frame a beautiful picture (in the begining anyways).  Basically, it saturated me and invaded my thoughts (even still, months after the fact)  And thus my need to purge my feelings on this amazing film.	5.0	Raw... its purely raw	2001-06-28	4	3	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3EGA74EANFW7G	Emanuel Goldstein	This would have to be the sickest most depressing movie I have ever seen.  A movie supposedly to show the dark side of drugs, instead it shows the dark side of life: a life without hope, or purpose full of dissapointment and illusion.  There is never any reason to make a movie of this nature nor is there to watch it unless you want to witness a merciless destruction of hope and the human sprit.  This movie will leave you depressed and wondering what would ever inspire a sicotic producer to produce such a film.	1.0	a sick depressing movie	2001-06-04	23	9	14

And yet, I really can't see myself buying the DVD or even renting it.  One trip through this nightmare was more than enough.  This movie is utterly depressing.  Forget happiness - this movie doesn't give a single one of its protagonists even a glimmer of a reflection of a sliver of hope.  You would think that would be obvious about halfway through it, but it's so well done that you keep on hoping something good will happen to at least one of the heroes.  But it just gets worse and worse.  The acting is superb all around, especially Ellen Burstyn's parts.  And the drug sequences are amazing.  Instead of trying to show what the characters are seeing, a la Trainspotting and Fear and Loathing (both great movies, no slight intended...), in Requiem we see more of a &quot;thematic&quot; drug influence.  The trips are coolly shot and exhilarating, but they're over quickly and after the second time we start to see how monotonous they are.  And of course, each time it's a little further down the spiral.  Like I said, I couldn't watch this again.  But it is, IMHO, the best movie made in at least two years.	5.0	Best Film, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress.....	2001-02-05	8	7	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2KYQAKDQJSFIR	EnchantedHeart	"Requiem:  Generally speaking, a musical composition honoring the dead; more specially (1) the Roman Catholic Mass for the dead, or (2) other commemorative pieces of analogous intent.I keep reading reviews where people say that teenagers should HAVE to see this film because it portrays the true hell that drugs will lead you in to.  However, I disagree.  While hellish looking for most, it also at times seems pretty much like a fantasy.  Even when Marion is brought to her knees (literally) to do the most disgusting things possible in order to get her drugs, she still has a smile on her face. Teenagers with their illusions of immortality may see themselves as ""smarter"" than the characters portrayed in this film and able to avoid the pitfalls better than Harry, Marion and Tyrone did.  I'd use caution before I showed this movie to teenagers as a way of ""scaring them straight"".Ellen Burstyn, gives one of the best performances I have probably ever seen, as Sara Goldfarb.  She is a true innocent victim, of her son, and her own hope.  Watching her lose her mind when all she wanted to was lose 50 pounds was really heartbreaking.  It would be easy to dismiss her as just a nutty, needy old lady and with Burstyn's performance, you can't.My problem with the film (and this might be a spoiler) is when Harry and Tyrone end up in prison.  The circumstances leading up to that going to a hospital just don't make any sense.  But that may just be the pedantic lawyer in me, because these two were headed for prison one way or another."	3.0	Song for the almost dead	2008-04-19	2	2	0

I left it feeling empty, disgusted, scared, depressed, but  grateful to be clean. It is the most real film about addiction. This is the film they should show in high schools. The cinematography is awsome, the score is unreal, and the actors couldn't have done better if it were nonfiction. I can't tell you how unbelievably good this film is. The day it comes out on DVD I plan to see it again. The soundtrack is also one of the best CDs I've bought in a long time. Arinofsky shows every form of addiction food, drugs, lifestyles, sex, money, gambling and even TV. The progression of the disease is shown not only by story line but the movie's quickening pace. The score gets more and more disturbing as well. Definitly buy both the DVD and the Soundtrack/ Score.	5.0	This is THE BEST movie I have ever seen	2000-12-08	5	3	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	This has got to be one of the most powerful (and most visually disturbing) movies to have ever come out of the 2000's. It's more than just a film; it's a piece of reality. Dreams are formed, desired, and shattered (hence the title of the film). It's a stunning piece of work, and a depressing one. Those who have weak stomachs (or had just had a rough day on the job) should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. I personally wasn't depressed by it, but I did care for the characters as they force themselves to make some very bad decisions in life (I'm not going to give the ending away, I promise). All of the actors (especially Ellen Burstyn) are terrific; they are perfectly cast for their roles, and nothing affects their performances. Director Darren Aronofsky has done splendidly with this one. He knows how to create a hardcore drama with his use of quick shots and lighting. All in all, this is a powerful film, and it deserves the high praise that it's continuously receiving as of today. Congratulations to Aronofsky, the cast, and the crew.Grade: A	5.0	Reality is harsh.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1CXKC1WVX9OLE	Eric Wilkinson	Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is an extraordinarily brilliant film, tied for the top three films I've seen in my near 900 film/18 year existence (Magnolia, Wonderland are the other two). This film could be another drug movie, lacking any originality (I personally love drug movies, but there's a chance for repetition every time). It's not. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is the brilliant sophomore (though not sophomoric) film from &quot;Pi&quot; director Darren Aronofsky, an up and coming writer-director from the Sundance Generation headed for a great career. It concerns the painful metamorphosis of two fledgling drug dealers and a clothing designer (one of their girlfriends) into full-on heroin addicts. Meanwhile, the mom of the one with the girlfriend is becoming addicted to TV and diet pills, convinced she'll be on a game show soon (a mean prank). These people have dreams. Leto and Wayans want to be on easy street, and Leto plans to take girlfriend Connelly (hugely underrated) with him to easy street, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Burstyn (in an Oscar nominated, and deserving performance) is Leto's mom, trying desperately to get through every day life till her one and only hope for salvation comes and she lets it fly by. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a painful film, brilliantly edited, gorgeously photographed in color by &quot;Pi&quot; cinematographer Matthew Libatique, and beautifully but horrifyingly composed musically by the Kronos Quartet and Curt Mansell. The result, thanks to visual brilliance by Aronofsky, is one of the three best films I've ever seen in my short but movie-filled life. The adaptation is harsh but strangely beautiful from that notorious Hubert Selby,Jr. novel of the 70s, scripted by Aronofsky and Selby themselves. The acting is very good. Leto and Wayans break their own rules and prove slightly different sides to their seemingly one dimensional abilities do exist. Jennifer Connelly, good in last year's other great film &quot;Pollock&quot; and 1998's &quot;Dark City&quot;, really comes across brutally honest and brutally tragic in this movie, at one point doing something only the most dedicated actress in art films could be expected to do. She was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female. Burstyn gives her all in the Independent Spirt/Golden Globe/Oscar nominated performance as Leto's mom, a pill popping TV addict who can't take a hint, resulting in horrible tragedy. This film is painful, brutal, difficult to watch, unbelievably enrapturing, darkly funny and brilliantly and gorgeously made. It's the best film of 2000, one of the three best films of all time. One can only hope it gets the notice it deserves. Nominated for Best Feature, Cinematography, Director, Female Lead and Supporting Female at the IFP/West Independent Spirit Awards of 2001. One word, to sum this artful masterwork up? Amazing.	5.0	REQUIEM FOR A DREAM: What, no infinety star rating?	2001-03-16	19	15	4
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A6VS2DC7YFQOE	Erik	I cry about twice a year on average, and I cried through most of this film.From the hard first scene to the despairing end, this movie is the most depressing and one of the best movies I have ever seen.The film focuses on two inter-related stories involving four main characters and follows them from their initial hopes and dreams to the horrible, despairing end that awaits all four of them.One of the characters, Mrs. Goldfarb, eventually becomes insane through her use of diet pills which stemmed from her obsession with appearing fit and trim on a tv show.  Her son, Harry, in an attempt to go somewhere with his and his girlfiend's life, gets the not-so-brilliant idea of becoming a drug-dealer, and his friend Tyrone also helps out in this scheme.Harry's girlfriend, Marion, is an addict and when Harry can't provide drugs for her, she turns to prostitution.  Harry and Tyrone both end up in nightmarish ends, but Marion's end is far worse.The music is amazing and the cinematography is stunning as the movie grabs you and brutally forces you into this nightmarish plunge.Caution though, if you are planning to watch the director's cut, watch out for the graphic group and lesbian sex scene.  It caught me off guard, but the scene is necessary to grasp just how far Marion had fallen and just how horrible it is what she is doing to herself.This is a very disturbing and depressing movie, but it is also very powerful and will change the way you view addicts and prostitutes.  It will impact you.	5.0	Emotionally Ravaging	2002-10-31	1	0	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1CF3HY24VVWJP	Erik Pack	This is not an enjoyable film. But a flawlessly effective one. The charachters are so believable. Especially Ellen Burstyn, who is at the top of her game. Things just keep getting worse for the charachters through the movie, and it's almost unbearable too watch. Jennifer Conelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans are all dead on perfect in their portrayals of these drifting souls. All they need is a fix...and they'll do whatever they have too to get one. This movie is undoubtedely disturbing, and one the most powerful of the year (that it was made). The amazing thing about the film is that it's not preachy, it's just telling a story. A story where all hope is gone, and the charachters can only dream of a better place.	5.0	The downward spiral	2002-08-08	3	2	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A17F2UX5A83NN4	Ethan Prague	"Calling this movie a ""mindblowing masterpiece"" would be a little bit of an understatement... As has already been stated, this movie is a no-holds barred view of the hellish world of drug addiction, staggeringly portrayed by the 4 main actors, and provocatively and innovatively executed by Arronofsky. After seeing Pi and having my faith in the cinema completely renewed, I couldn't wait to see this film. Suffice it to say, it left me perfectly breathless, touched in that very deep, special way that only certain films can do. . . Yadda yadda yadda. And yet, it's so one-sided, and it's nothing if not propaganda. Any movie is somewhat fictitious, even those that have grounds in true events, but conceptually, this movie only succeeds in further espousing the DARE scare tactics that we've all come to know and love (or loathe, if yr like me), which is basically that all drugs are bad, and anyone who uses them, for whatever reason, is eventually doomed to a life of pain beyond comprehension. *That's* dissapointing, and what's more, it's not real. While on the one hand, I do think this is a must see for anyone considering using hardcore drugs, (because they are dangerous, duh), I also think that it is important to view it within the framework of all the other information that's been written about them, and not get all mushy over this movie's tragedy. Because it is really an awesome film, one just wishes the message were as up to date as it purports to be."	5.0	Incredible film... nevertheless, propaganda	2002-07-28	2	0	2

But a movie that can change how you feel, or perceive the world, is what makes it a great movie. Each of the characters all had their sad back story. Ellen Burstyn gets to be on television, and goes into diet pills. She gave one of the most heartfelt acting I've ever seen. Jered Leto plays Harry, her son, a heroin addict and dealer. Even Jennifer Connelly, playing Marlon, Harry's girlfriend, gave a convincing story of being a*Slight spoiler alert stop reading here*hooker just to get money for drugs. and Harry's friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) had a backstory, though not as nervewrecking as the others, of his mother. The movie sadly didn't get me too deep into it. (Specially since he was thinking about her right before sex?)*Spoiler stops*This movie is also known for its soundtrack. It's annoyingly epic overused soundtrack of all time. If you're here just to see where this infamous soundtrack originated from, leave, or get ready for the intense depiction of drug addition(s), nudity and graphic sex.	5.0	The best movie I will never watch again.	2013-12-01	1	0	1

I love how this movie spirals down with increasing intensity like a runaway locomotive. Aronofsky is a true visionary. This movie was not suppossed to make you feel good. I am glad there are not more movies of this nature. This film should be seriously shown to all high school kids so they can obtain a realistic perspective on the spector of drugs.

I just can't do it myself...For those who honestly loved the movie, I can understand.  I just can't see so many people honestly enjoying something so disturbing.I usually love movies where you are left feeling uneasy, left almost feeling afraid of the world.  That uncomforable feeling at the end of a movie is what, in my opinion, makes some films so great.  See Happiness.  See In The Company of Men.  See a lot of other films.  Just don't see this one.The problem with this movie wasn't the actors.  The performances that were given were truely special.  On that level, I did like the movie.  I most especially enjoyed Ellen Burstyn, who does an amazing job with her character.  She gives a character without much to say some incredible depth, and you are left feeling her pain.  The direction of the film was very slick.  The drug scenes were at the very least interesting.  I've never shot up, and after watching this film, I can promise you I never will.My problem with the film is that you aren't just left feeling uncomfortable at the end of the film.  You are dragged through it by your hair - over hot coals, and shards of glass.  It gives you that truely uncomfortable feeling throughout, and by the end you are truely happy that it is over, and left wondering why you didn't turn it off earlier.  You feel, throughout the movie, as if you were doing the drugs with the characters.  The story doesn't make all that much sense after a while, and the film tends to just drag on, so as to make you suffer with them.A truely painful experience.	2.0	What can I say?	2002-01-08	4	3	1

That is their goal, and they are on their way but when they get a little too big, in their naivete encounter some ultraviolent competitors who deal the boys a serious setback.At the same time that this is going on in the young peoples' existence, Hal's mother Sarah, a widow, has a dream of appearing on an infomercial TV show wearing her red dress and becoming a celebrity (which is shown in flash forwards) but she'll have to slim down a lot, and she finally turns to diet pills. Ironically, her son warns her that she is becoming addicted.Meanwhile once more, Harold's girlfriend, the lovely Marion, turns to prostitution at private parties as a means to get her hands on the drugs that she has become addicted to and are in very short supply, just like the scenario in that finest of drug- addiction movies &#34;Panic in Needle Park&#34;, c1973 ish.Harold and Ty set out for Florida to find a drug supply, hoping to sniff out a source, sight unseen, as last resort. But Hal has gotten blood poisoning from all the injections and Ty has to try to get medical attention for his friend.

Requiem goes much deeper than people abusing drugs, it shows how dependent people can become on objects that give them gratification and it shows how far people will go to accomplish their goals. It really takes you info the lives of the characters and puts you in their shoes. I would highly suggest that everyone see this movie at least once... it is truly one of a kind and powerful.	5.0	The best movie I have ever seen	2003-12-24	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1P4GB5IBJ6O1K	"Gabby Hayze ""Mo Addams"""	Sara Goldfarb could be anyone's widowed mother. Harry Goldfarb and Tyrone could be anyone's sons. Marion could be the gorgeous girlfriend any mother would be thrilled to have her son bring home for dinner. Sara doesn't feel needed by anyone anymore. She's got her seating position among the women of her building who like to take in the sun in the afternoon, and she's got her television programs to which she is addicted. Her one goal is to appear on television in her red dress to make her friends and her family proud. Her son, Harry, just wants to make some money so he can live the life to which he has yet to become accustomed but knows he wants. If he and Tyrone can score that one big buy of drugs and sell them, they can be rich and live easy lives. Marion depends on the kindness of men to ease her way through life. In Harry she believes she's found her source of love, livelihood, and drugs. All four of these people want what everyone wants - to be loved, to be needed, and to be successful. Only for these four it all goes horribly wrong because, in their need, they accept addiction as part of the dream.This movie is difficult to watch, but not because it isn't well done. I can't think of a movie that's done better than this one. It's just so horribly painful to watch people who have all the best intentions sink deeper and deeper into self-destruction. Louise Lasser plays Sara Goldfarb's best friend. She is the embodiment of the fact that people only see what they want to see, even when a friend, a close friend like Sara, become hopelessly troubled and essentially become someone else completely.Requiem For A Dream is about drug addiction, but it is also about people leading quiet lives of desperation and the lengths to which they will go to try to grab the gold ring and realize their dreams. All of the actors in this movie are superb, and Ellen Burstyn should have won an Academy Award for the work she did in this movie. She is nothing less than outstanding. But credit should also be given to the way in which the movie was filmed. When Sara becomes paranoid, the camera helps you to feel the paranoid feelings she's experiencing. When Tyrone runs away from a shooting, the camera makes you feel his fear and his pounding heart as he flees. When Marion shows up at the door of a man who will give her drugs in return for whatever favors he requires, your skin crawls along with hers as she does whatever it takes to get her fix.  And there's another element to this film that affected me as I watched it. The music. It is an excellent addition to every scene with it's accompanying emotion.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes not only a good story well told, but also enjoys the separate elements that make a movie take hold of you and, in spite of difficult material, won't let you go until it's finished with you.	5.0	Riveting Masterpiece	2002-09-17	4	3	1

After playing Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn didn't need to hold the Oscar to actually knew she deserved it. Jennifer Connelly, one of her best performances (even better than A Beautiful Mind's). Jared Leto shows us he does act, and and he does it great!Darren Aronosfky's direction was superb! The way he decided to picture a reality a lot of people live is just amazing. Editing was also great!I saw the movie in the theater, and I remember the room was completely crowded (mostly by annoying teenagers who were chattering too much). As soon as the movie started, somebody pressed Mute in the theater. It completely caught our senses and full attention. No teenager said a word as the movie went on. And when it ended, everyone of us just decided to stayed on our seats for a couple of minutes, like if we were waiting for someone to bring us back to our reality.I didn't hesitate when I saw the DVD, I just took it and buy it. I have to say I haven't had the nerve to play it again. I just wanted to own one of the best movies I've ever seen (even though I still don't know if I want to see it again).You won't be forgiven if you miss this movie, but if you decide to see it a second time... dude, there might be something wrong with your mind!Watch it, Rent it, Buy it, Enjoy it (if you can say so)	5.0	The most disturbing + amazing movie I've ever seen!	2002-05-15	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3SOKVFUWBC31N	garlandb	Why was 'Requiem for a Dream' the best movie of last year ?  The cast is definitely one of the reasons.  Marlon Wayans, while not a tear jerking dramatic performance he showcases a side not often scene in films like 'Scary Movie' which he is better known for.  Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto have incredible chemistry as the central couple who create several unforgettable moments.  Sean Guilette (star of Aronofsky's 'Pi') creates an incredibly evil character in only a few minutes on the screen.  Last but surely not least Ellen Burstyn's role as Sarah Goldfarb.  If ANY ROLE has ever deserved an Oscar that is it.  The scene when she's telling her son about her lonely life and she's in between smiles and tears is one of the most powerful moments I've ever seen on screen.  The second ingredient is the script written by Aronofsky and literary great Hubert Selby JR.  Narratively the film never stumbles or comes close to letting the viewer down.  The third thing that makes this film rise so high above the endless sea of cinema is Aronofsky's unforgettable visual style.  His patented &quot;hip-hop montages&quot; give the film a fast, edgy contemporary feel.  Also anyone who could breath new life into split screen is a god in my books.  The time lapse shots, the subtle use of cgi, the fish eye, and that indelible montage scene at the end.  Aronofsky  seems to have an appreciation for every aspect of film making (script, cast, score, sound, editing, mise-en-sc&eacute;ne, etc.) that few other directors have.  It's this very reason that Requiem for a Dream is so damn good.	5.0	unquestionably the best director working right now	2001-07-11	11	9	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3A42AANH85ZTF	Gary Wise	This film was filmed with maximum 'point of view' style. You are dragged into the story, almost interactively. The sound design effectively punctuates the story; fresh, loud &amp; manipulative, yet judicious in frequency. Aronofsky pushes the limits of the experience well into the discomfort 'red' zone, yet there is still one foot firmly on the floor. Not only does the film have a great 'look', but also the DVD has great bonus materials besides commentaries and 'Making-Of' sections. The opening menu is the most creative I have seen to date! A lot of entertainment for the money.	5.0	A very involving movie	2001-06-29	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A367Q9VRWQZG7W	Gavin B.	"I read all of the member reviews for ""Requiem"" and there is little to add in way of praise for this astonishing film. It is ashamed that this ""Requiem"" got lost in the shuffle of drug films, last year. It is a far better film than the cooly detached ""Traffic"" or the inane ""Blow"". This should be the last film made on the subject of drug addiction...there is really nothing more to say. Aronofsky has made a film that captures the paradoxical pleasure/pain principle of addiction. The axiom of ""Requiem"" is this: All of us stand dangerously near the threshold of self-consumption. The monkey is waiting to jump on your back everywhere you go: the doctor's office, the liquor store, behind the Wall Mart, the playground, or the beach. As we watch friends and family spiral out of control, we realize that this could be OUR family, OUR friends; all of us.The entire cast of the film was daring, and took chances with tainting their images by portraying such nakedly vunerable characters. These were roles that many actors would take a pass on, because of the emotional toll that a film like this demands on the human psyche. It is reavealing that Hollywood chose Julia Roberts, their own ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"", over outsider Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress. Ms. Burstyn is a fearless and consumate actress and she will be remembered for this role...and twenty years from now ""Requiem"" will be remembered as THE drug film."	5.0	Weighing In On Requiem	2002-02-05	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	"Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch ""Trainspotting"", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as ""Requiem For A Dream"", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.Grade: D+PS This is 500 reviews.

It has its weak points: The editing is far too choppy; you get the feeling that you're not seeing nearly enough of Ellen Burstyn's superb performance. But it succeeds in what the real goal of film is, in powerfully communicating a message to the viewer.The film is about addiction, not just to drugs, though that is the most obvious sort here, but to anything - to love and to hope. The characters make plans, they have relationships, they do their best, and they fail. The film is about their decline. It is not a happy film; it's probably the most depressing I've ever seen. But it is for that very reason that it is great. By the end you feel everything that the characters feel. It's terrible, terrible. But that is what filmmaking is about, the same as any other art: Communicating a message to the viewer. At that, the film is wonderful. I recommend it highly.	4.0	Powerful	2002-04-16	0	0	0

The story of four people searching for acceptance and love, while trying to pursue their ""dreams"". This may look feasible at first in the midst of the sunny summer season. But we quickly see their addictions have them headed for disaster. The seasons of Fall and Winter shows us how their downward spiral is accelerated with each of these seasonal changes, and that there will not be a ""spring renewal"" for any of them. It shows us that even when Harry and Marion are ""together"" they really aren't with the genius use of split screen. The montage sequences (camera work and editing)are brilliant, the musical score is tragically poignant. All of the  performances are incredibly human, and heartfelt. The films final half hour is a tour de force in filmmaking and unlike anything you've ever seen in a film before !! This is a film that will be with you days after seeing it, and you will never forget it.

It is about the desperation to hold on to a dream of happiness, even when, in reality, there is no hope.This, as well as the film Pi, is a very good example of how films should be made.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1ZS82R4RC0I2N	gonn1000	One of the most surprising and enticing movies of the last years, this cult classic (yes, it`s a modern classic already) presents a superb and unforgettable perspective about the nature of addiction (not just drugs).Darren Aronofsky delivers some cutting-edge moments here, managing to offer terrific camera-angles with a powerful, fluid photography and an urban, hypnotic soundtrack. He`s one of the most promising directors around, resembling David Fincher, Chris Nolan or Richard Kelly due to his videoclip-like cinematography.The plot focuses the lives of four alienated and lonely individuals whose experiences with addiction lead them to a downward spiral, generating a couple of astonishing and surreal scenes. &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was one of the essential movies of the nineties, as it delivered a new perspective on drugs and its effects, but &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is equally impressive, creative and original, presenting multiple memorable moments worth rewatching.Its non-linear structure may be confusing at parts, some characters are not fully developed and the overall tone of the film is way too depressing (even a bit pretentious), still &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; shines as a respectable and strong achievement nonetheless.This is independent filmaking at its best, a rich and multi-layered cinematic experience that doesn`t disappoint.Highly Recommended.	4.0	A Dream...or a Nightmare??	2004-06-12	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	APJOR3LQLQBIC	Gordon Bombay	The movie does a great job at showing how a few decisions separate failure from success in a risky business that was compounded with many other factors that young adults face. The movie was well cast and helped make the movie believable.  Poor insight regarding cohesion of quick success was greatly compounded throughout the movie.  The movie has a similar tie to the movie Pi, by the same director, regarding how the use of substances add unexpected circumstances in regards to the outcome of the movie. It was a great watch.

All of those adjectives would seem like a redlight to NOT view this film, but the brilliance of this creation by Darren Aronofsky after Hubert Selby, Jr.'s book does what few films do - it makes a gut-wrenching learning experience.  From the hardcore heroin addiction to the even more terrifying addiction to doctor-prescribed ""medication"" drugs we are shown the gamut of how cruel this disease of addiction is to the victi's body, to loved ones, to the world.  The performances by each of the cast members are superb - Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans - and the supporting cast (especially the elderly friends of Burstyn's 'Sara')is very strong. But is is the directorial decision to use split screen techniques, rapid motion repetions of popping pills or preparing to shoot up and the middle-of-the-target musical score tha makes this film alomost unbearably real.

It is brilliantly revealing and gritty.  Holding nothing back, and giving no leeway to the squeemish.  Ellen Burstyn is spectacular, but Leto is the one who really lights up the screen like few have ever done.This film is permanantly branded in my brain.  After I saw it for the first time, I was literally numb.  My body felt empty and ailing.  The films effects are almost hypnotic and are gauranteed to leave you nothing short of stunned.  It will literally take your breath away, and might just make you a bit sick.  It is a film the no one who watches it can possibly forget.  If I ever see a more powerful film than 'Requiem' so long as I live, I will truly be shocked.	5.0	The most powerful fim ever made!  My all-time favorite!	2005-02-26	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1X28NWPDMTDG7	Gregg Hillier	"""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of those Indie films that people will either love or hate - there is very little middle ground. Maybe that's one reason why it usually works - it never falls victimn to Political Correctness or outrage - it cruises along almost like a documentary. The four addicts played by Ellen Burstyn (diet pills), Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans (heroin) are like failures from the show ""Intervention."" Leto, who would wreck his career with ""Alexander"" a couple years later, is quite good and Connelly, who nearly stole ""A Beautiful Mind"" from Russell Crowe is hauntingly effective and real. Ms. Burstyn is a marvel: her sad,lonely Brighton Beach widow left with nothing but a dream of game-show stardom is an amazing performance. Her Oscar nomination was richly deserved - she has received Oscar nods in 4 different decades - a feat that only Bette Davis and Meryl Streep have also achieved. But ""Requiem"" is a jarring and often ugly film that dectracts from its allure. This film is a serious downer - don't watch if you are having a rough day"	3.0	Outstanding Performances in a Twisted, Dizzying Film	2006-11-25	5	5	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"Well, I guess Amazon's Jeff Shannon would call me a masochist, because I did watch this film two nights in a row. Of all the recent drug-themed movies (""Blow,"" ""Traffic,"" ""Jesus' Son""), this is probably the most powerful. It is also the most adventurous cinematically, as well as being the most effectively cautionary of all these cautionary tales.Several viewers below noted how stunned they were by the cinematography, the editing and the top-notch acting. I certainly had expected a well-acted film--the cast alone would suggest that. Ellen Burstyn's has garnered a good deal of well-deserved acclaim. And I knew that Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans were up and coming young actors--who basically needed a plum role or two to really jump start their careers. Well, they certainly got a chance to strut their collective stuff in this release, and I hope they're able to capitalize on the film's artistic success.But I have to admit, I was unprepared for the film's powerful contemporary feel. The old fashioned 50s style title (evocative of such films as ""Hatful of Rain"" and the ""The Man With the Golden Arm"") had me fooled. The startling camera work, the jump editing, the stark soundtrack (courtesy of the Kronos Quartet) were anything but old fashioned. In lesser hands, it might have risked cliche --but director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby Jr. have all avoided the trap of sheer avant-garderie by emphasizing the human element over mere style. A haunting, ultimately devastating film."	4.0	"This ""Requiem"" is a Heavyweight!"	2002-01-24	4	3	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3DUFMYW4GZK34	Greg White	"There are only few film directors that I have faith in all the time... Amongst them are David Fincher, Steven Soderbergh, Oliver Stone, Michael Bay, P.T. Anderson, and now Darren Aronofsky.  The film is superbly directed in every aspect, and, the actors don't miss a step either.I've read dozens of reviews on the film, and it exceeded my expectations.  I thought ""Traffic"" was bad, well, this makes ""Traffic"" seem like an episode of Full House.  When I say ""Traffic"" is bad, I don't mean a bad movie, I mean bad like showing what it's really like.  I loved ""Traffic"", and it opened up my eyes to a lot, but ""Requiem For a Dream"" scared me beyond being scared.  Although the film isn't primarily a drug film, it's still got quite a bit to do with drugs.  Not a drug film means it doesn't neccessarily mean it's specifically about DRUGS(like heroin, or speed).  Darren Aronofsky stated that it shows how anything can be a drug, T.V. dope, hope, or even love.  Stealing a page from EW, I must say that this film DOES INDEED need to be shown in every high school to EVERY student(I'm a froshman, soon to be Sophmore), and EVERY film school class in the world.  Half the time I didn't know whether to be scared from what just happened, or in awe of the cinematography.  Pretty much both.  The film deserves multiple viewings, just to take in the different aspects.Jared Leto superbly portrays Harry.  I liked seeing him in a bigger role, since my only REAL exposure to him is ""American Psycho""(Hilarious), and ""Fight Club"".  Ellen Burstyn's performance can't be explained with words, that's how frightening she becomes.  Marlon Wayans proves he CAN act outside of a comedic-environment, and I respect him much more because of it.  Jennifer Connely doesn't slack any either.This DVD is a must for everyone.  The menus even got me excited, and there's tons of supplementals.  Among them: Making of(35 min. long), Anatomy of a Scene(6 min.), Deleted Scenes,and commentary tracks.I can't say enough that this movie was worse than I expected.  It was great, but really scared me.  When I read about the scene where Ellen Burstyn has hallucinations of her refrigerator attacking her, I laughed... It's no laughing matter.  If your a high school teacher, and your reading this : SHOW THIS TO YOUR STUDENTS!!  I DONT CARE WHAT YOU TEACH!  Everyone else, just watch it at least twice; once for the story, the second for the magnificent directing.  Kudos to Aronofsky."	5.0	Restored my faith in Film... Again	2001-05-23	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.  Thanks, Darren...	3.0	After the visceral impact fades, there's little to sustain the film...	2008-07-24	4	0	4

Visceral, intense, not for the faint of facing the sad underside of life. Ellen Burstyn's performance was the best I have ever seen concerning the subject matter, her story is particulary tragic since she simply was chasing the imagined perception of escaping loneliness via a false promise to recapture her youth.Jared Leto's portayal of empty and wasted youth was sorrowfully stated, as was his girlfriend's (Jennifer Connelly) and his pal (Marlon Wayans).Not an uplifting feel good movie to put it mildy.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ODE0UW7UMS6B	Gunshot Glitter	The emotional impact of this film solely relies on how true these characters are conveyed (from the actors' and director's point of view). The rated version does take away just a little from the director's vision but the acting will always create a disturbing, foreboding feeling. Yes, the DVD version is the unrated version. No, there is not a great difference between the R and Un-Rated versions. I just like the DVD better because of the image quality and (most notably) the sound. When Sara starts to hallucinate that the fridge is alive the sound coming from the fridge slowly creeps in front and behind you until the two sounds crash together to create a claustrophobic sting.The DVD has a Kaufman-esque intro where Tappy Tibbons is interviewing people for his JUICE product and it makes your TV look like it has a static signal(my friend actually thought my VEGA was messed up). The elevator music translation of the summer theme for the chapter index is hilarious. So is the test signal screen for the visual setup. The deleted scenes are just crazy split screens. I believe the 6 split screen involving the faces of Harry, Marion, and Tyrone while the three other splits fixiate on their &quot;fixes&quot; was the most effective.DVD is just ten times better for all the little humurous touches to lighten the feel for those who have already seen it. It also creates a misconception for those who haven't which is totally cool. BUY THE DAMN DVD! But don't be ashamed if you have the edited version because you still get the same atmosphere and message.	5.0	Not a great difference between R and Un-Rated version.	2001-06-05	0	0	0

Basically it's the story of what drugs can do to people, the dark side of it. The acting is excellent, and Ellen Burstyn was amazing to the point of being scary. The other actors did a fine job too, and the photography really complemented everything. As I watched, I became more emotionally involved with the characters than I usually do in movies, and I really started to feel depressed, and even sick by the end of it all. Probably the worst thing is knowing that there really are people out there in these situations, going through hell for just those few moments of pleasure.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A37DLVPKJZGSQF	Hannibal	Requiem for a Dream is a revelation. While it is by far the most disturbing film of 2000, this movie is thought provoking, intelligent, true-to-life and utterly convincing. I can promise you right now this is a movie you&#65533;re not going to forget in a while and a movie that is unlike any other drug movie ever put to the silver screen. Requiem for a Dream is so graphic with its violence, adult themes, drug taking and sex it may become a little too much for some people. I was frankly almost sick. So if you&#65533;re a faint-hearted person I recommend skipping this movie and maybe seeing the equally good The Basketball Diaries. Okay, back to the film. It is one of the best movies of 2000 and has a unique power. As soon as this movie was over I just wanted to go back and see it again. It&#65533;s official &#65533; this is the first movie in history than really properly portrays how heroin and speed and every other drug can dislocate us from ourselves. This movie has been classified as drama but it is really a horror film. It is so realistic, true-to-life and graphic about drugs and how they effect our lives that I was utterly terrified. I will never ever take drugs after seeing Requiem for a Dream and if I ever feel the need to I&#65533;ll watch the movie and forget all about it. The performances in this movie are absolutely breathtaking. Marlon Wayans is a star and Jennifer Connelly is shocking and great as a girl who will do anything to get something to smoke. Jared Leto is unequally fantastic and by far the best young actor in this gripping movie. However, it is not a surprise that Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance. She is truly terrifying, believable and masterful as Sarah, who is using a dangerous diet and just wants to be on television. This movie has many memorable and terrifying scenes but I will not ruin it for you. All in all, Requiem for a Dream is a master-work of absolute terror, drama and drugs, a haunting film that will make you think twice about ever looking at another dangerous substance.NOTE: Requiem for a Dream: Drector's Cut that is even more disturbing and graphic than the cut version. Director's Cut is even better than the movie itself and has alot of good features and new scenes. I highly recommend people who enjoyed the movie to buy the Director's Cut version.	5.0	One of the best films of all time.	2001-10-05	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2I83K9THSPNJ5	Hannibal	I first read 'Requiem' my freshman year of college. Until I saw this movie, I did not think anyone could ever do it justice. Despite what critics say, this movie is not about heroin. It is not 'Trainspotting.' This movie is about love in all of its forms-- love of the living, love of the lost, and love of substance. It shows just how quickly want can turn to need and up can flip to down. Ellen Burstyn (Yes, the mommy from 'Exorcist.')is phenomenal, delivering an Oscar-worthy performance. Marlon Wayans proves equally impressive, shedding his 'Marlon Brothers' and 'Scary Movie' personas to play his part with a talent and beauty few actors still possess. This tale, tragic as anything Shakespeare ever created, will make your eyes water, your heart ache and your hand cover your mouth. But your head will not turn. Spine-tingling and gut-wrenching as this film may be, you will not be able to move away from its quality. The tragedy of this film, however, will never compare to the lack of recognition it will receive at the Oscars.	5.0	Great Book; Better Movie	2001-01-24	23	20	3

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A156CGSLV7U3IQ	Hassan R. Saleh	Few films, outside of documentaries, focus on the perils of addiction; Requiem for a Dream is one of those few. Being such a film, realize that addiction is a depressing matter, and the film does not shy away from that.With that in mind, Requiem for a Dream in the simplest terms keeps it real. Showing you multiple facets of addiction, and the associated consequences. The movie expounds on the lives of each character to a point you find yourself rooting for them both as a hero and caring for them as you would for an addict you call a friend. When treatment is warranted you want to yell at them to get it, and when they are on the cusp of getting their fix, but yet being stopped you root for them to accomplish that goal.Simply put, if you enjoy films that creates real characters while avoiding the trap of romanticizing lifestyles we are unfamiliar with, then you'll likely enjoy this.	5.0	Honest depiction	2014-01-28	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2OEYBWWF9LG0A	H-Dogg	First off, let me say that Aronofsky is a talented director. He employs an impressive arsenal of camera shots, and he uses sound in interesting ways. These devices, however, aren't enough to conceal what is essentially a weak, flimsy story. I'll refrain from giving a synopsis, suffice it to say that the movie contains two narratives, both of which are propelled by causal relationships between events-- there are no twists, nor do the parallel stories ever really intersect. The action is very linear: the mother character wishes to lose weight, starts taking speed pills, is ruined. The youngsters use drugs, attempt to run a lucrative drug business, fail, are ruined. A leads to B. I think the attempt here is try to attribute causes to the story's developments. We're to believe that media has something to do with Burstyn's desires-- or is the television spot a means for her to regain the attention formerly given to her by her husband and son? It's hard to figure how these themes converge and what message the director is trying to instill.One reviewer here interprets the film as a discourse on the ways people, numbed by the trappings of modern living, try to find meaning and feeling in their lives. Agreed, but there was another film in the past few years, Fight Club, that did a better job with that material. Aronofsky attempts to heighten the dramatic impact of mundane scenes with an intense, driven violin score. Again, this was done better, in my opinion, by another recent film, Anderson's Magnolia, which, granted, had better scenes and a more intricate plot to work with.The upsides: great acting all around. The biggest surprise was Marlon Wayans, who peremptorily dispels any notion that he's only capable of second-rate, sophmoric schtick acting.In sum, Aronofsky is a talented director with a sense of scene and visual cunning. He's sure to do well in the future, though I think this film missed the mark.PS-- I refuse to moralize about the movie. I didn't find anything nihilistic or gratuitous about it, and I think that drug use is a completely valid topic for a film, despite the entreaties of fellow reviewers. My only question is: did anyone else find this film's perspective on the medical establishment totally over the top? (Ellen B's character being force-fed, ECTed; *not* sedated and fed IV; initially prescribed speed pills by a seemingly aloof, disinterested doctor; Leto's character being discharged from the hospital to prison before his arm's healed...)	3.0	Creative cinematography, weak story	2001-12-17	5	4	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3Q3YCT2GKNRQP	Heather Herr	"The scariest movie I have ever seen involves no ghosts nor zombies, psycho killers nor mutant spiders. Instead, it tells the story of four confident individuals connected by friendship, love, and family who all share a common goal - to finally make their biggest dreams come true. For some that dream is to obtain a ""pound of pure"", while for another it is to appear on television. The film follows each character and their whimsical reveries as their lives, both present and future, are overtaken by a whirlwind of drug addiction.Requiem For a Dream, from director Darren Afronofsky and writer Hubert Selby Jr., is one of the finest examples of cinematography I have seen, unmatchable in its concept and delivery. Unlike many movies adapted from novels, it does not fail to portray the story effectively. Instead, with its captivating score from Clint Mansell, including the stunning ""Lux Aeterna"", it introduces another dimension not available in the book. The music is as much a part of the movie as the story itself. When the pictures fade, the melodies replay themselves over and over, tearing into your heart note by note.The cast certainly does not disappoint either. Actress Ellen Burstyn performs an outstanding job in her role of Sara Goldfarb, the TV addict who lives to eat and praise her son Harry. Burstyn becomes entirely immersed in her part as she delves into the horrifying realm of addiction and loss. Along on her journey are lovers Harry and Marion (Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely) and their close friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Despite being an unusual role for these less experienced actors, they too do a superb job of transforming into their specific parts.This film is no mere 100 minutes of entertainment. The plot is far from enjoyable and is rather slow at times. Nevertheless, it is a captivating, nightmarish tale executed with mastery. Requiem For a Dream is an exceptional example of the powers of film - the ability to express a sense of reality unlike any other art form. As you experience this story, it is impossible not to sympathize with one character after another. You witness their lives slowly shatter while they are torn apart from the people they love. It is a movie you beg to end, but are too hypnotized to stop yourself.The most sickening, yet powerful part of this film is that what you see is no fantasy. The horrors of this tale are far from fiction. Even if it is not apparent in your life, it is in the world around you. The purpose of Requiem For a Dream is just that - a wake up call reminding people of the fragility of life, love, and the human mind.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2IX2P42AS6ZGO	--	Like many others, I was amazed by Aronofsky's debut, &quot;Pi&quot;, and had heard much about about this highly-revered film before finally checking it out.We all know the story by now...starting with the characters dabbling in substances with good (naive) intentions, starting to lose control, and finally being pulled down the spiral and losing much more than they initially thought they ever would.Going into this being the jaded film obsessive I'd like to consider myself, the movie actually did grab me and hold my attention from the start. Most of the camera tricks, although a bit MTV-ish as the director himself alludes to, are really interesting and are in fact grounded within the confines of the storyline. The ritual of ingestion gets very repetitive, but that's the point.A few things did bother me.. Some of the execution of the story and the camera-work seemed a bit cute... in a way, &quot;Pi&quot; seems to be more developed as far as distinctive atmosphere then RFAD. This is a minor complaint though, because as I said, the plot does keep one's attention. And all traces of cuteness are forgotten as the inescapable consequences of the characters' actions take on more and more gravity. The pacing is very well done. The downward slope goes from slight to sharp very quickly, leading to a frenzied jump-edit climax where everything forms a tornado of despair, and the viewer is left thinking, &quot;Something like this would never happen&quot;, but it would, and it does.As far as emotional resonance with the characters, the most harrowing to watch would more than likely be Sara Goldbaum (as seems to be the almost unanimous opinion). The younger characters at least have some idea of what they're getting themselves into, but Sara starts out so innocent with her foray into pills (with the mindset that the doctor gave them to her..what could the harm be?). She then ends up addicted, with her mind deteriorating until she's only a shell...housing a jumbled mess of disconnected scattered thoughts and perceptions. The others don't end up in positions any better, for the record, and human fallability and frailty has seldom been better documented.The power this film has is that it causes one to mull over their own decisions and consider whether they've been wise... Life can be beautiful, but it's all too easy to destroy it, no matter how invincible we think we are.Hopefully we'll all see this before it's too late.	5.0	Yeah, yeah...another review to add to the heap...	2002-07-22	0	0	0

Unlike movies like Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, where Drug use is glamorized, this film is the grim reality of it.  It was a great touch to have the mother addicted to legal diet pills and show the side effects.  Arronofsky has definately improved his technique since his debut film Pi. Personally, this was the best picture I saw for 2000. Julia Roberts might have done a good job, but I doubt she could have played the part Ellen Burstyn did. Excellent job. This film is not for the faint of heart or people who don't appreciate good cinema.  I look forward to the next outing by this up and coming auteur.	5.0	Don't Do Drugs	2001-05-22	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1HZ82QCA8Z92P	Hubert Vigilla	Adapted from the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (who co-wrote the screenplay), Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a descent into utter despair, a journey through the unfulfilled dreams of four characters whose lives are driven by drugs. It is a haunting, heartbreaking look at the dark side of addictions and is my personal pick for the best film of 2000. The story centers around Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), all of whose lives are driven by addictions: Harry and Tyrone are junkies, Marion is a coke addict, and Sara, persuaded to loose weight for a possible TV appearance, is hooked on diet pills. The film begins by showing each of these characters' dreams nearing fulfillment. Just when it seems that happiness is attainable, all of the characters' lives spiral out of control until they hit rock bottom. All of the performances are stellar, particularly Wayans and Burstyn. Wayans took me completely by suprise showing that he can actually act and act well. Yet it is Burstyn who stands miles above the rest. Her portrayal of the lonely, pathetic yet well-meaning Sara is incredible. It was Sara whom I felt most sorry for of this entire tragic quartet. Burstyn deserves an award for this role (and that is fact, not opinion). Aronofsky's direction makes this film a visceral, kinetic experience. His use of split-screens, fast cuts, and the infamous snorri-cam give this film an intense, addictive feel. The film's 20-minute-montage-from-hell finale is a blistering, disturbing combination of Aronofsky's quick paced flash coupled with the impeccably agonizing performances by the cast. All of this is punctuated by the Clint Mansell score performed by The Kronos Quartet, music which is fittingly somber and dirge-like. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is powerful cinema that can truly be called a work of art, a haunting nightmare that can rightfully be called beautiful.	5.0	A Beautiful Nightmare	2001-02-01	36	32	4

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A10KKIJ3TE8Y8Y	"""iamthethinman"""	Review #99 for this DVD and it came out 2 days ago.  I guess it goes to show you how emotional this movie makes people and how fanatical people become after watching it.  To comment on the movie, it's probably the most depressing modern movie made.  Visually and aurally, it uses every displaced technique to draw you into everyone's downfall.  The symbolism is deep and the mood even deeper.  A dark tale that no one walks away happy from.  And a masterpiece at that - for it's unrelenting fervor in beating your feelings into a bloddy mess.  I recommend this movie because it is do depressing.  It's a feeling that movies don't have anymore - and it doesn't sell out for anything.  Great performances by all and anyone who see's this movie and thinks that Julia Roberts deserved her Oscar is insane or lying to themselves.  I think any of her current boyfriends would even agree.As for the DVD, it's menu format is ingenius.  Confusion is the key here as your hope for a healthier life is put to the test.  A great play on the movie's inspirational speaker equipped with phone number and barker, not to mention low grade filming and an autographed photo of Tappy himself.  Fight the static to get to great extras like Ms. Burstyn interviewing Mr. Selby, a short feature, and outtakes including a hilarious one of Marlon Wayans playing a scene as his character, then Jar Jar Binks, then his character all in succession that proves he's a good actor, or at least the best of the Wayans.  The making of featurette could have been better, but it's still a good extra.  And seeing what was cut show that the filmakers knew when too much style was just to much.The movie is one made for DVD, like Fight Club.  It has a schizophrenic edit that has a myriad of cuts that will make you want to freeze and frame advance.  It's sound effects a bizarre and high sound quality is necessary for fearing the fridge.  From the colors to the motion speed, this movie is DVD necessary.  And the director's commentary helps show that everyone felt for this movie and that great film making is everything plus a little more thought than needed.  He defends everything about the film and gives credit where due.  Even his commentary on violence in movies helps understand where he wanted his film to be.A perfect buy for anyone.  And probably better to watch at home incase you get too squemish and need to stop to catch your breath - which may happen a lot.  This film must be seen at lease once by all, just because of it's anti-addiction feel.Enjoy feeling down - Thanks.	5.0	A DVD to Dwell on/A DVD to Marvel at	2001-05-24	12	11	1

For anyone interested in film, history or technique, this movie is required material. following up on PI, Aronofsky utilizes extremely heavy stylization that identifies his whole oeuvre. I won't bother with a synopsis, since you can find that elsewhere and that's not what the film is about anyway. In addition to actually pioneering new techniques in his films, including a camera actually mounted on the actor for reverse-POV shots, which i have subsequently seen used in other films. Few filmmakers can so poignantly convey the experience of a migraine headache as Mr. Aronofsky and watching the movie can be a draining experience, which is a testament to the director's skill since that was obviously his intention. It's also really cool just to look at."	5.0	It's like you're really experiencing addiction!	2007-01-31	7	5	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2B0XO8BTPRX7R	Ian Vance	I originally viewed `Requiem for a Dream' on the first day of its run at the Dobie Theater in Austin, Texas, mid November 2000. At this date I was on the last leg of a two-month road trip through the United States, having in that time witnessed the autumnal changing of colors through the eastern seaboard and experienced the political uproar of what eventually became this country's first (documented) coup de etat.  I also had several encounters with drug users and drug dealers over the course of the journey. Trying to relax before beginning the last fifteen hundred miles home,  I decided to take in a movie I knew very little about other than what I'd seen on the Moby-scored trailer and a few laurels tossed by various newspaper critics, those articles skimmed so as not to ruin any surprises the movie might have in store.I staggered out of the theater two hours later, exhilarated and exhausted and physically nauseated by this grim tale of broken illusions and abuse. Those of the audience around me displayed similar reactions: wide-eyed, pale in places, struggling to find the words...words that could not adequately express what we had seen and endured. For me, `Requiem for a Dream' was the climax of my journey, a travelogue full of encounters with drugs and the people that use them...well, the first rush of a climax, anyway, for the prostitute/junkie/schizophrenic I picked up hitchhiking a few hours later was just as harrowing an experience as this movie, in a very similar way: I saw the end result of Jennifer Connely's character ranting and raving and attempting sexual innuendos right before my jaded eyes.This is not a pleasant movie. Nor is it one to be watched again and again, despite the superb cinematography and the incredible acting chops displayed by nearly all involved. But it is a movie that should be viewed by everyone at least once. Love it or hate it, the power of `Requiem for a Dream' cannot be denied. It sucks you in with hopes and dreams and beautiful illusions, then methodically crushes them one by one. The last scene, a frantic montage of images, documents the depravity in which abusers submit themselves and the physically/emotional/mental cost of synthetic pleasure; it strips away the Calvin Klien glamour of herion and shows this narcotic for what it is: the refinement of misery.In my opinion this movie should become mandatory curriculum for high school drug-education classes.	5.0	The Agony of the Ecstasy	2001-08-29	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AQVPAA0D9LH1L	Introitus	"First, before I start anything, I want to say that when I first heard about film, somewhat a year ago, I didn't think much of it. The only distinguishing thing about this movie was it's theme song, Lux Aeterna. Other than the chilling piece, I didn't know what to expect.This movie is incredible. Not action/horror movie incredible, but emotionally. You see a portrait of the tattered lives of the four principle characters, their aspirations, their addiction to reaching their dreams, which in turn leads them down the road of drugs. Their lives move from alright to bad to worse in such a short timespan, you just can't help feeling sorry for them. You'd have to be emotionally void to not feel a thing for them.Even the three acts are symbolic. The film starts in the Summer, which is the brightest part of the year, full of fun and laughter and unargueably the highest point for in the movie for each of them. Then, there is a transition to Fall, as the world starts to die. Leaves fall off branches, trees wither, and their lives are changed deeper into their self-dug pits. They still have the chance to turn back the clock, but they don't. Finally, there is Winter. Their lives have eroded, just as the earth itself. It's cold, and lonely and dark, and they can't go back. All of this shows in the last ten minutes, as their stories reach their horrible, yet inevitable climax.""Where is Spring?"" some might ask. Spring is a time of rebirth, of starting over. In this calamity, Spring has no place. There is no hushed voices. There is no happy ending. By the end, you just want to scream in sorrow and agony at the outcome. Yet for all the pain, nothing will change.To me, this is one of the best, most dramatic movies out there, right up with Donnie Darko and Broken Saints for greatest movie of all time. Take heed, though. This movie is not for the casual viewer or the faint of heart and should be avoided if you can't stomach graphicallt intense scenes. For those who can, this is one movie you can never forget."	5.0	This will open your eyes,,,	2006-07-29	6	5	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A19JYLHD94K94D	Itamar Katz	Darren Aronofsky, it seems to me, is on his way to be one of the best, most influential directors of the 21st century. His work on Requiem For A Dream, like on Pi, is absolutely stunning, with brilliant use of experimental photography and editing techniques, short, thematically repeating shots (also used in Pi) and the original split-screen techenique. The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR. I can only imagine what this must be like in a huge, dark theatre. The harshness of the scenes and the fast, video-clip pace of the movie make it a very difficult, but very rewarding, experience.The seemingly complicated plot covers for a very simple idea. The story (This time adapted from a novel, the story for Pi was written by Aronofsky himself and was much more complicated and original) revolves around four main characters, and tells their four individual tales, with the common elements of addiction, illusion and their consequences. This idea, though, is materialized wonderfully, and makes for a very, very powerful movie. All four characters - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his friend and drug-dealing partner Tyron (Marlon Wayans), are remarkably well-developed, and each one is a full, real human being. Praise should go to Aronofsky but also to all four wonderful actors, especially Burstyn who did a really remarkable job as the TV junkie jewish mother.The movie is shocking, difficult, painful. You'll feel like your brain is being torn out and cut into little bits. But it's worth every minute. Do NOT rent this out for good light entertainment, but watch it, and eagerly wonder what Darren Aronofsky has in store for us next. I know I am.	5.0	Breathtaking	2002-01-22	1	1	0

Sure enough, I saw it for the first (and only) time several months ago. You can tell it's a completely different movie the second the DVD screen comes up. As for the movie itself...holy, holy cow. I think most of us would not want to see it again. Is it good? Yes, it is. Is it too good? Yes. And that's exactly why most of us would say no to a second viewing...It's brutal, nightmarish and very, very real. Darren Aronofsky has pushed us to the limits of what is acceptable in movies and what crosses the line. Because it's unrated, it serves as a well-deserved warning to the general public. Some people probably won't be able to see it through to the end because it's so extreme. My mother couldn't. But even though it's extreme, it still remains a very realistic demonstration of the mechanics of addiction, volatile hope and complete destruction. I have to agree with Jeff Shannon on this movie when he says here on the product page, ""Requiem for a Dream is a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior."""	5.0	One of the most intense movies I've ever seen.

However, as those of us who watched this movie know, it doesn't quite turn out the way these boys dreamed, and they saw their lives go down the drain.As for Sara, Harry's mother who had an empty life similar to many old people, she made me feel like I knew what going nuts really feels like.  As I was trying to go to bed at night, I couldn't stop thinking of the things that were going on with her character, and how her pitty dreams of being on TV and having a successful son drove her to insanity.Aronofsky's camera work is amazing.  We see many of the same techniques used in Pi, which I also loved.In conclusion, every person that took part in this film (especially Aronofsky and the actors) helped make what in my mind is a masterpiece.	5.0	Rollercoaster through the actors' minds	2002-03-12	1	0	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ALD4EGIL85Q8	IZZY	"I'm an oldies movie fan & don't normally watch new films. Not that I hate them but simply I prefer the classics. I read some time ago a list of the top ten's most depressing films in cinema's history. This film won the number one spot and it received rave reviews from noted film critics. I'd decided to watch in its entirely and to my surprise I found it to be one of the best anti-drug movie ever made since The Man With The Golden Arm (1955) & The Panic In Needle Park (1971). There are so many positive feedbacks I can mention here regarding this film. The cast members are played by Jared Leto Jennifer Connelly Marlon Wayans & Ellen Burstyn (who in my opinion should have received an Academy Award for her outstanding work).They share & deliver such unbelievable performances that can be described as electrifying  with uncontrolable desperation. The theme circles about the lives of four energenic adults who fall into the hands of drug addition. Their addictive appetites are evident by their involvements of doing unhealthy acts just to satisfy their unnatual ""highs"". The atmosphere can be closely described as deeply nightmarish, but the main focus is the overall transformations that take place from the beginning to the end of the film : or from better to worse. They share a single wish : to get a happy life. The youngsters want to establish themselves by someday owning a legitimate business while Sarah (Ellen Burstyn) finds the ""remedy"" to change her body appearance just to see herself wearing a red dress and starring in a TV show. Out of all the main characters who faithfully & realistically play their roles, I find Ellen (playing the character of a lonely widow Sarah Goldfarb) without question the best of all for her pitiful but splendid performance. Empathy is best described for Sarah due to her overdependancy of pills which in turn looming drug demons & dreamlike paranoias overtake  her sanity altogether. Such a grieving moment to find them confind in each of their own lonely but unescapable ends in the finale. Wonderful direction & screenplay by Darren Aronofsky which is supported by a terrific cast. A dark but emotional film I know you will enjoy."	5.0	This Is The Best Anti-Drug Movie Ever	2013-09-06	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3GTZW08HC6UV5	"Jack Barrett ""tool108"""	This movie moved me on an inner level I hadnt experienced before. I felt my heart sinking in my chest as I watched 4 lives spiral out of control and all the while all you can do is observe and suffer with these poor souls. A lonely widow and her son and her son's girlfriend and his bestfriend are the main characters. All of which have reasonable ambition and go about to achieve these goals they desperately wish to attain and with disasterous results. The movie attacks the nature of addiction head on, not only peering into the lives of junkies but average citizens whom are heavily addicted to casual things such as delicious, fattening food, TV, the American dream, and hope and happiness. At the end of the film I felt very disturbed which only goes to prove how powerful this movie conveys its message. Director Darren Aronofsky's talent is excellent and the film is shot in great, creative ways straying completely away from traditional filming techniques. Aronofsky utilizes split screen, awkward camera angles and gritty tight facial shots to perfection. Ellen Bustyn delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen, watching her character completely fall apart was the most painful to see. She should have won an award for her part, one of the best actresses ever. These two people and their talents are the two most apparent great aspects of the movie and the supporting cast and crew dont stumble on their duties either. The sound is excellent, great use of audio working hand in hand with the visuals to serve up a completely disturbing sensory feast. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly each turn in some of the best performances I've seen from each of them. Marlon Wayans in particular played his part with excellence, a far cry from the dim witted stoner parts he usually shrugs off on lesser films. This is definitley one of the best anti drug films I've ever seen, the only movie I've seen that is even competitive in the least is Traffic. Anyways, a highly reccomended film and a landmark piece of art.	5.0	The Most Powerful Film Ever	2005-01-04	5	4	1

So you could eek out a few more sales to the kiddies??	1.0	Ripped off by a &^*##@# edited version	2001-05-09	97	78	19
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A14A645PMSKH9V	Jack Hoff	Requiem For A Dream is a film which actually means something.  Not your run-of-the-mill love story with some teen idol and some teeny bopping girl, no.  It's about the reality of drug usage, mainly speed and heroin to be exact.  When you watch this film, you will see how all four of their lives slowly deteriorate into nothing as they become addicted to the drugs and make it their lives.  It starts off with Harry (Jared Leto) taking his mothers TV for drug money, starting off the journey to sadness.  Then they come up with a master plan to sell the drugs to gain a profit and have it easy for the rest of their lives.  But while they do this, Harry's mother Mary, gets a call saying she's going to be on television.  So she takes out a red dress inwhich she wore to Harry's graduation, and noticed she has gained some wait.  So she decides to go on a diet.  She tries everything, and nothing worked, so she calls a doctor who prescribes her &quot;uppers&quot;, or speed, if you will.  Then as they start to wear off, she takes more and more at one time to keep the buzz, causing her to have frightening halucinations.  On the other story, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), a buddy of Harry's, gets busted after talking to his business connections and a shootout takes place.  So Harry needs to spend all his money bailing out Tyrone, using up most of the drug profits and the rest of his money, causing his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to get extremely angered.  You should see the rest to find the results of this mind-tingling and fairly-harsh movie, because you will enjoy it for its entertainment and its meaning.  I cried at the end, which shows you I thought it was a very fine film.  Have fun.	5.0	Superb Movie About The Reality Of Drugs	2001-09-29	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3T0UWI5G3NFQW	"Jack Stevens ""expert"""	"This film portrays various drug addictions in all their glory.  From the hardest hardcore drugs to seemingly innocuous prescription addictions, each character starts off slowly and we get to watch as their lifes spin farther and farther out of their control.  A voyeuristic view into the world of addiction that leaves you both fascinated and shocked.  It uses a raw film style and doesn't pull punches, definitely not for the squeamish.  The ending doesn't tie neatly up into a bow in the Hollywood feel-good style (Traffic) but some characters suffer more than others, and none escape the movie unscathed.Opinion wise, I don't give out too many 5 star ratings, this one earned it. This movie didn't make it into a lot of Cineplex 24's but found it's place in the ""art house"" type theaters.  It is an excellent movie but it's grim and somewhat harsh portrayal of the effect of drugs on these people makes it one you have to go in prepared for. If your list of ""great"" films includes anything with Vin Diesel, please move on, this isn't for you.  If you are a male who wears a beret, this doesn't have subtitles, move on.  Anyone with a bit of refinement, who likes indy-looking film and doesn't mind getting some rough treatment at the hands of a director without the Hollywood sugar-coat, take a look at this, I think you'll find it a winner too."	5.0	Grim (un)reality	2003-04-06	7	4	3

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	A disturbing film, indeed. Very sad, very bleak, very real, very too much everything.We all live on dreams but what happens when these dreams become addictions? We get off the road, jump from the tracks, derail and we lose our souls.Every single type of addiction is studied or depicted here in their most stringent consequences.First television. You can dream of being on television. This will never happen, and you know it, but you go on dreaming and you become addicted to that dream just as much as you are to the television itself. And then you start behaving as if you were a star gone berserk.Second you can get addicted to slimming pills and in six months you become a zombie, the shadow of yourself, a non-entity, a guinea pig or guinea fowl if you prefer for doctors who are going to try all kinds of treatments not to cure you but to know what the effects of these treatments may be. You are an inmate in a hospital just like so many hundreds of thousands were inmates in Auschwitz.Third you can get addicted to drugs and then you will end either with one arm off and crippled for life, if they let you go out of the prison that will stand behind, or directly in the prison dreaming this time of freedom, though you were dreaming of paradise when you were free and you were shooting yourself with all kinds of heart accelerants, shooting yourself in both feet.Fourth you can get addicted to love in a way and a man in particular but, if you are, when that man will turn absent and non-existent any more you will be in a fix and you will have to replace him without being able to replace him. He will be your mental pimp and you will be his mental, but real indeed, shady lady or shady gentleman as for that, ready to do anything to get your fix, get some dough, maybe some baked dough, generally known as bread.Fifth there is another addiction that is dreadful. The addiction to old age that makes you believe you are not old and makes you behave as if you were not, but you can't not be, so you start cheating with life, taking pills, sitting in the sunshine, visiting other isolated old people, chanting and dancing when your son comes visit you, even if it is to steal your TV to bring it to a pawnshop of your friends.But the sixth and worst addiction of all is the addiction to solitude. That addiction can happen at any age, for any sex and in any circumstances. And don't believe it is because you live with someone, you share your daily life and chores with someone that you are not alone on this earth. Solitude is our daily lot and there is no fate in that. It is just a fact and you have to accept it. If by any chance you get addicted to that solitude, then your life is going to be hell on earth because everything, everyone is going to be a disruption, a disturbance, a dysfunctional item or individual or bore.When you meet people who are living an addiction to anything, you sure are going to come across a very disagreeable and very unpleasant experience. Addiction is the other side of the moon, the moon of life, the other side of it you can never see really because you are dead to the world, reason, logic, simple sanity and insane people don't see anymore: they fantasize.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	5.0	There is no end to addiction	2006-10-08	21	3	18
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1SK2887KAT9OP	jadeformercury	"It's a good film. The only thing that bothered me was the soundtrack. I'm sure if I had watched this film when it came out, I would have put this soundtrack on my favorites playlist...BUT goodness, it's the soundtrack of YouTube. Too many YouTubers use the soundtrack of this film to home made videos...Anyway, overall, this film is great. I wouldn't watch it with my parents or younger kids, but yeah, it's a gritty story about addiction. It's about addiction to drugs, an addiction to a dream of having happiness and a better life and how far one will go to satisfy those dreams. You take an addiction too far, and you might end up like the four characters in this film. These four characters are just hopeless dreamers imprisoned by drugs and the dependency of it. I'd say yes this film is disturbing...but it doesn't necessarily leave a major impression on me. Maybe I've just been desensitized to seeing disturbing films and content...After seeing films like ""Kids"" and ""Gummo""...this is just like one of those artistic films that tries to depict reality as shocking and disturbing as the directors can try to get. It makes you feel depressed...but it's the world we live in, it's reality. Each of these characters in the film I can easily see in every junkie or homeless person on the street. This is just the story of how these people got to where they are, losing everything for just a small ounce of happiness."	4.0	disturbing but watching it in 2013, it doesn't leave a major impression	2013-07-04	1	0	1

After watching it over and over, I can say that I'm incredibly happy that I did. The cast is absolutely dead on. It was an experience just to watch each character through out the three acts. Especially Ellen Burstyn, who was so robbed at the Oscars. Burstyn conveyed so much range and emotion as Sara Goldfarb that it was like she was possesed. I was also surprised by Marlon Wayans who played a somewhat serious role and showed he could be a great actor one day. (But Scary Movie 2 has gotta come first, ya know) Of course Darren Aronofsky's direction is incredible and he paces the movie perfectly. The DVD has plenty of extras to feed your need, and the commentary is insightful but I kept wanting to turn it off so I could hear the sweet music.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A184M4S247YZO8	James Burke	"On the surface, this is a cautionary drug tale right out of the 1930s: ""Behold, ladies and gentlemen, as four ordinary citizens, not unlike yourselves, descend into the dark underworld of dangerous and evil narcotics and go mad, mad, MAD!""But no clich&eacute; could affect you this deeply, and that's because this film is less about drugs than the voids they can't fill. Unlike most films of this ilk, which end either a ridiculous orgy of Uzi fire or worse, with a group improbably beautiful junkies decked out in $17,000 of Prada hopping into their mint '63 Lincoln and driving off into a VU-soundtracked desert sunset, Requiem ends at the bottom of the spiral, empty lives fueled with prescription hope colliding head-on with cold, final reality.And that's why it breaks your heart. These aren't bad people, these aren't players, they're just souls seeking light where there is none. Our director does an amazing job of capturing their rituals of addiction, how they substitute the safety of habit for the daunting task of confronting their fears and disappointments, and how it all falls apart when that eggshell world finally shatters.The last 10 minutes of this movie may be the most gut-wrenching cinema I've ever seen; it may be fiction, but you can't leave this behind when the credits roll.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3SZPLGWFRNGNM	"James C. Campbell ""Acoustic Picker"""	Requiem For A Dream is one of those rare films that leaves the viewer totally drained.  This story of addiction and broken dreams pummels you with imagery that only director Darren Aranofsky can pull off.  Many of the camera effects he honed in his movie PI, are perfected in &quot;Requiem&quot;.  The cast, down to the smallest part, is flawless.  Ellen Burstyn's methodical descendance into dependence is one of the all-time greatest performances by any actress.  How the Oscars passed her over is beyond me.  Wayans even turns in a dramatic performance of unexpected caliber.  Jennifer Connely's rich-girl romantic turned  junkie/prostitute should serve as a wake-up call to any recreational drug user.  Jared Leto is convincing as the waste-product son with a good heart.  The hallucination scenes are half Andy Warhol/half Marat Sade.  Rarely does a film disturb/amaze everyone who sees it...but this one does. I understand Aranofsky is going to direct the next Batman movie.  Hopefully he can rescue the franchise from hacks like Schumacher.  In the meantime, &quot;Requiem&quot; should be required viewing for every aspiring director.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	Don't get me wrong, I love Julia Roberts. As a longtime fan of her, I was pleased that she finally won an Oscar, for her performance in in the title role of  Erin Brochovich. However, if you really want to see the Best Actress of 2000, you'll need to see Ellen Burstyn's incredible performance in Darren Aronofsky's cutting edge, brilliant film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;.Burstyn plays a mother whose heart desire is to simply get into an old red dress to appear on a television show. To help her slim down to fit into this garment, she slowly becomes addicted to a multi-colored set of pills that gradually overtake her sad, pathetic life. Burstyn portrays this woman's decent into hell with such style and horror you believe what you are seeing is true. Masterful acting from a masterful actor.Ellen's Burstyn's performance isn't the only reason to watch this movie. Aronofsky's movie is a no-holds barred look at four characters as their lives decend into the hell caused by drugs. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly add tremendously to this film. But Aronofsky does something not many film maker's today do: he doesn't protect his characters. In this film, the effects of their decisions lead to horrific results, and he never moves in to protect them. It's amazing filmmaking and Aronofsky will be a director to reckon with in years to come.Don't miss out. Rent or buy this immediately.	5.0	Disturbing Dreams, Haunting Realities	2001-05-23	38	32	6
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A34CVPZ30BA4GD	James Robert Dator	'Requiem for a dream' is quite possibly the most disturbing and brilliant films to look at the drug culture; how this culture manifests itself within society, as well as the people involved. The viewer is taken on a journey through a world of money, sex, vacuous relationships and of course drugs.The film centers around four addicts Harry (Jared Leto) his girlfriend Marion (Jeniffer Connelly)his best friend (Marlon Wayans) and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn). We see how each of these characters falls into their own personal hell through the use of drugs and the motivation as to why they turned to the easy answer. For the friends it is due to the promise of easy money and get hooked 'trying out' their new gear. For Marion it is due to the relationship she has with Harry that causes her to become an addict. However the film succeeds on the highest level through the character Sara. How she starts using harmless uppers as a way to lose weight, and ends in hell.Cinematically the film is difficult to watch, the cinematography used is disorienting in many cases. This has good purpose however in trying to give the viewer an experience of what someone on drugs experiences. Director Darren Aronofsky used the interesting technique of split screening the action in the film to give us slices of two character's perspective which works brilliantly.People with a weak stomach for gritty, disturbing sex scenes or have qualms about seeing active drug taking (through needles in arms etc.) should not shy away from the film and would perhaps rather to see the rated version, with much of this cut out.The only film the 'Requiem for a dream' can be compared to is the British film 'Trainspotting' but the mood created in 'Requiem'is so disquieting that it makes 'Trainspotting' look like an episode of the 'Tellytubbies'.As far as the DVD goes you can't see this film in any grittier fashion than through the director's cut. The features are great, good interviews and commentary. The picture transfer is crystal clear (4.5 out of 5) and the sound transfer is fabulous in conveying mood (5 out of 5)No 'Requiem' isn't the kind of film you would take your mother to, nor is it one to watch with your friends if you just want to 'hang out and watch a film'. It has no happy ending, no tying of loose ends. And it's refreshing to see. This film has no answers to the problems of drugs, it's meerly an exposee of drugs in society. This film needed to be made and needs to be seen not only by people who are activly part of this drug culture, but also people who don't understand the motivations and vices people are related to through drugs.	4.0	A film that doesn't tie up all the loose ends.	2002-02-26	3	2	1

It's basically an account of four very stupid people who each find a way to completely ruin what semblance of a life they previously had.That Jennifer Connelly received critical acclaim for her utterly depressing role in this film just goes to show you how hopelessly lost our film industry is today.  The only positive I can say about this film is that this had some pretty clever photographic sequences, and the musical score, while generally melancholy, was appealing.  Apart from that, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

Let me also be a bit critical of previous reviewers.  The camara work in it was just as any camara work would be in a movie like this, nothing spectacular.  For good camara work I recommend The Graduate or Psycho. It also only plays on the depressing emotions.  In that respect it's like What Lies Beneath in which the whole movie is a series of cliff hangers.  This movie's sole purpose is to bring out the bad of drugs but in the most depressing way possible, and to play that emotion out in the viewer.  That alone doesn't make for a great movie.  See the Basketball Diaries, which is this movie, just toned down, and actually better.  This is the type of movie where I would have been better off to not have watched it.  There are only two movies I know of like that, this being one of them.  This seems to be the formula for what it takes to be a good movie today: Pick an emotion (whichever) and play on it as much as one can in 2 hours.

I just now got to see this movie, (which came outthe same year as Traffic), and it left me breathless. The film has superb acting, (leading the way: Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayan and Jennifer Connely). This film carries almost the same message as Traffic, but instead they give a more gritty and horrifying look into the world of drugs. The film will get the message ""Don't Do Drugs"" through to anyone.The cast does a superb job (especially Ellen Burstyn, who did a more than Oscar Worthy performance) not only that, they horrify you with the vision of the addict and just how truly far they will go to get their ""fix"".The fact that ""Traffic"" won the Oscar, does'nt mean that Requeim for a Dream isnt better, but rather the Academy dropped the ball, and missed, what was sure to be a clean sweep of every Oscar. That proves not only the Academy, but the every day person is biast with the diffrent film companies (Miramax, Artisan & New Line) because of the marketing. Paramount, Fox & Universal have a strong aggressive marketing team that is what really decides what we see.I always did hear good things about this movie, but no one said it was as good as it was.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A27WZZV8RZS91C	Jason Warner	There's a reason this is #55 on the top 250 movies on IMDB.com.  Absolutely brilliant picture, read the reviews here and at IMDB.com to get all the praise.Since there is no linked DVD review here, I wanted to mention that this movie has an incredible DVD translation.  Dolby Digital has never sounded so good.  Those of you lucky enough to have a 5.1 set up, you must rent this DVD.  The back speakers get as much play as the front ones and it adds *significantly* to the experience.  It would be a wonderful showcase for home theater stores, if the movie wasn't so disturbing.	5.0	Incredible DVD for an incredible movie	2001-06-18	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1NOAZ6QD7EBTX	Jay	It amazes me how so many people don't get this film.  The last review is perhaps the most telling of how shallow people are when they watch this movie.  I'm sorry if some might have found some of the depictions of addiction to be repulsive, but here's an eye opener: DRUG ADDICTION AND THE LENGTHS THAT PEOPLE GO TO SATISFY IT IS NOT A ROSY THING.  I'm not really sure what you could have expected, but to say that this film isn't realistic makes no sense, because it depicts specific individuals and what they experienced going through THEIR own story, not the story of others.  Also, the reality  of any addiction is that there are people that will go to pathetic depths to satisfy the insatiable addiction.  I don't see how anyone can say the writing was horrible.  Having just finished reading the book, that has to be one of the most absurd and comical statements that I've ever heard.And, you have to pay attention to exactly the context that the drugs were used in in order to understand what the author, Hubert Shelby was trying to say when he wrote this story.  Maybe actually reading the book would help you understand the story better.First, the story deals with dreams and hopes.  Harry, Marion, and Tyrone each had dreams of their own.  In the beginning, they fantasized a lot, and talked about how they'd attain everything. But when it came down to actually doing what they needed to achieve their goals, they saw that there was a lot of work behind it.  More and more, each time that they were faced with an obstacle in the way of their dreams, they took some drugs to be able to deal with it.  Unfortunately, through the use of the quick fix, which were drugs but could have been anything, they were not able to deal with reality, and they only pushed the problems away but never fully solved them.  They're dreams were so important to themselves that they continued patching up hardships in the hope of keeping that dream alive. This was a running theme through out the story, and it's just not independent to drug users, but it speaks on the human spirit.  So many times we're afraid to accept that there will be bumps in the road, and we're so afraid to go through them that we use any type of quick fix to erase them, and to keep our dream alive in our mind.  I think that this is the thing that people need to focus more on than the obvious usage of drugs.  In the end, they quick fixed themselves through so many problems that they became addicted to the feeling.  They became addicted to the illusion that everything was ok when, infact, it really wasn't.  Where is the direct knock on the drugs that were depicted in this movie?  What I see is a theme central to humanity, not a senseless and artless depiction of people doing nothing but shooting drugs into their system.I think Sara's story is more so a need to feel loved and wanted, and to not feel alone.  So many people go through this.  She did everything that she could to get on the show and she did everything that she could to lie to herself that maybe she wasn't going to be on it.  The saddest thing about her story is that her son, Harry could have solved part of her problems.  All that he had to do was visit her and he would have eleviated some of that aloneness that she felt, yet he never came.  He was so wrapped up in the pursuit of his own dreams that he forgot to take the time to see how she was doing.This movie is in no way a simple knock on drugs.  I think it more so shows the dangers of denial and covering up problems.  I've learned a lot from this movie and the book.  One of the most important things in life is to go through what you're going through no matter how hard things seem.  Requiem for a Dream is as beautifully presented of a story as any that I've ever seen.  It's absolutely gut wrenching, and will make move you--that's if you're open minded enough to think beneath the surface.	5.0	Wow, just wow at some of the reviews on here.	2006-07-20	8	6	2

Suffice to say, it was quite an experience watching this movie. Some of the scenes in this movie remain in the front of my mind and are impossible to forget - like I switched off the DVD player a few minutes ago even though it's been a few months.Possibly the most gut-wrenching part of taking in this movie was the fact that my grandmother actually went through a similar ordeal as Ellen Burstyn's character. I seriously grieve for my grandmother now that I have seen what Aronofsky illustrated with unrelenting, pulse-pounding vision. Luckily, my grandmother had a support system to help her get through her ordeal, whereas Burstyn's character has no one. It's very troubling to think about what might have been.Bravo, Darren Aronofsky. This is a visionary film - one that should not be watched alone.	5.0	Gut-wrenching and difficult to watch	2001-10-29	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2WP35QUWEMFCP	Jeanine	Requiem for a Dream was not only a commentary on the chemical addiction which plague a minority of the US's population, but rather on the large scale addiction which plagues the country as a whole - television.  The woman was addicted to tv (there was not one moment in which my disbelief was not suspended - proof of the first calibre acting which swept this movie along).  She saw herself in a distorted light not only on the tv but in her waking world as well (when she was not sitting in front of her addiction) . . . the lengths to which she wanted to merge with that medium (dieting) are seen in many examples in our own waking worlds - how many people do we know who have eating disorders?  They are more out there than they let on.  TV is a drug.  Through excellent directing and surreal cinematography (sp?) the screen appeared to shriek at the viewer while the actors were tormented in their own fantasy worlds. TV and drugs are not community binding for the actors were protrayed as individuals with their own problems from which there was no support from any outside party. They were alienated from society, social rejects. (The authorities in the film never related to the characters as people, but rather as objects taking up space). In television there is a perfect world which does not reflect our waking realities, people watch it and yet, truly, what do they get from it?  A thirty-minute to an hour high from which they come down when they realize that they're hungry.  Is a sitcom truly different from heroin...or coke?  Which one is the more productive, the most longer lasting, the most worthy to society.None of them.Think about it.	5.0	Commentary  on the assortment of opiates for the masses	2002-11-20	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1H12YVU0HUDM1	"Jeff D. Gould ""Jeff"""	The entire order was perfect from clicking to shipping.  The movie is amazingly filmed and wonderfully scripted.  Most people have the common misconception that Requiem for a Dream is just a drug movie.  However, though drug use is extensive and used throughout the movie, it is just a story element being used to further the main story arch.  The movie is technically about four people trying to make it for themselves (live the American Dream).  Every character is shown falling apart because they are so determined to reach this fantasy life they crave.  The mother becomes obsessed with the chance to be on tv, and we a supposed opportunity came, she jumped at the chance.  They developed her character very well showing the loneliness, emptiness, etc that she feels.  All of a sudden, her dream come true actually seems attainable to her.  Naively, she turns to a quack doctor and puts her trust into him.  Eventually, instead of her dreams, her delusions become her reality as she succumbs to Amphetamine Psychosis.  Each character was developed in a similar manner.  They all wanted a piece of the dream and in the end, it was their determination and stubborn attitudes that gave away as they were crushed (metaphorically). It just so happens that they all chose a bad path to success.	5.0	Amazing film but very misurderstood.	2012-02-04	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1LQLQUJJZUBTC	Jeff  Farrow	"At the beginning of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, director Aronofsky forces you to participate, to become both a victim & accomplice of his film. I don't see how the device he uses would have the same impact in a theatre setting. I won't spoil the effect for people who haven't seen the film at home.Ellen Burstyn is very gutsy to have taken on the role of a mother turned psychotic by prescription uppers to ""lose weight."" Her characterization defines ""tour de force."" In effect she plays two roles: the role of a middle-aged woman who gets hooked on speed, and the bizarre & hypersexualized woman on TV. What starts out as humorous & quirky, quickly becomes deadly serious. It was her extraordinary performance that influenced my rating from what would have been 3 stars to 4. She gets 5.The son, his girl friend, and a male friend are all addicted to heroin. Their spiral downward coincides with that of the mother's, but from separate locations as all communication breaks down. Only the son & his male friend remain on speaking term--and even that's soon busted up by increasingly horrific ocurrences.The main theme of the movie is naturally that of drug induced social alienation. The two lovers, so close at the beginning, become completely driven apart by their addiction. This process was very effectiively presented & played out by the 3 young actors. I thought they were all very good.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, unfortunately, goes way over the top about halfway through as addiction overwhelms reality. It's like throwing a barrage of images at a celluloid wall just see what sticks. What begins as a valid & visceral social commentary, descends into horror melodrama. Aronofksy is a very interesting director, this film just misses the level of greatness he is obviously capable of creating."	4.0	When Horror Becomes Melodrama	2012-01-12	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2V3P1XE33NYC3	Jeffrey Leach	&quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; Darren Aronofsky's film version of Hubert Selby's 1978 novel of the same name, will definitely attain cult status in coming years. Selby's story about a quartet of drug addicts employs a highly unorthodox literary style of slang, omitted punctuation, and run-on sentences that stretch for miles. Director Aronofsky echoed the novel with a host of unusual techniques for the movie version: fast editing, bizarre camera angles, and nightmarish effects created a riveting and nervous film that is grimly effective in conveying the horrors of addiction. Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connolly, Marlon Wayans, and Jared Leto; &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; will leave a lasting impression on anyone who takes the time to view it. As much as I enjoyed the film, I read the book before I saw the film and it is my opinion that the book does a much better job of delving into the personal torments of each of the major characters. The reason is simple: no film trumps a good book. Some pictures come close, but no movie ever made can compete with the power of your imagination. Still, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; comes amazingly close to fully realizing Selby's bleak visions.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; tracks the rise and eventual fall of Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sara, his girlfriend Marion, and friend Tyrone as all four individuals indulge in addictive substances and behaviors. For Harry, Marion, and Tyrone the problem is heroin. For Sara Goldfarb, her initial drug of choice is television followed by a particularly nasty encounter with diet pills. Throughout the first part of the film, all four see their lives radically improved by drugs. Harry and Marion meet and build a relationship through drug use and make tentative plans to run their own small business. Moreover, Harry can forget about the pain of his father's death. His friend Tyrone discovers the same sort of benefit as he tries to forget about his deceased mother. Things really take off for the trio when Harry and Tyrone buy a large quantity of heroin and make a bundle of money selling the stuff to local junkies. Sara Goldfarb's addictions are more insidious and ultimately more devastating. Shattered by the death of her husband, she spends her days ensconced in her apartment watching smarmy infomercial programs and eating sweets. When Sara receives a phone call offering her a chance to appear on one of these television programs, her elation knows no bounds. Recognizing her burgeoning weight presents a potential problem, Goldfarb visits a quack to obtain diet pills. Within a few days, things couldn't be better as her hunger pangs disappear and she loses enough weight to almost fit into her old red dress. Any day now that application for her television appearance will arrive in the mail and Sara will be the toast of her apartment building.All good things must come to an end, and in the world of drug addiction that end is often a fate worse than death. What started out as a recreational activity for Harry, Marion, and Tyrone soon turns into a hardcore addiction. Waking up in the morning with the shakes is the first sign of real trouble, but the trio continually reassures themselves that they are merely experiencing a small bump on the road to their dreams. Soon, serious fractures appear between the three when the heroin supply on the streets of New York mysteriously dries up. Withdrawal effects and the high price of existing supplies of heroin soon force painful decisions. Harry allows Marion to pay a &quot;special&quot; visit to her former psychologist in order to obtain a few hundred dollars. Meanwhile, Harry and Tyrone spend their time roaming the blasted landscapes of New York City in search of supply, and since it is the middle of winter the two often endure frigid conditions with little hope of success. When Harry gets the brilliant idea to take their meager funds and drive to Florida in search of heroin and Marion sells her mind and her body for drugs, you know the end is near. Sara Goldfarb's descent into madness begins when the diet pills no longer quash her desire for food. Even worse, the application she filled out is in limbo. As the hope of appearing on television fades with each passing day, Sara doubles her daily dose of the pills in a last ditch effort to lose those last few pounds. All of the characters' agonies are brilliantly executed onscreen, but Sara's is absolutely soul shattering in its intensity.The performances elevate &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; above the usual &quot;drug&quot; message film. Especially noteworthy is Ellen Burstyn in the role of Sara Goldfarb. Talk about disappearing in a role! This fine actress should have won an Oscar for her metamorphosis from a rather harmless soul into a quaking, sweating wreck lurching through the streets of New York in her tattered red dress. Her monologue to Harry about why she takes the pills to lose weight brought tears to my eyes. Just when you think Sara Goldfarb cannot possibly sink further into the depths of despair, Aronofsky piles on even more indignities.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is not a film for the faint of heart, but if you really want to view it in all of its splendor the director's cut DVD is the version to get. Included on the disc are plenty of extras: a commentary from Aronofsky, deleted scenes, an interview of Hubert Selby conducted by Ellen Burstyn, production notes, and a behind the scenes documentary. A powerful film not easily banished from the mind, I certainly hope that those who watch this picture follow through and read the book. Selby's novel, which does a few things the movie does not, is even more harrowing in its subject matter.	5.0	Please read the book, too!	2003-11-27	15	13	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ATL84JW0KKIMJ	"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1"""	I recently wrote a review for &quot;Blow&quot; comparing it to &quot;Traffic&quot; (which I thought was overhyped and overrated).  It's easy for me to lump all these movies together because of they all share the same theme: drugs.  Let me be blunt, comparing those other two movies (even Blow which I enjoyed) to Requiem is like comparing &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  No contest.If you're already on edge worrying about current events and world conditions STAY AWAY FROM THIS FLICK.  It might be enough to drive you right over the edge.  It's like an anxiety attack in a bottle.  It's so real and so intense that for me, I had to keep reminding myself it was just a movie, which is something I rarely have to do.  If you've ever had a family member who's battled a drug habit, or had a drug habit yourself, this flick will stand your hairs on end.  All the mania and euphoria of drugs is shrouded by a sense of loss and disappointment that almost always comes to those who clean up, or lose their personal battles.No doubt it's director Darren Aronofsky's deranged camera angles and constant bombardment of imagery that contribute most to the film's power and intensity.  It has all the subtlety of a gamg of thugs armed with chains and clubs beating you senseless without ever allowing you a moment to catch your breath.  Even the quiet moments are filled with so much heartbreaking tragedy that the viewer is allowed no reprieve.Incredible performances all four main players.  Ellen Burstyn deserves every kind of award that an actress can get, but it was Marlon Wayans performance that kept me in awe because it was just so unexpected.  Wayans shows that he has the talent and the skill to be a true heavy weight.  The interaction between Jared Leto and the always underrated Jennifer Connelly was what I found most disturbing about the flick.  Watching their relationship disintegrate is just too convincing and genuine at times.So to sum up... I'm not sure how to sum this movie up.  It's not for the faint of heart.  It is for anyone who's sick of the mediocre b.s. that hollywood has been pumping down our throats.  A movie like this comes out every once and awhile and makes you remember why you watch movies.  They aren't just for escape or entertainment, sometimes they CAN transcend into something important and powerful.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AELS507CK7Z6K	Jennifer M Makas	"This movie is 5 stars in terms of cinematic devices; the final sequence rivals anything Sergei Eisenstein could offer.  But in terms of story it is nothing; any sensible person knows the message already: DON'T DO DRUGS.  I don't need an incredibly hopeless and depressing film to tell me that, and after seeing it you are no better off than before.  Not worth owning because it would be incredibly difficult to sit through more than once.  If there is a message beyond the drug one, it seems to be that life has no meaning and it is all hopeless.  Not a pleasant film at all, and hardly the incredible breakthrough that so many make it out to be.Perhaps worth watching once to see a graphic depiction of how drugs can destroy your life.  The people involved are likeable (at times), so your sympathy for them does manifest.  However, I'm not sure I would call this ""art"" as so many reviewers here do.  In terms of films, I would say ""art"" is something subtle that you gain something from with each successive study.  There is no way to call this film subtle and repeated viewings would induce suicide.

We'll this story does give you that indication but it's so much more.After watching this I thought it was the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalizing, or condoning drug use in any way. Took me ages to finally see this flick but thankfully it's been recommended to me base on my experience with Aronofsky's recent film ""The Fountain.""It has a brilliant ensemble cast. Ellen Burnstyn had my heart by the end as I watched her truly sweet and charming character of Sara Goldfarb slowly deteriorate because of an addiction. I cannot believe she was denied an Oscar for this role, because it's among the best on-screen performances I've ever seen. It would be a crime in my mind to not commend Jared Leto on his performance. The job he does in the film seems to be quite underrated, but his role as Harry Goldfarb came out as my favorite character. His acting is superb in all senses, and its clear to me that his research into the role paid off. Big time. Because he's put me off drugs of all forms with his depiction of an addict. Jennifer Connely could've very easily made her character of Marion Silver a melodramatic, difficult to watch hunk of ....., but thank the good lord she didn't. It takes a great actor to walk the fine line between real and fake, and she does it so wonderfully well. She may have been playing a supporting role, but it never seemed that way to me. Her performance will stay with me for a long time to come. Marlon Wayans was also amazing in his performance and the fact that he managed to make me remember his character of Tyrone C Love says a lot.The directing is nothing short of amazing. Darren Aronofsky creates an excellent mood, making great use of cameras mounted to the actors, hallucination sequences, split camera shots and shows he his artistic sense in a brilliant montage at the end of the film, which was one of my highlights, and the score is beautiful, and makes the mood even more hostile at times. All up, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it's a film that everyone should see at some time in their lives. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may never see another film that leaves you more scared, shocked and affected mentally than ""Requiem For A Dream.""

Darren Aronofsky's second movie is not really about drugs, but about Desperation and what people would do just to feel accepted or COMPLETE.  Great camera works and angles.  Ellyn Burstyn really made me cry.  Character development is really good.  The story attaches you to the character, so when it started showing scenes of their downfall, you are concerned on what's gonna happen to them.  I really like how they laid the musical score (it plays continously while rapidly interchanging scenes of the four characters, giving the film a feeling that they suffer the same pain, DESPERATION).  The last 20 minutes of the movie will keep your eyes locked on the screen.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1B3HGBE9GAI08	Jeremy Heilman	Unfortunately, I think this film fails to successfully meld style with substance. I recently watched Godard&#8217;s Band of Outsiders in its current theatrical re-release, and when I finished that refreshing experience, I realized what it was that irked me so much about Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s Requiem. Godard&#8217;s film is specifically about an addiction to media causing a disassociation with reality. Requiem for a Dream is about drugs fueling that addiction to a vision of the &#8220;better life&#8221; that the media uses to tantalize us. Both films are stylistically bold, but since Godard&#8217;s is foremost about an addiction specifically to media (i.e. the characters believe real life should live up to the standard of films), and he&#8217;s able to imbue his characters with a youthful gusto, his stylistic choices seem integrated into his narrative.Aronofsky&#8217;s excess of style seems intrusive by comparison. He never really is able to make us examine these characters as real people (e.g. he has Ellen Burstyn DEVOUR the scenery). They remain stereotypes (i.e. specters that don&#8217;t really exist EXCEPT in the media), and therefore feel that they contribute to the problem of false media expectations more than they help expose it.  They are very fictional characters complaining that their lives aren&#8217;t fictional enough.The drug sequences seem to be just more of the media telling us how life is. We&#8217;re supposed to get the impression that, due to Aronofsky&#8217;s technical brilliance, we&#8217;ve seen how it is to be addicted to drugs after this film, but that dishonesty bothers me here&#8230; We&#8217;ve simply watched a murky, dreadful movie.	2.0	A lot of dazzle with a little effect	2001-09-05	12	7	5
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1Q7329LOIJG6M	Jerry Fry	"I think the title refers to the American dream, where you get a good job, buy a nice house and raise a nice family. That dream is over or never existed for the people in this show. The movie can be said to make many statements, but the one it made for me more than any other is: What makes people turn to drugs? Harry (Jared Leto), his mother Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are four people who's lives seem empty and bordering on despair. Harry, Marion and Tyrone love to get high, with heroin being their favorite escape. Harry's mom, who's hooked on television and mistakenly thinks she's going to be on her favorite program wants to lose weight and becomes addicted to diet pills. She loses weight but becomes emaciated in the process, starts hallucinating, and seems to be losing her mind. Harry warns her of the dangers of taking all these ""uppers"" (he ought to know) but it falls on deaf ears. Things are going good for Harry, Marion and Tyrone for awhile but things dry up and coming down is painful. They are so hooked that they're willing to do things they wouldn't normally do just to get a fix. At the end of the show it's hard to decide who to feel the most sorry for. All four of their lives have become a virtual hell. Maybe the best statement this show makes is: No matter how hopeless your life may seem, drugs aren't the answer. In the end they leave you worse off than you were before you started. The soundtrack is piercing at times, but fits with the context of the movie. A disturbing film but brilliantly crafted."	4.0	"""There's gonna be some prime back on the street"""	2003-06-28	3	2	1

They'll see this movie and object to what happens and not really care about what it's trying to say...It was great to see a film using many different kinds of shots/media. The split-screen was used very effectively and not so mush as to be annoying; a difficult thing to pull off. It was also refreshing to see a movie which ventured away from traditional and ""safe"" film techniques, i.e., rule of thirds, complimentary coloring, mono-coloring... Not to say that there wasn't any, but this film tries everything.  Even better than the very artistic visuals were the story/message/questions the movie communicated... most via expressions, pain, and drugs rather than words.  This movie must be experienced and processed.  Most of the American(christian) populus wouldn't get anything from a movie about [this subject]...but the movie parallels a junkie son and his junkie-in-the-making mother.  The audience is more understanding and sympathetic for the mother, and hopefully realizes that she and her son are not too unlike.  And if you already do know something/anything about good movies, you're probably thinking this movie couldn't possible be good if it stars Marlon Wayans, who should be hung for feeding Scary Movie to American teenagers.  BUT, he has somehow redeemed himself, thanks to his part in the movie. I was also going to go on and on about how the music was great and was just as integral to the entire movie as story and art, but I'll get off my soapbox and hope you buy this movie that the majority of this narrow-minded society would label as quote-unquote weird...something that the New Your Post wouldn't call a ""Thrill-ride"" or ""The year's best Feel-Good movie."""	5.0	Emotionally artistic	2001-05-31	0	0	0

There's no inbetween on this one.First of all, this movie was not made to make you feel good. It doesn't end happily ever after. It's brutal and it's real.""Requiem"" follows a year in the lives of four people: Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn).In the beginning, all is well for the most part. Sara, a widow, lives by herself and is lonely, but perks up when she receives a call that she's been picked to be on television. She immediately decides to try to lose some weight so she can fit into the red dress that she had worn to Harry's graduation years earlier. She tries some diets, but none seem to work, so she goes to visit a specialist that gives her some pills. She begins to take them, and they seem to work like magic. She's losing a ton of weight.In the meantime, Harry and his friends decide they should try to earn some money by selling heroin. Marion wants to open her own clothing store, so they save up money in order to buy a building where she can set up shop.Everything is well.Then the characters begin their downward spiral to hell.This film, which is based off Herbert Selby Jr.'s novel, is masterfully powerful. Even if you hate the movie, it will affect you. The story is raw and emotional, revolting and gripping.Besides the powerful story, everything about the way the movie was made is what makes it great. Aronofsky's direction is phenomenal. He makes brilliant uses of split-screens and the sound effects and clips of the drug use are original and creative. The music in the movie, all orchestrated, is exquisite. It fits so perfectly with everything that is happening on screen. And the acting is also wonderful. Leto and Connelly both perform the best roles of their careers, in my opinion, and Wayans shows that he can really do drama. But it's Burstyn's performance that is the most outstanding. She really grips your heart and doesn't let it go throughout the whole film.While I don't claim that you will love this movie, I think everyone should watch it at least once and form their own opinion of it. It will unsettle you and it will make you think. And that's what makes it worth watching."	5.0	Powerful and gripping	2005-02-20	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2MYZ791REPMWJ	Jessicka	As you have already read by now, this movie is about 4 people whose lives spin out of control due to destructive lives and drugs.  The mother's story is in my opinion the most shocking, becuase her doctor basically got her addicted to speed-like diet pills that eventually drive her over the edge.  Every person in this film gradually succumbs to madness and addiction, and its done in such an amazing matter even you find yourself shocked when all of a sudden they all turn into junkies before your eyes and the change was so graduall you didnt even notice it.  With the use of tripped-out scenes, inovative and original camera angles and shots, amazing actors, brilliant directing, and a nervracking use of the last 20 minutes, youll not only be left shocked and amazed, you'll find yourself feeling like youre literally on a roller coaster.  Ive never seen any movies that had me saying 'oh my god' out loud and that could keep me so on edge for almost half an hour, but this movie did.  And this isnt a sleazy film that makes the characters look like evil degenrates like most do, but it makes you sympasize with them becuase of the horrible things the drugs do to them.  Easyily the most shocking and nervracking films ive ever seen.  And has probably one of the best movie endings  ever.	5.0	Absulutely stuning	2004-08-06	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2HW33PQSRHLNO	J from NY	"This is a difficult movie to watch by any standards, I think.  As a lifelong fan of oddball, disturbing and surreal films of all variety, I would say this ranks in the top ten in terms of sheer unpleasantness.  And that's saying a lot. I remember hearing about this movie quite a bitwhen it was released and writing it off as another ""Basketball Diaries"", and that's what I expected when I popped it in my DVD player.  Wow, was I wrong.But the unpleasantness is not gratuitous; in fact, Arofonsky has done everyone a service by translating Shelby's book into film in such a visceral and brutal manner. The performances are appropriately desperate and the actors themselves mean a lot less than what they are intended to represent: surrender, through different means, to the forces of self-destruction, narcissism, and ultimate disintegration.  One thing, though; Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would not be looking as good as she does at the end of the film at all if she was such a fervent heroin user.Otherwise, there is not one false note in this hellish descent into the pits of human degradation and nothing is too extreme.  Anyone who has experienced addiction in their lives will recognize from the first scene in which Harry boosts his mother's television set that while a lot of the Kafkaesque and bleakly surreal are employed here, it is all too real.  For better or worse, I will never forget this movie, and it stands as one of the most successfully realized films I have ever seen."	5.0	"""I didn't take it out for air."""	2007-07-28	4	3	1

Surprisingly, its much more than that and I appreciate the message delivered in this film. Harry Played by (Jared Leto) lives with his mom Sara (Ellen Burstyn). Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)and his friend Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) are tied up with the drug business, there unfortunate habits eventually catch up to them they seem to let go of reality. Meanwhile Harry's mom is also caught up with the popular use of Diet pills. His mother is A Televison Junkie who is lonely and wants to get on ""Tappy Tibbons Show"" which is a similar to a Richard Simmons program played by Christopher Mcdonald. Just like Harry, His mother fantasizes, she wants to lose weight and fit in that red dress so she can be famous. I won't give away the ending, but it isn't pretty. then again most movies about raging drug addicts aren't pretty, hence, the movie Transpotting. What did attract me to this movie is the message. What the director was trying to portray is that almost every thing has the potential to qualify as a ""Drug."" For example, Harry's mom is addicted to television and can't seem to get a grip on herself, Harry and Tyrone can't seem to stop living life on the edge ect. You get the point. Overall the acting is stunning as well, the whole cast especially Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. As for the dvd, fans of this movie won't be dissapointed either. For one thing we get the director's cut of the film, with some good interiews with the writer and cast. A good solid commentary and some interesting deleted scenes. On The documentary we get a good behind the scenes on the story and setting on Coney Island. As for quality, the director obviously, intended to use a dark grainy transfer to set the mood of the movie, which he does a great job here as well.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3GTH1VXNRYZS5	"""j_james"""	Most reviews--whether they are written by professionals or amateurs--talk about how brilliantly this film is made. All of those reviews are correct. Aronofsky is one of the finest young directors alive, the performances (with the exception of Jared Leto, who is merely good) are all excellent, the audio track is chilling and the visuals in this picture are truly magnificent. Even the post-production elements--such as editing--are nearly perfect.But I think that most reviews don't see past the brilliant filmmaking to find the glaring drawbacks of Requiem. First, these characters are two-dimensional, at best. The viewer doesn't get get a feel for their pasts (with, perhaps, the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character, who is made three dimensional by the actress, not the writer or director) or their motivations or their dreams or their wishes for life before they became addicts. That's a dangerous thing to do in any film, but especially in one like this; one that is expecting the viewer to care about the eventual tragedies these people face. One that actually requires the viewer to care in order for the feature's political statement to mean anything, to have any relevance. Did this movie overcome the character development? To a certain extent, yes it did, if only because the performances were so amazing and the technical elements of the film so flawless. Nonetheless, Requiem would have succeeded even more if these characters had been more real.That brings me to a thematic discussion. Requiem, much like Traffic, looks into addiction, drug use and it's effects. Unlike Traffic, however, Requiem doesn't take a relatively neutral stance while doing it's best to accurately depict the drug world. Aronofsky, in fact, makes this film a resounding condemnation of drugs, as if saying that any and every person who uses drugs will eventually meet the same fate these characters do. Not that it matters, but I have persoanlly never done a drug (other than alcohol); I do know several people who use occasional substances and I only know one person who's life has been significantly negatively effected, though no where near to the same degree as these characters; most users I know are in fact quasi-users and lead perfectly normal lives. What I'm saying is this: drugs don't inevitably lead to these sorts of situations; to imply that they do--as Requiem for a Dream most certainly does--is not only excessively pessimistic, it's also a bit insulting. Setting aside any policital views, Aronofsky, would have been better served if he'd had at least one sane, occasional user who's life succeeded, than he was by having a plethora of spiralling hell-like situations for every character.Ultimately, is this film worth viewing? Absolutely. It is a very impressive cinematic achievement, but there are still some glaring flaws that shouldn't be ignored.	3.0	It's been talked about many times, but maybe not like this	2002-05-28	12	1	11

With the mother addicted to pain pills and the super-fast close-up camera tricks, I was on edge.  The only thing I did like was that Jennifer Connoly was in it and she had a brief nude scene.  Other than that, it seemed to be a little too artsy and in-your-face for me.  Some people love it, but I didn't.	3.0	disturbing, but decent	2003-07-10	10	1	9

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A15WLZ3Q2ODN1L	Joe Faber	Daniel Aranofsky's follow-up to Pi is a much darker tale of the dangers of drug abuse and addiction. Some may say that Aranofsky goes to far in showing us the vile debasements that go along with a drug problem, and for many people Traffic or Blow might be sufficient. But what makes this movie stand out from all the rest (aside from a fantastic cast) is the way it conveys the romanticism associated with drugs in our culture today.I believe that this film is one of the most powerful anti-drug messages ever created, but it doesn't deny the fact that there's an allure to drugs, be they over the counter medication or illicit substances.Artistically, the movie is terrific. The soundtrack is just perfect, and the split cameras are something rarely seen.All in all, this film is fantastic. But if you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, steer far clear.	5.0	Exceedingly powerful; not for the faint of heart	2002-01-05	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Darren AronofskyThis is a powerful movie.  While on one hand it would be simplistic to say that this is a movie about drugs, it is also necessary and accurate to say that the movie is about drugs.  It would be just as accurate to say the movie is about addiction.  This movie is broken up into three stages: Summer, Fall, and Winter.  Each stage tracks the descent of the characters into addiction and we watch as their lives fall apart.This is the story of four people: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and their friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  We start the movie with our characters about to improve their lives.  After Sara receives a phone call telling her that she has been selected to appear on television she is obsessed with losing weight and fitting into a dress that she wore years ago.  She sees a doctor that was recommended by a friend (the doctor seems like a quack doctor, however), and begins taking diet pills.  Harry and Tyrone have a plan to start dealing some higher quality drugs and make money so they can buy some of the highest quality cocaine and sell that and make serious money.  Marion is along for the ride and has dreams of her own about designing clothing.  At first everything is working fine and we are in the Summer period of the story where everything is at its brightest and warmest and most positive.  But it isn't to last.Harry recognizes that the diet pills that his mother are taking are nothing more than speed, with a downer to help her sleep at night.  He sees the signs of addiction and that she is starting to become strung out, but all she can see is that she is losing weight.  Harry and Tyrone are experiencing great success, but it is all starting to turn sour.  The rest of the movie is the slow (though at times rapid) descent into addiction and the repercussions of the drug addiction and lives they are leading.  There are arrests and Marion is now willing to trade her body for drugs since Harry is not able to provide her with the drugs she needs.  It keeps getting worse and worse and spiraling out of control for all four characters and the end of the movie doesn't give them redemption, but rather rock bottom.As I said, this is a powerful movie, but by no means is this film an uplifting movie.  Things start bad, improve a little it and just get worse from there.  This is a harrowing look at drug addiction and there is no truly sympathetic character whom I care for and hope things turn around for.  What this movie does have are fantastic acting performances from everyone involved (though I am somewhat less impressed with Connelly).  I have been impressed with both of Araonofsky's movies (the other being ""Pi""), but they have both been emotionally gloomy pictures.  I look forward to seeing what he does next and while I think this is an excellent movie, I think I'll be okay never seeing it again."	4.0	powerful	2004-03-02	5	4	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3VZ3FURMARCEW	johnc	Well, to be fair, Mr. Arnofsky has a decent sense of compositional flow, and he's makes interesting, and fairly effective use of lots of neat-o camera/visual effects. Also, Ellen Burstyn puts on a great performance showing us the visceral, compulsive and paranoid world of a lonely substance abuser.But that's just about it. This film is no more than a downward-spiral portrait of sad individuals who don't have the presence of mind to rise above their self-destructive habits ... There is not much articulation, subtle or othewise, nothing beyond stylistic moodyness (which it does at least succeed at) ...  There are times when you'll be gritting your teeth at some of the more miserable scenes in the film ... I personally walked away with a light case of nausea and a pain in my arm, but ultimately, it's not very fulfilling, poignant or innovative.There are already a number of junkie films to be had out there, this one does little to stand out ... but there is the soundtrack, which by itsself, deserves good four stars (can't go wrong with the Kronos Quartet &amp; now I can't wait to hear more from Clint Mansell ...  FYI he should have a solo album coming out under Nothing records sometime in the near future).	3.0	Requiem for empty, but well composed stylistic moodyness	2001-12-13	6	0	6
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A24VVMNW9AK723	John Crowell	"This film is a really good example of critics assuming that just because a film is graphic and raw, that automatically makes it good. Although is suppose this film has a meaningful overall theme of the dangers of drugs, the bulk of the film is too packed with pointless twiddling to make it valuable.For one the ""artistic film techniques"" are not at all original or compelling. The sped up sequences strike me as a bit too much like Clockwork Orange, although Kubrick had the intelligence to limit these; they keep popping up in Requiem. Much of the other tricks; hand-held or cart-mounted camera when Leto and Wayans take the TV to the flea market, the extreme flickering of lights as the mother slowly goes insane, the psycadelic representations of shooting up (pupils enlarging, sounds of sighs, etc), two different shots split into different parts of the screen, following two distinct actions; I've seen all of this before.Worst of all it all this foolishness gets in the way of the characters. Perhaps the worst aspect of Requiem is its extreme predictability. Literally 30 minutes into the film I began correctly predicting what would happen in the end. Since we are bombarded with such film-school foolishness early on, we are left with little time to get to know the characters.We get glimpses, the mother missing the deceased father, Leto's slight guilt over being an addict, the love between him and Connely, but it isn't as explored as it should have been. As the movie drags on and everyone's life worsens, we don't really know enough about the characters to identify them or care about what happens. The worst example is of Wayans' character, whose back-story (only of 30 second clip relating to his mother) seems to be tacked on as an afterthought so we might care when he is abused in prison at the end.The only bright spot is that of the mother. Ellen Burstyn is far and away the best actor in the film, which is to say, the only decent one. Her story, though un-realistic (no one ever gets so addicted to diet pills that they hallucinate and have to get electro-shock, sorry. And while we're at it, I'd say that if a prisoner with an infected arm really were made to work until it had to be sawed off, I would say there'd be a pretty big scandal. For that matter, I don't really think that a prison guard would really punch a prisoner in the chest and shout racial slurs at him. All of this is ridiculously dramatized) is somewhat compelling, namely her relationship with the rest of the women in the building; how being on TV makes her ""somebody."" It would perhaps have been a good idea to center the plot on her, but what we're left with is a depressing poorly conceived mess of cookie-cutter film tricks and half-baked characters in a downward spiral.Thumbs down."	2.0	Worth seeing I suppose, not worth much else	2005-01-20	10	5	5

I agree with everyone on this score and for this reason alone I would recommend everyone seeing the film.  What amazed me is how true the picture was to the orginal story.  It is very difficult to make a film from a great story and keep true to the orginal book.  This film, however, does this and more.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1IL9BSLDPA7E6	John Doe Jr.	&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is arguably the most horrific and shocking American film I have ever seen. It is brutal, honest, and sadly depressing, and I didn't expect anything more when I first saw it. Saying that &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is over-the-top and exaggerated is like saying that an orange isn't a fruit. It is not exaggerated, but instead a fast-edited, well-directed masterpiece directed by Darren Aronofsky. The story concerns a lady named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) who lives in Coney Island and is sometimes visited by her junkie son Harry (Jared Leto). She subscribes to diet pills after being selected as a guest on her favorite TV show. However, her addiction to the pills gets stronger as her son, his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans) all become victims of drugs.Burstyn gives probably her best performance to date, same for Leto and Connelly in a very good performance. Wayans gives his first dramatic role and possibly also his best. Darren Aronofsky gives an outstanding direction, the editing is wonderful, and the music is one of the best movie themes I have heard in a while. Very powerful and horrific, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is one of the 50 best films of all time.

I saw it quite a while ago when it made the independant run in my city, and I just recently got the DVD.  Not sure how, I just went into a store and saw it on the racks...it's not supposed to be out for 2 weeks.  ANYWAYS...the movie is brilliant, and the DVD isn't a disapointment.  The transfer is amazing, and the features are really great.  The &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; special from the Sundance Channel is really great.  The commentary by Aronofsky (who is a film genious...Pi was one of the most brilliant movies ever made) is really great.  I just love this movie, and the DVD was definately not a let-down.  The &quot;deleted Scenes&quot; aren't much though.  They are just different angled shots of scenes...and even though they weren't used in the movie, they really don't serve much purpose.  BUT, it IS interesting to see a little more into Aronofsky's mind and how he wanted this movie to look.  I feel that he made a perfect film here.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1LLHNE4ZGDZNO	"John G. Frykman ""jfrykman"""	The acting is superb--especially Ellen Burstyn.  It is the story of four essentially good people who get pulled into the drug culture, with devastating results.  All of the characters are flawed in ways that make them especially vulnerable to the allure of chemical fixes to their less than perfect existences.  The musical score all by itself is worthy of special mention. It is a minimalist score that is perfectly matched to the action.  The director uses repetitive &#34;instant&#34; visual flashbacks as exclamation points in the characters' individual descents into the hell of drug addiction.Powerful, but not for everyone.  You may not like it, but you won't forget it.  The four stars I give it recognizes this, but for me, it rates five.  Your results may vary.	4.0	Very gritty, but an absorbing work	2014-01-12	1	0	1

If you asked me what was better, the acting, the story, the directing, or the music, I honestly couldnt tell you, because they are all absolutly amazing.  Ellen Burstyn gives an absolutly stellar performance as Sarah Goldfarb, a woman addicted not only to diet medication, but to the pursuit of the spotlight.  Watching this film, I had to wonder if she was really acting, that is how great she was.  Jared Leto plays her son, Harry, a small time addict who will do anything for a fix, and along with his friend, played magnificantly by Marlon Wayans, finds a way to make it for himself, along with his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely.  The film then follows each of these characters in their own personal journey and subsequent decay to addiction and dependency.  Darren Aronofsky, the director of &quot;Pi&quot; turns out a brilliant film worthy of mountains of praise and accolades.  Unfourtunatly, because this film is not rated, and is far too deep to be understood by &quot;society,&quot; it will never get the praise it deserves.

There is such a concentrated dose of graphicness and extreme feelings of depression conveyed from these, that the viewing will automatically trigger feelings of disgust from the average or normal person. I do not blame those who feel this is a five star film, but the other extreme seems pretty unfounded. On the other hand, I find the raves hard to believe. This is a wonderfully produced, deep, well-acted movie. A true psychological thriller. Ellen Burstyn is truly outstanding. Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and a versatile actress. Overall a very above average film with a limited degree of appeal to most people. Well worth seeing once, and I would recommend teenage viewing for the shock value.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1CO80OWENLJVH	John Miele	Amazon's review claims that Requiem For a Dream teaches us nothing that any sane person doesn't already know.  But that isn't the purpose of great art.  Does Hamlet teach us anything that we didn't already 'know'?  The power of a great piece of art is that it can make an obvious truth viscerally real and palpable again, even if we've heard it a thousand times.  Drugs are bad, addiction is bad.  Yes.  But does that adequately sum up the experience of Requiem For a Dream?  Not at all.  Aronofsky's film might not say anything 'new,' but it finds one of the most effective way of saying it.  That's where its power lies.	4.0	This is not a story about drugs.  This is about addiction, despair, hopelessness.	2009-03-12	5	4	1

Julia Roberts was a wonderful Erin Brokovich and I LOVED Laura Linney in You Can Count on Me, but this performance is the thign that comes along not too often. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ABB05LRAC0CBF	"John Self ""www.theasylum.wordpress.com"""	"If you thought the sight of Jennifer Connelly getting it on naked with a ...(sexual toy) could never be repellent, then let me introduce you to a whole new experience...And if the cinema reviews of ""Requiem for a Dream"" were agreed on two things, they were that it was stymied from the beginning by its outdated and unsubtle source material, and that the last twenty minutes are hard to watch and impossible to enjoy.Yet what recommends the film is the fact that despite the stomach-churning closing sequences, it is not only compelling but impossible to tear yourself away from (and, incidentally, never as painful and unsettling as his debut ""Pi""), and that despite its apparently two-dimensional moralising, it remains with you longer afterward than any film since perhaps ""Magnolia.""It is certainly a measure of Aronofsky's high-minded approach that although he has cinema's sexiest couple at his disposal in Connelly and Jared Leto, he never trades on their looks and the only nudity is non-sexual. Indeed one of his greatest achievements in the film is making the golden couple appear increasingly grotesque as their fall progresses. Connelly in particular echoes Roald Dahl's Mrs. Twit, whose ugly thoughts over time, you may recall, began to show on her face until she became so ugly you could hardly bear to look at her. But ""The Twits"" never did brave that ...(sexual toy) sequence...All the lead performances are flawless, and Ellen Burstyn was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Leto's mother. When a director and actor come together so well you get infinitely memorable moments like Burstyn's beaky, wrinkled face peering with confusion around the room at the edge of a fish-eye lens. Horrible. What's most astonishing on viewing the film again, though, is that ""Requiem for a Dream"" clearly marks out Aronofsky as the natural successor to Stanley Kubrick (and isn't it nice that we had only to wait two years?), with his fastidious attention to frame composition, his delight in colour, his careful use of a brilliant score, and of course, most tellingly, the sense of something missing in the heart region...This brings us back to what the some didn't like about it, and with these concerns taken into account, the film itself probably only deserves four stars. I'm giving this package five though, as the DVD gives it a whole new dimension (though not the one the critics were looking for). The extras are simply the best I have ever seen on a single disc set, and, crucially, now you can program your DVD player to run the chapters backwards, and give the lovely Jennifer and Jared the happy ending they deserve."	5.0	Police Academy 8 : Narcs Get High	2001-09-16	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AK81WLVD5KGUX	"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan"""	Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is going to be on television -- so, needing to lose a little weight in order to fit into her nice red dress, she starts a regimen of diet pills. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto) keeps hocking her TV to buy drugs for himself, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). And from there, everything pretty much spirals downward to hell._Requiem for a Dream_ is based on the book of the same name (which I haven't read) by Hubert Selby, Jr. (who also cowrote the screenplay and makes a brief cameo appearance as the 'Laughing Guard'). Essentially, it's a harrowing study of addiction and its effect on hope. Although the film's primary focus is on drugs, other objects of addiction (television, sex, even food) take turns in the spotlight. And it's all pretty grueling. (Parts are darkly comic at the same time, as when Sara has to sneak into the room so as not to arouse her hungry refrigerator.)With a lesser cast, or with any more self-conscious moralism in the screenplay, it would have toppled off of its highwire and turned into just another Special Episode of 'Blossom'. And with even a _little_ more of its already-overused nerve-jangling speedy-uppy-slowy-downy Technique-with-a-capital-T, it would have toppled over in the other direction and become just another pretentiously arty soap opera.And that would have been a disaster. The topic itself isn't exactly new; what else could there possibly be to show us about it that we didn't see years ago in e.g. _Lost Weekend_ and _The Man With the Golden Arm_ and _Valley of the Dolls_ (never mind _Reefer Madness_ and _The Cocaine Fiends_)? Had this devolved into just another film in an already overloaded genre, it wouldn't merely have failed; it would have crashed and burned.But it manages, somehow, to work. As I suggested above, a lot of the credit has to go to the cast; Ellen Burstyn is by God magnificent, and the three younger leads bring life to a trio that could easily have cliched itself into a sort of bizarro prequel to 'The Mod Squad'. Credit also goes to the appropriately jagged score by Clint Mansell (much of it performed by the Kronos Quartet).The lion's share, though, goes to director Darren Aronofsky (who was also the other cowriter of the screenplay). With nearly anybody else, I'd suspect a desire to impress the world by making his second movie an Idiosyncratic, Shocking, Yet Deeply Significant Work of Art. But that suspicion doesn't really make sense applied to a guy whose _first_ movie was _Pi_. (This one is actually somewhat _less_ gonzo than that one.) Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, Aronofsky has his craft under careful control.Overall, then, this is a much, much better movie than it has any right to be. There's nothing really new in it; it's right on the edge of unbearably preachy (and on a relatively uncontroversial subject; does anybody think addiction is _good_?); it's got a strong flavor of deliberate 'art-housiness', if you know what I mean. But much to my surprise, it succeeds anyway, and somehow its characters manage to become sufficiently real for us to care about them even while they're totally screwing themselves up.It's not cheerful, it's not pretty, it's not even easy to watch. But I'm impressed enough to watch it again. I may even read the book.Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go have some coffee.	5.0	Better than it has any right to be	2004-05-28	5	3	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1U5EIW985DXXA	"Jonathan E. Adams ""A different view"""	"Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream plays the least intelligent character (Sara Goldfarb) in any movie I have ever seen where the character's lack of intelligence is not made explicitly clear to the audience or the other characters.  She inhabits a fantasy world, where it takes no more than a half a day's diet to get her refrigerator to talk to her.  She lives to watch an over the top television game show/self-improvement infomercial.  (There is no small amount of irony that there is a self-improvement message in the infomercial that is completely lost on Sara.  She is caught up in the flicker of the image on the screen and little else.)Sara complains of being old and lonely and it is touching when she does so.  That said, the primary reason for Sara's isolation is a complete lack of inner resources.  Why isn't she taking classes, or helping out a working mom with after school care or working part time in a flower shop or helping out at a homeless shelter? Why doesn't she own a dog, or a canary or a fish?  These are questions that the filmmakers don't go anywhere near.  It is unclear whether Sara is deluded into thinking that she is going to be on her favorite infomercial or not, but either way there is a conjunction of her fantasy life with her real life which is enough to send her into a delusional spiral.  Since Sara is incapable of coming up with something to aspire to on her own, when given the possibility of a dream she grasps at the weakest of straws with both hands.Jared Leto plays Sara's son Harry.  Other than being stunningly beautiful and ""loving his mother"", the Harry character has few redeeming characteristics.  Yes, he is not out and out evil, but if he is the standard for goodness, lord help us all.  He regularly steals Sara's one possession that means anything to her, her television, forcing Sara to schlep blocks and blocks in order to buy it back out of hock.  This is not presented as a joke but more of ""that's-the-way-Harry-is"" statement.  This is the first scene of the movie, confirming that Sara is in a full delusional state, denying the reality that is occurring right in front of her eyes.Jennifer Connelly (Marion) is the love interest for Jared Leto.  (She is a good match.  She is as pretty as he is.)  She appears to be a dropout bankrolled by well-to-do parents from whom she is estranged.  She lies to them about being in therapy preferring to sleeping with her skuzzy analyst for money rather than trying for some kind of reconciliation with her parents.  Rather than facing her addiction problems, she is willing to be sexually used in the most degrading manner.  While such things unfortunately do happen, we don't get much of a sense that this sinking in squalor is much of a struggle for her.  She goes down the tubes with barely a bubble of protest.And finally there is Tyrone, Harry's friend.  But Tyrone is black, so we don't get much of a sense of his story and his struggles (if any).  We do know he once had a sweet relationship with a loving mother and has a sexy girl friend who he'd rather ignore to do drugs than mess around with.Requiem for a Dream is designed to provoke strong reactions either positive or negative.  The drug scenes are graphic and strong as are the scenes of Ellen Burstyn's breakdown and Jennifer Connelly's degradation.  The problem with the film is that the aspirations of the characters are shallow.  It is hard to imagine these characters without drugs.  It is a sad and pathetic thing when one winds up agreeing with characters that drugs give their lives meaning."	3.0	Requiem for a fantasy is more accurate	2002-02-22	5	2	3

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AN55VVQSWHGCA	Jon Bjorling	Really. What is left to say at this point? Some say that Requiem is nothing more then an overrated NC-17 (or R) rated after school special about drugs. In some ways, yes it is that. Some say that it's a masterpiece adapted from a masterpiece. In some ways it's that. I personally feel that it is one of the most powerful films to come out in recent years. Aronofsky has crafted this film so well that you feel for these characters. This is not a movie that you go into hoping to see big explosions and gunfights and other elements it seems to take to have a box office sucess. This is a film that grabs your heart and rips it out. How can you not feel for Ellen Burnstyn's oscar winning performance as Sara?(*note* I don't acknowlege Julia Roberts as the oscar winner.) She could be your mother or even grandmother. True, Jared Leto's Harry isn't completely fleshed out as much as some would hope, but it doesn't matter, Leto's acting ability makes up for the lack of character. The same holds true with Marlon Wayans. When I first heard that Wayans was in it, I was skeptical. I really don't like anything he's starred in. But when I saw his performance, my jaw hit the floor. HE CAN ACT!! Not only that, HE CAN ACT VERY WELL!!! It's a shame that he doesn't do these type of films more often. Finally, Jennifer Connelly's Marion....my God, her fate is possible the second most depressing in the film (of course, Burnstyn's character has the worst fate in my opinion.) Should you see it? Yes. Will you like it? I'm not sure. Does it deserve to be a classic? Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes.	5.0	What is left to say?	2001-05-31	2	2	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A36HBE2C5SQ2E6	"Jordan Appel ""thedudeman"""	Darren Aronofsky's second film revolves around 4 people that have a great life and are happy, but a series of choices and mistakes causes that feeling of happiness to go away. But, no matter what, they still maintain that happiness because they have nothing else to hold onto. They all still cling onto it even though their lives are thrown into a fiery downfall.Darren Aronofsky has made one of the best films of the 90's. He hits you hard with his sensory-based direction. He makes you react to what is being shown on the screen with a gut thudding motion that would make the strongest man cry. He has mastered the art of showing people that are all good then sends their lives into a tumbling downfall. His direction is wild and all over the place, and he does the direction with such an artistry that you can't help but merzmerized by what is going on the screen.Delusions of Grandour come to mind when we look at these characters. We feel some sort of pain when we watch these characters go ahead and form a niche in making their life worse until the point where they cannot turn back and realize all of the mistakes that they are making. It self induces pity from us towards the characters. We feel things when we watch the film.We don't even realize what we are watching till the end when we tell ourselves how we like this film.In my personal opinon, I was watching a mastery of filmaking. I formed that we all have our own dreams and reality that we hold onto no matter how much pain, torment, trouble or feeling that we have towards our life, we hold onto the dream no matter what. Dreams can be ruined by what we do and the mistakes that we make.I enjoyed this wonderful piece of film making, because it shows us a harsh and brutal reality.	5.0	It's not a movie, it is more like watching people die off.	2005-07-27	3	2	1

Perez ""Jose"""	"Bizarre, singularly unique and startling in unexpected ways, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a rare achievement - a movie that is so innovative in its dialogue and characterizations, it can either drive you crazy or make you leap for joy!  There is little joy in the story itself, as it deals with very adult themes of drug addiction, victimization and unpleasant characters.  However, if you give it a chance, it will blow you away with its sheer velocity and transformative power.  A nightmare one moment, a walk on the beach the next, its hypnotic and never dull.  Plus - it has one of the most remarkable performances by a female actor in the past 20 years in Ellen Burstyn's fierce portrayal of an addicted mother.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Burstyn lost to the ever-popular Julia Roberts last year, but deserves to be hailed as a landmark role...perhaps even a signature role (for sheer drama, this beats her Oscar winning ""Alice Doesn;t Live Here Anymore"" as well as her up-until-now greatest accomplishment as Regan's mother in ""The Exorcist.""

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1FLAX56XMQ4IS	Josh	If you're easily emotionally disturbed, dont watch this movie. If you have good taste in movies and havnt seen this yet, you simply MUST. I saw it probably 4 months ago, and I still think about it during my everyday life. Its without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen.With nothing but Hollywood action garbage, cheesy chick flicks, and Rob Schneider movies out these days, 'Requiem for a Dream' captured my interest like no other film has done. The trippy visual effects, the repeditive sequences, and the score written by the great Clint Mansell makes the viewing experience simply mindblowing. The story is so real, the acting is so good, that I still somehow believe that the characters played are actually real people living in Coney Island. I'd recommend this movie to anyone thats sick of Hollywood and wants to experience revolutionary film making.	5.0	Simply Mindblowing	2003-02-26	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2	Josh Hitchens	I don't think that there has ever been a film as bleakly harrowing or as brave as Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream.&quot; The film deserved to win a dozen Oscars, including Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress. What makes this film different from other movies about drug addiction is that it never offers a moral view. It tells the story of four addicts living in Brooklyn who we see spiral with unstoppable momentum down into drug addiction hell over the seasons of one year.You feel for all of these characters, but the one you will pity most is Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow played brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn. Sara hangs on to the pathetic dream of being on her favorite TV game show and losing weight to fit into her beloved red dress. Enter the diet pills. The scene where Sara explains to her son Harry (Jared Leto) that she &quot;likes the way&quot; she feels now. &quot;Now, I smile,&quot; she says. You get the feeling that Sara is teetering on the edge of madness, and more heartbreaking, she is aware of it. Her later scenes tear you apart as she plunges straight down into insanity, with no hope of ever coming back, because she doesn't want to come back.Jared Leto delivers another outstanding performance as Harry Goldfarb, Sara's heroin addict son. Harry really wants his mother to be happy, and when he learns that she is addicted to speed, he breaks down and sobs on the way home. But a shot of heroin makes him all right again. He and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans-who is very very good) decide to start dealing heroin themselves, but the scheme goes horribly wrong. Also very affecting is Jennifer Connelly as Harry's girlfriend Marion, who will do anything for her next fix, including prostituting herself. Harry even sends her out with a man when he knows that she will have to have sex with him to get much needed cash. This is the wedge that drives them apart, only reconciling when it is too late for both of them.This is all seen with an unflinching eye, holding nothing back. Darren Aronofsky's highly effective visual style pays off in the powerful punch of the final montage of scenes which shows the fate of the four characters we feel for so deeply. The music jars us to attention as Sara undergoes electro-shock therapy, Harry's infected arm is amputated, Tyrone tries to drift to sleep in prison, and as Marion willingly suffers sexual degradation. The final images show Tyrone dreaming of his mother, Harry sobbing that Marion will never come see him, Sara lost in insanity, and Marion emotionlessly cradling a packet of coke. These four people, now without dreams, now without souls, curl up into fetal positions and sleep. The last clip shows Sara and Harry on the game show, and we see the look of crazed fear and sadness in Sara's lost eyes.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is the most powerful film I have ever seen. It takes a second viewing to catch all of its subtleties, notable the two women who told Sara about diet pills visiting a now cadaverus Sara in the hospital. If you can bear it, you will be changed forever by this sorrowful and realistic vision of four victims of addiction. See it.	5.0	Requiem for a Dream	2001-08-09	15	11	4

Marlon Wayans showed me he's more then just a crappy comedy actor and all the others were awesome as well. The story just keeps getting worse for all four main characters and their addiction. As it goes along you just know they are heading towards an ultimate climax in which they all reach their ultimate nightmarish lows.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"""Requiem for a dream"" has two separate stories, yet connected through family ties and drug-abuse.The first story is about Sara (Ellen Burstyn, the same from ""The exorcist"", if you can believe it). Sara is a middle-aged woman, overweight, addicted to watching television. When she receives a phone call telling her she will be on some TV show, it's the moment of her life. She has a red dress that she hasn't worn in some time and she can't wear it again because of her weight problem. So, she sees a doctor that tells her to take some pills instead of taking meals. Soon she is addicted and obcessed to the pills, and her life goes down the drain.The second story is about Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto, from ""My so-called life"" and ""Panic room""), his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely (before ""A beautiful mind"") and his friend played by Marlon Wayans. The lives of these three characters are already down the drain, because they're heroine addicts, and everything they do is in order to get more of the stuff.All four mentioned actors have impressive performances. Ellen Burstyn's transformation during the film is amazing. Her performance won her nominations for both the Academy and Golden GLobe awards (and she lost to Julia Roberts, proving that what wins these prizes is lobbying, not acting). Jared Leto is also very good, but he doesn't change much from the introspective and  quiet characters he is used to play. Marlon Wayans surprised me doing a serious character, also very good. But Jennifer Connelly's performance, in my opinion, was the strongest. For once, she put aside her good looks and concentrated in doing a drug addict, sometimes ugly, desperate, puffy face, running nose, etc.Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with the director, Aronofsky, saying he wanted to provide the viewers with an emotional roller-coaster. There is no roller coaster in the movie, it's all plainly downhill from beginning to end. I found  interesting some of the technics used by the director, like using mostly closed sets (specially towards the end), showing the prison-like life the characters were going into; and the camera attached to the actors' bodies, closing on their faces, was also different from what I'm used to watching in movies.The title is perfect for this movie. What is the ""Requiem for a dream""? It's when you look back through your life and you realise that it wasn't as close as what you'd wanted it to be, you only spent the chance you'd got for living.Grade 9.0/10"	5.0	A punch in the stomach	2003-02-28	8	7	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A345NBUKYXR8M3	"J. Terry ""mandy terry"""	"I just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone's MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.Riveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, ""a tour through hell.""  This film makes you think.  The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.During the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn't depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.All of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.I felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn't close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.The film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.Overall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.All in all this is an 5 star film."	5.0	requiem	2006-09-03	11	10	1

Because in other movies, people use drugs and you never actually get to see the real truth behind drug use and abuse.  Every movie teaches the audience of how &quot;cool&quot; and fun drugs can be.  But not one movie that I have been witness to has captured the reality of addiction and other possible problems you encounter when involved with drugs.  This movie was great.  Specially because, unlike fairy-tales, the main characters do not live happily ever after.  It starts with three friends that are trying to make it in the city.

I picked this up on a whim from my local video store, and was blown away. Not only is the storyline compelling and somewhat shocking, the cinematography is such that it adds to and influences the viewers interpretation of the movie. The way they picture the characters doing drugs, for instance, is effective and unexpected. The turn of events is unpredictable, but not to the point where the movie gets confusing. Despite how desperate and ill (both mentally and physically) the characters may be, it is easy to pick out things about all of them that one can relate to. The message that the movie leaves you with is deep within the plot, and I am certain that it differs from person to person. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.	5.0	eye-opening film	2004-10-10	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A32O4GWGVV9VAG	jumpy1	Sorry Hubert but see, Requiem for a Dream might be seen as interesting, from a standpoint of, say, film technique. The photography, the editing, the acting, all superb. In that sense, the DVD is great becuz some of those extras? about filming and writing? are more interesting than the film itself. But storywise, major disappointment Hubert--just one or two scenes dragged out to fill an hour and a half, beating and beating the same campy message as that movie, Reefer Madness I mean, it's filmed much more stylishly than that, you know, but you see what I mean. And what's the deal with that soundtrack, that weird ominous music? Hubert, really. Do drug addicts hear string quartets in their heads all day? Whatareya trying to make here? A horror movie? With an old lady taking speed from her doctor, and talking to the TV? It has such a great, poetical title. I really expected, given the fact that so many successful people are addicted to these very drugs, you'd try to show how addiction destroys the pursuit of dreams. I mean, with a title like that...But these characters, they had no real dreams to pursue. They did nothing at all with themselves all day. Nothing, Hubert! Nothing! Not to mention that they were bone-chillingly stupid. Don't get me wrong--Ellen Burstyn was great. It's just that given the amount of speed she was taking over just a few months, it doesn't make sense, what she does. Do you actually know anyone who has taken speed for a few months? And the girl who becomes a whore - puleez. Girls who look like her have much better options when they decide to be a drug whore. Hubert, you were just trying to make a splash. Admit it. You were just trying to make us scared. But you made me laugh, Hubert. You really did. This sh** really sells, you were right. You don't even have to know what you're talking about. You just have to put it out there. People eat this sh** up!  Man, you're doing it, man. Wish I could, too. I really do.	3.0	Requiem for what dreams, exactly?	2009-08-26	9	1	8

This film is by far the best film I have seen all year with a large dramatic contrast from beginning to end.  Darren and Hubert Selby Jr.(the writer of the book) make you fall in love with the characters in the beginning making you leave the movie shaking and in absolute shock like you best friend or puppy has died.This film gets a definate A+ in direction and an A++ for Mathew Libitiques work in cinematography.  The fast paced cuts, fantabulious character interaction, and electronic joy ride score of music makes this movie total eye candy and an emotional roller coaster.Other credits I would like to not is Ellen Burnstyne's performance as &quot;Sarah Goldfarb&quot;.  Although, she has not been in a major motion picture since the 1970s she once again astonishes audiences with what I would believe to be the best creative dramatic contrast in characterization in modern film.On another acting note, Marlen Waynes also takes us all by surpass by a great dramatic role in contrast to his norm of comedy.  I like you better in the dramatic style stick with it!In summation, I recommend this film to anyone with a brain to be toyed with.  This is the definite must see of this year, although it probably is not for the faint of heart...-The Justin B. Scale of Overcriticalness	5.0	Aronofsky wins my mind again!	2001-06-03	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1P4BK48KU8FRV	Justin	This film functions on several levels, which adds to it's ability to convey a myriad of meanings.  With that in mind this film can be taken a couple of ways.  One way is to view it as a more intense cautionary tale of drug abuse.  On this level nothing comes close.  Take any anti-drug commercial out there and it won't hold a candle to this film.  While watching it I didn't doubt that were this film to be shown to even the worst of junkies that they would certainly wish to quit their habit.  The film is able to convey the message of drug abuse so easily due to superb imagery and an amazing soundtrack which I did not hesitate to buy. Another way to take this movie is a bit more depressing.  The whole of the movie ends on a massive down note.  It's basically a destruction of hope.  And after watching this movie it's kind of hard not to be a little depressed or at least sorry for the characters who in the end, lose it all.  And this brings me to another part of the movie which is excellent, is the ability for the actors to really draw the viewer in.  These characters make you want to feel sorry for them, and you cannot help but emote with them.  However this bond between the characters and viewer does make the end of the movie a little hard to take.I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that this movie would be very hard to watch a second time, however I do plan to do so.  Because even though the movie is more intense than anything else I've ever seen, it's also perhaps the best movie I've ever seen.  I'd recommend this movie to just about anyone above the age of 16.  The movie really makes you think, another major accomplishment of the film.  So with that I'd advise you to watch this film, you won't regret it.	5.0	Awe Inspiring	2003-06-01	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1DNYGN6CYWJKZ	Justinian	I've been reading through many of these reviews and what I tend to see from the lower ranked reviews is that they didn't like the camera &quot;tricks&quot;. Aronofsky didn't do that to be edgy or &quot;hip&quot; he did that because when your on amphetamines, you &quot;speed&quot; up, and &quot;slow (crash) down. He's trying to give you the experience of the addiction. The vien collapsing and the cutting off the arm isn't shock, its real. That's what can happen in the worst cases. Still, something to be watched, a beauty of a picutre acting/directing/score wise.	5.0	What people don't realise....	2004-08-03	2	2	0

Although the movies isn't really about drugs, its more about thier depletion of hope. The movie is faced paced with amazing cinematography which makes you feel that your on a trip yourself.The movie is definatly not for the weak at heart, its disturbing and has a lot of gore in the last 10 minutes. The ending is definatly depressing, I saw this about 4 days ago and I'm still disturbed by it.Requiem For A Dream is a great movie and should definatly be shown in classrooms to show students what drug addiction can do.	5.0	Disturbing Masterpiece	2001-08-09	3	2	1

I wish I had when I was younger. Do not try to figure out what to expect, do not dissect every frame with pompous imaginings like some viewers and commenters like MauricioD. He seems to be obsessed with his definition of surrealism. I'm sure Aronofsky didn't look in a dictionary to mold his movie or to be weighed down by a definition. Surreal is in the eyes of the beholder. Just sit back and be mesmerized by a well-woven story with a powerful message. It will blow you away! It's worth 3 times the price.

It has a crappy ending that leaves you feeling terrible for those involved and put me in a bad mood  for wasting approximately 2 hrs. of my time when i could have watched somthing different.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1FYDFO4BZJYOF	Karmyn Guthrie	People in the business of movies have a firm grasp of the fact that we, the consumers of such huge quantities of mass entertainment, are getting very hard to shock. It's hard to make us feel much by showing us any sort of shocking underbelly, exposive any kind of meloncholy truth.  This movie made me, a jaded college kid, cry so hard i almost vomited.  It seems that in order to be moved by something fake it must strongly, creepily resemble something real.This little shard of reality which the movie slices you with is not &quot;the horrors,the perils of drug addiction.&quot;  I don't think this is purely a drug movie by any means.  In my mind anyway it is one of those movies that will enter the canon I will pretentiously call  &quot;movies that expose the deep patheticness inherent in modern american life&quot;  Was anyone else yelling &quot;God Harry, go visit your lonely lonely mother for christssake.&quot;  How can human lives be so devoid of meaning that people lust after cupcakes, adoring tv audiences, empty girls gyrating on tables.  No wonder they use chemicals to get at least a burst of feeling.  Drugs don't kill people who are already dead.That having been said, the scenes with the frighteningly good Ellen Burstyn seem like they were from a completely different movie that was cut with the pretty mediocre movie the young people starred in.  She was the only thing popping out of an otherwise two-dimensional pop-up book.	3.0	look at all the lonely people	2001-12-05	1	0	1

Nijsen"""	From the harrowing opening scene where a guilt-ridden son steals his distraught mother's television set, Requiem for a Dream draws the viewer into a bleak and merciless landscape of shattered dreams and drug addictions.  Against the gloomy backdrop of Coney Island, New York, director Aronofsky stages the parallel tales of Harry Goldfarb, whose heroin addiction goes from bad to worse, and his mother Sara (a heart-rending performance by Ellen Burstyn), who tries to recapture her past happiness with `diet'-pills. Underscored by darkly brooding violin music, this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet the undaunted viewer is rewarded with an unforgettable tragedy unique in the sheer force of its dramatic story-telling.	5.0	Not for the faint of heart	2011-09-10	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AG65V3LSYO191	Kate	This film is certainly not one to show your children to discourage drug use. Undoubtedly, it discourages drug use, but it is perhaps the most graphic film I have ever witnessed; certainly in the leagues of 'A Clockwork Orange' etc. I wouldn't hestiate to say that this is perhaps more graphic that the former, and again, I believe it to be more disturbing.It truly will make you think twice about touching substances, with its bleak take on the world of junkies, from 'diet pills' to hard hitting heroin. There is absolutely nothing positive about this film, and that is perhaps its most effective feature.It is drug abuse at its worst; desperation to the highest degree, and it is both marvellously acted and written, with hugely innovative and clever cinematophy.Certainly, one of the best films of 2000, and one that I personally won't be forgetting too soon. It has certainly altered the seeming innocence of diet pills for me!	5.0	I have seen no shortage of disturbing films..but this...	2001-09-04	1	1	0

As a lover of D.A's work in film I must say that this film is pieced together with the practicality and ethic of an epic tragedy. As I watched I found his usage of frame and camera work to be quite facinating. Being one who has worked with a steady cam, I must say he knows exactly what he is doing.The characters are so simply drawn out and with a dark grace put together for you. I find it not just a film about narcotics but about how life takes toll on our everyday situations, as displayed with Ellen Burstyn's character of a widow drawn into the realm so similiar to her sons, yet still so blind to it.The usage of color and light, as well as angle brings us directly into the characters lives, giving us a piece of what they hunger for, and in the end how we realize we all hunger for something so similiar.

This movie absolutely ripped me inside out. Ellen Burstyn's acting blew me away (if she doesn't get the Oscar for her performance, the Acadamy may be getting a letter from me). I barely recognized Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans' performance really impressed me.  Aronofsky's directing style is so beautiful and so gut-wrenchingly realistic that this film is far more profound than any other film I have seen.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y	kendall lopere	"Requiem for a Dream is an interesting and enjoyable diversion that ultimately has little to say. The movie is best read as a chronicle  of the slide into addiction of 4 connected, sane, likeable, fully functional individuals that regularily use drugs.  Whether or not anyone involved in the production of the movie has ever used drugs is open to debate.  In many ways in fact the movie might have been funded by the Government's ""War on Drugs"".  There is no redemption here.  Everyone who uses drugs is destroyed by them.  Several key arguments of the anti-drug lobby are played out here.  Watch the ""Gateway Drug Theory"" in action, as all the addicts begin to consume more and harder drugs! Watch the ""Decline in Societies morals"" as the rich daddy's girl who could be YOUR daughter becomes a [hooker], allowing her body to be graphically defiled in all sorts of ways to fund her cravings. However, this kind of moralizing and patronizing approach ends up being rather heavy-handed - half way through the movie I wanted to scream out ""OK! Drugs are bad!!  We get it!!! Now work on the plot!!!!"". Sadly there is no feedback here, and we continue to be hit on the head with the anti-drug message until the film thankfully ends.That's not to say it's a bad movie - the plot thread involving the mother is the highlight of the piece, making a very important point that legal drugs can be as addicitive and destructive as illegal ones, the mother-son relationship must strike a chord with anyone who has parents, and the tale of the doomed lovers could be as Shakespearean as the title suggests.The editing of the movie leaves something to be desired, as this movie could be a textbook case of the dangers of using gimmicks for gimmicks sake.  The worst abuse of this is when the director decides to use a split screen approach to fully capture the scene when 2 people are having a conversation in the same room, a few meters from each other.  It's pointless, it adds nothing and it detracts from the on-screen drama....To conclude, if you want a movie to scare you off drugs, but that actually has a plot and is entertaining and hilarious too, watch ""Trainspotting"" or ""Spun"" instead."	3.0	Coney Island Freak Show...	2003-08-29	27	11	16
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A30GOMEFT6969Q	Kenneth Tua	What an amazing movie, I was speachless when I saw it. Everything is so great about that you won't believe it. It is the kind of movie that has everything well done, not a single error of dislikely thing, the type of movie that makes buy the dvd and the soundtrack. Darren Aronofsky is a genious no one can stant him. It's amazing to watch Ellen Burstyn and her passion for her TV game show, and how she changes at the end. Her acting is brilliant. Each drug in this movie causes the same mortal effect, it shows you clearly what could happen when your likes and passions get out of hands. Jared Leto prooves to me he's one of the best out there, he's such a great actor and has that strange look which is so fashionable and physically adaptable like in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Highway&quot;, it's like whole new different Jareds for each movie he makes, he is definately unique. I never thought Marlon Wayans could make it so fine, in fact the casting of this movie is perfect, the visual effects are beautiful, the music is SO for the movie, it goes exactly in every part, the movie is so complete that you can't ask for anything else. So if you want to see a movie like no other, something that you are not going to in any other movie unless it is from the same director, buy this movie and buy the soundtrack. It is just great.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1GSSL3MHX1NA5	KevinSF	This is, without a doubt, the most intense and amazing film I have ever seen.  Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of the decade (and perhaps, of the century).  I could barely walk or breathe or think or do anything but FEEL when the film ended.  And be forewarned, you will not be feeling very good.  You should be in a good state of mind when you see it, or at least have someone you can be with or talk to at some point shortly thereafter.  I cannot remember the last time I was so profoundly affected by a film.  This is absolutely brilliant film making, and performances just simply do not come any better than this (and probably never will again).  It will be such an incredible crime if Ellen Burstyn does not win the Academy Award for this performance.  &quot;Requiem&quot; is also visually astonishing, and contains one of the most haunting and achingly beautiful scores I have ever heard.  For all of the well-deserved praise that has surrounded the film &quot;Traffic&quot; this year, &quot;Requiem&quot; is perhaps the most soul-searing and devastating depiction of the pain, despair, and horror of addiction that you may ever see.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AU00XG6EK3RH2	Kevin W. Howlett	"This movie is one of those rarely-made movies that have created a paradigm shift in my day-to-day operations.Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky draws on the writings of Hubert Selby, Jr. to create a lasting image of the destructive effects addiction has on the human body and spirit, one that gest underneath the skin and stays with you.The movie chronicles the lives of four connected characters:  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  Each of these people have their own visions of happiness that begins innocently enough in their minds the way hopes, wishes, and dreams do in all of us--little ""what if""s and ""It'd sure be nice to""s that usually die on the back burner where they were born.But in this movie, other factors come in that cruelly give this quartet the opportunity (some would say excuse) to pursue these dreams to the point where they become an unhealthy obsession from which there is no escape, only a temporary release from the pain by plunging further into their dreams, which by the film's ending, have mothered their own personal nightmares.Many people who reviewed this movie have made the error of stating that this is an anti-drug movie.  While the connection is more than apparent in the film (all four characters are putting some kind of drug into their bodies) the real core message and point of the film is how addiction in general, to anything, had the ability and strength to overwhelm and subvert the human spirit.  Take for example, movies.Going to the movies (or watching one at home) is a great way to ""get away"" from life for a while and momentarily forget about the things that make up the darker threads of the human tapestry.  The problem arises, when one enjoys the escapist quotient of movies to the point where all other activites that make up real life are eschewed in favor of this quick fix.  The same statement can be made about drugs, alcohol, video games, etc.The real tragedy in the movie is that all four characters flat-out admit that their willpower and perserverance have succumbed to their addictions.  The most memorable is the pivotal scene at the end of the first act, when Sara, who has been told that she will appear on television, talks to Harry about the diet pills she's been taking so she can fit back into the red dress she had worn at Harry's graduation.  Sara is no road scholar, so she is unaware what the diet pills could do to her if she ever overdoses, but she loves the feeling that she gets when she takes them.  She never overtly admits that her taking the pills makes her happy, but that is the real truth she hides from herself.  She doesn't want to stop taking them because the feeling she gets from them is better than life the way it was before she was perscribed them:  boring, widowed, lonely Sara, sitting in front of the TV and nursing her box of chocolates.The movie is not about drugs.  It is about addiction, and it shows us what addiction does to people with the stark honesty and brutality that no high school class or parental seminar or psychology professor could ever have hoped to achieve."	5.0	The Triumph of Addiction	2002-12-14	1	0	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	"""Requiem For A Dream"" is director Darren Aronofsky's second movie, based on the book by Hubert Selby, following his powerful black-and-white ""Pi"". Starring Ellen Burstyn (oscar-nominated for her role), Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans in the top 4 roles, plus Sean Gulette, Mark Margolis, Samia Shoaib, and Ajay Naidu from ""Pi"" in minor roles. The score is by Clint Mansell, who also scored ""Pi"".Darren Aronofsky expands his unusual visual style to include split-screens, stop motion or sped-up motion sequences, extreme close-ups and wide angles.The movie starts with the son Harry (Leto) taking mom Sara's (Burstyn) TV to pawn for drug money. Shortly after, mom gets a phone call telling her that she has been selected to appear on a TV show in the near future. She anticipates her appearance on the TV and finds she can't fit into her old red dress. She tries some diets, such as a hard-boiled egg and grapefruit, then goes to a quack doctor for diet pills - purple in the morning, blue in the afternoon, orange in the evening, green at night. She eventually loses it and ultimately lands up in the hospital.Jennifer Connelly is Harry's girlfriend Marion, a fashion designer. As a result of Harry and Marion's heroin addiction, Marion performs more and more sex with other people for drugs or drug money.Harry and his friend, Tyrone (Wayans) spend most of the movie buying or trying to buy drugs, and getting high. They eventually plan to buy a large quantity to re-sell it to get a share for free. Ultimately, after driving toward Florida for a drug buy, Harry ends up in the hospital with an infected arm, and Tyrone gets put in jail.In a fantasy, mom and son finally appear on the ""Tappy Timmons"" self-help show.The reasonably-priced DVD has a commentary by director Aronofsky, a commentary by the cinematographer, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and some other goodies. Unrated director's cut, which is currently #51 on the IMDB top-movie list, has scenes of constant drug use, strong language, and explicit sex.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AKS9SJTHTU0OM	K. Gordon	Amazing on a purely cinematic level - assaultive, hyper-kinetic, fullof breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good(Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'mever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is reallygetting at. There are interesting implications that our real addictionis to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but thosethemes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made withthe technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer ofdepth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along.By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over thetop, and a bit illogical.Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it'sbravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority inadmiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it.	4.0	Flawed, but thrilling film-making	2011-04-24	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1E57S74SY6QHG	K. Havel	This powerful story of four lives going on a downward spiral is gauranteed not to disappoint any viewer.  Darren Aronofsky delivers a message that i have never seen in a movie before.  Addiction can be anything, and it can happen to anybody.  A son, his best friend, and his girlfriend, have dreams of making it big, but quickly find out that their drug addiction is sending them in the wrong direction.  And a mother who goes from trying to lose weight to trying NOT to lose her mind.  This movie is up there with the best i have ever seen, and it will leave a lasting mark on anyone who watches it.  This movie is gripping, shocking, and shows the absolute cold hard truth of what goes on in the world every day. Even tough the general topic has been the plot of many movies in the past, Requiem for a Dream is truly one of a kind!	5.0	Totally Flawless	2003-10-09	3	2	1

It depends entirely on contrived and unnecessary camera tricks as well as cliched destructive patterns that are supposed to serve as warnings against drugs.  Also, there is the arbitrary placing of symbols throughout, only enhancing the thick stench of pseudo-Freudianism that is brought by the ridiculously obvious oedipal anxiety that the Leto and Burstyn characters suffer (imagining his girlfriend in a red dress while his mother obsesses over a red dress).This film was apparently an attempt to manipulate trite patterns that attemtp to conceal an overall lack of creativity.  That makes sense, since this film is patently uncreative.  I finished this film knowing nothing more about the characters than when I started, and caring even less.  Development and depth are ommitted in this film and all that is left is a pretentious and superficial attempt at something ""postmodern"""	1.0	Pretentious	2005-03-09	37	18	19
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1GPQYZFVU4NC2	"""kidinterrupted"""	When this movie opened in Boston last November, I dragged my best friend to see it with me.  I knew I couldn't go alone.  Two hours later, I knew WHY I couldn't see it alone and was racked with nightmares for weeks afterward.&quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is the second film by indie-auteur Darren Aronofsky, former Brooklyn native and Harvard dropout.  Good thing he screwed up at Harvard or this film would never have been made.  After reading Hubert Selby's &quot;almost as disturbing&quot; 1964 novel &quot;Last Exit To Brooklyn,&quot; he discovered this book, the story of four formerly everyday innocents sucked into and trapped by a downward spiral into a place with which hell could never compete.  The odd part is that he never finished it.  It disturbed him too much.  I can identify with that.The visuals that encompass this film are so stunning, so frightening, so spastically violent and cruel that you may find yourself hiding behind the nearest large object to avoid the wrath of what leaps out of the screen and assaults you with all its might.  The Kronos Quartet, who provides the disturbingly beautiful soundtrack, plays with a continued intensity through the entire film up to including its vicious finale.  In addition to the cinematography and score, though, are four actors that easily make this film one of the top ten of the last ten years.  Hands down.  No questions asked.Ellen Burstyn's performance in this movie was easily one of the most heart-wrenching, dynamic sucker-punches in a VERY long time.  To watch this sweet old woman, Sara Goldfarb, descend into loneliness and drug addiction will easily bring you to tears, particularly at its finale.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans cause you to do a double-take as the best friends, Harry and Tyrone, who go into business for themselves only to find themselves worse off than they ever were before (to say it mildly).  They both take off into directions they have never previously achieved.  And Jennifer Connelly's artistic sweetheart-turned-whore is nearly as worthy of Oscar praise as her co-star Burstyn is.  I can't imagine any of them will ever have better performances in their lifetime.To say this is an excellent movie is an understatement.  To say it is graphic in terms of its violence, sexuality and drug use is also an understatement.  Be prepared to have the images of their hell swimming through your mind with every moment of the weeks ahead.  But, whatever you do, don't be afraid of what I say as well as what the other reviewers say; you MUST see this movie.  You will never forget it.	5.0	Complete and total shock	2001-05-23	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2SCB0WFBSPY81	Kiersten Ann Dalonzo	As anyone who has ever read a book, then watched a movie based on it knows, depth and nuance are close to impossible to reproduce and by consequence emotional impact and often the core essence of the book is lost.  Like, I really enjoyed &#34;A Beautiful Mind&#34;, from Ron Howard, but it didn't, I'm not sure it could have, effectively brought the book to life.  But, - at least for me - the &#34;Requiem for a Dream&#34; movie came as close as a movie could.  The off-beat, off-key characters, so intertwined yet disconnected in the book make the movie, as they did the book, special too.The opening scene of the movie brought me instantly back to the opening scene in the book.  Many of the scenes in the movie are dead on. The so very surreal delusional pipe dreams of junkies and speed freaks, the core of the book, are also at the core of the movie.  The movie  is even somewhat successful at addressing the slowly building elements that foreshadow disaster - as the naive hope, and innocent fun of &#34;Summer&#34; moves through a gradually colder darkening &#34;Fall&#34;, and ends in a &#34;Winter&#34; where each of the protagonists (to me they're protagonists) end, not in the the Promised Lands of their hopes and dreams, but prisoners in a frozen hell from which escape seems impossible.For me personally, the powerfully sad and harsh consequences of hard core drug addiction revealed in the movie, and particularly in the last scenes, hit just as hard as in the book.Although I can't say with certainty whether most others will be as moved as i was, I want to believe they will gain an empathetic understanding about the truth for many addicts (although actually it's by far the truth about most addicts).  They aren't bad people.  They are just people.  Lost in the throes of addiction.  Losing themselves in the process.[The book and movie were so powerful for me because I'm an addict.  I used for many years and for the last several years of my active addiction I was a junkie.  I was as at home on the streets of NY as I was the town I lived in Pennsylvania.  I lived for that next hit.  A shot of heroin was wonderful.  A shot of heroin with coke (a speedball) was nirvana.  It was over twenty years ago, on my way to the city I nodded off and hit a boulder.  I woke up in a hospital, and after a month in ICU, then two surgeries was told I would never walk again.  No lesson learned and feeling sorry for myself, I used for 4 more years.I was lucky.  I survived.  I had two innocent sons who were starting to see their mother was doing horrible things and i finally realized they didn't deserve that.  They were my motivation to get clean and in doing so I discovered a world I didn't know existed (or had forgotten about).I went back to school and earned a degree.  And although I can only work part time because of physical issues, I know that what i do does helps others (I'm a social worker).  Best of all, the boys are grown now and they barely remember those dark cold days.  What they remember most is the the warmth and love of recovery.  I can't help but wonder what became of the characters in &#34;Requiem&#34;.  I know many people who never made it out of addiction alive, four of whom were close friends.  But there is a joyful side.  I know many many more who are living full, fulfilling lives because they found recovery.  It doesn't matter if it's NA, AA or any other way.  In the world today there are millions of addicts who have found a way to get clean, stay clean and become people who give to life and are no longer taking from it.]- Kiersten Ann Dalonzo	5.0	The Movie More Than Nails Essence of Book	2014-01-08	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L	"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip"""	Man, what a sad, scary, excellent, grim, disturbing, well-made movie. The more I read about this movie and learned about it, the more fascinating it seemed. I also am one of those people who, when they hear a movie is extremely shocking and disturbing, get a burning urge to see it as fast as I can to see if it shocks me (especially if it's unrated or NC-17), since I am pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.The plot concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. REAL ugly. (Watching someone shoot up directly into a gangrene-infected, pus-filled crater in his arm kind of gave me a whole new definition of the word ugly.) Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress so she can appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out by being addicted to TV and candy, but has the bad luck to go to a doctor who-in what I thought was the only unrealistic part of the film- gives her an RX for 'diet pills', that turn out to actually be speed. I say unrealistic because, as anyone who has ever worked in the medical profession knows, very few doctors will NOT just write someone who goes to them for the first time to see them for weight loss a huge prescription for extremely powerful and addictive controlled substances without so much as an examination. If the movie took place any time before the early 80's, this would have been a little easier to swallow.Anyway, I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes pills and starts losing weight, as well as suddenly becoming very energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug, her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through the film (one of the few that had a tiny bit of comic relief) Harry visits her --the only visit he makes during the movie where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope money.  He is briefly riding high (in more ways than one) and tells her he bought her a big screen TV-he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that &quot;TV is her fix&quot;. He looks like he's getting a bad feeling when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning, and then he hears her grinding her teeth, and figures it out. This is the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung-out hallucinations-starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. An agressive fridge with a mind of its own sounds Monty Python-esque when you first hear about it, but trust me, you won't be laughing by the end of the movie.One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug, and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high, there's a slam-bang fast cut montage of the same images over and over; a sigh, a pupil dilating, cells changing color. The scenes where Sarah hallucinates are pretty close to the real thing. The description I probably agree with most came from Darren Aronofsky himself-he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome, depressing, worst-case-scenario fates of all 4 characters are just as intense, hard to watch, and nightmarish as I heard they were. I don't think I will ever forget Harry's mother's transformation from a harmless, plump, friendly older woman to someone so frightening looking that people cringe away in fear and revulsion at the sight of her.My only complaints would be that I wish it were longer, with more time for character development.  I would have liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before they were addicts, as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is great- Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros- I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it, but here...wow. I would have liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before, but he is excellent and also almost unrecognizable  (he said he dropped 1/5 of his weight for the role and boy does it show). Connelly I disliked so much before that I would actively avoid seeing movies she was in, but I was very impressed and convinced that she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime- not only convincing, but she was dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell, which many actresses over 50 would probably not be brave enough to do.Not recommended if you're easily shocked, squeamish, or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place, stay away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board.  And we were all people who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition, this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supported and glorified that whole 'heroin chic' crap. Also a good movie if you are having some problems in your life and want to put them in perspective VERY fast.	5.0	Good Lord!	2001-01-03	28	23	5

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A136MAOWGCU2C2	K.T. May	"It's not too often that I give a movie the full ""ten out of ten"" stars that a website like IMDB will allow you to rate a movie, but I just recently had the pleasure of viewing Requiem For a Dream and all I can say is, wow.  I know I say this often, but this is a film that will stay with you for a very long time.  Many critics say it is a film about drug addiction, but those of us who adore the film on a much deeper level can tell you that it is certainly about much more than that.This 2000 film, (released on DVD in 2001 and directed by Darren Aronofsky of Black Swan and The Fighter) stars Jared Leto (Fight Club), Ellen Burstyn (The Fountain), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie) and Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), is based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., and is a fantastic character study that deeply explores how quickly things can unravel when people want things so desperately, they'll do anything to get them.Leto stars as Harry Goldfarb, the son to Burstyn's Sara, who is in love with the beautiful Marion (Connelly), an aspiring fashion designer.  Wayans is Tyrone, Harry's best friend who, along with Harry, tries to pursue a better life through the ill-conceived idea of ""the big score"", i.e. that one drug deal that will allow the dreams of this threesome to flourish, possibly affording them the luxury of leaving their Coney Island homes behind.While the events that play out in the lives of the younger three are tragic enough as the movie unfolds, it is Sara's story that, when pinned up next to the tales of the other three, add an extra dimension of weight to some already pretty weighty material.  Sara is, arguably, the character for whom most people's hearts break the hardest.  She receives a phone call that she is chosen as a guest to be on her favorite infomercial.  She sees this as a reason to live and begins to take ""diet pills"" to help her fit back into the dress she wore at Harry's graduation, the one her late husband loved so much.I won't lie to you--this movie ends in what is far from a happy ending, which makes it much more realistic and hard-hitting than most films you will watch in your lifetime.  The performances from each of the principal cast members are heart-breaking and true-to-life in their own right.  Not to mention, the score composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet will earworm its way into your mind and lay eggs there for days.  Per the Wikipedia page for the film, the pieces here are notable in that they are quite adept at making normally softer sounding instruments sound more cold, harsh and uninviting.Words cannot do this film justice.  What can, however, are the 2,000 cut scenes (in a movie that would normally receive the treatment of between 500-600), the fool-proof and gut-wrenching performances, the haunting score, the heartbreaking plot and the power of the hold this movie will take on you and not free you for weeks afterward.  If you want to see as many quality films in your lifetime as you can, seriouslly, add Requiem For a Dream to your list."	5.0	10 Years Later...	2011-02-02	4	3	1

This movie is shocking in many ways and if you want to watch a movie that is going to make you feel all happy when you get done watching it this is not the one for you, you might want to go rent disney or something.  What this movie is is an intelligent and provacotive look at a world in which there is much hope to go around but that hope is never realized, it is a honest look at what it is like for some to live a life of drug addiction and it is also a wonderfull and shocking and entertaining movie.	5.0	Something original in a hollywood world	2001-05-10	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2HSLWMVQ7DZWM	K Zalasky	Requiem for a Dream has to be one of the best movies that I have watched.  This movie does not contain explosions, car chases, or shoot-outs that other movies rely on to draw an audience.  What Requiem possesses is far beyond that on an intellectual and emotional level.  This film will take you on a journey through aspects of life that most people either ignore or don't realize exists.  RFAD is about four individuals whose dreams to better themselves (be it finacially, physically, or emotionally) take possession of their being and eventually destroy any aspect of their lives worth living for.  Requiem illustrates how the desire to be accepted by others and oneself can lead to disastorous results.  Words cannot describe the emotions one will experience while watching this work of art.  Journey through a tragic example of addiction, desire, and loss as Requiem will put into perspective what truly is important in life.	5.0	An emotional plunge into a realm of despair	2005-03-02	3	2	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3P316WPF1HDBX	"Laurence Doyle ""(Actually Simon Doyle)"""	I started watching this with only a really vague idea in my mind; one of a pretentious, arsey look at modern day drug problems and stupidly over-the-top camera techniques.To a certain extent I was disappointed, but to a certain extent the film lived up to my expectations.Truely there were some incredible performances from a highly gifted cast (special mention must be made of Ellen Burstyn, who terrified me, sickened me and made me feel so sorry for her simultaniously.One the surface this is a no-nonsense, hard hitting film about what drugs can do to you; how they affect you and the people you love. All four characters start out bright and normal, but slowly sink into a world consumed by drugs (namely heroin).Yet what brought this film down for me was how it lost its way towards the end. The director started off brilliantly, with pieces of film that were hard-hitting and terrible, but that people could relate to. As the film progresses, we are sent whirling through a number of unnecessary camera tecnhiques and voice techniques, not to mention graphic scenes merely for effect (the cutting off of an arm etc). Yet the ending leaves us with a sense of sadness and regret, but paints a vivid picture in our minds; one of both warning and preaching. The degredatoin the characters suffer are all a means to an end for the point the direction wishes to make: please don't use heroin!To conclude, there is no doubt in my mind that this was an interesting film to watch, with great underlying meaning, excellent acting and, at times, some highly skillful directing. However, I found it hard towards the end, to engage my interest, as it just went from strange to stranger.If I could give half stars, this would be 3 and a half, but I think in conclusion it has a well earned 3 stars.

Beautiful, but dark and horrible.  After seeing the Selby interview and reading some of the quotes from the novel, I may check out the book.  I recommend this disc for the interview.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	This is a wonderful, dark film about drug addiction, as well as the destruction of hope. It is marvelously cast with wonderful performances by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly. It is Ellen Burstyn's bravura performance, however, that blows the viewer away.Burstyn plays the role of Sara Goldfarb, a lonely, middle aged widow who lives in Brooklyn and has a handsome, though heroin addicted son, Harry, affectingly played by Jared Leto. Harry spends most of his time shooting up and dealing drugs with his buddy, Tyrone, deftly played by Marlon Wayans. Harry has a pretty, well to do girlfriend, Marian, played by Jennifer Connelly, who walks on the wild side with Harry and begins her own downward spiral with drugs.Sara is in denial about how serious her son's drug habit really is. She is, in fact, the great enabler when it comes to Harry. The concept of tough love never even enters her mind. After all, Harry is all she has. For her, hope springs eternal, when it comes to her beloved Harry.Sara spends her days glued to her tv set, watching her favorite game show or talking to other lonely, middle aged women who spend their time sitting in front of the multi-unit dwelling in which they all live. Her life is limited and stark, until she one day receives a call inviting her to be a contestant on that game show she watches. It is here that her life begins to unravel, as she goes on a diet in order to fit into her favorite red dress in preparation for her possible television debut. Fueled by diet pills provided by a so called &quot;doctor&quot;, she begins to live a life that parallels that of her son.The director, Darren Aronofsky, inventively shows the viewer the experience of drug addiction in a novel way, through a montage of vivid sensory and imagery bursts that become more frequent and intense, as the drug use in the film becomes more pervasive and relentless. He takes the viewer through the personal downward spiral of each of the four main characters in the movie, as they hurl on a personal collision course fueled by each one's respective drug addiction.  It is one of the most frightening and horrifying portrayals of drug addiction ever to grace the screen. Marvelously directed and acted, this is a film to remember.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AW3IRKSV25IUS	Leonel Sanchez Trapani	Hi folks around the globe! I saw this movie in the cinema immediately it came out and was at once enthralled by it. I just love the cinematography, the unrellenting pace of the movie and the actors' performances, each one of them is worth a big big hand. I was particularly surprised at J. Connelly's acting skills, she's so much more than a pretty face. The subjects brought up the film (addiction, the crave for love, fate, responsibility) resonate deeply within you, allowing reflexions and debate. Summing up, I am delighted to have the DVD at home, as it gives you access to previously unseen footage, interviews and so forth. Just one thing, and if anyone has an answer I'm all ears...well, English is not my mother tongue and even if I do get 90% of the dialogues, there's the occasional slang word or phrase that I miss, that's why I count on English subtitles as something to turn to now and then. This DVD is supposed to include close captioning. There's no way I could decode it, though. Could someone tell me if they were able to? And if so, how? Last but not least, buy the director's cut, there's already enough fascism about so as to foster censorship. Down with censorship, up with quality Art. And no doubt Requiem for a Dream is cinema at its summit.	5.0	outstanding	2003-09-22	6	3	3
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A9P01SFMPMGXZ	Lesser Knowns	Everytime I go to the movies, I sit down in my seat and hope that something will drift across the screen and blow me away.  Finally, I've had such an experience.  Requiem is painfully nerve-breaking.  It gives a glimpse of how far the human mind can go after drugs and social pressure have pushed it off the edge of sanity.  The camara work shows the excruciating sensations felt by the characters through masterful angles and a diversity of lens that forces the viewer to see life in the most disturbing of ways.  The soundtrack adds to the psychological and physical havoc displayed on screen.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants to be shocked, horrified, bewildered, and moved beyond words and coherent thought.  Arronofsky is a cinematic artist, as well as a mastermind madman.  Don't be surprise if you feel things you've never felt before.	5.0	YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS ONE	2000-11-12	5	4	1

Everything in the film was done perfectly and the audience are just like going through the happiness and misery of the 4 protagonists with them. Magical isn't it?

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AZIZ8DF9DBFTD	"Levi ""Movie Man"""	Requiem for a dream is an amazing look at the development of drug addictions. Unfortunatly, these problems occur as a result of people trying to accomplish their dreams through the use of drugs.Although the story line in this movie may appear to be slow, Aronofsky is careful not to rush to the ending that the entire movie builds up for. He allows plenty of time for the characters and their respective problems to develop, which is all presented at the perfect pace- starting as petty and getting progressively worse. The character development is something overlooked but mandatory in a movie such as this.I must give specific mention to the music too. The music is the perfect compliment to the specific scenes and really displays the attitude of the scene as well.Overall, this movie is very depressing becuase it doesnt hold anything back and is made more depressing by the fact that incidents such as these are all too common.	5.0	Great Movie	2006-04-09	7	5	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3CMWWOO7AOZUG	L	"Requiem for a Dream will appeal to fans of such spirit-breakers as ""Magnolia"" and ""Happiness"", and it does sport a similarly bleak assault on its main characters. This movie, however, lacks the distinctly misanthropic snarl of those two films. It requires empathy and, it is, after all, a requiem for the lost dreams, not only of the characters in the film but of every person who has destroyed their lives with drug abuse.Having personally seen drugs decimate lives around me, I can tell you that these characters are archetypes of stories which have been played out again and again. Taken literally, this film is unbelievable. As amalgamations of the lives of real drug users, however, they're terrifyingly realistic. Heroin users can and do develop gangrene. Heavy amphetamine users do develop psychosis. Women who are addicted to heroin do get desperate enough to sell their bodies for the stuff and people who get caught do go to jail. While being a horror story about the dangers of drug use, this movie takes care to be believable in its portrayals not only of the effects of the drugs themselves but also the effects of those drugs on the relationships of the people involved and, more subtly on the reasons that people abuse drugs to begin with.This film IS a cautionary tale and a masterful one at that. By building hope in the beginning of the film, the director draws drug users in to understanding and empathy. By his exquisite detail he lets them know that he's no clueless Nancy Reagan shouting ""Just Say No"" at a captive audience. Then, once they fully relate to the characters he leads them down into the spiralling nightmares of their possible futures....Ellen Burstyn is unforgettable and Marlon Wayans deserves mention for a remarkably mature performance. Also important is the Kronos Quartet for putting the real Requiem into the dream.Praise aside, this film isn't for everyone. It is a fulfilling but not necessarily enjoyable cinematic experience. My viewing companion ditched out 45 minutes into the movie screaming ""I  can't take this!"" and he LIKES ""Happiness."""	5.0	A Masterpiece but Not For Everyone	2001-06-08	4	3	1

As a matter of fact, it was so disturbing that I found myself thinking about it for days on end. A friend of mine stated it was the closest depiction of the hell of addiction that he had ever seen.  I highly recommend it if you're ready for total emotional involvement but it's not for the faint of heart and it affected me so deeply that I find that I'm unable to view it again.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	This disturbing film, creatively directed by Darren Aronofsky of &quot;Pi&quot; fame is about drug addition. For Ellen Burstyn, cast in the role of Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely Brooklyn housewife who is trying to lose weight to appear on a TV show, the drug of choice is diet pills. For her son, played by Jared Leto; his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely; and his pal, played by Marlon Wayans, the drug is heroin. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., who also wrote the screenplay, the setting is a run-down and sad Brooklyn neighborhood near the beach, where buildings are old, people are poor and the American dream is a far off taunting illusion. The time period is unclear because the TV set, which is the center of Sarah Goldfarb's life, is of 1950s vintage; and yet the characters all use cell phones. But these details really don't matter much. There are enough other fantasy elements in this film to hurl it into the age that created music videos.Using creative film techniques, the director has managed to bring the audience right into the mental states of the addicts. There are extreme close-ups, slow-motion and fast-motion sequences and split screen effects. We go on the fantasy trip with the characters and then we crash with the reality. We watch the effects on them as their personalities change as well as their physical appearances. The result is chilling. The script calls for outstanding acting jobs and Ellen Burstyn's work is perhaps the finest of her long career. The other actors also shine in these very challenging performances. Jared Leto is more than just a handsome young actor; Jennifer Connely, who is almost too pretty for her harrowing role, is excellent; and Marlon Wayans, who we usually see in comedies, proves here that he handle a serious part. This is not a film for the squeamish. It is deeply disturbing and sad. But the discomfort is worth it for those who are willing to explore this underbelly of a perverse American dream.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3TL5IU4PJAJSV	"""lindenarden"""	There is no question that Aronofsky is a brilliant filmmaker-- this film is hypnotic and utterly gripping in every sense. The actors, particularly Ellen Burstyn (who deserved an Oscar), are brilliant. If you ever need reasons NOT to do drugs of any kind, see this movie. It certainly raises new possibilities for the medium of film, because I've seen a lot of them and there aren't many that leave you feeling the way you do after seeing this one. How do you feel? Numb, depressed, hopeless-- in short, the film makes you feel like a junkie. The experience of seeing dilating pupils, shooting needles and Jared Leto's festering arm (nothing in film has ever made me cringe like that) is not unlike Burstyn's grotesque shock therapy. The movie is like being bludgeoned-- in a good, cathartic way, if that makes any sense. See it for the experience and see Aronofsky's brilliance firsthand, but I'll only see it again if I feel like punishing my mind.	4.0	Shock Theater	2001-06-12	1	1	0

One loses her sanity, the other his health, another his freedom, and the last her dignity. As Mrs. Reagan once said, ""Just say no"".But obviously it's not that simple to jus say no, so the viewer is caught between watching a 2-hour car-crash, witnessing the disaster unfolding before their eyes, and simutaneously forced to consider their own attitude to drugs.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ANS1YPC8P56BF	LithaMoon	After seeing this movie on DVD at home, I was glad I didn't see it for the first time in a theater, I don't know what I would have done.  What I mean is, after I saw this, I was physically ill.  I felt as though someone had punched me in the stomach and pounded me over the head with a baseball bat.  That's how good this movie is, it struck a physical reaction within me, and I began to connect with each of the 4 main characters and their different addictions.  This isn't a movie soley about addiction to herion, its a movie about addictions to different things.  Ellen Burstyn's character was addicted to losing weight and being beautiful again, therefore she got hooked on diet pills.  Jared Leto's character was hooked on his love for Marion Silver (Jennifer Connely).  She needed the dope, he would supply, and they would be happy and in love.  Marlon Wayans's character was addicted to the images of his deceased mother, and needed the drugs to soothe his internal pain.Overall, this movie is not for the sensitive, or the easily offended.  There are many traumatizing scenes that will leave an impact on you for a very long time.Darren Aronofsky is going to be legend.	5.0	A Movie Lush with Reality	2001-06-10	0	0	0

Wether or not these TINY details are realistic really does NOT matter AT ALL, there is so much more to the movie, how can anyone possibly focus on an insignificant thing like that?The story, i'll let you find that out by yourself, but i can tell you this much: The acting is unbelievable (i couldn't believe how good Wayans was), Jared Leto has always been an incredible actor, and he proves it in this movie, he gives such a powerful and emotional performence. Ellen Burstyn (i cant believe JULIA ROBERTS beat her, their performences were incomparable), she does such a great job at portraying a TV crazed Speed Addict (who doesn't even realize she is). Jennifer Connely was stunning, you can tell she's a really great actress.THe Director is a genuis, like many people have already said , watching this movie kinda makes you feel like you're on a trip yourself. The scenes depicting the actual intake of the drugs were really original and gripping, you'll see what i'm talking about!I will admit this movie made me cry, the end is just unbelievably sad...I dont understand how anybody can even think about touching drugs after watching this movie (but this is besides the point)...I don't know what else to say, GO WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW....it's a masterpiece.	5.0	AMAZING	2003-11-11	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2T0LI9JT45VA5	"Liz ""Birdmother"""	Even though I, a Sixties teenager, never tried drugs, never possessed the least amount of curiosity, and never, never could understand the appeal, the prospect of levelling judgement at those who do, did, and will is not an option in the foreseeable future. Especially after viewing 'Requiem for a Dream'. The one thing about drugs that seems to be a universally recognizable cross-cultural phenomenon, is that when one consumes their drug of choice, one is fairly well guaranteed of a predictable set of feelings. Feelings that are far preferable to those randomly and often cruelly dished up by a drug-free life. For many, many people it is easier and far preferable to die in drug hell than to encounter the seemingly bottomless pit of pain that exists in an everday mainstream life. It is no wonder that the life and death of a drug addicted soul makes better sense when viewed from the perspective of choice as presented in this film. When the character played by Ellen Burstyn defends her choice to stick with the diet pills, she makes a stunning case for that choice. Her son is sickened by what he knows will be the outcome of her consumption of those particular drugs, but he can't present a compelling argument without revealing his own scope of personal aquaintance with pharmaceuticals, etc.What it all boils down to is that by the time you are, in most cases, irretrievably sucked into the biggest lie of all for a life (that drugs will take away your pain and give you all sorts of nicer and often ecstatic feelings) you have a double whammy. You would have to go through withdrawal to get out of the addiction phase and go back to face all of those terrifying feelings that you wanted so desperately to avoid in the first place. The truly sad thing is that the terrifying feelings are a real piece of cake when stacked up against the retribution of the outside world against a drug addict.That is why this film is so important. The director and his top level cast go above and beyond the performance level to bring us all the truth about the way that all people, nice ordinary people included, can barter their souls for the worst and most profitable scam ever perpetrated upon the human race.	5.0	Four Quite Nice People Go To Hell	2003-02-01	4	3	1

It touched me and disturbed me so much that, like ""Schindler's List"", I don't think I ever want to see this movie again.I am a squeamish person, but I was entranced by the visions of ugliness created by the director. However, this is not simply a cautionary tale about the dangers of drugs.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1OKGC6ZQ8IPPK	Madeline	For most people who have ever considered trying harder drugs, such as speed or heroin, this movie will probably change their minds completely. Not that the movie is simply an anti-drug statement. It's so much more than that. Requiem For A Dream is an outstanding film, with interesting characters and an intricate, if not ultimately desolate, storyline. That being said, it is not something to watch with your family, or even some of your friends. It's disturbing, depressing, and will probably give you nightmares.The film-making is unique, especially in the scenes where the characters are using. You never see any of the characters actually injecting, I think, but the series of shots shown instead are just as intimate. I found it fascinating. The acting is great; I was really surprised with Jared Leto's performance. A couple years back, I was really into 30S2M. Eventually I noticed he had small parts in both Fight Club and American Psycho (two of my favorite films), but neither of the performances really displays his talent like Requiem For A Dream. Throughout the film, you see his life slowly deteriorate, and it's painful to watch. In fact, this whole movie is painful to watch.The emotions this movie brought out in me are hard to describe. I was really moved by this film, it was unlike anything I've ever seen before. If you've ever suffered with an addiction, I think this film will appeal to you. It describes the misery of so many people around the world, and it does so with style. The ending is horrific, and if you don't lay awake after it, I worry about your sanity. Requiem For A Dream will undoubtably haunt me forever.Fortunately, in my opinion, those kind of films are the best. If you haven't seen it, I dare you. Prepare to be shocked.	5.0	Disturbing, but Incredible	2010-02-17	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1IUE611O90BOQ	M. Adkins	First of all, this really is a stunning, staggering, heart-wrenching film. It's sad and beautiful world (asJim Jarmuschmight say) full of flawed characters, and Ellen Burstyn was magnificent. That Julia Roberts won Best Actress over her is a crime against decent film-lovers everywhere. But be fore-warned: Based onthe novel by Hubert Selby, this is NOT a plucky, feel-good experience. It's overwhelmingly raw, and probably not for all tastes ( I'm looking at you,Norbit fans)But, as for this disc: Here is a prime example of why people bother upgrading their media to the latest-and-greatest format. Daily, I have to fight the urge to waste money on new versions of movies I already own (& I did already own the fineRequiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)DVD of this), but I couldn't resist a film that looks and sounds this good. [Side note: TheKronos Quartet soundtrackis spectacular.]If you've already got the setup (HDTV or projector, sound system, etc) than you can do a lot worse.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1PICWXVZHP61T	"Maeve of Tara ""Avid Reader"""	"First off, Ellen Burstyn is the STAR of this movie, shining like a nova in a no-holds barred, courageous, unique performance. She was nominated for the Oscar, and booooohhh! to the Academy for passing her by. Perhaps they could not handle such pure brilliance?The story is not so unusual, and surely there are even more brutally honest films dealing with drug addiction, than this one. What is unusual, however, is  the editing, especially towards the end, when we, the hapless viewer, frustrated because we can not reach out and put an end to their suffering, watch all four protagonists get tossed from one end of Hell to the other, in short, brutal sequences, so fast and furious that we can not even keep track of what is happening.... and perhaps because it's better so because the pain and agony we are presented with is simply too realistic and impossible to bear.Yes this is a cautionary tale. What makes it stand out from among  the others is that it encompasses four different people. Director  Darren Aronofsky is outstanding. By including the mother, Ellen Burstyn, and her fast rollercoaster into Hell because of a jaded doctor who carelessly prescribes high doses of diet pills, he has enriched the plot. Though middle aged, Sarah Goldfarb has lived a secluded life and thus is an innocent, with an old-fashioned trust in the omnipotence of her doctor.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) lives in Coney Island, and is the mother of Harry (played by Jared Leto). Sarah gets selected as a guest on her favvy TV show, which jolts her out of her apathy as a lonely widow, wishes to lose weight to look good on screen, and finds the aforementioned doctor.  Meanwhile, her son Harry, his girl friend Marian(Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans) step into an accelerated ride into chaos.There are enough plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, plenty callous scenes to infuriate you. Harry ends up in the hospital with a clearly life-threatening inner-arm infection from heroin usage, and the doctor, instead of treating him PRONTO, calls the police and has him tossed in jail. I am not sure if such a thing can be done in the real world, or perhaps this is just naive outrage on my part?Another amazon.com reviewer, ""Pen Name: Mr. X (NYC)"" offered a good observation on August 9, 2004: ""... this movie doesn't make the character's bad decisions equal bad outcomes, the director forces these bad outcomes onto the characters with unrealistic events. Diet pills don't produce what you will see in this movie, and they arent going to use electro shock therapy. ""Mr. X. is correct, not everyone will freak out on diet pills as Sarah Goldfarb does here, and not every drug addict takes it to the bitter end to end up in jail or in a sex-party for freakish, well-dressed, pillar of the community type of men. Yes indeed some drug addicts might encounter angels who will lift them out of Hell. But do you want to chance it?I used to be a die-hard can-do, will-do, person. I did not believe that there is such a thing as an ""addictive personality."" But my opinion has been changing lately. Yes, it is quite possible that not only is there an ""addictive personality,"" but ""addictive chemistry,"" meaning you are born with or later fall prey to chemical imbalances that leave you vulnerable to be hooked on all kind of things, from drugs to alcohol and cigarettes.  So, it's best not to play Russian roulette, don't unchain the sleeping beast, and most importantly, don't ever be too sure of yourself!Parents, do indeed serve this film to your teenager, along with his/her Wheaties and multi-vitamin pill, for breakfast."	5.0	Parents: serve this to your teenager along with Wheaties	2004-10-24	5	4	1

This movie was filmed beautifully and filled with so many meanings. I love the transitions and how the story unfolds to how it ends. It is brutally honest on how drugs happen to many people in the world and it just shows you a snippet of what truly goes on. The honesty, the way it was portrayed was amazing. Ive watched it a few times in my youth and it definitely made me against drug usage. Watching it recently as a much older and experienced individual, it still got me like it did the first time. Disturbing, visually beautiful, brutally honest, amazing acting from all the individuals... breathtaking... truthful moments... just all in all amazing. You have to experience this movie at least ONCE in your lifetime. My boyfriend watched it for the first time and was just taken back, states he will never watch it again but was happy he did.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1R283L4SH4UP8	Magpie	......in my own humble opinion.Requiem For A Dream on the surface is not disturbing. It's intense and certainly shocking, but it doesn't get disturbing until you peel back the layers. Darren Aronofsky, along with David Fincher, is a director who is very aware of the material he creates his films from. The novel that this movie is based on is not about drug addicts. Let me repeat that, it is NOT about drug addicts. It is not Trainspotting. Requiem For A Dream tells you what it's about in its title. Dreams. Dreams that every single one of us have. Some of us achieve them. Some of us let them fall by the wayside and settle for something else. Then there are those of us, that are so obsessed, so ADDICTED, to our dreams, that we are in danger of destroying all the good things around us that we've created in our lives while in pursuit of this one solitary single goal. In Requiem, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion want to have the good life. They want money and success. They want to get there as soon as possible. They take short cuts to get there because the goal is taking way too long.So, what's the difference between you and them? That they shoot heroin? Are any of us addicted to cigarettes? To caffeine? To sex? To shopping, even? Anything can be a crippling addiction, anything can stand in the way of pursuing your dream without even you realizing it. You, yourself, could be standing in the way of your dream, and you might not even realize it.Sara Goldfarb wants to be thin so she can be on television. There are so many people who hate the way they look and will do anything to get the body or the face they want. Many do not have the patience or endurance for exercise. For many, exercise may not work, so they look for other methods. Sara Goldfarb is your neighbor, she's your mom, your sister, the woman who served you your coffee at your local coffee shop today.People are too quick to write this movie off, even those that love it, as a &quot;drug&quot; movie. It's not. It's a cautionary tale about letting your dreams destroy your life. In particular, the &quot;American dream&quot; that's advertised day and night to us. Selby understands this. Aronofsky understands this. Many don't. Not even Amazon.com understands it (read their review of this film. Especially their &quot;Is there anything in this film that any sane person doesn't already know?&quot; line.) It's only after you see the movie, and especially when you read the book, and when you peel away the shock effect layers of the work in your brain days, weeks, months after you see or read it, and realize that what happens to every character in &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; could very easily happen to you. All it can take is one wrong decision, like Sara's use of diet pills, or a belief that you can &quot;beat the system&quot; without recognizing your own weaknesses, like Harry, Tyrone, and Marion, to have you spiraling downward. It's that easy. It can happen to any one of us.That's why it's disturbing.	5.0	Why Requiem For A Dream is so damn disturbing.......	2001-05-24	5	4	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A30ZPSYOGFJXR6	Manola Sommerfeld	This was a very interesting film.  Ellen Burstyn is superb as a sweet and lonely widow who simply wants to lose a few pounds and gets addicted to (doctor prescribed) amphetamines.  Her son (Jared Leto) is a serious heroin junkie, along with his best friend (Marlon Wayans, in an excellent role), and girlfriend (Jennifer Connolly).  At the end, all their lives have been destroyed, to a larger or lesser degree, by their involvement with drugs.  They lost their freedom, their mind, their dignity, and quite literally, even more.  The very end of the movie is quite brutal, but the story had been building up to it, so it did not come as a complete shock.  Some parts were too heavy, like the evil and quasi-maniacal attendants in the psychiatric ward.  I thought that was pushing it.  I did like the message, perfectly conveyed by the title.  Drugs will kill whatever dreams you had.  There was no doubt in my mind after seeing this film.The film was slightly amateurish on the hyperreality effects: the chewing, slurping sounds, the mega-visuals, the repetitive sequences.  They look like just taken from the assignment of your first year of film school.Regarding the DVD features: the documentary disappointed me.  I wish it had more structure.  For example, they could have strengthen their explanation of how they filmed some scenes by following up with the finished scene.  The documentary looks like it was put together quickly.  The director's commentary also leaves much to be desired.  Even directors would benefit from rehearsing what they have to say beforehand.  On the other hand, the Independent Film Channel documentary is far better because it is more structured.  Also, the segment with Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby is awesome.  He cries, he laughs, he is honest about his life and shortcomings, and comes through as such a humble person.	3.0	Best Title Ever	2002-02-08	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AD3EX5UG7UZPB	"Marcos ""proletariat"""	"I've always been amazed at the huge following and generous ratings and reviews this film has received. Though it does have its merits, overall I found Requiem for a Dream to be very disappointing. The plot itself offers absolutely nothing new - three friends that fall prey to the horrors of addiction and their lives spiral... how many times have we seen this, and done much, much better for that matter?This is director Darren Aronofsky's sophomore (and sophomoric) effort. While Pi was excellent, Aronofsky uses, as another reviewer excellently puts it, ""gimmicky camera and editing"" and other bad, stylistic shock value techniques such as the extreme accounts of each character's sub-story to attempt to create a dream like or surreal experience, the obvious point of the film, and it simply doesn't work.Even as a recovering addict myself, I felt no connection or empathy towards the characters, except for perhaps the mother character, played by Ellen Burstyn, in part due to her performance and the fact that her story offers something refreshing from the otherwise stale, hackneyed dreck that constitutes thislame attempt to marry art with a hollywood blockbuster. It is absolutely embarrassing watchhing Leto attempt a New York accent, and watching Jennifer Connolly act is like watching paint dry.I think the biggest problem I had with the film was its ending, or maybe it was just the whole damn thing and the feeling you're left with... the problem doesn't lie in the writing but the direction - you are left with this residue-like feeling that the story is shaking its finger at you... as if you just watched a DARE film, not a piece of art. It WOULD normally be refreshing to watch an addiction film that doesn't glorify/romanticize drugs - this film does not, however unfortunately, there is no success here.Some scenes, particularly Connolly's lesbian sex scene, displayed the lengths to which one will go when the disease of chemical dependency/addiction takes over... The problem, though, wasn't that it was explicit so much as it was dragged out long after it made its point, latent with desperate self gratuitous direction.Bottom line is it failed to accomplish what it desperately attempts, making ""Requiem for a Dream"" a rather pretentious title. The only scenes thatremotely induced a successful feeling of surrealism for me were Burstyn's, and I think that was mostly because it offered something mildly different and the POV shots worked.This was painful."	1.0	Overrated and Hackneyed	2011-12-20	27	12	15

Darren Aronofsky is a visionary director and this is his masterpiece.The story centers on a group of drugs addicts living in New York. Everytime someone in this movie uses drugs Aronofsky employs a series of quick edits meant to simulate the effect of getting high. I used to edit home movies like that, but I had to stop after my relatives got sick.Requiem For A Dream should be used as an anti-drug educational film, shown in every high school Health class. No other film has been quite so honest and realistic in its portrayal of long-term drug abuse,This film showed the horrors of many addictions, but none were to scratch-off lottery tickets.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A29XCPKG2YEF02	Marion Harris	I just saw Requiem for a Dream this afternoon and speaking  as a future film maker myself,I thought the movie rocked! But can we spell &quot;comfortably numb&quot; from pink floyd's  the wall,and the film sid and nancy? Don't get me wrong I liked the way Darren Aronofsky used disturbing to the  point of sickness images to portray his story.The dvd is  good because he is able to give his insight as to what the  film was actually about instead of most of the abstract  images that are thrown at you for 102 minutes.This film was a treat for me because I'm a huge fan of both Jared  Leto and Jennifer Connelly.I thought their performances were more than exemplary.This gave them the opportuninty to shed the images that each portrayed as teen idols-for Jared-&quot;My so called life, and for her-goody,goody family films like &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;.Marlon Wayans of course provided the comic relief in the film as I thought he would,but he did have  a volitle role in the film as their best-getting-high-every- day-buddy.Since I was born in the late seventies,I'm not  that familiar with Ellen Burstyn's work,however I thought  she deserved the oscar nod that she got for this particular role as Jared's mom.People actually have addictions like her character,so I thought that was important to show how  people let perscription drugs get the best of them.As for the 'Wall' reference I made earlier,like the rock opera, by the end of the film each of the characters in Reqiuem descends deeper into maddness than when the film begins. And this movie shows you how badly heroine can send you  packing on a one way trip to hell in style.And the movie is loaded with sid and nancy isms because we all know that&quot;the couple that uses together stays together&quot; is the basis of jared and  jennifer's characters.So I'd like to say in conclusion, Darren Aronofsky has given us something to remember for the next 20 years or so for groundbreaking movies like this one. When they look back at what was the most controversial, they would have to say &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;.	5.0	Sid and Nancy 2000	2001-05-23	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A4RG2QJGRRXUF	Mark A. Kintzley	I could easily give this film 5 stars. I didn't hate it and I didn't like it. I love horror and comedy. I never liked serious movies about the tragedies of life and I despise depressing. This movie was DEPRESSING! I am talking...it grabs you by the eyeballs and drags you 150mph into a world you'd rather not ever visit and leaves you there. It was also just a plain old damn good movie too. The actors were believable and the filmwork was superb. I felt like I was thrust into the minds of the druggies and it wasn't fun. Ellen Burstyn...my god...what an actress. I loved/hated seeing the deterioration of that poor woman. Bottom line...I had to watch the Exorcist right after this just to feel clean!	2.0	I can see how some would rate this a 5!

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A13WK0568LZNL0	"Mark Coffey ""austindeadhead"""	I've seldom seen a movie that is more faithful to its source material than Requiem for a Dream.  The performances are marvelous throughout; it is a crime that Ellen Burstyn did not receive best actress for her performance, but Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are all great, as well.  The slippery slope to addiction has rarely been portrayed so honestly.  I have heard some complaints that the movie has no subtlety, but really, that is a reflection of the addict - there is nothing subtle about living for the next fix.  That such people exist is no exaggeration - unfortunately, I have met a few myself, otherwise wonderful people who have lost themselves in the dream world of narcotics.  How quickly that dream turns nightmarish! - which is, I think, rather the point of this fine piece of work.  Don't miss the novel if you like the movie - it is extremely well written, and just as powerful, if not more so.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A37YY9BZJ4RMZQ	Mark Erikson	What attracted me to this movie was the soundtrack, which was probably the single most incredible soundtrack I'd ever heard.  I have heard good soundtracks - but those are usually a random collection of songs by various artists which compliment a movie well, but this is a proper score.It's a score unlike anything else I've ever heard, and it was enough to keep me enthralled when I finally got around to watching the movie it belonged to.However, the movie itself isn't so great.  The theme is somewhat interesting - that what seems like the catalyst to make all your dreams come true is in actually the thing that will ruin your life, but there is very little in the plot that hasn't been seen before.In short, this is a drug movie.  You can expect junkies making bad decisions, acting stupidly and generally ruining their lives when it seems obvious to the audience what the right choices would be.What saves the movie is the downward spiral of Sarah Goldfarb, and old woman who becomes addicted to speed.  It is a strange situation, since durgs and geriatrics aren't often aligned in such a way, and also very disturbing, as the world around her becomes increasingly skewed as the movie winds on.  This footage alone is enough to scare anyone away from hallucinogens for at least a week.Overall, the movie is worth watching once, and the soundtrack worth listening to numerous times.  Worth buying, in fact.	3.0	Interesting but...	2001-06-11	2	1	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	This film is a harrowing experience.  The principle cast of four all spiral to their respective dooms, all fueled by the use of &quot;recreational pharmaceuticals&quot;.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable as buds who see the drug game as a way to escape their lower socio-economic lives, even as they do not see the way that their own abuse of these drugs makes such an escape impossible.  But it is the overpowering performances of Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly that burned a raw place into my psyche.  Ellen Burstyn's Sara is not a junkie.  She is just a lonely, overweight middle-aged woman who dreams about being younger, thinner, and not nearly as alone.  Jennifer Connelly's character comes along for the ride with her boyfriend, but by degrees she descends lower and lower.You have to watch it to see how low these characters fall.  This is not a happy-go-lucky movie.  But if you are interested in a well-made, well-acted cautionary tale about the dangers of addictions, you'd have difficulty finding one superior to &quot;Requiem&quot;.	5.0	Could it happen to someone you know?

Director Darren Aronosfky has achieved deserved recognition for this morality fable about the destruction of four lives by drug addiction. Wonderful performances put this tale right in your face. The stuff dreams are made of is heroin and diet pills. The characters write their own requiem as they descend into hell. Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached but well worth watching for the performances---especially Ellen Burstyn who was Oscar nominated for her work here. Jared Leto as her son, Marlon Wayans as his buddy and Jennifer Connelly as Leto's girlfriend all turn in fine jobs as the doomed souls who sell out for the ""Dream"". Sad, depressing but fascinating viewing if a bit heavy-handed at times. A damn fine film nonetheless."	5.0	REWARDING  IF  YOU'RE  GAME....	2002-10-22	1	1	0

The cinematography is excellent. This movie is horrible because it is so real, and so depressing, and once you see it you will not be the same. I watched it a few days ago, and it is sticking with me like a splinter. I cannot stop thinking about it. I feel so bad for the characters. Their lives go so horrible wrong, and you want to stop them. You want to help them. You want to turn off the movie and run away, but you can't. You can't do any of it. You have to sit there a watch as their lives unravel. Right from the very beginning, this movie made me uncomfortable. I've never experienced cinema like this before. I'm used to being entertained by movies. This movie was not entertaining. That being said, you need to watch this movie. Everyone under the age of 40 should have to watch this movie. It should be shown to every high school student in the country. Then again, maybe not. This movie is so different from anything out there, I'd hate to make it common place.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AWPODHOB4GFWL	"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF"""	"Director Darren Aronofsky (""PI"") has brought together a story of four people full of hope and allows them to slowly disintegrate into helpless shells.  The director's trick is that you continue to care about these characters throughout the film - not an easy feat.  Leto and Wayans (a nice dramatic turn for the comedian) are best friends caught up in heroin addiction.  Connelly is Leto's girlfriend who has her own problem with cocaine.  Throw in Leto's Mom, Ellen Burstyn and you have an unlikely collection of likeable people on their way towards self destruction.  We already know that all the characters are going to end up in hell or worse, but it's the way that the Director shows the quick and varied descent of each one that makes watching a car wreck seem like kids stuff.Leto and Wayans end results are just as horrific as Connelly's final wasteland.  In fact, in this unedited version, Connelly has some nasty final punishment come her way.  Burstyn is the stand out performer here; with speed (diet pills) induced hallucinations and gritty realistic acting.  What starts out as a simple wish to fit into her favorite old dress turns into insane sequences of distorted reality and terrifying delusions (imagine a killer refrigerator threatening her - it's so real, it's uncanny).Aronofsky's techniques are amazing, with fast cut editing and speed filled action sequences that instill the mood of a nightmare sequence.  There is simply too much symbolism, imagery and artistic endeavor to list here other than to say the scenes are breathtaking.  The dialogue and interaction between characters is genuine and each scene is carefully orchestrated to balance reality from fiction.  It's a hell of a story and a nasty ride, but worth every cinematic moment.There are plenty of extras like Director's commentary (really nice feature), a making of featurette and deleted scenes."	5.0	Birth Of A Nightmare	2003-10-29	10	9	1

It's about different forms of addiction, and it pulls no punches in its depiction of the inevitable downward spiral of its four main characters. Not only should you see it for the message, but for its cinematic inventivness. Visually, I've never seen anything like it. The cinematography, sound, editing, music and visual FX are top-notch and will blow your mind. The acting honors here go to Ellen Burstyn, who gives an incredible performance as the poor, naiive Sarah Goldfarb. Watching her deterioration (both mentally and physically) is heart-wrenching. Burstyn gets great support from the rest of the cast as well, particularly Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Also, those familiar with Marlon Wayans' comedy roles will be very surprised with his subtle, convincing portrayal of enterprising heroin addict Tyrone. Director Darren Aronofsky has created one of the best films of the new century; I can't wait to see what he does next. The last 20 minutes of this wonderful, haunting film will leave you breathless.

This should be viewed by anyone who is thinking of taking drugs, not as a &quot;don't take drugs&quot; message but as a &quot;think about the consequences first&quot; message.  It's horrible to see the four main characters in the film go through so much pain.  The leads all do fantastic.  Marlon Wayans took me by surprise with his outstanding acting.  Darren Aronofsky is an incredible director with skills that deserve recognition.  This film is truly an amazing experience but it's not for the faint of heart due to it's graphic and depressing nature.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"Requiem For A Dream is one of the best films I have ever seen. Brilliantly co-written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, Requiem For A Dream does in fact attack you with a dramatic and remarkably candid portrayal of what a ""drug"" can mean to someone--and what that ""drug"" can do to someone. For Aronofsky, that drug could be watching television, taking diet pills or street drugs. This film is sure to have a deep emotional impact on you; and as a former social worker I could empathize with the struggles that the three or four main characters live through as they watch the destruction of their dreams because they used drugs to achieve their dreams.When the action begins, we meet Sara Goldfarb, a lonely old widow in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn whose only pleasure seems to be watching a somewhat silly self-help show on television. Her son, Harry, is constantly hocking her television set for money--only what Sara doesn't know is that Harry uses the money to buy heroin for himself and cocaine for his girlfriend Marion. Harry is also friends with a drug dealer named Tyrone; and they scheme to buy and resell drugs on the street for fat profits. Unfortunately, just as others have noted, Harry and Tyrone often turn out to be their own best customers.Sara herself is on a mission. One day she gets a phone call stating that she has already won a spot on the self-help talk show-and when Sara can't fit into her prized red dress, a problem ensues. At first, Sara tried to diet; but this goes nowhere fast. A friend tells Sara about a doctor who is rather liberal with his prescription pad; and this doctor soon has Sara hooked on diet pills that eventually have her jumping around like TWO Mexican jumping beans.In order to make the tragedy of it all even more human and painful for some of us to watch, we see Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone all deteriorating as a result of their respective drug habits. It's not a pretty picture; but it's brilliantly acted and portrayed by the filmmakers.Of course, the plot can still go anywhere. What does eventually happen to Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone? Will any of them be able to kick their drug habits--and what becomes of any of them if they can't kick their habits? The last twenty minutes of the film give us a skillful expose of their new lives.The DVD has extras: there is a director's commentary with the ""making of"" featurette; and there are deleted scenes. The ""anatomy of a scene"" extra is also very well done.Overall, Requiem For A Dream is probably one of the very best films I have ever seen. It gives us an often painfully candid look at what drugs can do to people and how people must struggle to beat their addictions. I highly recommend this for anyone wishing to study this matter. Unfortunately, the film is so frank that some sensitive people will be uncomfortable; but I believe that they had to make the message strong because that is the only way to truly deal with the issues involved."	5.0	painful, candid and essential	2008-05-30	9	7	2

I think I know: Anyone but a film student knows that addiction and compulsive behavior are abnormal and lead to misery, and thus doesn't need to explore it in typically sensational detail.

Those things are really not relevant to what one actually sees on a screen. I'm not a film student or filmmaker. What matters to me in a film is the finished product. The finished product in the case of this movie is not good in many ways, most of which are not relevant in an Amazon.com review and would require a great deal more space(and time)to develop.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Requiem for a Dream was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2000 and deservedly so. Naturally, reviewers' favorites and those of audiences are often not the same ones. Many viewers will find this look at the effects of drug abuse on four New Yorkers too strong and horrifying. Not too many people got the chance to see the film in its theatrical run, as it was released without a rating, rather than be tagged with the MPAA's dreaded 'NC-17'. New Line is offering an 'R' rated version on video. You can't fight Blockbuster.Sara Goldfarb [Ellen Burstyn] is a widow living in a low-rent high-rise apartment near Coney Island in New York City. She keeps her beloved television, which is about all the company she has, chained to a radiator. Harry [Jared Leto] is a sweet, rather passive guy who is also a junkie. He steals her TV on a regular basis and hocks it for drug money. It's a pathetic game they play, for he always takes it to the same place and she always goes and gets it. As is sadly typical in most families, they never discuss Harry's drug problem, which he shares with his girlfriend, Marianne [Jennifer Connelly], and his best friend, Tyrone [Marlon Wynans]. Sara has addictions of her own. Chocolate is one. A strange game show is another. One day she gets a phone call. The caller claims she is to be a contestant on the show. She is unable to get into her favorite dress, which she hasn't worn in twenty years. At the suggestion of a friend, she goes to a diet doctor who puts her on pills. Soon she is as addicted as her son. The rest of the movie shows the harrowing decline of the characters.Director Darren Aronofsky jazzes up this all too gritty story with some of the most original visuals you can imagine. This is all done with dazzling camera work and very few special effects. He also enhances the picture with a clever, detailed soundtrack. He wisely observes his characters objectively and never sinks into banal moralizing. He makes few anti-drug statements. His theme is the nature of obsessive-compulsive behavior.The cast is marvelous. Burstyn was nominated for an Oscar, and, if there were justice in Hollywood, she would have won. Leto and Connelly are two of our best character actors, and Requiem for a Dream is another entry in their impressive and ever growing resumes.The story is contemporary but hardly new. It is based on a novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. that was published in 1978, before America's costly and ineffective war on drugs even began.	4.0	A Nightmare is Also a Dream	2002-03-16	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ACBA805501SEU	Matthew Skidmore	Acclaimed film director Darren Aronofsky returns with this dark and disturbing look at the highs and lows of drug dependancy in Brooklyn. Based upon the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (who briefly appears in the movie), REQUIEM FOR A DREAM paints a pretty bleak picture of the tangled lives of four very individual people - each battling with their own inner demons.The film opens with the introduction of the two main protaganists - Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). We first meet them as they pawn a TV set owned by Harry's mother in the hope of gaining quick cash in order to buy heroin. We later learn that Harry always pawns this TV set whenever he needs a quick fix - thus, stating the low depths this guy will go to feed his own drug dependancy. This initial incident in the picture sparks off the eventual downward spiral that each of the characters encounter. We quickly meet Harrys' girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his own mother (Ellen Burstyn). Each character is drawn up to provide the audience with an easily identifiable dependancy to relate to. For instance, Harrys' widowed mother is obsessed with geting onto a game show and this slow interest begins to consume her entire life, blissfully unaware that her son is running a drugs racket with his girlfriend and best buddy.Aronofsky throws in every kind of MTV trick in the book to dazzle his audience, which at some times is truly stunning- but, at others comes across as awkward and beguiling. You don't really feel connected to the foursome and their exploits neither interest or depress you in the way that they should (Check out TRAINSPOTTING for a more gritty take on the highs and lows of drug dependancy). The film offers no really likeable people - each character is either mentally depressed or self-obsessed, and no real hope is offered at all (I'm not saying I want a Hollywood style Drugs movie with a 'light at the end of the tunnel' type finale, but life has equal ups and downs, and all this movie is interested in is displaying a beautiful MTV style hell with pretty young people teetering on the edge of their own destruction).The cast are very good, with the exception of lead Jared Leto. His pretty boy looks and dull acting style deny this movie with the strong emotional arm that it needs to succeed. You want to connect to him, but feel nothing for his plight and come away feeling cold and uninterested. Marlon Wayans drops his usual comedy schtick for a well deserved acting role that allows him to develop and excel - he shines in his limited screen time. Jennifer Connelly (who I remember as a little kid seeing her in LABRYNTH and that Dario Argento flick PHENOMENA/CREEPERS) too is pretty good, and she (along with the excellent Ellen Burstyn) pull this movie along giving it a gravitas that it truly needs. Aronofskys' direction is good, with art-house touches here and there - fused with a late 90s MTV sensability that at times dazzles and others infuriates - coming across like a rabid hybrid of David lynch and MIchael Bay.The disc is good - This review refers to the UK Momentum Pictures release. A directors commentary is added plus additional deleted scenes (they don't detract or add to the film). Also, a raw 'making-of' documenatary is good and adds insight into a real making of a movie, ie: it looks pretty dull. Picture quality is good, highlighting Matthew Libatiques' excellent cinematography that changes mood and colour as quick as Aronofsky cuts his movie. All-in-all, a flashy, yet art-house attempt at creating another in the long line of underground american movies that depict the dark and seedy underbelly of the US. Not particularly rewarding or enticing. See FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS instead.	2.0	Ever had a dream that you can't remember?	2002-02-24	9	5	4

Internalize this distinction before you watch it, or write a review about it. Aronofsky isn't moralizing about the perils of smack; he's commenting on the industries, legal and otherwise, that thrive by promising dreams they can't deliver, and on the eventual collapse of lives built around those promises. This is not &quot;drugs are bad, mmmkay?&quot;; it is something far deeper and broader, and to pan it -- or praise it -- as anti-drug propaganda is to miss the point entirely.See this movie.

This is the case with the work of exponents such as director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, with the point being that filmmakers in this genre are expected to experiment and to attempt to provoke us; which is why one celebrates works from Cocteau, Polanski, Hitchcock, Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Joel Schumacher, the Coens, etc., despite the fact that such experiences can be uneven, given the fragility of the medium. And yet. Despite the worthy performances and contributions, 'Requiem for a Dream' suffers from dialog that is merely serviceable and (as Salvador Dali knew) paramount to surrealism is humor, which director Aronfsky seems to lack considerably.	3.0	The surreal in movies	2009-09-19	16	2	14

The solid story of four intersecting lives in a rapid descent to hardcore drug addiction, performed to perfection by all the actors, combined with truly original and dazzling imagery as the camera concentrated on those moments when the fix comes in.I cared about these people.And then the screenplay committed the cardinal sin: ripped my willing suspension of disbelief into shreds when one lead character was in need of immediate medical attention and instead was given grounds for a major lawsuit (not giving away the spoiler for those who haven't seen it).In that moment, Requiem went from being a brilliant film to being the best-produced Partners for a Drug Free America commercial, ever.	4.0	Almost Had Me There	2003-10-17	3	2	1

It isn't for everybody but it is a classic.  I like the way it uses the music in the movie and seems to have a good soundtrack.  It uses different camera styles, repetitions, and strong emotional scenes to really make the audience feel way the characters feel.  Yes, this is a serious movie even though Marlon Wayans is in it and he gives a good performance.  For those who don't know, ""requiem"" is a song of mourning composed or performed as a memorial, usually for a dead person.  The title makes more sense after seeing the movie and knowing this definition.  Sometimes the repetition can get to you but it does make you remember it.  You may not want to see every part of it but you will not be able to turn away.  The final 10-20 minutes are very intense and emotional.  I have only seen this movie while in my 20s as I am now and only with people in their 20s so I can't say how an older group of people will see this movie but I think most 20-30 yr olds who like drama and are open to looking at the plight of addicts/dealers will like this movie."	5.0	Unique Style.

It took me three attempts to see this movie while it was in the theater (you see I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma and there isn't much of an independent movie scene here, so all the independent movies go to one certain theater and are only there for about 2 or 3 weeks). I'm a big fan of Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Pi&quot; and II had previously read about Requiem in IFP and one of my friend's had mentioned it to me a couple of times, so I read some reviews about it and the reviews were a little bit mixed up, because some critics liked it and some didn't so I decided that I would have to see for my self. When I finally got a chance to see it (the first time they owuldn't sell me tickets, the second time I had to run out of the theater before the security guards got to me, and then the third time I actually got to see it) So when I actually did see it I was so amazed. It scared the crap out of me, because some of the stuff is just pretty weird and random and just seeing the horrors of drugs is the other scary thing. The acting in this movie is extremely good. You feel for the characters by the end of the movie. After I saw the movie it just kept playing through my head and I kept thinking about the music, so the next day I went out and bought the soundtrack. I don't know why certain critics knock on this movie, because it is so amazing. Well good movie.	5.0	Powerful, amazing, emotionally moving....	2001-01-30	11	6	5

I bought this movie just reading the reviews from here and thought I would be blown away.

Many reviewers have already given positive comments to this masterpiece, so I won't say more about it.SPOILERS WARNING SPOILERS WARNINGWhat I want to say is about the censorship thing. There is absolutely no need for you to go so mad about it, because the scenes deleted do not have so much to do with the story itself. Just like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" MPAA was totally infuriated by the pornographic sex scenes, so the filmmakers simply ""removed"" or ""didn't show"" what Jennifer Connelly was doing in the last few minutes of the film. Those sences are not THAT exotic or outrageous since there are tons of similar stuff on the internet. In other words, just go to the ""right"" websites if you are really fussy about those deleted scenes. Believe me, they make no difference except satisfying your untamed curiosity.After all, nobody would actually buy the edited version, because there are !no extra features on the disc!

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3GE4JNI4PSNX4	"""meltingyellow"""	"This must be one of the most overlooked, underrated movies of 2000. Director Darren Aronofsky and the cast of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans did such a superb job in transfering the book to the screen.""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie about drug addiction. But its handling of the subject is so beautiful and poignant, and most importantly, REAL, that the film stands out among the countless other movies made about drugs.One remarkable thing in the movie is the humanity of the characters. Though all 4 are drug addicts, they are not shaped simply by that fact. Instead they are portrayed as real people, deserving of dignity and all the dreams they hope for, who are destroyed by the evil that is addiction. It is a powerful message, because drug addicts are one of the most misunderstood and mistreated groups of people in our society.The second aspect of the movie that deserves so much praise is the stunning audio/visual effect achieved by Aronofsky. He has the ability to turn a scene into an intense experience. His interpretation of the euphoria and hysteria brought about by drug abuse is wild; I loved it.This movie brings you to 4 people who each have a dream, whether it be beauty, prominence, respect, or riches. But they are deceived into believing that drugs can realize these dreams, and this in turn brings their downfalls. Personally, I think the underlying message of this story is that we all need love. As you will see in the movie, each character was in need of some sort of validation as a human being. We all need to love each other, and above all love ourselves."	5.0	A brilliant portrayal & stunning visual experience	2002-04-10	5	4	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	"""Requiem for a Dream"" is 102 minutes of pure hell, torture, agony, sadness, and pain.  And yet.... I loved every minute.  This is filmmaking at its best.  This is a film that wasn't made for the sole purpose of making money, hence why this is not a ""Hollywood Movie.""  Directed by the man who brought you ""Pi,"" Darren Aronofsky, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is about how the path to happiness and success isn't always the right one, and how some people are willing to do just about anything to get it.The main focus of this film is addiction.  We are presented the day and life of addicts and what they go through when they either have their fix or don't.  Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyron, are drug addicts.  They need their fix 24:7.  And when they don't get it, the results are pretty bad.  They come up with a scheme to sell cheaper drugs for more money so they can purchase more drugs and purer drugs.  To them, this is how they can succeed.  If they save enough money, they can purchase the better life.  Well, that better life is going to come with a price tag, and the price isn't money.  The more they use, the more they need.  And the more they need, the more desperate they become, doing whatever it takes to get their next fix.The film isn't only about drug addiction.  It's about addiction in general.  Anything can become an addiction.  Take for instance Sara Goldfarb, Harry's lonely mother.  Her fix is chocolate, sugar, and television.  When she gets a call that tells her she has been chosen to appear on television at a later date, she immediately runs for her red dress.  Unfortunately, with the passing years that have endured her life, she doesn't quite fit into it anymore.  So she goes to a doctor and gets a variety of diet pills.  They make her peppy and hyper.  But soon, she's adapted to them, and she wants more.  The more she takes, the more brutal affect it has on her body and mind.For these characters, what seems to be the path to absolute happiness turns into a gut-wrenching nightmare.  The last 15-20 minutes are the minutes you will NEVER get out of your head, no matter how hard you try and no matter how hard you want to forget them.I was so blown away by this movie.  I had heard so many good things about it and after seeing ""Pi,"" I knew that it was something I would have to see soon.  The movie may be pure hell and torture to watch, but it is done in such a brilliant and enriching way.  The camera movements, shots, and cuts are all so well-executed.  Aronofsky uses his camera techniques to get you right inside of all of the characters' heads, allowing us to experience exactly what they are going through.  People have complained about how all over the place the camera is during the movie, but the whole point is to make you go through exactly what the characters are going through.  It also shows us how fast a fix can take place and how short it is lived.  It wouldn't had been effective if it were done in any other way.The acting was great.  Ellen Burstyn is so great in her role as Harry's mother.  I don't think there's anyone else who could've gotten the job done.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are also terrific in their roles.  You could tell that they were absolutely determined to get their characters down in order to make the story work.As disturbing and unsettling as this movie is, I feel it is an important one for people to see.  Sure it's unrated, but this is something I think they should make mandatory viewing for junior highs and high schools.  Anyone who is thinking of using or experimenting with drugs really needs to see this movie.  I'm sure they'll have second thoughts.  I myself have never done drugs, and seeing this movie reinforces the fact that I will never, ever do drugs.  EVER.The DVD is great and really does the movie justice.  (The menu's hilarious.  It really had me fooled.  I know some of the other reviews gave it away, but I'm not going to.  You'll see what I mean when you get to it.)  The picture and sound quality is sharp and breathtaking.  Some of the extra features are commentary, making-of documentary, deleted scenes, ""Anatomy of a Scene,"" trailers, and much more.I know I've said this before about some other movies, but I think this time it's going to stick:  This is possibly the most disturbing movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  Be warned, this is not a happy film to watch.  You're going to go through hell and back.  You're going to feel pain, sadness, and sickness.  You're going to want to turn it off, but deep down something is keeping you from doing so.  As disturbing as this movie is, it is an important one to watch.

You will laugh, cheer and cry all the way through this movie and walk away feeling as if a tornado just whipped through your soul.Darren Aronofsky has done what only a young and breathtakingly original director can do creating this movie. If you have read the book (which I strongly recommend BEFORE seeing this movie) you will understand what I mean, as the book is powerful and emotionally challenging. The movie Requiem for a Dream is both visually stunning and aurally powerful.Camera angels considered risky or unsettling by other mainstream directors are used with gritty confidence. Harsh sounds accompany strobe-like images in drug sequences allowing the viewer to almost FEEL what the characters feel. Aronofsky's cutting edge techniques of split screens with dual sound-tracks, long takes balanced by rapid-cut editing and staccato-like sound effects all propel the viewer on a rapid descent to hellish train wreck devastation.This is not an unsympathetic film, but certainly unapologetic. Unlike other ""drug films"" such as Trainspotting, there is no glimmer of glamorization of drugs here. In fact, if you see this movie and ever consider trying Heroin or Speed for that matter, consider yourself beyond hope.Ellen Burnstyn ... shout her name from the mountain tops! The Academy was bold enough to nominate her for an Oscar, but lost courage after that. It makes me wonder if the jury actually viewed the film. Her performance is one of the most riviting in recent memory AND was by far the most difficult role in the movie. Don't let that fool you, however; casting was done impeccably even down to a startling Marlon Wayans who turned out a dramatic role with savvy and eloquent understatement.I can't say enough about Requiem for a Dream, and feel what I have said is inadequate. You won't be able to see this movie without it touching you deeply. It is slick, beautiful, ugly, and devastating.

Siegel	"This is a movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The War Zone"" or ""Psycho"" that is relentlessly brilliant and very difficult to watch. It's a movie I can only watch about once a year.Much has already been written about this movie in the media and several excellent reviews below. The story of how four people fall prey to various addiction is well told. Aronofsky doesn't hit us with the horror right away. He lets us get to know the characters and their dreams before letting their addictions shatter those dreams. The acting is top notch. Leto and Burstyn and (surpisingly) Wayans are excellent. Connelley has gotten a lot of attention for a Beautiful Mind but this is her best performance to date.It's Aronofsky's film-making skill that makes this movie stand out. The relentless editing, creative camera angles and taut pace give the movie a look that's unforgettable.As for the Director's cut vs. edited version. The original movie was unrated because the MPAA wanted to give it the kiss of death with NC-17 (a rating it deserves -- this is NOT a movie for kids even though it's probably the most effective anti-drug message out there). Aronofsky bravely stuck to his guns and sent it out unrated. Blockbuster and other chains refused to stock an unrated movie, so some small edits were made. You won't miss much with the edited version, but I'd buy the Director's Cut on principle. Aronofsky deserves to have his true vision seen."	5.0	Tough but brilliant - the real best pic of 2000	2002-06-21	20	17	3
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; directed by Darren Aronofsky, affected me like few other films I've ever seen. &quot;Requiem&quot; tells the intertwined stories of Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), Harry's girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), and Harry's best friend (Marlon Wayans). As Sara sinks into a nightmare of prescription drug addiction, her son experiences a parallel hell of &quot;street&quot; drugs. Thus, the film explore two sides of drug addiction in the life of a single family.Aronofsky directs this film brilliantly, and his ensemble cast gives outstanding performances. Ellen Burstyn is heartbreaking in the starring role. In addition to the principal actors mentioned above, Christopher McDonald gives a creepy performance as a talk-show host with whom Sara is obsessed.This is an incredibly intense, upsetting film. Never before have I seen such graphic and relentless images shown in a theater. Aronofsky turns his cinematic eye on the extremes of human suffering, disorientation, and exploitation, and he never flinches. The images and sounds he presents were, to me, more upsetting than Holocaust video, Klan rally footage, or other real-life horrific material which I have seen over the years. And most conventional horror films will look like children's cartoons next to this movie. The final 20 or so minutes of the film are particularly intense; the unsettling musical score and sound effects blend perfectly with Aronofsky's visual symphony of pain.Despite the shocking images, I did not find &quot;Requiem&quot; to be exploitative. I believe this is because Aronofsky never loses sight of the humanity of these characters. Sara and the others are not just cinematic &quot;cannon fodder&quot;; they are characters with whom, despite their faults, we can empathize.&quot;Requiem&quot; is a technical tour-de-force. Be warned: the graphic scenes of sexual exploitation, cruelty, and suffering will, I believe, be simply too much for many viewers to bear.

Tresca ""Talien"""	"I never read anything about Requiem for a Dream except for an off-hand comment by a reviewer about another movie, ""At least it's not as relentlessly depressing as Requiem for a Dream.""  That's when I realized that no, Requiem for a Dream has nothing to do with What Dreams May Come.  In fact, the two are polar opposites.With a completely fresh perspective (once I realized that Robin Williams was not going to pop up at any moment and crack a joke), I was able to drink in the awful, heady concoction that is Requiem for a Dream.  And it's a testament to Darren Aronofsky that I walked away satisfied and even inspired by what ultimately is a tale of self-destruction.The movie begins with Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) having an argument with his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) over a television set.  It seems Sara is having a nervous breakdown and has decided to chain her television set to the wall to protect it ""against robbers.""  Then, terrified of Harry, she locks herself in a closet. The two argue through the door...until we realize that the person Sara's really afraid of, who really would steal the television, is Harry himself.  You see, Harry's a junkie.In a routine that's so rote as to become familiar to everyone in the neighborhood, Harry rolls the television set to a pawn shop, who in turn gives him money for it.  And then Sara goes back to pay for it.  The exchange is a pittance (20 bucks), but it's all a lot of work to keep the illusion that Sara is not funding Harry's drug habit.Requiem for a Dream is all about these kinds of illusions.  Behind it all lurks the very real danger of addiction; to people, to things, to routines, to hope.  The movie is truly a sad commentary over what happens when people lose hope.  It is the death of the American dream.From there, the movie branches into two different plots, following Sara and Harry's lives. Overweight, with her husband long dead and her only son stealing from her, Sara is a desperate, lonely woman.  When she receives a phone call that she will appear on a television show (an infomercial that plays incessantly, nattering on about ""Juice""), she struggles to fit into a red dress.  It's the same dress she wore once before, when her husband was alive, during happier times.  Fitting into the dress becomes an obsession, as she shifts from dieting to medication. The doctor doles out four kinds of drugs: three of them uppers and one a downer to make her sleep.Harry, on the other hand, has dreams of his own.  With his buddy Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and the love of his life, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), they hope to stop dealing drugs by ""one last score.""  Harry plans to open a boutique with Marion and live happily ever after. But all of them are addicted to cocaine and they come up with all sorts of excuses to snort it.What's different about this movie from say, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is the ever-present Aronofsky.  There's no shot he won't attempt, no horrible act he won't film, no technique he won't try.  We watch Sara on speed, as she cleans her entire apartment from top to bottom.  We are continuously assaulted by the RIP-SNORT-AHH rush of the drug trip, which hits the viewer like a rabbit punch to the head. We are with Sara during her bad trips and with Marion during her good trips.  Dreams and hallucinations start to blend together, and always the soundtrack reminds us that this is a nightmare, not a comedy.  These people are real.  They're you're neighbors, your friends, your family...and they need your help.But they never get it.  Nobody has any safety net.  Not Sara or Harry; not Tyrone who lost his mother when he was six; not Marion who sees a psychiatrist that lies to her parents about her treatment.  These people have all been forgotten by friends and family.  They grasp out in vain for dreams that are largely meaningless, struggle to achieve goals without any clear purpose, and ultimately fall, fall, fall...to their deaths, into insanity, or prison.Every actor in this movie is at the top of their game.  Leto does an admirable job as a bleary-eyed dreamer who keeps hoping to make a mythical ""big score"" that will save him from all the rot and ruin.  Connelly's uses her angelic looks to full effect, such that her it's gut-wrenching to watch her beauty (and her innocence) used and abused.  Wayans shows surprising range as a wayward soul who just wants to embrace his mother one more time.  But the real star of the show is Burstyn, who displays amazing range as a mother and an old woman, going slowly mad in the humdrum repetition of her life.  Her role is extremely convincing; enough to bring back some unpleasant memories of my own grandmother's mental decay.Drug-trip movies rarely work well unless...well, unless you're on drugs.  They tend to replicate the experience in such a fashion that if you're not high, the movie is confusing or just plain irritating.  Trainspotting created the canvas for a movie like Requiem for a Dream.  Aronofsky takes it to a whole new level of dread, using sound as much as sight to reinforce the highs and lows of addiction.Requiem for a Dream is not a movie for the faint of heart.  But it is not exploitive or judgemental.  Hubert Selby Jr. isn't just writing about people who are chained to their addictions, he's mourning them.  With Aronofsky's deft touch, a grim book truly rises to the level of a requiem, filled lights and sound that follow its poor subjects to their grim conclusions.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AWEY0GKTG4OAY	"Mike D ""Mike D"""	This movie is about as depressing as it gets. Every other scene shows the characters (played by excellent actors who show the most visceral emotions) slipping a notch further into dispair, sorrow, anguish, and basically, hell. The cinematic effects used emplasize the repetition of the habits that cause the characters downward spirals. The music repeats themes for much the same effect, and has parts that are painfull to listen to, creating an atmosphere that completes the sensory experience. The Krnos quartet performs remarkably, and the original score fits the movie perfectly. I would recommend renting the movie, unless you enjoy being depressed after watching a movie that drains any hope or leftover happiness.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1JMQ88IMH0XJL	Mike	REQUIEM FOR A DREAMTHE MOVIE: This movie is not really a 'movie'. I would prefer to call it an experience. What you sit through in this movie affects the people on the screen just as much as it affects the audience. We are put through emotional turmoil watching these characters' dreams slip away from them, we go through the horrors of addiction and experience every emotion that the actors on the screen display. On the subject of acting this movie shows some of the best performances ever in a movie, especially from Ellen Burstyn, who gives a truly indescribable performance. Overall, there is no movie I have ever seen to better the quality seen in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.THE SPECIAL FEATURES: I would buy this movie on DVD if it had zero special features. It is an essential film for me. It's just a bonus that it has some really cool special features. The best of these is an involving and amazing making of feature that has commentary from Darren Aronofsky. It's stunning to see how much effort and heart went into this production. The Anatomy of a Scene is also very interesting, showing how Aronofsky did many of the camera tricks. We also get quite a few deleted scenes that don't do much to make the DVD better but they don't ruin it either. It's hilarious to see Marlon Wayans mocking JarJar Binks! In Memories, Dreams and Addictions Ellen Burstyn interviews Hubert Selby Jr. about his life. This is a very long interview that doesn't always intrigue the viewer and it was kind of confusing because you don't know if Hubert is being serious or kidding with us. We also get 2 theatrical trailers, a B-roll and audio commentaries from Aronofsky and Matthew Libatique, director of photography.	4.0	Movie: 5/5, DVD: 4/5, Average: 4.5/5.	2002-10-21	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1A921NQHIMNL2	Mike	This is a great insight of the way drug use is destroying livesin urban America today.It has extremely good camera shots in the scenes in which Jered Leto and Marlon Wayans are injecting drugs. Also, they shot the certain scenes well that involved the character Sarah Goldfarb, because it builds the uneasyness inside of you while you are watching it, and it makes it seem as the movie is going on that Sarah is becoming more mentally damaged from her use of certain amphetimenes that she is taking.This movie creates a message, which creates a much more powerful impact on the veiws of many people then a lot of the cheesy anti-drug commercials. The end leaves you hollow inside from watching these characters try to fulfill their dreams, when the drive for their satisfactions of their dreams ends up crashing down on them at the end.When Sarah is watching the TV show over and over again, it makes her think more and more that she will end up being on it, however the effect of the amphetimine in the diet pills makes her clueless of to what's going on in reality. At the end, the scene in which they need to give her shock treatment and soon afterwards she ends up in the insane asylum, from my opinion, is the most dramatizing, nerve-racking part of the film. (Other then the scene that Harry wakes up with a stub for an arm.)The characters have a drug addiction, but what drugs are they using? In the scenes in which the characters Marian and Harry snort drugs, it looks like cocaine, but has the effects of meth, from their contant insomnia.  It could be either coke or meth from the adrenialine rush.  That is what confuses me.People act like watching this movie twice only doubles the amount of hollowness inside of you and makes you even more concious of the dangers of drugs, that devastates you to think what they do to so many people.  If you are considering veiwing this film, i recommend that you do not watch it twice, because watching it once already gives you the message. I did manage to watch it twice, and the second time made me shiver all the way down my body a repeaded time from the first.  However, i suggest you do veiw this breathtaking, fact-based work of art.	4.0	Be exited! Be-be exited!	2005-07-15	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A128PMX5NKLQF6	Mike Wilson	After watching this movie numerous times over the past three years I have owned it, I can say that this movie may contain the best sound versus visuals of any movie to date.  I thougroughly enjoyed &quot;Pi&quot;, so I decided to rent this movie and was blown away.  I have also read Hubert Selby's &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; and loved the rawness it possessed.  The movie and the book it was adapted from really show a side of all humanity that is common among us all.  We all have are vices, some are good and some are bad, but when they are taken to an extreme, the result is usually negative.  Love someone or something too much, you will always be left broken-hearted or dead, respectively.  Much like the X-Files, there usually is some music playing in the background.  I have never seen this technique used to perfection as it is in this movie.  The shots, dialogue, music, etal. are as original as it comes.  I enjoy showing this movie to friends just to see there reaction.  There have only been two responses, they either love it or feel that it is too disturbing.  Nonetheless, this is a truly great, original American movie that offers something of value to every distinct viewer.	5.0	The most ugly, yet beatiful film ever.	2002-06-02	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"""No middle ground here: you'll either love or hate `Requiem for a Dream,'"" the dust cover publicity reads. I beg to differ: I admired the film for its intensity, its fine if unorthodox craftsmanship, and its superb performances, but I found it so harrowing and depressing that I can't imagine how anyone could ever love it. Director Darren Aronofsky, writing the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr. from Selby's novel, strives to recreate the subjective experience of a junkie's addiction, to an extent even films such as ""Drugstore Cowboy"" failed to do. Working with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Jay Rabinowitz and sound man Brian Emmerich, Aronofsky assaults us with the sensory experience of addiction, as experienced by four pathetic losers: junkie Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and speed freak mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn). Each becomes the perfect, and perfectly horrible, example of the different private hells that junkies fall into. All four actors are superb, but the standout is Burstyn, the saddest of all, a lonely widow who becomes addicted to diet pills in the vain hope of landing a spot on a TV game show. The sight of Burstyn imploding in paranoiac terror, as she hallucinates that her refrigerator is attacking her and the people on TV are laughing at her, will be etched in your memory forever. Whether you want it to be, of course, is another matter. I was glad I saw ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but I think once was enough. The DVD, however, is cleverly packaged (as a video by Tappy Tibbons, the TV motivational speaker Burstyn is obsessed with, played with smarmy ferocity by Christopher McDonald). It contains a compelling ""Making Of"" documentary, as well as a bonus video of Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby, who is still the unhappiest kid in Brooklyn after all these years."	4.0	No middle ground on this film?

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2WZ3OKU6H716Y	miles@riverside	"The movie uses a lot of split-screen effects, like you see in those early Brian DePalma thrillers such as DRESSED TO KILL and SISTERS and so forth.  This and the time-lapse photography make the picture very engaging visually.  The characters and dialogue are fairly convincing, and the story moves along at a reasonably fast clip.  All of which are good things because, while the film is not entirely without a sense of humor, it moves inexorably toward a very depressing, hopeless conclusion.I don't think the theme to the movie is simply ""Don't Do Drugs"".  The Ellen Burstyn character's amphetamines are doctor-prescribed.  An interview with the novelist/co-screenwriter Selby explains that the story is really about human suffering (hard to argue with that).  Most stories about suffering indicate that there's a point to the suffering, or at least that there's light at the end of the tunnel; but this one does neither.So, entertaining and technically impressive, but also a real downer."	4.0	Very Clever, Very Bleak	2003-12-14	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; shows the lives of four characters and their addictions. It is summertime in Coney Island, NY and there is a sweet and lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb ( Ellen Burstyn)that lives by herself. Her favorite TV game show is hosted by Tabby Timmons (Christopher McDonald). Sarah receives a phony call from the show telling her that she is going to be the next contestant. Sarah feels that she has to lose weight to fit into her favorite red dress, so that she can look good for the show. Sara visits her local doctor, who prescribes her diet pills that work miraculously. Unfortunately, the pills turn out to be amphetamines. Sarah's son Harry(Jared Leto) and his best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) are heroine addicts that spend all of their time either consuming , or selling to maintain their habbit. However, when their supply is cut off, Harry and Tyrone run into a fatal losing streak that manages to take Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connely) down with them. Now all four characters must try and regain control of their lives.&quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; offers the most realistic look at addiction that I have ever seen. The story is emotional and hard hitting, going back and forth between Sarah and Harry and company. The film is shot brilliantly. The actual ingestion of the drug is extremely graphic and disturbing. After the drug is done, we see a short period when their life seems better. But afterwards, we get to see reality come crashing down on all of them with how quick the effect ends. According to Entertainment Weekly, this film is so realistic that it should be seen in high schools across America. Too bad the NC-17 rating wouldn't sit well with parents. The musical score is haunting, and extremely beautiful. It really helps to drive the movie on the downward spiral that it travels on.All the performances are outstanding. Jared Leto is amazing as Harry. The character offers all the false promises of an addict and a shocking portrayal of using and hitting rock bottom. Ellen Burstyn does the best job in the film. Her portrayal of Sarah is one that we really feel sorry for. The path she travels down, was forced onto her by a dishonest doctor. The emotion that she puts forth is very realistic! Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, and Marlon Wayans are also outstanding.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a movie for the ages. It is one that will never fail to amaze audiences everywhere. The amazing story, reality of the drug scene, and performances are all flawless. The DVD is outstanding. It is extremely low priced, and the extras include commentary from the director, a making of documentary, deleted scenes, and much much more!	5.0	This movie blew me away!!	2003-10-03	3	2	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"I've somehow managed to put off seeing this movie for 11 years.  It was a conscious decision.  Director Darren Aronofsky's recent success with ""Black Swan"" and a cheap Blu ray price finally got me to watch it.  My original hesitation had to do with the subject matter and the fact I knew Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would be sexually abused.  Now I love to see beautiful women  but brutality and rape is not my thing.  Here Marion, her boyfriend played by Jared Leto, his friend played by Marlon Wayans and the mother of Leto's character all circle the drain strung out on drugs.  Sara is the mother and is brilliantly played by Ellen Burstyn.  She is hopped up on amphetamines prescribed by a quack doctor in an attempt to lose weight.  The other 3 are your typical beautiful young people whose future is compromised by a long stint hooked on your garden variety street drugs.  The acting is superb all the way around, but this is a difficult movie to watch.  It is gut wrenching and nauseating but has brilliance about it with the sights and sounds Aronofsky brings to film.

But I felt cheated because by concentrating on style he sacrificed opportunities to allow the audience to get lost in the story--which is, let's face it, why a lot of people go to films.That shortcoming is definitively rectified in this, the director's next effort.  Sure--this time he didn't have to start from scratch with the writing, he had Selby to work from. But he's managed to keep his stylistic brilliance and wit, even improve on it (e.g. the dilating pupils, jumping fridge and deafening teeth-grinding) and still provide a showcase for the actors & story.  Selby writes about addiction and that is a big theme of this movie.  But the story is really about tragic results when characters seek a better life for themselves and those they love, but their imagination of where to look for their dreams is limited to destructive spaces.About the acting: we all knew Burstyn is an exceptional actor, though sparsely seen lately; let's hope that changes.  But Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly *all* surprised me here.  I didn't realize they had it in them.  And (character) actor Christopher McDonald is brilliant as the real and hallucination versions of the pseudo-evangelical tv personality.About the music: Clint Mansell did the amazing score and I even bought the soundtrack.  Kronos quartet's theme was used on trailers for The Two Towers last fall and always gives me goosebumps.I see a lot of films and am hard pressed to think of ten that hung over me for days like this one did.  I'd rank it with some of my all-time favourites in the gutwrenching genre: Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and to a lesser extent Memento.	5.0	I liked Pi, but this is exceptional	2003-02-18	0	0	0

In Requiem for a Dream, Aronofsky has created a movie so completely negative and grim that I actually found myself thinking, &quot;Heroin addiction couldn't possibly be this bad.&quot; I mean, after watching countless other (and better) films about addiction, I realize it will empty your bank account, ruin your health and destroy your personal relationships. But did the main character really need to develop a huge, pus-filled, necrotic looking hole in his arm, then have that arm amputated with a buzz saw while he was awake, to get that point home? While at the same time his girlfriend pulls a lesbian trick in a room full of sleazy yuppies while they stuff dollar bills in her mouth, just for some dope?This isn't realism; it's complete and total nihilism without much purpose other than to be as disturbing as possible and to show off a bunch of MTV-ish sound blurts and flash cuts. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like you need a shower and tell you nothing new about drugs, this is it.	2.0	Disturbing and completely vacant	2001-12-02	20	9	11

It took every situation to such a ridiculous extreme that the point was lost. For example, the scene where the mother receives shock treatments. Nice bit of horror, but completely unrealistic - they don't treat people that way-- they put them to sleep-- and showing it as if  she'd be awake and aware is cheap theatrics that reflect poorly on the director. It's not as if you have to embellish the realities of heroin addiction - its bad enough without without the exaggeration.	1.0	Hideous and over the top.	2005-04-16	49	26	23
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	APIW11UEPKIC2	"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ..."	This movie is always talked about as being an anti-drug movie.  That may be true but I cannot say for sure.  The director is not known for being outspoken about drugs.  He has probably used before.  I really have no idea.  Maybe the reason I don't find this to be an anti-drug movie is because I have never had problems with drugs.  Maybe it would have hit me as pure trash.  I have known people that have had problems but I think that the thing people need to realize going into this, IT IS A MOVIE!  Watch it as a movie.  Don't show it to your kids as a message against drugs.  They will probably think it is a really cool movie and possibly think about using drugs because the film is so good.  When I say it is good I mean you may watch it 20 or 30 times like it has caused me to do.  Most movies I can do other things while watching but I just can't do it with this.  I have to watch it in it's entirety and I can never look away.  So again, just watch it as a movie and don't read too much about it before you see it.Sorry to sort of go off on a rant but all I hear is how this should be considered a documentary and some people even say a bad one at that.  Maybe these people don't watch real movies with great acting performances regularly.  Marlon Wayans will totally blow you away with how you will believe every bad thing that happens to him.  Ellen Burstyn probably gives the best performance overall.  All of the charcters have a drug problem.  Burstyn's character is addicted to weight loss drugs and her son(Jared Leto), his girlfirend, and best friend are heroine addicts.  The movie starts out well enough and drugs seem to be helping them out but when there is a dry spell and no drugs are around, things do not go so well.The cinematography in this movie is one of the most amazing pieces of art I have ever seen on film.  There is a scene where Jared Leto and his girlfriend(Jennifer Connely) are very desperate for money so they decide for Connely to go spend some time with a man who has been wanting to pay for her time for a while.  This is a disturbing part of the film but it becomes one of the most unique moments I have ever seen in a movie.  I would consider this the best score I have ever heard in a movie and it helps out when Connoly has a scene leaving the place of the man who paid for her company and the camera truly makes you feel what she is feeling.  You will have to find out for yourself what she is feeling and it is kind of a scary moment the camera creates.  It was very unique.  I have never experienced a feeling like that in  movie and never have sinced.I have done the best I can to explain this movie.  It is one of my favorites films of all time and I just had to say that and let it out of my system.  Words cannot describe how good the movie is but I have tried.  Every scene from start to finish is absolutely outstanding and yes the ending will hit you hard.  It is tragic, and it is just plain amazing.  I will admit that I would never think of EVER shooting up after seeing this, even if I wasn't scared out of my mind of needles in the first place, but this is one of my top 20 favs ever even if it is seen as an anti-drug movie.	5.0	One of the best movies ever	2007-01-29	9	7	2

The soundtrack is very important in its dramatic element. I can safely say the soundtrack of this film carries the largest dramatic element I have ever heard a soundtrack carry. I'm pretty sure Mozart originally wrote lux Aterna, but Clint Mansell has done a superfluous job re-mixing it in so many ways for this film. This may be the most dramatic orchestrated piece of music I have ever heard used in film or television. Most recently Howard Shore used it in a preview trailer for Lord of the Rings Two Towers.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AZTIDJ4BACLHB	Movie Addict NZ	Requiem For A Dream is not a film to be messed around with. It is a very brutal film depicting four Coney Island people and the anti-climax outcome of their lives. There is one thing that they all share, and that is an addiction. Whether it be an addiction to TV, diet pills, or heroin, they are all brought under the spell of the thought that there is a better life beyond the lives they lead. Interestingly but beautifully directed by Darren Aronofsky of Pi fame; comes the real to life brutality of drugs to the screen in a way that would normally never be seen. A very talanted cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans bring the story to life in great depth. You begin to feel for the characters and wonder why these normal people have chosen the paths that they have taken to self destruction. Even though this film is not intended for a young audience, it should be seen by any teenager who is thinking of experimenting with drugs of any sort. I am pleased that the director did not give in to the MPAA by editing any scenes from the film to avoid the doomed American NC-17 rating, but releasing it as unrated for the world to see just where lives can lead with drugs in you're system. >Enjoy&lt;	5.0	A Brutally Gripping Masterpiece	2002-06-16	0	0	0

It focuses around four doomed people, who you grow to like, and then they all fall into a spiral of their own self-destruction.

Well, it isn't fantastic, and anyone that describes it is fantastic is highly disturbed.  For this is one of the most gruelling things that I have ever had to sit through.  It is explicit, upsetting and totally unforgettable.  But fantastic?  Jurassic Park was fantastic, this is on a higher plain.Although the film doesn't really have a message to it other than 'drugs are bad', it thankfully shows both the highs and the lows of the drugs.  This is in sharp contrast to other drugs movies such as 'The Basketball Diaries' that seems to consist almost totally of lows.  It also shows that ecstasy, heroin and cocaine aren't the only forms of drugs on the market.  For example, the same cut shots and editing are used when Harry shoots up as when his mother switches on the TV, eats or drinks her coffee.  The point being that there are plenty of legal drugs on the market that have an equally destructive effect.Finally, the explicit nature of the film: I found myself squirming in my seat a couple of times and there's no doubt that there are some pretty horrific scenes here.  And as for the incredibly explicit sex scenes, it's difficult to call them exploitive when they so clearly show the degradation that the character has gone through to reach this stage.  This film is not for the weak-willed.  It is upsetting and mesmerising in its sheer grotesqueness.  Yet it is also an unforgettable, important piece of film-making.	5.0	Worrylingly disturbing, sickeningly compelling	2001-11-11	2	2	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0	Mr G Bowden	At once compelling and repellent at the same time, Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; has been billed as one of the best films of 2000. Fusing MTV-inspired editing, stylised cinematography, a hip-hop score given added grace thanks to some strings and stirringly effective performances from the cast, director Aronofsky has made an unforgettable piece of cinema that deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.Playing like an extremely demented Aphex Twin video (without the absurdist hilarity), Aronofsky makes his actors honourably play perversion-parade for his opus as they misplace their hope of escaping from their mundane lives into chemical charms, from heroin, to coke, to dieting pills. Aronofsky does the right thing in not plumping for the audience's sympathy too much and even in the finale switches from sly comedy to full blown horror with panache. That said, Aronofsky delivers the harrowing moments impeccably also, with the help of some fine editing from Jay Rabinowitz, Matthew Libatique's haunting cinematography and Clint Mansell's brilliant score. Carrying the film though, the actors play their parts just as well, especially Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, the former making full use of his big blue eyes to suggest a sweet hope that is tragically tempered by his aimless actions. Burstyn however makes the film hers, especially in the final moments when the audience is shown what she has finally been reduced to; no wonder she announced upon winning Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards earlier this year that this was &quot;the role of my career&quot;.Film has been attacked for its easy moralising (&quot;Drugs are bad, mmmkay?&quot;), but in his descent into the lowest depths of pop culture hell, Aronofsky gives us a visually resplendent reminder of what the medium of cinema can achieve, if not one of the best school education films about drugs ever made.	4.0	A Movie Everyone Should See Once	2001-06-30	9	7	2

Anyone who has never taken drugs and would like to know the journey that addicts take will not be disappointed.  It will leave you drained and in pain for the characters.It was especially painful for me since I know that this path that was taken in the movie is all too real for thousands of young people.

There is no beginning, middle or end...it's just a sequence (though a terrifying one at that).For a film to take itself as seriously as this one does, a viewer should...no wait, NEEDS to care about the characters. For me, at no point did I feel much sympathy or care about any of them, with the exception of maybe the mother.Despite my frustrations with the script, it is well acted. It's gritty and certainly conveys the despair and dark underworld of addiction. But again, without any sort of arc, I never felt sucked into it and was really expecting some sort of payoff, which never occurred.The editing is certainly unique and worth showing to film students. I've never seen a film like it from that standpoint.If you can ignore the writing and just ""go along for the ride"", then its worth a watch.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2CHLPRJZSD6U9	"Mr. S. St Thomas ""suckerfly"""	The stronger story in this moralistic tale of addiction, is the tale of Ellen Burstyn's character. By far, that was the basis of a great piece of filmmaking. The exploration of over-the-counter / prescription drugs, television, weight loss, hyped up marketing ploys was the film that should have been made and thoroughly delved into. Burstyn is a wonderful actor and a film made with that character for 90 minutes, making as many pointed accusations it could about an industry of addiction in denial would have made a powerful film. That was the movie I wanted to see, but that was not what was on offer here.The quick MTV style edits work in the context of Burstyn's segments, but in the long run, the story overall could tell her tale far far better than trickery and sped up montages. This just wasn't done.And as far as the 'youth in trouble' portions of the film, I really was not buying it. As the main character 'shoots up' into the same vein which is now swollen, gaping and oozing, totally remiss of the fact that he has another vein JUST like it on his other arm, was kind of funny. This device was just primarily used to frighten the unaware. Anyone who was/is an addict would look at this character and say, what an [goof]! Now, if he had been using heroin for 10 or 20 years, and every viable entry vein on his body had been thoroughly collapsed, THEN I'd believe it. Regardless of the addiction, heroin users aren't THAT stupid. Insuring you get the next 'hit' relies on you maintaining a reliable 'hitpoint'. Really did not buy that, ruined the whole point of the movie. Went for shock when it didn't need to. Came across like a 1930's drug warning exploitation film, but in colour. After that, the movie just falls apart.Its an interesting watch, and surely worth it for Burstyn's performance throughout, but it honestly works better as a film you'd show to students to scare them off drugs, OR film students interested in editing techniques. I know the people worked hard on the project, I know they put their efforts in to it, but there was a better movie in here with just Burstyn carrying it. And a more believeable plot would help carry a more believeable message. That addiction of all kinds afflicts each and every one of us, admitting it helps.	2.0	Requiem For A Better Dream	2003-03-17	23	17	6

Is it finely done?  Well yes it is that too.You end up getting sucked into these people's lives which start off fairly innocuous enough.  All four main characters are played extremely believingly.  Jared Leto is the son to Ellen Burstyn's diet-pill addiction mother.  Marlon Wayans is the oh so cool buddy to Leto while Jennifer Connelly (bewitchingly beautiful) is the girlfriend that will go to demeaning ends to get a fix.The message is loud and clear.  Innocent addictions start with baby steps and can lead to utter despair and destruction.  You only need to watch once to get that message but once you watch you'll be thinking twice before drinking too much coffee, venturing to the seamier sides of life, or being lured into other addictions.  I'm sure that wasn't necessarily the movie's or director Darren Aronofsky's intent but that's what spoke loud and clear to me.The pacing and perspective are intensely neurotic and visually portray an addiction so enticing and powerful that it can wipe out the humaneness of four lives right off the map.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3AX7CWZSC2CW2	Mugi	Requiem for a Dream depicts the lives of four characters from summer through winter. Ellen Burstyn gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Sarah Goldfarb, a widow living alone who won a chance to appear on television and is trying to lose weight so that she can fit into her husband's favorite red dress for the event. Her son, Harry Goldfarb, is an heroin addict who tries to make money in the drug trade with buddy Tyrone to fund his girlfriend Marion's clothing business. The movie goes in a downward spiral as the four addicts are dragged deeper into their habits, each of them finding themselves increasingly paranoid and helpless, ending up in increasingly compromising positions.Darren Aronofsky's directing is pure genius. Each time the characters take a hit, the screen cuts to a fast editing of drugs being consumed, pupil dilating and cells pulsing. This is repeated a few times in the film to emphasize the never ending cycle of drug use. I also like the use of dreams and illusions in the movie. Each character is absorbed in their own dreams of happiness while their realities are rapidly deteriorating. I find that an apt parallel of drug use which offers promises of pleasure. The second half of the movie is hauntingly poignant as the scenes of dreams, reality and drug use intersect one another.Overall, the movie is very realistic, which makes it gritty. But isn't that the purpose of the movie?	5.0	A gritty portrayal of addiction	2013-08-25	1	0	1

Although I enjoyed the plot as well, it was the sheer artsyness that atracted me to it. It's a perfectly woven quilt of visual and audio stimulus; from the super-speed pupil dialation, to the sound it makes every time Ellen Burstyn's excellent portrayal of a pill poppin granny, picks up the remote control to her television.For those who have never heard the term &quot;multi-media&quot;, it is more than simply a movie, it is the marriage of the visual and audio aspects to stimulate and titilate the on looker's brain. For those interested in multi-media, check out DJ Q-Bert's movie &quot;Wave Twisters&quot;. It is Q-bert's music played over truly crazy animation, sort of in the spirit of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; (another great). Requiem is a little more on the visual end of the spectrum than those mentioned above, but an outstanding multi-media production none the less. I would highly recomend &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; to any one. I would also reccomend those other somewhat closed minded reviewers to watch it again, and appreciate it for it's multi-media value. So watch it, even if only to experience it's Multi-Media madness.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A4RUN01NO4827	myownme777	Requiem for a dream is based upon the equally great book by Hubert Selby Jr. who deserves to be noticed, as well as for Last Exit to Brooklyn, also a great movie adaptation.This film made a great impact on me when i went to see it in it's unfortunate limited release, as it still does today.I have recommended this film to everyone that i've ever cared enough about and only 1 person let me down when she fell asleep and i broke up with her immediately because of it.Everything about this film is perfection in my opinion.Yes the subject matter is depressing but so is the 6 o'clock news.The always great Ellen Burnstyn works her heart out to put in one of the greatest performances of all-time.After the Oscars gave the award for best actress that year to Julia Roberts i immediately stopped watching them, what used to be such a tradition to look forward to every year.Instead i woke up to the realities of that institution and have found more meaningful expression within independent award shows.Darren Aronofsky does a great job in translating Selby's vision to screen, after having directed the also very good Pi.Jennifer Connely also puts in a note-worthy performance, better than her award winning performance in A Beautiful Mind.One musn't forget the music as the soundtrack matches the film well.Watch the extras and the making-of doc.Watch what Ms.Burnstyn goes through for one scene, as well as a treat for Fangoria fans.Can't say enough about this film.Watch the unrated version only to get the complete vision.	5.0	Great Film	2005-08-31	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A12WE3MP6QF04	"""nanabush"""	What can l say that's already been said about this dark and harrowing film ?  I can blab all day about the superb direction but what l really want to bring to your attention is the Oscar-nominated performance of Ellen Burstyn.  She has already racked up a slew of Best Actress awards from the Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston and Florida Film Critics.  Her Independent Spirit, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations are strong indications that she has an excellent chance at winning her second Best Actress Oscar statuette come this March 2001.  Her character's decent into drug addiction is so harrowing and heartbreaking to watch that you are literally glued to the screen.  The supporting cast all do wonderful jobs with regards to showing their emotional vulnerability on screen.  One of my favourite scenes is in the apartment of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) where she imagines her refridgerator coming alive, threatening to eat her.  In that one scene alone, the musical score, acting, visual effects and direction are all at their best.  And the scene of Sarah's talk with her son about being old and alone is so heartbreaking.  Acting at it's best, in my opinion.  I bet they will use that very scene as her &quot;Oscar clip&quot; at this years Academy Awards ceremony.  The film is also very dark and sometimes graphic so beware if you're someone who watches only PG movies.  I love the musical score as well.  One of the best of this past year.  It truly effected to mood of the entire film and made it all the more enjoyable for me as a viewer.  Don't miss this film if you want to see one of the top ten films of this past year.	4.0	Ellen Burstyn Is Remarkable !!!	2001-03-03	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2MGZ2QGN52HY5	Nancy Calas	Requiem For A Dream is a shocking veiw of the drug world and the true effects it has on people. Through its four characters, played brilliantly by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, you see the effects different kinds of drugs have on different walks of life. The excitment of this wonderful film is nurtured and at times heightened by the amazing cinematography. This electrifying film will have you hearing the requiem of the lovable characters and dreaming about the chance that this could happen to you.I thought that Requiem was a wondefful work of art that deserves to be seen by all that coudl fully appreciate it.

If this film's horrifying portrayal of the affects of drug and addiction isn't enough to convict a drug user to make an effort to quit, then it is a sad testimony to the will and drive of the people in this world.  Ellen Burstyn gave a breathtaking performance!  I never cry during movies (Its not that I'm cold hearted, I just don't cry during movies!), but I have never been closer to tears than I was during the final ""Requiem"" of the movie.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Darren Aronofsky, coming off his chilling breakthrough Pi, managed to bring one of the most accurate portrayals of drug addiction to film with this nerve shattering film.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jenniffer Connolly, and Marlon Wayans give knockout performances as the doomed people who have one kind of addiction or another.  For Sara (Burstyn in her Best Actress nominated role), her addiction is television.  She watches an absurd self help infomercial with hopes that she will appear on it.  When her hopes are elevated, she begins to down diet pills and coffee so she can look thin for the show, and then we watch her slowly deteriorate into madness.  For her son Harry (Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Connolly, looking beautiful as ever), and his friend Tyrone (Wayans), their addictions are heroin and the hopes of making it big in the drug underworld, which they begin to do and then only find everything crashing around them.  Requiem For a Dream is undoubtadly one of the most depressing and heart wrenching films that I have ever seen, and Aronofsky's uncompromising direction shows the viewer the way drug addiction really is: it's not humerous (such as portrayed in films like Trainspotting or even Drugstore Cowboy), and it can be incredibly euphoric, and utterly nightmarish.  All in all, those looking for a different, creative film should give Requiem For a Dream a look, but don't expect to watch it more than once.	4.0	Disturbingly haunting and totally unforgettable	2003-01-08	5	5	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AGAH64XMHB9LZ	Neal Humphrey	This movie, shocking, riveting, is one of the most incredible performances I have ever seen. Recommended to me by a fellow film-lover, I had no idea what I was in for. The tour through a drug addicts life, and the incredible mirror of the more standard druggie to the pill poppers, ignorant of the incredible weight their habits carry, unwarned by society, will shock and amaze you. Aside from that, the cinematic techniques employed in this film are incredible - long takes at fast speed, super short shots, and walking shots with the character still, the background moving behind them, all expertly placed, filled with meaning, symbolism and power. It will blow your mind - I was just blank for hours after, unable to comprehend the power of what I had just witnessed. I recommend this to anyone who has ever done or thought of doing drugs, as the most powerful possible deterrent (DARE doesn't have anything to compare to this), anyone who is losing their faith in Hollywood's cheesy movies, or anyone who likes movies. Just don't expect to do anything for a while afterwards - your brain will be literally overpowered.	5.0	Restore your faith in the power of FILM!	2001-09-14	1	1	0

Well, the right kind of substance for me anyway. I wasn't necessarily bored by it like I am by a lot of other so called great movies, this was actually pretty fun to watch as it was visually captivating, but unfortunately in the end ended up being a pretty average story.There wasn't enough for me to care about, it's ""just"" a story about the consequences of doing drugs, there weren't really any interesting subplots or anything that was explored. With a premise like that, I would've preferred seeing how destructive drugs could be to friendships, relationships, etc.I can just add this to my list of over-hyped movies I've seen that was supposed to be amazing, but only succeeded in mildly entertaining me.

Marlon Wayans has never been this good in anything before or after. Everyone else is amazing as well, i just point him out because he's normally quite a goof and i would never have imagined that he would be able to pull off such a serious role so well. see it when you think you'll be able to get yourself out of the dark place it is certain to take you to.	5.0	deeply unsettling and superbly well acted	2013-10-07	2	1	1

Aronofsky does perhaps the most incredible job ever done by any director EVER in staying true to the story, it's mood and it's message.  Art can be deciphered in many ways and, personally, I've always felt that this story deals with far more than just drugs.  I find it sad that so many people here are trying to compare this film to Reefer Madness.  Really?  Is that the way to convince yourself that you're own drug habit isn't so bad?  Or do you simply live in a fairy land where all the junkies are fully functional and live well into old age because you're all just like William S. Burroughs.  Read the book before you start blasting the director and actors on this one.  Regardless of how you feel about the ""glamorization"" of drug-induced downward spirals, I think you'll agree that this film is captures the very essence of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel."	1.0	A great film that you shouldn't buy edited.	2009-07-14	7	2	5

I do not recommend this movie.Instead of elaborating on why, I will say only this: unlike other films/books in this genre, particularly &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (book, not film) &quot;Requiem&quot; is virtually devoid of humor. It takes itself much to seriously for what it is. The phrase &quot;the Emporer wears no clothes&quot; comes to mind - intensely close up camera shots repeated over and over do not a subtle, deep film make. In fact, this film is void of all subtelty. It is very confident of its own profundity, which is rather ironic, considering the four hundred and seventy eight thousand cliches it indulges in.For a good - mostly real - story about heroin addiction, but done with some integrity by Jim Carroll, read the Basketball Diaries. At least he keeps his sense of humor - something which makes his message a little more real than, in my opinion, this ultimately pretentious film.	1.0	Once Again	2001-05-30	25	9	16

The breakneck visuals concentrate the brutal honesty of the film.  In the hands of a less talented director, the visual techniques would have appeared more like a music video and less as a narrative.  The score of the film consists mostly of variations on the same piece of music.  The haunting remixes accurately represent the film's dark mood.If you respected this film (it's hard to ""enjoy"" a film such as this), you may like Darren Aronofsky's Pi as well.Be sure to get the director's cut of Requiem for a Dream.

These happen to work for this movie and had purpose for the story line but there was room for some tasteful editing (without losing the message).While many parents might not feel comfortable viewing this film with their teenager - there are valuable lessons in it for young people who all too often think they are 'bulletproof' or that 'it won't happen to them'.I give it only 4 out of 5 stars because some of the imagery is vague and unnecessary and it's not really a movie you want to watch more than once."	4.0	Every Teenager should watch	2005-01-12	3	1	2

This is one of those few movies where you actually stare at the tv screen for more than 5 minutes after the film is over...it's just that good. To say this is brilliant film-making is an understatement.  Ellen Burnstyn gave of the best performances I have ever (and I repeat, EVER!) seen on film. What really pisses me off is that she was nominated for an Oscar the same year that Julia Roberts won for that piece of trite called &quot;Erin Brockovitch&quot;....talk about wanting a recount!  Miss Burnstyn won that Oscar in my eyes that year.  And, I firmly believe that this movie should be sent to schools that participate in the &quot;Just Say No&quot; program.  It may be rated R (or in some versions, NC-17) but this is what really happens to people who abuse drugs.  The last 10 minutes of this movie will either move you to tears, or make you get up and leave the room...it's just that powerful.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3HEOREMM29XWV	"""novicaine19"""	A lot of movies try to explore youth and drugs. While most make some kind of bookish statement about how parents should pay attention to their kids, peers should be more accepting of each other, etc., this outstanding film shows the real hopes and aspirations of a lot of people who live a drug life. Indeed, there is an escape element that we typically associate with drugs, but we also see youth's fantasies for love, success, pleasure, and relief from the restrictions placed by conventional recipes for life. Moreoever, and this is where 'Req.' demolishes previous drug movies, the old mother also obtains a drug addiction of her own, reliving some of her younger dreams. Invariably, this woman has failed to satisfy her young yearnings despite living up to conventional models. Every viewer should leave this movie with doubts and questions, not answers.Indeed, this is a depressing movie, extremely painful. However, it illuminates questions in life via drama (not philosophical asides). Therein lies its ultimate strength: as if this were nearly a snap shot of life shaping moments we all experience but often fail to see how our choices will affect our outcome. Hopefully, this movie can help us feel the dangers we risk today, rather than simply processing them through automatic cheese grater-like cliches.	5.0	feel the pain	2001-08-13	3	2	1

Requim for a Dream grossly comes to terms with the reality of drugs and its effects. A physcotic path spiraling down to destruction is the main theme of this movie. Revolving around four characters who all have a connection this movie does what other movies cannot. It doesn't shy away from the grim reality of drug abuse which is raw and not made for tv. The most merorable and imagery scene is where Ellen Burstyn's character is consuming diet piils and coffee until she abrubtly gets a ravenous appetite for food but pushing herself back in order to lose wieght (just to fit into a pink dress) the food attacks her when the refrigerator comes alive and attempts to consume her whole. This type of scene in a movie is what makes one think, &quot;What the F*ck&quot; but then again wow. Ellen's performance should've won the best actresse award at the Oscars instead of Julia Roberts performance which seemed so dull compared to this one.Three words to describe this marvelous achievement; grim, raw, and amazing.

This depressingly bleak melodrama is what IFC and Sundance continue to peddle and why nobody cares about independent films.

A friend who suggested this one on movie night has now lost the right to do so in the future.  This film was just mean spirited, depressing, and unnecessary.  I will never be able to watch a film with Jennifer Connelly and not get upset again.  If a movie has anything to do with people destroying their lives over substance, they tend to be mean spirited by nature.  If you enjoyed this nightmare, go watch Rush.  You'll like it too.

After watching it the first time, I decided to never watch it again because of its raw darkness. The next day I was watching it again.The characters are likeable, but their lives are destroyed by their choices. It is painful to watch the characters go farther and farther down into their nightmarish lows.However, everyone should watch Requiem for a Dream because of its honest portrayal of drug use. Some aspects of the movie are incredible, like the artistic qualities of the film, the acting ability, and how easy the story is to relate to.Other aspects of Requiem for a Dream were annoying, but easily forgiven. The movie has a loose plot because the story is about observing the spiraling downfall of the character's lives. The filmmaking style can become aggravating because of how repetitive it is. And I had a quirky problem with trying to start the DVD, because an infomercial plays when I press the `play movie' button. I had to start the movie through `scene selection'.	4.0	Requiem for a Dream	2005-02-20	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3HLQG9Z4AVUH0	one woman's opinion	"If you are looking for a REALISTIC film about addiction, look elsewhere.  This is artsy crap with decent to excellent actors in it. The movie is devoid of any reality regarding the plot, drugs, addiction, New York City, or mental illness and its treatment. DO NOT believe the hype. Maybe the book makes it all work, but the movie (this is not a ""film"") fails utterly.This movie is chock full of rank stereotypes (New York jews, menacing racist crackers (who all live South of New York), moronic shoot 'em ups, and adolescent ""dirty"" sex fantasy) and just plain wrong plot lines.  To suspend your disbelief and just go with the film is practically impossible if you have accumulated more than a quarter-century's common knowledge. Shock therapy, or ECT, hasn't been administered as depicted for AGES.  Diet pills (speed) do not reduce people to catatonia and hallucinations--particularly if one has been off them for weeks.  Diet pills certainly curb appetite, but not so much that one is unable to eat and must be fed forcibly by a tube(again, especially if one has been off them for weeks).  I could go on and on about how unbelievable the plot lines are.  But there is another fundamental problem--other than making your pupils dilate, the movie offers little in the way explanation as to WHY these characters are willing to go to such extremes. No one seems to enjoy/get relief from getting stoned. Oh, wait, is it because all drugs will make anyone do anything? (Uh, not really.) The young characters don't even go through withdrawal to justify their actions. They barely even sweat--they just get snippy when they run out.  We are supposed to believe that Leto and Wayans drive (they suddenly have a CAR when the opening scene depicts them walking a TV set on a cart forEVER for $20) to Florida (gas money?) to score dope (because there is no fix in ALL of NYC) from some random dealer (they don't even know what CITY he is in) who just shot up a Waldbaum's and fled NYC in a tractor-trailer hauling oranges.  I kid you not. Oh, and smoking pot makes you hallucinate. Right. I want my money back."	1.0	Unrelentingly unrealistic	2012-05-14	18	5	13
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3T8ME3BRVGXJR	"Only ""onlyiwillremain"""	Some would say that this movie has no 'soul,' and they would be absolutely correct. That is the point.It begs the questions; What is Art? How far should Art go? What is the point of Art?Speaking for myself, I consider Art an essential reaction to Life, and a method of pushing emotions into others; Art is something that makes you feel things that you probably and sometimes hopefully, wouldn't feel on your own. The critical side in the questioning of how far it should go fall on mostly deaf ears, here; I believe Art should have no limits, and should only cater to an audience so-much, if at all. The point of Art is easy for me; the point is to move the Artists to make it, and secondly the audience who receive it.This movie is about how things have the ability to take humans over and hollow them out; drugs are the main carrier of the disease here, but the audience should be able to surmise that it's really speaking about all the things we lose ourselves in, to the point where we can't find out way back out. The obsessive, compulsive, worldly manipulations that crush so many lives, are the star of this show. It's a brutal, propulsive, assaultive movie that keeps the heat on until the end, and leaves you feeling like the characters must have; entirely empty. The point is to get there, to that point, carried by the loss of soul and light the characters experience.This movie is supposed to stay with you. It's supposed to haunt you. It's supposed to remind you next time you pick up that cigarette, to question if you're still in control of yourself; or those diet pills, of that six pack of beer, or that gambling habit you might have picked up. The point of this movie is to break into you, and show you exactly how easy it is to lose sight of who you are, where you're from and where you had planned to go; it's a stunning work of genius that's designed to shake you up in an extreme way and make you think about your life, and your dreams. It brings with it questions; who your friends are and if they're worth keeping around, for one. The film forces us, also, to examine our self worth; it makes us take stock of our lives and think of ways to make adjustments.I've only watched this movie twice. The first time was more than ten years ago, and the second time was a couple years ago. I plan to watch it again, but it's hard. This movie is a very upsetting movie; make no illusions about that. I find it incredibly hard to watch, at times, and think it takes me to the outer edges of my sanity by the end.The first few hours after watching the movie for the first time, I remember very well. I was pretty stunned, with where the movie had taken me, in such a relatively short period of time, but what seemed like an eternity. I felt so empty, bone dry, hollowed out. I didn't cry for a week after seeing this movie, for any reason; it took the ability out of me, and I've heard others say similar things regarding the film's effect on them. The days following, I thought a great deal about the movie and my life.If you are mentally unstable, or easily influenced, you shouldn't watch this movie. It's not for you. It just isn't.Having said all that, I don't think I would recommend this movie to my entire Christmas list. It's easily misunderstood, and if you go into it expecting a movie for entertainment-only purposes, you'll hate it.	5.0	Praise and Warning: Be Careful of Your Self and Where It Takes You	2011-01-28	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1NQ5IR2N7IIND	organikoak	I saw this movie twice.  Once in the theatre and more recently on DVD.  The first time I saw it I had high expectations because of all the film buffs that highly recommended it to me.  I thought it was a bit slow moving the first time I saw it, but once I walked out of the theatre, I was deeply moved.  In order for a movie to be good, I need to walk out of the theatre in amazement--amazement in the acting and amazement in the plot.Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto were both excellent in this movie.  Burstyn played Leto's mother, Sara Goldfarb, so unbelievably well.  She was a pathetic, sad, old, self-pitying woman who became addicted to diet pills and eventually went crazy.  Leto, who played Harry, eventually had his arm amputated because of a growing infection from heroin injections, and Jennifer Connelly, who played Marion Silver, humiliated herself by succumbing to acts of sexual violence in exchange for heroin.This movie does not glamourize heroin use.  It truly makes you think about it's fatal consequences.	5.0	Still recovering...	2001-07-20	5	4	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3ECY8BYAK5D2H	Orgazma	This was written above &quot;Requiem is far more slick and flashy, it shares Gummo's depressing pointlessness, viewer manipulation, and lack of realism in its overall outlook.&quot;The point of those movies were to show certain occurences at a certain time. To just watch a chunk of these character's lives. Viewer manipulation?? LACK of realism? Okay, that is the exact opposite. I know people EXACTLY like those people in those movies and I find the characters to be well molded and VERY realistic. That's the whole point. The overall outlook is just what some people's actual reality is. If you don't find the characters to be &quot;real&quot; enough people, you obviously don't know people like that. Everything about both those movies were amazing and I find it to be a sickening thing to say someone would be a masochist to watch Requiem twice. It was a beautiful movie and the end gave me a sense of perfection. It topped it off perfectly and gave the perfect sense of closure.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A9OZ9N4L7BWST	orly Trieber	After seeing just about every drug genre movie created, I have finally found one that does reality justice.  Gone are the days of candy coating or glamorizing heroin.  In this often uncomfortable and raw story, you fall in love with each of the characters, but you then have to experience their painful breakdowns. Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance of her career, and I give her credit for even attempting such a stressful and radical role.  Jared Leto is cherubic, an incarnation of the fallen angel, and even Marlon Wayans must get respect for breaking away from WB comedy.  Jennifer Connelly's performance truly hit at a woman's vulnerability, with her big eyes full of tears. This carefully selected cast made REQUIEM a must see.  Like BOYS DON'T CRY, this is one of those movies that should be seen at least once, and i can guarantee it will linger.	5.0	speechless	2001-02-12	8	7	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"Requiem for a Dream should be seen alone for the performance of Ellen Burstyn who shows that an actress of grandmother vintage can still can slam dunk the latest kid on the block for six and also manage to outperform everyone else even though she is part of a hip and fashionable MTV-type choppy and deranged independent film production.Requiem for a Dream is not a nice movie. It is very dark, upsetting and mean but is also more than a tad bit exploitive of a number of elements that are done more than a bit over the top here. For this reason Aronofsky does cater for the shock market at times. Certainly if you think more about what you are seeing you will realize that the suspension of disbelief is remarkable but not even remotely close to the reality of life. For example - doctors do not rat out addicts to the cops, the neighborhood junkie knows exactly who is driving his car, you don't go around with a septic arm for days without knowing it, electric shock therapy is administered with an anesthetic and heroin dealers certainly don't turn up at the local supermarket in a truck to sell dope to hundreds of people queuing up on the streets. Aronofsky suspends our disbelief. He does is this brilliantly, but folks should reexamine the material a bit more closely before realizing that they have been duped into a wonderfully fantastic reality-based fantasy. Aronofsky even hints this fantasy world to you more than once and even in the closing segments. Requiem for a dream is a DREAM full of hope, desire, anxiety and failure played out to the tune of hyper-realism. It is wonderfully executed but this is fantasy mixed with a dash of reality that unfortunately too many people literally took to heart.This film deserves its place as a cult classic and certainly the director is something of a talent to look out for. The premise revolves around a son addicted to heroin and his mother who is addicted to slimming pills so that she can fit into her nicest dress to play in a popular television game show as a contestant. All the horrors of the American Dream are played out to full effect and everything goes from bad to worse to terrible to extremely severe.When all is said and done this is just fiction with a social comment to make but it is still hard to see what you can take away from it except maybe a sense that some people do end up in a bad way using drugs. However this should be no justification for the kind of brutality that the US government conducts in its own drug wars or the multi-millions of dollars that end up in terrorist hands from the black market drug economy (this is sort of explained during the jail sequence involving a sick guard). I took this movie as a very good social satire that is meant to shock in a ""this is how bad things can get for some people"" sort of way. It is a tad bit exploitative like I said, but heck some people go through this so why not film it. Just don't take everything you see here to heart and enjoy this art form for what it is - a great urban nightmare drama with some fine direction and acting to boot."	4.0	First Rate Suspension of Disbelief with Powerhouse Acting	2004-01-09	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AZ1VI3LRE5WUE	Pablo	"The first thing to say is that ""Requiem for a dream"" is not a movie for everyone. In fact, it is a movie that would only please a minority. People might find it gross, brutal, and too disturbing; that's ok, although I consider it a work of art. Because this is art, to make something new, original, using new ideas, new methods. And that's what Darren Aronofski has done, reaching the status of one of the most controversial and intesresting directors in the cinema industry. And his biggest achievement is that he's made a movie of emotions, something we miss in most of the cinema made today. We feel this movie, we feel its characters and their addictions, and that's exactly what I'm looking for in films. I don't want movies that makes me feel the same way before and after watching it. I don't want  superficial stuff that serves as a superficial entertainment for the millions of people who goes to the movies to see the same formula every time. How can that be fun? How can it be an entertainment? This movie is for the ""other audience"", for the ones who like to be involved with what their watching, with the ones who like watching something new and original, for the ones who are looking for breathtaking emotions.Other thing to say about ""Requiem for a dream"" is that it's not just an entertainment: it's almost an experiment. An analysis of the conflict between humans and reality, and how our desperation for getting out of the real life and reach our dreams can become the worst nightmare.Aronofski does an excellent, absolutely brilliant job, converting his film in a drug itself. Although it can be highly disturbing, we are  somehow addicted to what we are seeing; the director has created the perfect atmosphere for what he's telling; his use of the camera and technology increases the intensity of the images to unexpected levels, putting us right in the middle of the paranoia, a fictitious atmosphere in which there's no space, no time, and no way out.To end, the acting. All of them are just amazing; Marlon Wayans is faithful to his character, giving a convincing performance as Jared Leto's best friend. Jennifer Connelly just blew my mind. She puts all the talent she has (which is a lot) to create a difficult character.  Leto is excellent in a complicated performance that goes far beyond any other role he's ever played. And Ellen Burstyn does something in this movie I've probably never seen in any other actor or actress before. She puts body, heart and soul to make a performance that achieves the highest levels of perfection. Her bravery to hold this risky role as she did has to be recognized at every moment. There's no need to say she deserved the Oscar, although it doesn't bother me that much, the Academy Awards will always be a fake.To conclude, this movie is an astonishing, marvelous masterpiece that should be seen by the people who looks for ""something else"" in movies.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2YRFAQBNBMJP7	Patrick Leal	What Aronofsky has managed to put together in this visual assault on the psyche is nothing short of phenomenal--and disturbingly surreal. Tracking the progressively degenerative lives of four drug abusing individuals, Requiem for a Dream precedes the so-called requiem with an outright rape of the viewer's senses. In the path to destruction, we learn that the seemingly benign can often be the most damaging--Ellen Burstyn's triumphant performace as Harry Goldfarb's mother, Sarah--as in her vitriolic descent to hell via the innocent use of inocuous diet pills. Joining her along the path to center Earth is her son Harry, his best friend (played stoutly by a well-casted Marlon Wayans), and Harry's ex-Bourgeousie girlfriend.Aronofsky adeptly visualizes the repetition of habitual drug use through stylistic sequences that promptly package the actual act itself. What is left is the trivialization of harcore drug abuse wrapped tightly in skilled editing room techniques; Aronofsky drives the effect home by nifty camera work and slick visuals. Most symbolic is Harry and his girlfriend sharing a moment in bed as Aronofsky uses a simple split-window montage to demonstrate the isolation and distance that figuratively divides the two characters. The stylized scene is quickly subdued by the ensuing tension created by the crafty camera shot, and what is left is pure pathos.The final 15 minutes of RFAD make the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan seem so distant and irrelevant, as if the emotional and physical damage imposed by drugs far outstrips the destruction whatever bomb or mortar shell can inflict.	5.0	Celluloid Trauma	2001-12-04	5	4	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A20PEB9NLSKVCE	Paul Ferguson	In the unlikely event you actually read through the 200 preceding reviews to get to this one, I won't waste too much more of your time. Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' is an ambitious modern tragedy that ultimately falls victim to its director's misplaced sadism. In attempting to create a shockingly accurate portrait of the highs and lows of drug abuse, Aronofsky fails to allow his characters any sense of humanity -- they are, to the end, the sum of their addictions. While the film contains excellent performances all around, and cinematography that shows Aronofsky has grown considerably since 'Pi', neither can save it from descending nearly into self-parody by the end. In sharp contrast with 'Trainspotting', one of the few other contemporary films to portray drug addiction with any degree of honesty, 'Requiem' offers its characters no hope or quarter; it merely trudges them through a gauntlet of horrors from which they can never escape. Whether the four protagonists get what they deserve in the end is mostly irrelevant, as you won't care much about them by then. (Aronofsky's depiction of a mental hospital is particularly reprehensible -- believe it or not, they have improved considerably since 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', though Aronofsky doesn't seem to have noticed.)If you do bother to see 'Requiem for a Dream' -- and you may as well, I suppose, if only to see what all the fuss is about -- make sure you see the unrated version, not the patronizing &quot;edited version.&quot; (Why major rental chains and department stores want to offer a film like this is puzzling in itself, but they should at least have enough respect for their customers to give them what they came for.)	3.0	Tragically flawed (the movie, not the characters)	2001-06-16	3	1	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AD04C2V32YEUP	"Paul Hiebing ""engineer nerd"""	"It's often said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In the case of this film, ""good intentions"" is analogous with ""undying dreams."" I remember seeing this film in the theater and being emotionally battered and bruised for the following two days. ""Over a drug film?"" I thought? I examined it and myself further and found it not to be a film about drugs, but about simple addictions and the horror of seeing a dream come close to realization and start to fall apart.The story of junkies and dreamers who refuse to let go of either intoxicating aspect of their character is dangerously effective. Despite having vastly different lifestyles than most of the populace, Aronofsky deftly makes each character idetifyable: Mother, sister, brother, friend, self... The story then leads the characters through their dreams and their addictions (sometimes being the same thing) an leads them unflinchingly to their conclusions.Thankfully, the DVD is ripe with all sorts of delicious extras. Commentaries, behind the scenes, outtakes: it's all in there. And it's all informative and genuine, making it evident that this film was definitely a labor of love. Too bad it was so horribly robbed of award show attention.The effect is that ""Requiem"" is a powerful uppercut of a film that requires the viewer to have a sense of humanity to take something away from it."	5.0	The road to hell...	2002-08-13	8	7	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A33VUXHHFQM8SY	"""pfbuono"""	"Requiem for a Dream is a harrowing book, written in 1978, by the great Hubert Selby, Jr.  It follows the skewed ambitions and downfall of four people in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn from their various addictions, ranging from television to heroin.The story was brought to the screen in 2000, directed by Darren Aronofsky, one of a host of young, innovative (P.T. Anderson, Spike Jonze, etc.) American directors.Using an extension of the innovative camera and editing techniques first glimpsed in his first feature, the black and white ""Pi"", Aronofsky, also co-writer (with Selby, who cameos late in the film as a taunting corrections officer), captures like no one before him, the utter self-inflicted hell of addiction.Except for Tyrone's (Shawn Wayans) joints being smoked, the use of drugs are shown using a fast-edit technique backed by a short hip-hop barrage, leaving the viewer to wallow in the harrowing after-effects of these lives coming unravelled - with absolute zero glamorization.The filmed story is told very much as Selby wrote it, in a powerful way rare to ""book-to-film"" translations with absolute respect to the author's vision. It is a hard, blunt vision to view and it's impossible not to be affected by the gripping tale.The acting is phenominal.  Ellen Burstyn, as Sarah Goldfarb, will break your heart.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Conolley are mesmerizing as the drug-addicted Harry Goldfarb and Marion.  The big surprise for me was Shawn Wayans, who broke out of his clownish WB persona to deliver a wonderful performance.The film swallowed me whole, pure and simple.The film was rated NC-17 in theaters and I believe this was a mistake.  If there was ever a true anti-drug statement than should be viewed by older children, this film is it...whether it strives to be or not."	5.0	The Most Important Film of 2000...a Harrowing Must-see.	2003-01-10	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1DRM3JV6T5O6P	Phillip Oliver	This is the one of the most unique and harrowing films that I have seen in some time. Definately not for everyone, but I was riveted and the last 10 minutes is a roller coaster ride you won't soon forget. It covers the various drug addictions of 4 people (I won't go into too much plot detail because it is covered here in other reviews) and is filmed with a creative vision rarely seen in films today. Employing various digital techniques and outstanding sound, the film works as an assault on our senses with the story unraveling before us in a staccato rhythm of quick cut scenes. Ellen Burstyn, as a widow addicted to diet pills, gives the performance of a lifetime and this truly shows that the Oscars are just a popularity poll. How she could have lost to Julia Roberts' Erin Brocovich is a shame because Ms. Burstyn is in a league of her own here. An extraordinary performance and film, one that linger with you for quite some time.	5.0	Julia should not have won the Oscar!	2001-05-27	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A339FFCC9RNYLR	"Photopro ""Mike"""	"Requiem For A Dream is the most beautiful, eye-opening, and hurtful movie that I have and probably ever will experience.  I went through every possible emotion watching this film.  Hate, Sadness, Anger, Happiness, Jealousy, Lust..... It can go on and on and on.  But the main point of this film is to show what a life of drugs can do to us.  How it will grip us, and not let you, pulling you into situations you dont want to be in..... until it is to late.You feel so bad for these characters, you want to help them, and tell them to stop, but all you can do is sit, watch, and let the tears roll down your face.  It is that powerful.  Other than the story that is a major eye-opener, the movie is filmed wonderfully, from the director of ""Pi"".  I dont believe that I saw one single bad camera view in this whole movie.  And much of the film is showing as if the character is standing still, while the world around them is in fast forward.  The camera work of this flick is great, and any fan of great filmed movies will drool over this work, that is after they cry from the story.If this film does not open your eyes to the harms of drugs (especially heroin) to your body, mind, lovelife, and just plain life, you are crazy.  This is the biggest eye opening movie since ""KIDS"" and will leave you hurt days, even weeks after viewing.  But that is the objective.  We should feel this way, why?

Shock therapy, amputation, prison and degrading sex are all a fact of life.  Every single day in this country, somewhere, somebody is living through a real life version of this film.Having been working in the EMS field for the past decade, I have witnessed first hand the horrors of drug addiction.  When I first started working on an ambulance, it was complete culture shock.  I had relatives and friends of patients I would be picking up, tell me how wonderful a person so-and-so was, that they can't believe how fast that that persons life fell apart.  I couldn't believe it.  Normal people, who had normal jobs and normal families somehow let all that slip slowly away because they could not say no to drugs.  You've all heard this happen, but until you see it first hand, you don't get the full grasp of it.Darren Aronofsky perfectly gives us a sense as to the power that drugs have.  He opens the viewers eye's to how some parts of our society live on a daily basis.  I'm sorry ""wsidechris"" if Jared Leto's accent isn't on par to your taste's.  Go back to the Gumdrop Mountain section of NYC that you live in and let the rest of us enjoy this great film, which is a fantasticly acted, sobering look at drug addiction.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A37WODWBPJ5Y4Q	P. Liddle	We all know how great this movie is, but I didn't know how great it could be until I bought the Blu-ray version. While it is not demo worthy like The Tree of Life or Inception for example, it stays true to the directors intentions, which is a good thing. I did not expect and certainly did not want a super clean picture free of grain when it is not meant to be seen that way. The color palette is muted for the most part, it is a bit grainy, but details are sharp. One must consider the way the movie was intended to be seen. If you take that into consideration, the transfer is excellent. It is a huge improvement over the DVD version and certainly worthy of an upgrade.The music score is absolutely fantastic and haunting at times, making use of every available channel with its dts-HD MA 7.1 audio mix. It really brings this movie to life. It would be a shame to watch it without a proper surround setup capable of delivering HD audio (though that is true for almost any Blu-ray).It is not exactly a movie you pop into your disc player every month, but it does deserve multiple viewings if you can handle it. Aronofsky's films are always top notch, from PI and Requiem to more recent titles like The Wrestler and Black Swan, you know are in for something fresh; something made with the intention to make you think and feel rather than to merely entertain.Requiem's subject matter may turn people away which is certainly understandable. The film is gritty, raw, full of despair and downright depressing, but so is heroin and amphetamine addiction. After watching it you will, at the very least, have a greater understanding of what it is like to be addicted. And hopefully, you will realize just how broken and cruel the U.S. justice system is; focusing on imprisonment rather than rehabilitation. Granted, it is a bit extreme, but it gets it's message across in a very effective way. There will never be a movie quite like Requiem for a Dream.	5.0	Excellent Step Up from DVD	2012-02-03	2	1	1

The Mother becomes obsessed with some sort of demented infomercial/gameshow and losing weight so she can be on the show, and soon becomes addicted to speed.Her son and his friends split a large amount of heroin between the 3 of them and they think all their troubles are over. They quickly find the money's gone along with the drugs, but not the craving for more. Soon they're going to great lenghts to try to score...I won't spoil the ending for you, but this movie is worth the watch. Visually it's really awesome. The soundtrack is also very good.

Requiem for a Dream is just like one of those fast paced trailers, all the way through the film!Of course this is a very depressing, upsetting film about addiction, be it to heroin, diet pills, or television. If you like your films upbeat, stay clear from this film. You'll hate it and curse all those who told you it was great. But if you are a film lover looking for a movie that is masterful and powerful in whatever message it gives, no matter what negative emotions it can create, this one is for you. It takes you right along for the ride as the film's central characters begin to have hope for the good life, then forces you to hold on as their lives take the wrong turn and hopelessly spin out of control into utter despair.The beautiful stylistic choices in this film are endless. From the quick editing to simulate the rush of getting high or the characters insanity, to the heart-pumping music adding to the editing, to the symbolic use of fades, cuts and dissolves to pack in layer upon layer of meaning, this film is a complete masterpiece. It was one of those rare films that gave me the chills of amazement all the way through, the thought &quot;My God, this is an awesome film&quot; running through my mind non-stop. I found it so amazing; I could watch it over and over despite its despair-filling mood. Its genius is enough to distract my emotions away from the doom. There's so much to find in Requiem for a Dream!To any film buff, this one demands multiple viewings to appreciate all the layers of ingenuity. Look past the so-called &quot;gimmicky&quot; editing... it has a reason it's fast paced and stylized, and it's not so it &quot;looks cool&quot; to the MTV crowd. This gets my highest recommendation.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A28TE19TXYHVXB	Queen V	"I was flipping through the channels the other night, when I happened upon this movie. Within a second, I was hooked until the bitter end, just like the group of addicts this film is focused on. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Just like a drug, it was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. I CANNOT believe I haven't seen this movie until now. This is one of the few movies that left me stunned, deeply affected, and just plain disturbed afterwards (the only other movie to do that was ""Bully""). Shock-value aside, this movie was simply great, multidimensional filmmaking - visually, musically, and acting-wise. It's one of the best films I've ever seen.In classical music, a requiem is a Mass for the dead. In the movie, we watch aspirations and relationships wither away when the characters are consumed by addiction. Overweight TV-addict Sara Goldfarb (portrayed amazingly by Ellen Burstyn) turns to speed for weight-loss when she believes she is chosen as a TV-show contestant. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict, along with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Marion dream of opening a store, and Tyrone wants to prove to the memory of his mother that he can be successful, so they get involved in drug dealing for some fast cash. Unfortunately, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the rest of a movie is a frightening trip down that path. When it all crashes in the end, all four characters are left rotting in their own personal hell, alone and tormented by their inner demons.Ellen Burstyn should've won the Academy Award over Julia Roberts. The deterioration Sara goes through is intense. By the last part of the movie, she's a loony speed junkie, barely recognizable from the beginning of the movie. Physically and emotionally, her change is a total 180. Jared Leto is wonderful as well. His eyes alone express huge amounts of emotion. You can really feel the love he has for his girlfriend, and the concern he has for his mother. Marlon Wayans surprised me by not hamming it up in his usual comedic way. I almost wasn't sure if that was him at first, since he usually doesn't tackle such dramatic roles. He handled himself splendidly... it's nice to see he's got serious acting chops. He came off as very natural. Jennifer Connelly was amazing. As her character starts to self-degrade, you can totally feel what she's going through, especially when she hits rock bottom.Let's talk about the directing now. Darren Aronofsky, the director, is a genius. I have never seen a film utilize both visual and audio techniques to narrate a story as well as this movie did. Visually, the movie plays like a David Fincher flick on acid. Rapid cuts and edits, fisheye lenses, split screens, slow-mo and high-speed shots, swirling cameras... a whole array of MTV-like editing techniques are used. But, it never seems gratuitous, as if it were done just for the sake of looking cool and artsy. These techniques help enhance the storyline, making you feel like you're really in the characters' shoes. I felt like I was on drugs just watching this movie, experiencing both the highs and the lows (especially in the truly frightening final sequence). Moments of willpower in the film are shot very effectively as well; if you've ever been on a diet, you'll totally relate to the clock-watching, the beckoning fridge, and the quickly disappearing food. One technique I really loved was whenever a character used their addiction (whether it be smack, TV, coffee, coke, etc.), the camera would zoom-in up close and show syringes shooting, pupils dilating, lighters sparking, spoons bubbling, pill bottles popping open... all in rapid succession with sound effects going ""pop, bubble, crackle, slurp, snap, suck!"" This technique is repeated over and over, to give you a sense of the habitual nature of addiction. I can't even smoke a joint anymore without close-up images of lips inhaling and smoke swirling flashing through my brain.The beautiful musical score plays an integral role in the storytelling as well, aside from its obvious role as a requiem. Not since ""Pink Floyd's The Wall"" have I seen the music exactly match what you're witnessing visually, until now. The strings express such haunting sadness in the main overture, and frantic, Psycho-like melodies play as terrorizing images flash onscreen. The score is played by a string quartet, which can represent the four main characters. It is also divided up into three, very symbolic movements, just like the movie is: Summer, Fall, and Winter.I highly recommend you see this movie, especially if you like dark films like me. I just advise you watch it in a sober state, unless you want to get freaked out of your mind really badly. This movie will affect you by itself. I'm scared of even just thinking about heroin right now."	5.0	Requiem for a Dream: The Ultimate Anti-Drug.	2003-06-03	20	19	1

This is the worst movie I have ever seen and ever hope to see.  The fact that it could be rated so highly, here and on IMDB, indicates the abysmal emotional immaturity of film fans.&lt;spoiler alert>1. No likable characters - which isn't to say the characters just sit there, no.  They scream off the screen with absolute annoyance.  I hated the characters 15 minutes into the film and wondered how they could possible be turned into something worth watching.  They weren't.  Androgynous boy-man has the voice of a whining buzz saw cutting through a series of jagged metal chalk boards.  Jennifer Connelly manages to disguise her attractiveness under a layer of creepout that was hard, physically hard, to keep eyeballs focused on.  And the Wayans brother is just annoying token-black-man, thrown in to give the Semitic/Anglo couple some ""street cred"".Okay, not all characters in a movie need to be appealing.  But the kicker is, when you get to the end of the movie and you realize you are supposed to feel sorry for them...somehow.  Despite the fact that they never displayed an ounce of decency or humanity.  It's beyond comprehension how I could feel anything other than disgust for them all.So maybe the mother character is sposta appeal?  As she descends into a diet pill frenzy that borders on the comic, and increasingly chews the scenery like a dog with an old bone, you can only hope the movie will end soon so you can begin the process of extracting her visage from your catalog of humanoid faces.2. Displays all the writing and plotting skills of a privileged, protected college student trying to imagine what life on the edge is like.  It's truly laughable.  Truly cliched and trite and laughable.  Token-black ends up arrested by token-Southern-law-officer and sentenced to forced labor.  Semitic junky loses his arm - oh yes, in the South doctors will call the police before treating a case of gangrene - we're just that inhuman.  Creepy chick starts having sex for money and drugs, but we're sposta feel sorry for her cuz she doesn't enjoy it.  Mother goes into an irrecoverable spastic state from diet pills (DIET PILLS!) and has her brain fried with electroshock.  Yeah...that's a believable scenario.  Zathura is more believable.  Childish junk, this ""plot"".3.  Purposeless student film devices.  The quick cutting, the meaningless split screens, the accelerated/decelerated time, the steady cams strapped to bodies - it all screams, ""I am so creative, world look at my genius and despair.""  What's really lovable is the little montage that accompanies every heroin kick - gee, that never gets old.4. Stereotypes - the lovable black heroin dealer, the horrible black sex fiend, the n-word using Southern law officers, the doting Jewish mother and her troop of aimless Jewish mother friends, the creepy bald successful guy.  Every character in this movie is a hack job pulled from the yellowed pages of some pulp novel found on a bus stop rack.5. Laughable drug use - For junkies, these people have awfully fussy biological clocks.  They can go without for any length of time it takes to flesh out some worthless scene.  But then suddenly, they're willing to become sex slaves for a slight taste.  Whatever gets the director to the emotional non-moment he thinks will grab the ghoulies of pretentious film critics.  And then the mother on diet pills?  And she's so stupid she doesn't realize that taking several at a time is inadvisable?6. Ridiculous plot devices - did I cover the hysterical creepy mental hospital where they go straight to the brain frying levels of ECT?  Why didn't the director just do the lobotomy routine from Cuckoo's Nest?  The drug shortage with a special Xmas delivery that means nobody in NYC can get heroin...yes, that's believable.  The man who can't take care of an infection on his arm until...it needs antibiotics?  No, that might be believable.  No, it must be cut off.  Ridiculous!  And the Wayans character...he's operating with the Jewish guy, but he's also in the black mob and they are independent and have money but then don't and...was anybody allowed to review this?  Did nobody giving this drut 5 stars think this was a problem?  The mother with her TV addiction, who just happens to watch the same show ad nauseum?  Believable?  Or just meant to inflict despair?  I claim the latter.Dear dawg, I could go on and on about how insanely bad this movie is, and how I hope the director gets put on the next one-way rocket trip to the Andromeda Galaxy...but what's really disturbing is the number of people who could swallow this razor blade and call it candy."	1.0	"Forced ""Drama"" for Adolescent Minds"	2008-07-26	21	4	17

While the picture certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know already, it is an unflinching look at the possible consequences of drug addiction.  Amazingly enough, while you certainly don't condone even the reasons (excuses?) of each circumstance, you cannot help but feel empathy for the four lives depicted.The standout performance, hands down, is Ellen Burstyn who was cheated out of an Oscar.  Her performance is quite simply spellbinding.  Even more so are the supporting players, most notably, Marlon Wayans.  Because he has previously been cast in comedic roles, it is quite surprising how well he handled such a dramatically demanding role.  He should invest in more dramatic parts as he proved to match his stellar cast members.This is one of those movies where you immediately need to take a walk and ""shake it off"" or merely have a nice long cigarette.  This is an intense movie experience following the results of drug addiciton on 4 hapless souls.  Even more harrowing is that the movie offers not one shred of hope.  In that instance alone, it should be applauded because it implies there is no hope as long as you do not posess enough responsibility to recognize dangerous behavior and do something about it.I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	5.0	Harrowing to say the Least - Remarkable Film!!!!!!!	2003-12-12	3	2	1

Nowadays, a person receiving ECT will be put out, or put to sleep, and only there toes convulse.

The movie is divided into the seasons of summer, fall and winter. And as the seasons of nature get darker and colder through the seasons, a requiem for a dream does as well. The film is Darren's Aronofsky's portrayal of the consequences of abusing substances for greed, profit, or self improvement. Each character in the film begin with loads of ambition and through substances these ambitions turn dark and slim to hopelessness. Although the film has high amounts of drug content and some explicit sex, they prove to be essential to the movie's message and storyline.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AWTURFQJ2I2JI	"""ramirezify"""	From the moment you pop this DVD into your player, you will be rushed with a myriad images and sounds, all of them significant and all of them stunning.  The menus are cleverly structured around the &quot;Tappy Tibbons&quot; theme (you'll understand after you watch the movie) and the extras are actually quite intriguing.  One thing to stay away from in the deleted scenes: Marlon Wayans trying to ruin his only worthy work with an impression of Jar Jar Binks.Now, on to the film itself.  Director Darren Aronofsky has created a masterpiece with only his second effort.  The film is beautiful and disturbing, and its impact is actually forced upon you.  That may sound like a bad thing, but it's actually not.  The main point of this film deserves to be hammered down your throat, and every young person should watch it probably before junior high but definitely before high school.  NOTE TO PARENTS: use discretion when exposing your children to the themes in this movie.  Deviant sexual behavior and graphic drug abuse and a smattering of shocking violence all show up to enforce the point of the narrative.  Every young man or woman is different, so be sure to carefully evaluate your child's maturity level before deciding when to show them this movie.  It is a film where nothing is gratuitous, and no matter how many times you watch it it will be hard to take.  The film scares you and shocks you in equal measure, and rightly so.  The theme here is addiction, specifically relating to drugs throughout, but there is also an underlying message that addiction to hope (most prominently displayed in Sara Goldfarb's case) is probably the most dangerous addiction of all.This is a masterful work not only in terms of its unparalleled visual imagery, but also in its backdrops and, most surprisingly and largely unnoticeably, in its sound work.  Listen to Sara Goldfarb chew on a piece of chocolate.  Listen to Marion's psychiatrist chomp on his food.  Listen for the tons of ambient sounds that filter through flawlessly on the soundtrack.  Listen for little, seemingly insignificant sounds (like Sara's refrigerator starting up after she talks with her son) that actually support the narrative.Every performance in this movie hits the mark so well that at times the audience will be stunned into silence.  Ellen Burstyn plays it raw and realistic, and for Julia Roberts's slightly above average &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; performance to beat her out at the Oscars is just further proof of how the Academy is into sympathy votes.  Each of the younger cast members pulls off a flawless turn as well, capturing the roller coaster ride of feelings that their characters experience and embodying the personalities of each without fail.  Most surprising turn ever goes to Marlon Wayans, with a serious, heartfelt role as an inner city young black male who has underlying psychological (that's right, psychological applies to Marlon Wayans's character) reasons for wanting to succeed in the drug dealing biz and, in effect, to &quot;make it.&quot;The fact that each of the actors carries with them a sort of natural beauty further compounds the shock and impact of the audience having to see them deteriorate.  Ellen Burstyn is a beautiful woman even in her elder years, but the way she looks at the end of the film may blind you to that fact.  Jared Leto is a handsome young fellow who seems to be able to look good with any hairstyle (reference this movie and ones like &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Urban Legends&quot; to see what I'm talking about).  By the end of this film, however, he doesn't look that good at all (sorry, ladies).  With Marlon Wayans, the visual change may be hard to detect, but you'll pick up on it if you pay enough attention.  He conveys the feeling of misery quite well, I might add.  He appears resplendent and healthy in the first part of the film, but it does change.  And then there's Jennifer Connelly, one of the most underrated and stunningly beautiful actresses to ever grace a screen.  Her beauty will captivate you from the get-go, but her own character's visual transformation rivals that of Burstyn's character in its extremity.  You will hardly be albe to believe your eyes by the end of the film with respect to how these naturally beautful actors change their appearances.Watch this movie and then visit the website for some irritating fun, and then read the book for good measure.  This story is not to be missed, especially by anyone who has had experience with or exposure to drugs of any kind.Wanna know how to make a sensory treat out of a movie?  This one's a very good example, a true tribute to Aronofsky's style (watch for his direction of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; to show itself sometime in the future; our faith in Batman films may be restored yet) and one that outdoes his previous feature (&quot;Pi,&quot; also very good) a hundred times over.  This movie is so good that only &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; can beat it out for the title of best movie of all time.  Repeat: DO NOT MISS IT.  It stands so far above all other movies you've ever seen.	5.0	Sensory masterpiece	2001-10-04	2	2	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2HJB9J5O5CLPB	R. A Rubin	MTV has struck again.  The camera is choppy, hand held, cut from character to character to scene to scene, and accelerate through the drug deals.  It's hard to care about these characters because their problems are thrown against the wall as if Jackson Pollack were splashing paint.  Sure, they all get addicted to what?  Looks like coke, but has effect of crystal meth, but could be heroin, except they get frantic like coke or meth.  I surmise the director doesn't care about the detail, just the effect.  Diet pills are notorious for the consequence of the amphetamine.  An old Jewish lady getting crazy on speed, that takes some chutzpah all right.The sex scene with Jennifer Connelly, her performance with a device and another prostitute, there's something not true about her in that scene. I'm sure there's a lot of drug addict girls that will do anything for a high, but darn it, none of the junkies in this film are emaciated enough.Ellen Burstyn  is an exception in her role I think.  She certainly acted crazy enough.  If my refrigerator asked me to feed it, I'd be in Bedlam too.  She deserved her Academy Award nomination, but being a cynic, I wonder if all the actors that got awards for acting crazy, I wonder if it is so hard to act crazy?	2.0	Tough To Care About These Folks	2005-07-10	8	1	7

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ID7JGOK1TSZW	"""razwee"""	First of all, my admiration and respect go out to Artisan Entertainment for their decision to release this film unrated, following the MPAA's deplorable and hypocrtical decision to award it an NC-17 rating.In the recently released Not Another Teen Movie, a girl defecates loudly and disgustingly in a toilet, only to have it fall through the floor and cover the students below in an oh so palatable melange of bodily discharges.  Explain to me the logic behind awarding a movie like that an R-rating and giving a masterpiece such as Requiem an NC-17 for a few seconds of explicit but very relevant sexual acts which are not at all excessive.  But anyway, enough bashing of the closed minded conservative lackeys who destroy art...back to the movie.I must admit, I'm a sucker for Aronofsky's style.  It is his relentless, innovative, and unsparing style that makes this movie a masterpiece not just narratively, but also stylistically.  Anyone who enjoys watching cutting edge uses of conventional directorial techniques (e.g.--split screens, fast cuts, disorienting camera angles) will revel in the novelty of Aronofsky's bag-o'-tricks.The frenetic fifteen minute climax is a testament to Aronofsky's keen grasp of effective narrative.  Bravo Darren!!  Keep up the good work!I cannot mention this movie without pointing out the remarkable performance of Ellen Burstyn.  Showing that acting is not all glamour, she spent four hours a day applying prosthetics and makeup to give the illusion of an overweight, lonely mother in the waning years of her life.  I'll be lucky if I can turn in a performance as good as this at 67-years-old!  Burstyn fills her character with an incredibly subtle blend of empty hopefulness, woeful naivete, and when appropriate, uncontrollable psychosis.  Strong, solid performances also given by Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans.A word of warning:  Despite the heinous acts the four central characters commit, you WILL grow to love them and root for them...and your spirits WILL be crushed when they crash and burn, and an unflattering realism will sink upon you like a ton of bricks.  The most heartbreaking part of their downfall is not even the manner in which happens, but that it EASILY could have been avoided.The soundtrack adds icing to the cake.  I loved the Pi soundtrack (another Aronofsky film), but was disappointed when only three songs were original Clint Mansell tracks.  The soundtrack for Requiem is ALL Mansell, and it is a force to be reckoned with!  When I heard that the Kronos String Quartet (one of my favorite performing groups) was a dominant feature, I was ambivalently excited and confused.  How would a composer who does mostly electronica manage to effectively blend a string quartet with his style?  Needless to say...somehow it worked. The result is a haunting, jarring, surreal score which adds to Aronofsky's idiosyncratic style and accentuates the pervasively foreboding nature of the narrative.  Without the grotesque dissonances of the score, the disturbing nature of the film would have been halved.I must concede that this movie is not for everyone.  But for me personally, the unusual combination of a dynamite soundtrack, spectacular acting, innovative and delectable direction, and altogether unsparring storytelling make this movie a 4-star opus.It is easily one of my all-time favorites.	5.0	Bravo on all counts!!	2002-09-23	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AE362Y068XZ6J	R. Barry Lyndon	This is a great transfer to Blu-ray, despite the disc's discount price, and is likely the best this film will ever look.  It's a marked improvement over the DVD.The picture is great.  The disc's bitrate averages around 35-36 Mbps.  The blacks and shadow detail are deep.  The color is accurate, bringing out the depressing greens of fluorescent lighting and blues of the night lighting, along with the warm natural outdoor shots of Coney Island.  Grain is very present but there is no visible digital noise reduction (DNR) applied.  There is maybe just a hint of edge-enhancement, but it's not offensive and not visible in normal scenes.  The film looks soft and hazy at times, but only due to the cinematographer's use of soft-focus filters.  When the image is meant to be crisp, it is.  You can see the detail in Jennifer Connelly's skin and Marlon Wayans' stubble.The lossless audio is great in DTS-HD 7.1, really highlighting Clint Mansell's score and the sounds of the Kronos Quartet.  The hallucinations of Ellen Burstyn's character sound creepy and scary.The extras are the same as on the DVD.  They include a commentary by the director, Darren Aronofsky, a very detailed commentary by the cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, deleted scenes, a making-of, an interview by Ellen Burstyn of the author of the original book, Hubert Selby Jr., and the usual trailers and TV spots, including the uncut TV infomercial that plays a large role in Ellen Burstyn's character's motivation.A great presentation of this indie film!	5.0	A flawless transfer to Blu-ray, great picture and audio quality	2009-12-19	4	3	1

It is amazing and makes the movie that much more impactful. This film just goes to show the power music has over a film. That aside the film itself is a completely sensorial experience. Watching the progression and destruction of these characters you feel as if you yourself are the addict and as the brilliance in shot composition deteriorates so does the characters and audience members along the way. You feel and see what the feel and see and you feel the hunger and desperation for their chosen vice. A beautifully heartbreaking portrayal of addiction and destruction that left me completely engrossed, repelled, and sucked dry of all emotion by the end of the rollercoaster of a film.	5.0	Sensorial Overload	2011-07-08	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ALXAU5JNVKJ53	Reluctant Critic	Requiem for a Dream is a hard film to watch, there is no denying it. I first saw it at a matinee show on a bright sunny day in St. Louis. As I emerged from the Tivoli theatre into the daylight, it seemed impossible that the beauty of the day around me could possibly coexist in the same world as the bleak degradation that the characters in this movie descend into. Since I bought the DVD, I have been avoiding it for weeks, unsure if it was worth facing that descent.It was. Despite being a emotion bonecrusher, the quality of this film is undeniable. Darren Aronofsky has kept his touch for depicting the extremity of human emotion that he demonstrated in Pi. In Requiem, however he makes the characters so rich and engaging that the viewer is drawn along on their voyage of self destruction. This is a big improvement. One of the biggest flaws in Pi was that we have no reason to identify with the obsessive main character. In Requiem, each of the main characters is sympathetic and three-dimensional. It's this that makes the film so traumatizing.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely widow living alone in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She spends her days watching television, particularly the infomercial snake oil of Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald), a guru who sells a three step program to rebuild your life. One day she receives a phone call telling her that she has been chosen to appear on television. Filled with excitement, she tries to make herself over for her appearance on TV, which rapidly becomes her one reason for living. When she finds she can no longer fit into her best red dress, she starts dieting like crazy, with little success. When an unethical doctor prescribes her heavy stimulants, however, the weight starts coming off, although the side effects put Sara on the edge of madness. Watching this sweet and lonely old lady fall into drug addiction and obsession is very hard. As madness starts to creep in, Sara spends her days hallucinating in front of the television and huddling in mortal fear of the refrigerator.Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto) is Sara's son, a heroin addict who repeatedly steals his mother's television to finance his habit. He and his partner Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) are scrambling to climb the ladder of the drug underworld from addict to affluent dealer. While at first glance they look like a couple of scum bags, as we get to know them, they become more sympathetic. Harry is a considerate guy who wants the best for his mother and regrets the pain he causes her. Tyrone's thoughts continuously drift back to his own mother in idyllic flashbacks of his youth.Marion Silver (Jennifer Connely) is a young girl from a rich family who wants to design clothing for a living. She and Harry are in love, and together they scheme to turn Harry's drug profits into a chance for her to open a store to sell her own designs. Marion is also entangled in an unwholesome relationship with her sleazy former therapist. Despite this and her cocaine habit, the depths of which she seems unaware of, she seems like a decent person. The scenes of her and Harry together are sweet and endearing. They make us wish the best for this young couple. The fact that they share these moments in a fog of drug-induced euphoria seems almost irrelevant, thanks to Aronofsky's skilled staging, and fine performances by the Connely and Leto.As the film progresses, the hopes and dreams of the four characters are slowly strangled by their dependence on drugs. As despair encroaches on their future plans, they scramble to hold it all together. By the final sequence, the characters' degradation accelerates out of control like a runaway train. Aided immensely by the feverish compositions of the Kronos Quartet, this is one of the most disturbing sequences I've ever seen on film.Technically, this film is very well executed. Sara's nightmarish hallucinations leave the viewer shaken. The time lapse sequences convey a very believable sense of how out of control a speed addict must feel. Aronofsky uses strange perspectives to great effect. In particular, he seemingly hangs a camera from the character's neck at times, to catch every nuance of expression at their moment of greatest shame.I have to recommend this movie, but I warn you, it will not make you feel good. It will probably make you feel like humans are weak and foul things. Choose well when to watch, or risk ruining a light-hearted evening...	5.0	Requiem for a Dream	2002-06-12	3	2	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2TBWLOHTZNK54	Reviewer	"I'll say going in my expectations were at least somewhat high for this movie, which never helps. People have been name dropping it for years. All I knew was it was ""depressing"" and about ""drugs"" which is enough to figure out a lot right there.It kicks off somewhere between two worlds... the intense and crude, drop out and score reality life of a young druggie son and his friend and girlfriend, and the the comic, barely believable life of his mother who's in lala land about television game shows. I really wished the two halves made more sense together, but I think they should have left the comedy side out. Some might say the mother's misadventures are a metaphor for the more subtle side of life, we need a fix from TV or food, or a fantasy, just like druggies need it from drugs, but overall this part of the film feels like it can't cover its bases with sincerity... it was a bridge too far to go and seriously hurt the ending for me.The ending itself will be something you'll just go along with, or laugh at. That's up to you. Certainly an interesting film but it does not manage to represent a complex view of its subjects by the time it's over, to me anyway."	3.0	Complex characters, plot problems	2007-03-20	6	1	5
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"The devastating, downward spiral of four individuals addicted to drugs is examined in lurid detail in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" directed by Darren Aronofsky, who paints a vivid picture of the physical and psychological damage that can be incurred by unrestrained chemical abuse.  And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of ""recreation,"" and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a widow who lives alone, and only wishes that her son, Harry, would come around to see her once in awhile, besides when he needs her beloved TV, which is her only real companion in life.  Sara doesn't realize it, but there's troubled times ahead for her, too, which begin with a telephone call informing her she's been chosen to appear on a television show, which to her is like being given the Holy Grail.  Immediately, she begins to prepare for the moment, but she is bothered by her weight-- her favorite dress doesn't fit anymore.  She's just too fat (she feels) to go on TV.  The solution she discovers, however, is easy.  Prescription diet pills, provided by a doctor recommended to her by one of her friends in her apartment building.  Diet pills, nothing more.  It seems so harmless.Director Aronofsky doesn't pull any punches with this film, and shows-- often in graphic detail-- just what drugs can do to a person.  Some of the images he presents are hard to take, and are not easily forgotten; like the effects of a needle on an arm when injected repeatedly into the same spot over a prolonged period of time, or the delusions caused by ingesting vast amounts of ""speed.""  But the visuals he offers are not the only powerful images; the psychological implications are quite potent as well.  Each character at one time or another seems to comprehend, during one of their few-and-far-between lucid moments, what's happening to them.  But they either do not want to address their situation, or they can't.  Either way, it's harrowing to watch, let alone contemplate.Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work here, and rightfully so; her performance as Sara, a woman who gets taken unawares and must do battle with an unexpected demon, is astounding.  It's a challenging, decidedly unglamorous role, and Burstyn certainly gave it everything she had, and it paid off.  Sara is someone with whom you can sympathize on a number of levels, while at the same time, the way she comes into her situation is so disconcerting it makes you want to keep her at arms length, because it's something you don't really want to have to think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It's an emotionally taxing part-- for Burstyn, of course-- but for the audience, as well.Jared Leto gives an extremely convincing, believable performance, also, but his character tends to evoke mixed feelings.  On one hand, you feel terrible for him, but on the other, you realize that-- unlike Sara-- Harry came to where he is because of his own unsound judgment and choices, which casts a rather subjective pall over his circumstances, and therefore the way you relate to him.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's a depressing situation (to say the least) for everyone involved.The same can be said of Connelly's character, Marion, who seems to go deeper into her situation than the others with her eyes wide open, and it's disturbing to see someone so young, vital and seemingly intelligent allowing this to happen to herself.  Connelly, who admirably of late has forsaken mainstream cinema for roles of more substance in independent films (like ""Pollock"" and ""Waking the Dead""), turns in a memorable performance here, capturing that dark side of human nature and expressing it so well in terms of her character and the path she chooses to take.  And of all of the characters in the film, it is through Marion that you really get a sense of the degradation and loss of self-esteem that comes with the territory to which these people have staked a claim.  And it's just almost too horrendous to consider.The supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald (Tappy Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Marcia Jean Kurtz (Rae) and Peter Maloney (Dr. Pill).  A powerful anti-drug film, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a stark and realistic look at a problem that affects everyone either directly or indirectly, and it's so effective because there's no attempt to candy-coat the issue.  Aronofsky tells it-- and shows it-- like it is, and like ""Trainspotting"" and ""Traffic,"" it gives you a real grasp of just how far into our lives the tentacles of this evil reaches, and how vulnerable we all really are to it.  This film may be a sobering trip, but it's definitely one worth taking."	4.0	Sobering Film	2001-07-08	9	8	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2YX9VMOSROGOZ	RM	"Ok, Requiem for a Dream. When I bought it, I thought it would be an extraordinary film, judging by so many five stars. It was good, thought-provoking but not a masterpiece. The story revolves around 3 friends who are trying to live the ""good"" life by injecting and smoking as many drugs as they can. Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, the depressed mother of Harry (Jared Leto) who's husband has died. Her luck suddenly seems to change when she gets a call from a tv show called ""Juice"" inviting her onto the show.So, in order to lose weight and look her best, she decides to start taking diet pills. Of course, she becomes addicted and starts to hallucinate. While all this is happening Harry, his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) come up with a way of earning some quick and hard cash by selling drugs on the street. They begin to realise, however, that they aren't the only ones selling and start to receive alot of competition and errr....more violent wake-up calls.The friendship goes to pieces, with Harry having to have his arm chopped off because gangrene or something similar has turned it septic, Tyrone is vomiting and hallucinating in prison and Jennifer starts going mad because there are no drugs around for her. Therefore, she needs to make money by having sex and performing for an audience by participating in a lesbian sex scene to feed her addiction. Sara and Harry's relationship also goes down the drain, with her having to have ECT treatment to get cured and turning 20 years older in the process.The acting is very good, no problems there, and the style of quick cuts from scene to scene is innovative. I especially found the scenes where Sara's fridge is attacking her and Jennifer having sex with another girl at a party particularly effective in demonstrating how drugs can ruin people's lives in the long-run. Good extras on the DVD with deleted scenes, commentaries, interviews, tv spots, trailer, etc. A powerful, ambitious anti-drug film which was just that little bit lacking for me. I found Trainspotting to be a more complete film overall."	4.0	Good but thought it would be better	2005-04-08	4	2	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"A film that tries to show us the evils of substance abuse by putting us into the heads of the abusers as much as possible.  The film is brilliantly edited so as to become more and more disjointed as the main characters fall deeper into despair.  This is an ""artsy"" movie that for the most part uses all the ""cool"" camera tricks, jump cuts, split screens, etc. for positive effect and not just to show off.We follow Jared Leto and his friend Marlon Wayans, along with Leto's girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, as they decend deeper into their addiction.  At one point, they even come into a lot of money and opportunity, but the drugs destroy it all.  The other main story follows Leto's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, a lonely older woman who believes she's going to be on a popular TV show, and decides she must loose weight.  She starts on diet pills and begins popping them like candy.The three younger characters chart a more predictable course.  Connelly and Leto have a lovely romance slowly come unraveled.  Wayans sees his dreams slipping through his fingers.  We've seen much of this before, but never this graphically. We aren't held at a distance by the director but rather we are pulled in to see things through their eyes.  All three actors are quite good, and Connelly, in particular is a revelation.  She'd done fine work before (and won an Oscar, of course, for her next film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  But it's her work in this film that should have drawn Oscar's attention.  Her final degredation is just about as low as we have seen a character sink in many a year.  Leto is always a good performer, and his final outcome is also a corker.  Wayans meets justice in a more predictable way, and his scenes in prison are almost farcical and are the only times the director totally loses control over the tone of his film.  Wayans is absolutely fine...the script and filmmaking strand him..and that's why the film only gets 4 stars.  It really deserves 4.5.The reason, I think, that Connelly didn't get her Oscar nod for this film is that Ellen Burstyn absolutely runs away with the movie.  To say that her performance is brave only begins to state the facts.  Her character, basically, is driven mad by her addictions.  And we see it from her point of view.  We see how the delusions she suffers COULD drive you nuts.  We pity this poor, lonely woman, whose son is constantly stealing from her to buy drugs.  She is deluded.  Burstyn becomes physically unraveled as well.  I just don't know how she was able to do it.  In years past, we always rave about actor's undergoing physical transformations for their parts (DeNiro in RAGING BULL, Hanks in CASTAWAY, Zellweger in BRIDGET JONES!!) but the transformation Burstyn allows herself to go through is shocking and emotionally draining.This movie is graphic and brutal and not for young kids.  But even though it is R-rated, this could be a ""scared straight"" film for teens.  And adults absolutely should see it.  I look forward to director Aronsky's next effort!!!"	4.0	A tough film, but well worth the effort	2003-04-24	4	3	1

Like many of you I am a big fan of David Aranofsky's &quot;Pi&quot; so I should have known better. I liked this film very much but it is one of the hardest films you will ever want to watch.  The characters in this film are not deeply likeable or even people you would want to have over for dinner with the exception of Jennifer Connelly who has never seemed so breathtakingly radiant as she is in the first half of the film.  But they are real people and whatever their flaws, it is really hard to watch them take this dark dark journey. Due to Aranofsky's stylized cinematography, you get in the heads of these people and you take the journey with them. Its a real unpleasant trip but when it is over you realize this is a movie that actually took you someplace and gave you an experience that you have never had from watching a movie like Traffic or Trainspotting.  When you are done you have been somewhere and its very personal. It will stick with you.	4.0	Hold on to your handbag, you ain't prepared for this.	2001-06-23	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	Darren Aronofsky follows his stunning debut film ' with this brilliant, electrified look at addiction.  What will be long remembered, is the stupendous, raw, brilliant, performance of Ellen Burstyn as a lonely, plump, widowed mother hooked on diet pills and TV.  Jared Leto is her son and Jennifer Connelly is his beautiful girlfriend.  Marlon Wayans is Jared's best friend.Based on the acclaimed novel by Hubert Selby, this deeply disturbing film adaptation burns itself into your heart and mind as these four individuals become possessed by something beyond themselves where their dreams become nightmares of dark desire.The disc is a very crisp transfer with a multitude of special features that include two commentary tracks, one by director Aronofsky and another by cinematographer Matthew Libatique.  In addition, Ellen Burstyn interviews author Selby, there's a making-of documentary, deleted scenes with commentary, anatomy of a scene, production notes and more. Highly recommended.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AINY9YQ0YSM2Z	robulus	"Requiem for a Dream is an energetic and engaging melodramatic tradgedy with addiction as its theme, stylistically much like a ninety minute version of the film clip to Prodigy's ""Fire Starter"". A gradually accelerating descent into nightmare, both in narrative and imagery, Aronofsky creates a dark tale for our time with skillful and original use of camera and sound. It has resonances with 80's indie movie ""Liquid Sky"" (both subject and definitely soundtrack) and some of the imagery recalls Cronenberg's eXistenz. On this level it works and is a grimly entertaining and challenging film for those of us who like this sort of thing.But a cautionary tale? Yes, like the 1950's propaganda film ""Reefer Madness"" is a cautionary tale. Addiction is an ugly thing and its ugliness is well documented, but Requiem for a dream goes well beyond anything resembling a factual analysis of its subject matter. If you want to use this movie to scare your kids away from drugs, you may have some problems suspending disbelief. Not everyone who abuses drugs is doomed to drug abuse hell, and this film does not embrace the idea of rehabilitation (where ""Trainspotting"" did). Much of the story reinforces old stereotypes and myths about drug dealers and wildly exagerates certain risks. Prescription diet pills leading to electro-shock therapy?This is where my concerns about taking this film too seriously arise. Many points of this story sit uneasily with the issues surrounding our approach to drug abuse and harm minimisation. When Harry seeks treatment for a horribly infected and poisonous wound resulting from injection he is not only arrested but refused treatment. Refused treatment for a life threatening injury in a hospital. What is the take-home message here? Don't dare to seek medical treatment if you have consumed illegal drugs? Kids die that way.Watch it and be revolted Cronenberg style. But if you want to use this movie like a Grimm Brothers fairytale, tread very carefully indeed."	4.0	Dont use drugs, drugs are bad,  mmKay?	2003-06-02	5	4	1

After i saw Pi, and i heard Aronofsky was making another film, i did a little looking around and found the DVD the Requiem for A dream.The story revolves around 4 main characters who all want better lives, but they just make their lives worse in the process.  This is something which holds ur attention from start to finish.  Thihs movie is really a downer, and a real change up from your conventional drama story.  The feelings of the characters are almost felt by the viewer because of the incredible direction and sound, it just involves you.Never before have I seen such a movie that plays with your thoughts and feelings so well.  They want better lives and it ends up worse than it started for them.  So you think if it would have been better if they didn't try in the first place, but then you think that they wouldnt have mentally grown as poeple if they never tried.  It's a movie that challenges your knowledge too, your knowledge on friends, and just the world overall.Not to be mistaken for the next uplifting middle aged mothers drama, this one is different and doenst have much base for comparison.  Just see it.	5.0	A graceful look at life.	2001-11-27	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2 Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing ""Requiem For a Dream,"" a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, ""Requiem For a Dream,"" though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored."	3.0	powerful anti-drug drama	2002-01-11	11	8	3

It's a movie that's best experienced, certainly, when you have many thoughts in your head, about all that could have been, or what should I do for my future.....what's the most &#34;clean&#34; and peaceful way to become what I want to be. It really makes you think about that, and at the same time &#34;wakes&#34; you up from everything you thought it was all fun and games.A movie that certainly needs to be seen at least once.	5.0	A great heart-wrenching movie that will make you think for a few days!	2013-10-27	2	1	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3081Z4P774YR4	"""rsmon77"""	One of the things I can't seem to let go of after seeing &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is how people can let themselves become victims of their own personal vices.  As terrifying it is to see one character try to escape reality by shooting drugs into an infected and rotting vein, I can't help but feel sympathy for those who seem to be unaware of how their addiction has imprisoned them.  The character of Sara (played memorably by Ellen Burstyn) is among the greatest example.  To watch a character like that change from a complacent, yet likeable human to what we see at the end of this film is nothing less than tragic.  What is surprising is how this movie doesn't turn into a celebration of drugs, but rather a stark and horrifying reminder of how habits (of any kind) can destroy the soul long before it destroys the body.  This is truly one of the best films this decade has produced.	5.0	A Truly Powerful Film	2001-11-10	2	2	0

You will feel horrified. And you will feel so lucky not to be where the 4 characters are at the end.Set among the beaches of Coney Island, this movie follows four basically good people with dreams and shows how they try to achieve (and fail) at their dreams through drugs. In the beginning, Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Waynes) are dealing, wanting to get a pound of pure heroin and retiring rich. Harry's beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) wants to open up a clothing store and not depend on her parents anymore. And Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) spends her days in front of the TV until she gets a call to be on TV, and she is ecstatic. Dreaming to fit into her favorite red dress, she tries a diet. When that doesn't work, she goes on diet pills. In the first of three parts, these four people are at their height-Marion and Harry are young, in love and on heroin, Tyrone and Harry's business is booming, and Sara finds that her dream of being on TV is a reason to be happy. They are at the top of the wooden roller coaster, and there is no where to go but down.And oh boy, does it go down.As summer ends, the fall comes (quite literally) for these people-whenever something good is supposed to happen, something bad happens instead. Tyrone and Harry's business is dried up and are low on cash, forcing Marion to go to extremes to get money for their score. And meanwhile Sara has been eating nothing but coffee and diet pills. When she gets adjusted she thinks that something is wrong, so she takes more-lots more, and she mentally spirals downward (in one hallucination she is being attacked by her fridge). When these people finally hit rock bottom, it is devestating-all of them land in places worse than death physically, mentally and psychologically.Everything about this movie is fresh, excellent and razar-sharp. Darren Aronofsky is a young indie director with one other film to his name (Pi), and I know that we all will be seeing more of him over the years-he is too brilliant to disappear. The editing is both exaggerated and realistic-the way that they made the drug hallucinations is simply brilliant, and isn't afraid to push the envelope to the extreme. The soundtrack is cutting-edge by the Kronos String Quartet with mixing by Clint Mansell and absolutly PERFECT for the movie-you will not be able to hear the crickets chirp without thinking of the beats to the movie. It's so incredibly haunting.And then there's the acting. Jared Leto manages to impress us and make us forgive him for years of B-movies with his sympathetic performance. In the scene talking to his mother, you can see that he is genuinly scared for his mother when he discovers that she is on diet pills, being a druggie himself. He is basically a good person but doesn't have the power to truly help them. Marlon Waynes is so good in his guilt-ridden performance that for 2 hours you can honestly forget that this is the guy from 'White Chicks' and 'Scary Movie.' Jennifer Connelly is obviously a great actress, but here she demonstrates what makes her a phenomenal actress. Her change from loving Harry with heroin on the side to loving heroin with Harry on the side is truly brilliant. And then there's Ellen Burstyn. She is so brilliant and convincing not just in her drug-induced hysteria but also in her more quiet scenes. I am appalled that she didn't win a Best Actress Oscar over Julia Roberts for her little half performance in Erin Brockovich-a prime example of star power overpowering a great performance. Sure, Julia might have given the best performance (which isn't saying much) in her pathetic romantic comedy-ridden career, but Ellen Burstyn gave the best performance in HER career (after a Best Actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and being part of the horror classic 'The Excorcist', that's saying A LOT). All of these great performances will live with you forever.In the fold-out poster that I found inside the DVD, the director says that this movie is the triumph of Addiction over the human spirit, and he couldn't be more right. In the beginning, these people have dreams and seem so close to achieving them. But by the end because of the abuse of drugs their reality is so awful that their dreams become their escape, especially to forget what they did to get the drugs in the first place, and it becomes a circle. Though this is ovbiously an anti-drug movie, it doesn't have a preachy feeling to it. It's as though Darren Aronofsky was simply more interested in how Addiction triumphs and showing Addiction as the hero, not the enemy. I also applaud the movie for not only showing illegal drugs as bad but also innocent legal drugs and how they can be awful for you if used wrongly and eaten like M&Ms.; This is a movie that can possibly make a life change for some people-EVERY PERSON SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE-You will learn more from a dramatization about drugs than any documentary, because this shows and gets deep inside the heads of everyday people and their fall from grace.

I assume that is what the director intended which is quite an interesting technique.  While this isn't my favorite movie of all time or anything, I did like it.  I agree with the person who said this should be shown to all high schoolers.  It would definitely open up their eyes.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3621YUSZC5N7X	Rudy	Darren Aronofsky's visually stunning film depicts a group of drug addicts in New York. He parallels their addiction to that of the mother of one of the youths, who becomes hooked on prescription meds. The movie starts slow but gradually builds to an intense climax. Aronofksy's unique style utilizes many sights and sounds to engross the viewer into the film.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A22WUL3S5Q7OGC	"""rukahsatc"""	I had honestly never heard of this film when I saw it earlier this year for a film class in college.  We watched the film in our &quot;technical issues&quot; part of the class, and after seeing the film you will see why.  The cuts from scenes and other cinematography will either interest you further in the movie, or turn you away.  Yes, sometimes the &quot;cuts&quot; as you will see, can get a little disturbing and annoying, but, they begin to wear on you and become part of the movie.I recommend this movie for that reason, to see the chance the film makers took on what could have broken the movie.However, this film, as a lot of people have pointed out, is not for the weak hearted.  At the end you will find yourself, speechless and with a feeling of, most likely sickness.  Because of this reason, I recommend seeing it.  I read one review in which stated, the point of all movies should be to leave you speechless at the end.  I strongly disagree, but this is still a movie that should be seen, as long as you can handle the material.However, just for pure taste perhaps the end sequence of Jennifer's character at the party could have been taken out, I understand why they put it in, but, if you are showing it for a class or with teens, perhaps you want to check out the edited version.	4.0	Saw it in a College Film class...	2002-05-26	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	Sometimes film can change you. A film can alter how you feel about any well depicted profession. It can mother the notions of what love must feel like. It can drag you through the darkest and most dire circle of hell. It can exploit a pessimist's worst apocalyptic vision into an immensely valuable anti drug statement. It can shock you scene after scene with its honesty and its unflinchingly brutal depiction of the desperation of the inner city, and at what price peace can there be achieved. One of the top five films produced in the past 20 years, and in the name of freedom of speech, priceless.	5.0	I want to see donkey to donkey	2002-04-18	0	0	0

But to those who really want a more clear enjoyable reason to say no to drugs, then this is it.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AD29KEJMCAD76	Samhot	"I am going to try to refrain from writing a lengthy review for this film, and keep it as succint as possible, although for a film like this, the task almost seems impossible. Many reviewers have already said some things that I am going to say, and would have liked to say, but the review will go on, anyway.This is a powerful movie, in which it's main theme centers around drug abuse & addiction, and the dangerous consequences that may follow. But, the film centers on more than just drug abuse and addiction: to me it also centers on life, and how the average folk go about trying to embellish what seems like the emptiness of life. To try and enhance (and possibly) facilitate the meaning of that last sentence, think about this: many people do -- and/or try to reach for -- things that are supposed to make one's life more meaningful and complete: getting married, experiencing the birth of one's first child, going to college, becoming wealthy and/or famous, et al. In society, we are basically brought up to believe that if we follow along certain patterns (e.g. becoming wealthy, etc), we will be happy & fulfilled. One of the many things this film shows us, is that sometimes, what we are brought up to believe, can be a devastating illusion, or at least, there is a strong possibility of this.This story focuses on four main characters, and their addiction to drugs. The story is also cleverly told over the course of four seasons (three, technically), and like another reviewer pointed out a few pages back, the mood of each season correlates with the psychological and circumstantial happenings of each character (or vice versa.) The film starts with the Summer, which correlates with adolescent feelings. In this case, these four characters seemed as if they were happy (or at least we may think they are happy), and seemed to be filled with laughs, smiles and confidence in their future and dreams. In the Autumn, which represents added responsibility, and preparation for ""darker times"", things start to slowly go downhill for the gang. We can see their circumstances beginning to spiral, and their dispositions begin to follow downward as well. By, Winter (which represents ""death"" or the ""ending""), each of these four members seem to meet the ""finality"" of their fates, to disturbing effect, to say the least. Spring, which represents birth, and fresh, new beginnings, never arrived. Heavy stuff, there.Some reviewers have complained about the camera techniques used in this film to be nothing more than flash for flash's sake, and similarly, some have said that some of the disturbing scenes found in the film were there for shock value only. I couldn't disagree more. For starters, like another reviewer has pointed out, the ""speeding up"" and ""slowing down"" techniques are supposed to correlate with the ""speeding"" or ""raciness"" of the characters' thought processes while under the influence of...well...speed (and other drugs.) I found this to be very clever and fascinating. Secondly, while there *are* indeed disturbing images in the film, I didn't necessarily find the images to be the most disturbing aspect of the film, but rather *how* these images were shot. In other words, it's more *psychologically* disturbing, than it is *graphically* disturbing, if that can be basically understood. The way this film was made alone, should not be taken lightly, and it is indeed clever and noteworthy filmmaking. You'd have to see the film for yourself to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly did wonderful and convincing jobs in their respective roles. Their performances truly helped to make the film what it was, and it wouldn't have been as complete without them. Ellen Burstyn's performance seemed to get a droves-worth of accolades, and deservedly so. Her performance was undoubtedly the most frightening, disturbing and heart-wrenching thing about this film. In moments, her character made me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether. The whole movie is powerful indeed, and the last segment (Winter) is indeed the most intense and hellish part of the movie.I watched this film with another member of my family, and by the time the ""Winter"" segment had arrived, we were *both* saying things like, ""I will *never* watch this movie again. It's a little *too* much reality."" Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving, this film will stay in your mind long after it has ended, and many will gather their own responses as to what the movie meant to them. And, if some of you think that what happened to these characters can't happen to anyone in real-life, think again: it's *very* real, and *can* happen (and no doubt *has* happened to some in real-life.) Indeed, reality can be too much at times.Before I close out this review, let me share a brief story with you about someone who used drugs: it was documented in a program (I can't remember the name of it right now) that a female experimented with a drug, and not too long after that, her friends were quick to comment that she was becoming excessively paranoid and delusional. She was sent to a specialist who did a brain scan on her. When the doctor took a look at the scan, we the viewers (and no doubt the girl, and her mother, who happened to be alongside her) saw something *very* disturbing: there were various holes -- large holes -- throughout her brain: like the equivalent of looking at a piece of cheese after a mouse had nipped through it quite well. The result? This girl now suffers from acute bipolar/manic-depressive disorder. And you know what else? This was the result of her experimenting with a drug: after ONLY ONE TRY! That's right, this girl is now stuck with a ""psychotic disorder"" for the rest of her life, as the result of her experimenting with a drug after only *one* try. Yes, indeed, reality can be a bummer. I recommend seeing this film at least once; this goes for everyone."	5.0	Powerful, Unsettling and Real.	2004-12-07	8	5	3

The characters are well developed and the ultimate disintegration of each of them is executed superbly, showing the insane depths to which the human soul can sink. From a filmmaking perspective, not only is the cinematography dazzling but the careful matching of the visual effects to the musical score intensifies the impact of every scene. The film builds in power as would a musical requiem, finally ending in a violent multimedia crescendo. The final 20 minutes of &quot;RFAD&quot; are as edgy as any I've seen and are simply not to be missed.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2Y343ZF977VNJ	"Saskia Seattle ""saskiaseattle"""	This film is worth one viewing - by rental only, but ultimately somewhat hollow and unsatisfying. I think it's over-rated and those in love with it just like the eye candy. I wouldn't consider it worth buying.It's not completely worthless, however.The visually exciting part is that Requiem develops its own visual language to depict events that sophisticated film-goers are already familiar with. Who needs to see another junky shoot up? We've seen it so many times, it simply doesn't have the shock value or impact that it once did. Instead, the film-makers provide quick, clever, visual representations of the physical effects of shooting up that act as a visual shortcut to get you to the real point of the movie - how the addiction leads the lives of these individuals to spin out of control.The film also serves to point out how our quick-fix, get-rich-quick culture encourages behaviors that lead to addiction. And, it clearly illuminates the hypocritical views mainstream America and our medical community often has about legal and illegal drugs.I would give the movie a 4 for being visually innovative, but a 3 for failing to hold the story line together and for failing to provide for an adequate ending.	3.0	Visually exciting, but ultimately, unsatisfying	2001-08-17	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	Requiem is one of those little known movies, quietly powerful, that will leave you reeling with emotion in its wake.  Even unfeeling husks like myself will not escape unscathed.This is a beautifully mastered film about drug addiction, but not in standard, drugs-are-bad format.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a junkie who dreams of being a better person but still regularly hawks his mother's battered TV set for fix money.  He and his friend Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) decide to go into dealing, to set themselves up so that they never have to worry again.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's mother, is a lonely widow who spends her simple days watching TV, eating chocolates, and gossiping with her friends.  Until she receives a phone call saying that she has won a chance to be on television, and with this dream comes a revitalization of Sara's life.  Determined to fit into her old red dress when they call her to be on television, Sara embarks on a diet.  Unable to resist food, her only companion through her lonely widowhood, Sara goes to a quack doctor for diet pills.It is extremely fascinating how `Requiem' managed to tackle two separate types of addiction in one movie, blending their patterns, their cause-and-effect, and their rise-and-decline results into one sweeping expanse of cinematic pleasure.  Imbedded behind this well directed and well-photographed movie is an eerie soundtrack, with an ominous score repeated throughout the movie giving audio fuel to the increasingly horrific visuals.`Requiem' will leave you hollowed out, numb, aching in a profound and disturbingly vague way.  It is filled with hope and hopelessness, love and destruction, compulsion and self-defeating purposes, centered around that gaping wound called addiction.  Look for spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie 1 & 2), Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth), and Jared Leto (The Panic Room).  Each of these actors/actresses give us their best performances to date in `Requiem', and tip your hat to the realism from the supporting cast members.If you watch only one movie this year, make it Requiem For A Dream, and if you only get to watch two movies, then watch this one twice.  Also of note, if this movie touches your soul the way it touched mine, go out and grab up a copy of the book `Candy', by Luke Davies.  Also themed around addiction, it uses the same despairing approach to this tender subject as `Requiem' does.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A13D1WTFEMS9VH	Scorpio69	"We board a fast moving train to oblivion with no understanding given as to why these people became such desperate junkies in the first place. Should we assume that it is simply because they're all so obviously stupid? The beautiful Jennifer Connelly, for example, apparently has a talent and wants to design clothes and maybe open her own store, yet she can't otherwise form a coherent thought, like, ""Gee, maybe I should finish high school first!"" Or is it all supposed to be because of their inability to move beyond their bleak surroundings? There are lots of people living in bleak surroundings who don't do what these people did. So what is it? Hmmm?And let's not forget that we're talking about people who not only shoot smack, but whose loftiest aspiration is to become smack dealers themselves so that they can get lots of money fast. In fact, when they're in their money-making ""business"" mode, they seemed to be able to bring their respective addictions under control just fine, thanks. Hey, you've gotta have a clear head to make it in the business world. But getting a real job (or even looking for one) never enters into the equation for these self-absorbed nitwits.As far as mom living her zombie-like TV-oriented life while popping Rx diet pills so she can be on TV herself, where's the background info that would allow us to buy into this? Is your grandma a pill addict with an IQ of 50? Whose grandma is, exactly? No, the vast majority of TV-watching grandmas aren't popping pills, they're popping cookies into the oven.So, with no reasons given as to how this particular group of Jerry Springer guests decided to roll up their sleeves and stick a dirty needle in (or eat diet pills like M&Ms;), I just plain didn't care.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ACTYP447JCDX0	Scott Bresinger	"This is one of those films that a person can be obsessed with--assuming they can stomach it in the first place.  Since I'm the type of person who's watched ""The Silence of the Lambs"" so many times I've memorized most of the dialogue, and emit enthusiastic laughs at the most horrific scenes, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is kind of like a warm bath.  Of course, since I'm clearly a deranged mutant, what would the ""average"" deranged person think?  For one thing, they might get the idea that heroin isn't all it's cracked up to be, unless of course you long for misery, anguish, pshysical/mental deterioration and the sweet, sweet oblivion of death.  Well, if heroin addiction is too much of an investment for you (I've been told it can take up a lot of your time), but dig the schadenfreude of watching people (okay, actors) experience the other stuff, then this is movie for you!To be fair, since after all I've went and given the film 5 stars, and I honestly do love it, ""Requiem"" is also highly reccommended to anyone sick of the processed, pre-chewed gruel of most mainstream studio fare and want to support challenging, bleeding-edge filmmakers, this is definitely for you.  Director/boy genius Darren Aronofsky has clearly seen the advances of Godard, Tarantino, Tom (""Run Lola Run"") Tykwer and yes, even the best of music videos and decided to do them one better.  If this impulse had been applied to a regular genre picture, like ""romantic comedy"" or ""thriller"" or ""Ashton Kutcher,"" it could have been an embarrassment.  Hubert Selby's original novel was nihlistic, but it was justly hailed for its gritty, hard-boiled style, which most directors seeking to adapt it would have forgotten about, instead delivering just a wallow in suffering.  Aronofsky uses every trick in the editing bag and probably invents a few new ones to make his harrowing tale compelling, even on many repeated viewings.  Sure, dismiss it as an American ""Trainspotting"" if you must, but whereas that film eventually retreated into cheap irony, in ""Requiem"" it's totally organic to the story, and even, dare I say, sincere.Some critics have even sniped at the mother character portrayed so brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn.  An aging, lonely woman as a drug addict?  Come on, they say, be real!  Where they're totally wrong is that while her son and his friends are busy with heroin, this is clearly contrasted with her own addiction to television and ""diet Pills"" (amphetamines).  Addiction is a common denominator of most people--just about everyone has some fix they need to function.  Actually, I wouldn't trust someone without some kind of addiction--in Aronofsky's view, there are no benign addictions.  While I'd argue that point--things like heroin or god are far worse than say, repeatedly watching ""Silence of the Lambs"" or, for that matter, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" Aronofsky's point is made at least as well as the Velvet Undergound's ""Heroin.""  It should also be noted that this isn't an anti-drug polemic.  If anything, Aronofsky wants to point out the futility of legislating, and punishing, what is after all human nature.Actually, the main reason I'm even writing this review is a way to satisfy my anticipation of Aronofsky's next project, the science fiction parable ""The Fountain,"" which the last time I looked was slated for release in early '06 (it had previously been scheduled for December '05).  I can't think of any better way to prepare for what I'm sure will be another mind-blower than to watch ""Requiem."" Just be sure to buy the unrated version instead of the cut-for-Blockbuster R-rated edition.  As long as you're wallowing in pain, misery and the sweet, sweet oblivion of death, you might as well do it right."	5.0	Misery is the river of the world...	2005-09-29	12	11	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2KV9KAG6YMVLS	Sean Dalton	This is not a subtle film.  It employs everything--lighting, camera tricks, music (the score alone is a work of art)--to get its message across.  I think it should be required viewing for every American teenager.  It will shock and horrify them, and that's a good thing, considering the subject matter.  Ellen Burstyn (who, let's be honest, could turn a piece of you-know-what film into a wonder by her mere presence in it) is amazing; she completely loses herself in the role.  I was moved and saddened by her initial loneliness, by her wish to be on TV, by her descent into addiction.  Jared Leto is good, but it's hard to compete with Burstyn.  Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his girlfriend, and Marlon Wayans shows a range never glimpsed in his shallow comedic roles.  His final scene is particularly moving.  I didn't like Aronofsky's first film, though I saw the man had talent, and this proves it.  Not for people who look for escape in their movies, but for anyone who loves originality and experimentation in film.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2003-07-30	5	4	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3PDXZ9UWEZBVG	Sean Mann	Requiem For A Dream is nothing short of groundbreaking, provocative, disturbing, and most of all entertaining. It is easily one of the best films of 2000 and displays some of the year's best acting as well. The film, as you probably know, focuses on drug addiction. The film focuses on the lives of four people and their addictions. The film focuses on Harry Goldfarb (played by Jared Leto, in one of the best male acting performances seen in 2000) and his friend Tyrone (played surprisingly well by Marlon Wayans) as they decide to make a business of trading drugs on the streets of New York City. Harry also loves to use drugs with his girlfriend Marion (played nicely in an award-nominated performance by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) who tends to fall out of her deep relationship with Harry several times in the movie. Now, here comes the most excellently told story out of the three parts of the film. Sara Goldfarb, Harry's mother has nothing to do with her life but watch television and eat food, which both are much-loved hobbies. She also sometimes spends time with the other  ladies at the front of the building she lives in as well. You notice these  hobbies as Harry continues to steal her television set for drugs several times with Sara eventually buying the set back. One day, while watching her favorite show &quot;Juice&quot; a show that is meant to help the lives of it's contestants, Sara gets a call that tells her she has been picked to be on the show and will get an application in the mail soon. This turns out to be a trick but Sara sadly does not believe this as she tries to fit back into her favorite red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation. When she doesn't fit into it, she goes on a diet until a friend mentions how her relative took diet pills. After much temptation, Sara decides to get a prescription and to take the pills and eventually is pressured to take more and more to lose more weight while she has yet to get a response from the network when she already mailed out her application months ago. Ellen Burstyn is everything the &quot;Best Actress&quot; should be: believingly heartbreaking, emotive, well-received, and well-liked. Everyone who has seen &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; knows that she was snubbed at the 2001 Academy Awards and many (including me) would love to get an address of the Academy so letters can be sent showing disappointment. Ellen Burstyn plays the role so well that she is the one character in the film you want to reach your hands out and tell her that she is beautiful, and that she needs to change for the better. However, as sympathetic you feel for the other three characters you undesrtand there actions are intentional as they know the dangerous consequences that may befall on them. &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is a movie that can be called &quot;A Just Say No!&quot; film but is so much more even thought it completely teaches about the consequences of drugs. The film is so educational and well-written, directed, and acted the National Film Registry should enter this in their library so the film can get public acknowledgement for it's brilliant story-telling of the consequences of addiction.Rating: 5 Out Of 5 Stars	5.0	A Film That Should Be Submitted In The National Registry	2001-05-22	8	7	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2Z3QB8JV09AQ6	Sean Mccollum	I don't know who this director thinks he is. He goes through this movie with an air of superiority that completely destroys any credibility with his subject matter. By the end I truly got a sense that he thought he was better than these characters. All these little people that hold on to thier pithy dreams and end up addicted to some kind of drug. By the end, things go to a ridiculous extreme for all four cast members. It's a work of schadenfreude and it needs to be called out.	3.0	ehh.	2004-04-25	10	2	8

Being very concerened about a couple of friends of mine who have issues kind of like the characters in the film, I took them to see this. It REALLY gave them a big wake up call.  First class acting, camerawork, editing, and music.  Groundbreaking film work.  This film should be shown to every highschool kid.  It is extremely unfortunate that the MPAA couldn't understand the reality of the film and how important this film is, by giving it an NC 17 rating. Much better than the movie that wins Best Picture in the year 2000.	5.0	Kubrick would be very proud....	2000-10-23	13	13	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2727C1VHMXRT1	Sergio Oses Puchkov	This movie is based on the novel of Hubert Selby Jr. and directed by Darren Aronofsky, one of the most talented people in the film industry. There's no happiness in life without suffering, and not always things play out the way we want, sometimes distorted expectations or false goals will keep us from finding true peace.This story exposes the life or 4 individuals, each one striving to achieve happiness through materialism, and it's this blind quest for their dream what ultimately destroys them in a cruel and sad way; it's really impossible not to feel empathy about these characters, because it's on their own hands to turn around from the path of grievance, but as story comes to conclusion there's no happy ending for them; hence the title requiem for a dream.	5.0	A lesson for life	2010-09-24	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A313PXRGQT3ZH	Seshadri Veeraraghavan	"I bought the DVD the day it came out - the unrated version, of course - I hate censors having their way with creativity. What I saw didn't disturb me in the least - I was far more disturbed by ""Taxi Driver"" - it had the raw edge and unpredictability of an ultra-volatile character. Another film I'd very highly recommend for fans of Taxi Driver is ""HENRY: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". Don't waste your time and money on Part-II, just get Part-I by John McNaughton and Richard Fire, and starring Michael Rooker and Tom Knowles.Getting back to Requiem..., I think it was meek and insipid. The only thing that impressed me about the film was the hip-hop collage of sounds and images; inspired sounds of injections, cells expanding, eyes dilating, and a totally unexpected scene of gang war.Jennifer Connelly shines, and Burnstyn is great; their performances being in total sync with their characters. However, Jared Leto was too clean-shaven and nice-looking to have been a solid drug addict that he was portrayed. The much talked about ""Requiem"" scene was not graphic or brutal at all! It was a pathetic scene, one written just to create controversy, and need not have been in the movie at all. It was done very distastefully, and was empty beyond the initial five seconds of shock-value.In fact the movie is not emotionally draining; it's exhausting mentally only because of the suffering of Ellen's character. While I'd recommend the movie to people that like shock tactics, I'd definitely ask the genuine movie lover to stay a hundred miles away from this piece of inspired mediocrity.One more thing; most critics seemed to suggest that this film was about the ""systematic destruction of hope"" - far from it!Even though the things that happen to the main characters in the end, may seem to suggest the ""systematic destruction of hope"", they don't. After spending $$$... to see the exposure of the way drug abuse affects people (in a brutal, bizarre manner), I realized that this film only preaches taking the high moral ground, and does not bring down anything to earth.I made a mistake buying the DVD; I certainly hope the reader doesn't."	2.0	Very, very disappointed.	2001-05-26	7	2	5
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A264XZUXLFMZ8B	Seth Webber	Darren Aronofsky burst onto the film scene with his obscure film Pi.  I enjoyed Pi a lot, but it was really his training ground for this film, Requiem for a Dream.  This is a very well made anti-drug movie.  The message felt very similar to the personal side of Traffic.  I think Aronofsky got shafted since this film got released the same time Traffic did, and thus got mainly overlooked because it dealt with the same topics.  Requiem looks at addiction in a much more stylized manner, using a lot of the same techniques Aronofsky used in Pi.  Things like the Rozzi-cam, a rig attached to the front of the actor to give you a real subjective feel, and the hip hop montages, cutting certain actions in a similar manner of montage, made their way from Pi and fit very well into this fairly quick paced film. .... I rented the edited version which has nothing on it and corrupts Aronofsky's original vision of what the film should be.	4.0	Aronofsky is beginning to make a name for himself	2001-05-25	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2VYN1CQKMY2BT	"SetSail4Disappointment ""Jen"""	"There are movies like ""trainspotting"" that hype the idea that ""heroin chic"" is acceptable, cool, fun. Heroin is about shooting up, needing more, getting sick, freaking out, and doing *ANYTHING* to get more. That's what ""Requiem for a Dream"" does a fine job of truely portraying. But this movie doesn't just explore heroin abuse (Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans), it explores the world of the down-and-out cocaine addicted rich girl(Jennifer Connolly), and the widowed, t.v. obsessed speed freak (Ellen Burstyn).In this movie, you literally feel how they feel: the euphoria, the pain, the descent into madness. ""Requiem"" goes far beyond just being a movie, it's an experience. Director Darren Aronofsky does a fine job of making all your senses aware in this movie: the beautifully haunting music, the syringe in the arm and the pupils dilating, the lines on a mirror and a rolled up $20, the snap of the white lid on the pill bottle. It's all there. This is a beautifully sick movie. It's raw, real and you should do yourself a favor and see it!"	5.0	Pure Genius!	2002-04-03	2	2	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1R6347DZ96NK1	Shadi Mirza	I suppose I'll start by addressing comments made by CJG.  Yes, the ending is much more unsettling then most anything the Hollywood hit machines can crank out, but that's what makes the film so powerful.  The movie is about addiction, plain and simple.  The characters in this movie are so deeply seeded in their addiction that there is no possible way they can come out unscathed (Ellen Burstyn's character may have a chance).Let me reiterate what everyone else is saying about Marlon Wayons performance by saying that he is fantastic in this movie.  I sincerely hope, after seeing this movie, that he never appears in another comedy/spoof film again.  He is that good in this movie.  Jared Leto is the guy who appeared on &quot;My So Called Life&quot; (with Claire Danes), and if you remember him from that role alone, you never will again after this movie.  He is almost too good an actor for someone who appeared on that show.  Jennifer Connelly continues to take the risks as an actress that made me love her so much in &quot;Dark City&quot;.  Yes, she is good looking, but you won't see that at all here, just a great performance.Another actor that few people give mention at all is Christopher McDonald (the ringleader of the info-mercial Sarah watches on T.V.).  This guy has gone from his previous best known role as Shooter McGavin (the great &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;) to this role, and it really shows his chops as an actor.The bottom line is that you have to watch this movie.  Not only is the cinematography amazing, but after watching it, I promise you will not even think about using drugs for the rest of your natural life.  Yes, it is THAT disturbing.Let's see what Aronofsky can do with the next Batman movie (a crap franchise, indeed).	5.0	This movie is dark, depressing, and a masterpiece!	2002-01-14	1	1	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A20XDHNKURJOKG	"Shaggy P ""alcoholicninja"""	(Forget) DARE, watch this movie!!!If you want a happy ending or a sugar coated view of the drug world this is not the movie for you. However, if you want a movie that beautifully displays the purest interpretation of drugs I have ever seen in a movie, this movie is where you'll find it. It shows the the highpoints as well as some of the most drastic lows that can be found in the drug world. Though controvertial to no end, I would suggest showing this film to highschool aged kids as a drug deterent tool. It certainly did more for me than any funded drug resistance program I have seen.Beyond the reality check this movie gives, special attention should be paid to the extreme mastery of film the director displays throughout the entire movie.By far the most serious roll I have seen Marlon Wayans play, he pulls it off extremely well showing his skill as more than just another comedic actor. And we can't go without mentioning the beautiful Jennifer Connelly... she has definately grown up since her roll in Labrynth something like 10 years prior.Taking in great acting, directing, and a beautiful story line it should lastly be noted how incredible the score is for this movie, through listening to the music you really feel the power this movie puts out.I can rant and rave about this movie for days and days, but I can put as simple as this... If you like a thinker movie with a real, true life base, it will be extremely hard to find anything better than Requiem for a Dream. Buy it today and after seeing it once you will be telling all your friends how badly they need to watch it as well.	5.0	Hands Down the Best Drug Movie Ever!!!	2003-01-19	3	2	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	If you have seen Pi, you'll love this one. (I find both movies to be groundbreaking, almost of a class at par with Stanley Kubrick of yore). Aronofsky, a meticulous director, uses some very original techniques to set the tone and convey the themes within this sometimes dark but always beautiful, complex depiction of the nature of addiction.Through use of split screens, revolving cameras, extreme close-up, distorted angles, blasting sound, and repetitive symbols, all in an effort to convey the actual experience of the substance-user under the influence. The film is a visceral experience, unrelenting in its portrayal of each character's descent into their own personal abyss.The film focuses on three main characters: a Jewish mother from Brooklyn, Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, the son, Harry, played by Jared Leto, and the girlfriend, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. Mom is addicted first to television, and as a result of a proposed appearance on her favorite show, decides to lose weight with the aid of diet drugs, prescribed by an unethical physician. Harry and Marion are fond of heroin, but they will settle for something amphetamine in a pinch. All three start out as casual users, but as they persist with their addictions, each character's environment deteriorates and they all sink deeper into unreality. Aronofsky portrays this by having the characters interact with each other in a relatively normal way at first, focusing on the familial relationship between mother and son, and the romantic one between Harry and Marion.The early scenes are brightly lit and pleasant to watch, with many shots of the gorgeous Leto and Connelly lying head-to-head, looking remarkably alike, awash in drugs and love. Even the screen-wide use of the symbols and sounds of drug use seem exhilarating and exciting at first, and it is not until the viewer is bombarded with them relentlessly that they become uncomfortable to watch and hear. Aronofsky splits the film into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter. The seasons change along with the characters, and as time progresses, the characters split from each other, each advancing more deeply into their own addiction and despair. Their individual descents parallel each other, which Aronofsky represents by quick cutting from one character's current predicament to the others, all the scenes infused with garish colors, murky lighting, and disquieting music. At one point Aronofsky unites the characters by showing the visual similarities between the bloodshot, bruised, and terrified eyes of the mother, the heavily made-up, smeared and bleary eyes of Marion, and the infected, bloody and blackened wound that Harry grows on his inner arm.The performances in this film are top-notch, especially from Ellen Burstyn, as a perfectly actualized suburban junkie. Her character is really the sympathetic one, caught not in a desire to get high, but just to be a little more attractive -- a trait so typical of our media-fed society. Also notable in his role is Marlon Wayans, playing against type in a non-comedic role as Harry's drug buddy.In a conventional drug film, the addict usually dies, as a morality play, or to accomplish some finality for the storyline. Aronofsky refuses to go for the easy way out. The last twenty minutes of this film possess some of the most harrowing footage you will ever see, and there is no respite for the viewer or the characters.A definite 5-star and one for your collection!	5.0	An excellent although somewhat grotesque movie..	2003-03-21	30	26	4

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A27M0CNORWZLG1	Sheppdawg	"This is one film that will really stay with you for a while. And shatter your nerves in the process. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr, this film takes you on a ride and doesn't ever let up.Jared Leto is Harry Goldfarb. A drug addict with aspirations of making it as a dealer. Along with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), they are all addicted to drugs.Their drug use seems natural and they appear like the prototypical junky. But the most disturbing character transformation is Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn). She is a widow living alone in her apartment. Harry occassionally drops by to pawn her TV for drugs. But she always goes down to the pawn shop to get it back. When she gets a call one day telling her that she's been selected to be a contestant on a TV game show, she gets very excited and decides to lose a few pounds to fit into a red dress that she absolutely loves. But dieting isn't easy with just willpower so she goes to the doctor that one of her friends recommends. He prescribes her diet pills. Which is basically speed.She starts to lose weight but the pills make her very nervous and anxious. And she doesn't sleep very much. In one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, Harry comes to visit her. He can tell that she's taking speed and tells her that those pills are no good. She asks him, ""Well how would you know? Are you a doctor?"" And his reply is priceless.Somehow the three friends manage to actually deal drugs and put away a good bit of money. But soon their consumption starts to drain the savings. And when the supply of heroin in the city is substantially reduced, they are forced to do desperate acts to maintain their habits.The movie begins to get very dark and disturbing at this point as all of the characters start to sink very low and do things that only the most desperate of addicts will do. The overall message I got is that there are things worse than death that can come from addiction. And if you see this film you will know what I'm talking about.The theme song to this film is haunting and very powerful. I highly recommend it but be prepared to have your nerves completely shot. It's a difficult film to watch at times but is definately a film for any movie lover to view at least once in their life."	5.0	Shatters your nerves...	2013-02-23	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1RW5LESS217FS	Sherie M Baker	This was one of the most disturbing movies that I have ever seen. What made the movie disturbing was its vivid and honest portrayal of the drug addicts struggle. Everything that happens to the addicts in this film is gut wrenching, sad, troublesome and complex.  The film involves the young and the old: the doctor and the street pharmacist. It is truly a cautionary tale. It allows the viewers to feel the heartache and misery of the drug user or abuser. The audience is permitted to feel overwhelmed and as helpless as the addict.This film should be shown to anyone contemplating the recreational drug use of heroin, cocaine, meth, speed, pills etc. None of the addicts in this film set out to become addicts. None said when I grow up I want to be an addict. The mother never said I want to be an addict.  She simply wanted to lose weight and went to a doctor. It is sad that once the addicts got too close to the edge of the mountain that there was no one or nothing to help pull them back. I will forever feel extreme sympathy and empathy for those addicted and pray for such people because, &#34;but for the grace of God there go I.&#34;	5.0	The Reality of an addict	2014-03-18	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3O4C1NQ6F6IR5	"Shikhar Srivastava ""Curious"""	I know a movie is strong enough when it forces me to write a review. I did this for AI, Shawshank Redemption, and ET. and I also wrote it for Freddie Got Fingered, Austin Powers Goldmember, and Charlie's Angels 2 (I hated those but netflix does not allow negative stars). So now you know that I am not an intellectual or a pseud.My feelings are the same as most other reviews. I had not seen anything more horrific than this in my life. I am recommending it to all my friends who like serious cinema and art. I did not know about this movie at all but I had seen Pi. A search for director's other movies brought me to this movie. Even though this movie is categorized as 'drama'. a more appropriate category would be horror.  In this case it is not fake zombies out there but real life itself. Real lives are devastated because of drugs. Thats the biggest horror of our times. I admire the director for bringing this marvelous piece of art that is a lesson as well. My son is two, but I would make sure that he sees it when he is thirteen or so. Its a must. And I don't think that anything as strong as this will come out in next ten years or so (unless it is from the same director).This movie took me to those depths I had never been before. Yeah, we have heard about drugs and their effects, but has someone experienced it ? This movie seems like taking you there. The pain, the agonies, the broken dreams, destroyed families. When I was a kid, there was some soap on TV on drugs. Our father did not allow us to see that, and rightly so. Most other movies/soaps/media just glamorize the part of drug and teach methods on how to use them or where to get them. This movie cuts all the slack. Its not important to know HOW drugs are used or what their names are. It does not matter. No one needs to know. However the aftereffects of drugs, these we should all see. Thats what the purpose here is.I bought some pills for weight loss for my wife (TV ads) two years back. She did not try those, and I am glad now.  I know we will fear that little bottle ( it must be lying somewhere) even when throwing that in trash. Thats THE message, and I am glad I saw this movie.Even though I would like to see it once more, I don't think I have the capacity to bear the pain . I returned it as soon as I was done.  and for those who like feel-well good ending, I doubt that anyone can have a happy ending on topic of drugs. Thats the way it is, it is one way street folks. No good feelings here, take it for what it is.	5.0	A *MUST*  SEE FOR EVERY SENSIBLE BEING	2003-12-02	8	5	3

Therefore, it surprised me to see the movie take such a comic tone midway through.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ABE14SVILZLNY	"SID ""Punk"""	I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close. I was totally amazed by her.All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will.	5.0	Disturbing, Graphic and Great	2004-07-18	2	2	0

Coming from my son, I believe that the emotions, pain and torment are as real as depicted. I won't go into much more about the film, because I think the other reviews do a great job.

Even if you don't like the genre, Requiem for a Dream is among those movies that you have to watch at least once in your life.The soundtrack of Requiem for a Dream, specificallyLux Aeterna, is one of the most influential music that I have ever listened in my entire life. It has been used in many trailers and movies, including The Lord of The Rings Two Towers' Trailer which featuresRequiem For A Towerversion of Lux Aeterna.	5.0	A Powerful Fantasy!	2012-05-15	0	0	0

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AJ9W09EUQPAKE	Sirin	Other films explore drugs but this one goes further. The plot is pretty simple. Right at the start the characters are set up for respective gruesome, nightmarish cataclismic fall outs from drug addiction. The last twenty minutes in particular present a spiraling, multi-angled view of a sort of drugs hell- the veins, the needles, the pulsating arteries the physical transformations - beauty becomes gnarled, warped and frail. It makes for compulsive viewing.This is a movie dealing with extremes. Extreme loneliness, extreme desperation, extreme desire for acceptance, extreme addiction and extreme imagery. This is what makes it a cult tour de force along the lines of Trainspotting and Clockwork Orange (although I wouldn't quite elevate it to that league as the characters in this movie are not developed as fully as they could be). If such movies offend you, for christ sakes don't put yourself through the self inflicted torture of watching it. Remember the Director's Cut is even more gut wrenching than the original.	4.0	Cool, cult, horrific, grotesque fall out	2004-11-18	1	1	0

Requiem is a very artsy creepy movie which follows 4 lives to utter bleak destruction.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A201HVME20DUW0	Sneak	after all the hype over this movie, i decided to give it a go. the styling and feel of the movie is supposed to give off this 'awkward emotion' but i only got 'eh, it's interesting i guess' from it.i understood it, that's not the issue at all. their wants and dreams are like demons that taunt them endlessly as they all try to get what they desire. money, opening a business, getting thinner... we all deal with something similar with our goals like this ourselves. it makes perfect sense.so why don't i like it that much? why doesn't it shock me? why doesn't it leave me with a deep feeling of profound emotions?well, i think it's the way it was set up. the feeling was a bit too artsy and the scene with the fridge didn't seem scary as much as it was goofy. it was intended as a 'scary' moment but rather was a way of saying that something so easy to look at and is our worst enemy when dieting can easily be our worst nightmare. i get it. it makes total sense, i just feel like there was no need for it.the drug scene also seemed a bit pointless. which one would it be if there were so many of them? well, the one in the car with the deaf guy signing. that whole scene. i understand the issue behind it but why have a random death? to make it more impactful to show how their usage and selling can actually hurt everyone? again, it makes sense. it just doesn't catch my eye.i've seen better movies but i can see why this is a popular and odd movie. but that song that always replays? gets on my nerves. you hear it no matter what in the movie when a deep moment is happening to show the cycle getting worse.i wouldn't mind giving it another watch through but for now, i'll leave this behind for a while.	3.0	eh,,,	2014-01-31	2	1	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L	Solid Snake	Elegant and melancholy, Requiem is an unsettling drama that is as beautiful visually as its subject matter is depressing.Each scene is excellently framed and contrasts in lighting, colors and settings allow the film's mood to parallel the highs and lows of the character's circumstances. As their predicament spirals out of control, and they shed the last vestiges of dignity and restraint, the film hurls you into their darkness - a chasm of moral bankruptcy, hopelessness and decrepitude.Requiem approaches the material with an objectivity that often feels brutally cold, but it handles the characters with a tenderness that makes their already mournful fates emotionally crushing for the viewer. The film does not offer us the comfort of a happy ending, so don't expect to go home smiling.The movie ultimately ends on a note that is starkly (and unavoidably) anti-drug, but this is not a preachy movie with some hidden moral agenda. The objective here is not to highlight the evils of drug use, but to mourn the human cost, weighed in hopes dashed, lives derailed and loves forsaken. This is after all, a requiem, a rueful ode to dreams buried and lost forever.The Directors Cut DVD is the only version you should consider buying. It contains the full unedited version with mature material that was removed from the watered down theatrical version. Not a movie you'll watch often, but one that will always resonate when you do.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A25DWVF5GFVSPK	Spiros D. Garbis	This may very likely be the most truthful film on drug addiction and its grave consequences on the body, mind and soul. Darren Aronofsky's approach to this topic is engaging and stigmatizing. Using the arena of drug addiction, the film very persuasively depicts how innocence can be corrupted and how human dignity can be poisoned when a life has fear and uncertainty with no real sense of purpose. Aronofsky's approach to this film, like a good theatrical play, leaves you with a lasting sense of urgency on today's pop culture. The performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans were very good but it must be said that the foundation of this film was Ellen Burstyn's acting. Her portrayal of the mother in the film is simply mesmerizing. It's obvious that she put in much heart and soul in her acting for this film. At times I lost the sence of watching a film and felt that I was experiencing a first hand view of a woman completely falling apart from her uncontrolled use of &quot;acid&quot; pills.  Perhaps its because we no longer experience acting of this calliper anymore, just mere shallow performances dressed up with sensational special effects. It's unfortunate that Ellen Burstyn didn't win the Oscar for Best Actress in this film. However, it's even more unfortunate for the Oscar committee for lacking the insight and wisdom in not rewarding such splendid acting.	5.0	An original and pragmatic look on how drugs destroy	2001-07-07	4	3	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2UW83R0JOZZ6	S. Schell	"From the visionary that brought you ""Pi"", a Sundance Film Festival winner about a mathematical genius trying to unlock the secrets of the world through numbers, comes a tail of misery and melancholy.  For those that enjoy their vast library of romantic comedies, you're probably wondering, ""If the movie's that depressing, why the HELL would I want to watch it?""  Based on Hubert Selby's 1978 novel ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"", ""Requiem For A Dream"" follows the lives of four Coney Island natives as they succumb to their various vices.  Ellen Burstyn is the star of the show and no doubt the best performance of all as Sara Goldfarb, a lonesome widow who day-in and day-out tunes in to her television, fixated by a self-help extremist named Tappy Tibbons (McDonald).  Treasuring a red dress she wore to her son's high school graduation, she aspires to wear it again but she has one small problem - 50 lbs.  She diets to no avail, unable to contain her cravings.  Upon a friend's suggestion, she visits her doctor and receives a prescription for diet pills - her downward spiral begins.Meanwhile, Harry Goldfarb (Leto) is repeatedly pawning his mother's TV to support his smack habit, accompanied by his partner-in-crime and fellow addict Tyrone Love (Wayans).  Besides his endeavors with Tyrone, Harry is involved with a coke-snorting beauty named Marion Silver (Connelly).  The footloose trio begin a trafficking operation in the hopes that they will soon score the purest pound of heroin, earning them the higher living that they dream of.  However, fate is misaligned for the three and a drug deal goes bad, landing Tyrone in jail and Harry and Marion desperate for a fix - their dance with depravity is inevitable.Make no mistake - ""Requiem For A Dream"" will literally heave you through the deepest, darkest vortex of anguish and despair.  Take it from me - I was thoroughly distraught and emotionally drained when the end credits finally rolled.  I even noticed how irritable I felt and how easy it was for me to get upset.  The film so profoundly affected me that it put me in a completely different state of mind; it actually made me feel quite miserable.  While this may be a filmmaker's vital objective, it is not necessarily the greatest thing to gain from it (as I found out for myself).  Even the score is devoid of hope; it is neither beautiful nor enchanting in the least.  In fact, listening to the score itself for a prolonged period is about as hard to take as the film.  Built on an electronica foundation with intermittent segments by the Kronos String Quartet, composer Clint Mansell's compositions are hip and moody sonatas signaling impending doom.Director Darren Aronofsky has reappointed many of his collaborators from ""Pi"", including nearly half his producers, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and composer Clint Mansell.  Aronofsky's vision is perfectly melded with Libatique's inimitable cinematography, providing a feast for the senses.  Using techniques such as jump cuts, peephole magnification, mounted POV cameras and simultaneous uses of time-lapse film and slow-motion frames, Aronofsky gives the viewer a glimpse of the paranoia and euphoria of the characters' highs and lows.  He even gives the time of day a distinct aura; daylight is calm and celestial, while evening is foreboding and dangerous.  Most interesting are the rapid fragments of film we see as the addicts use their drug of choice.  The jump cuts of a butane lighter, boiling heroin, rolled dollar bills, anthills of cocaine that abruptly disappear and the dilated pupils of the user lead to the all- consuming narcotic rapture.  The only thing that becomes tiresome is the loud and embellished whooshing noise that accompanies each jump cut.  Of course, this was probably added to convey the ""rush"" the addict is feeling.Jared Leto is undaunted and slightly disarming as Harry, but his character is hard to sympathize with since he does nothing to help himself or others.  So goes it with Jennifer Connelly as the sleepwalking Marion, a bold beauty that lives only for the moment.  She and Harry latch on to one other in a seemingly devotional manner, but the truth is that their only bond lies in their drive for perpetual sedation. Leto has been in a string of films (both TV and big screen), having made his biggest impression in 1999's ""Fight Club"" as a bleach-blonde devotee to Tyler Durden's detrimental campaign.  Connelly has done much in the industry but her previous roles have left her undistinguished in the eyes of critics.  Since projects such as ""Dark City"", ""Higher Learning"" and ""Waking The Dead"", Connelly has reemerged and proven to be a commanding presence onscreen.  Sara's downfall is the most heartbreaking to witness for she is really the only character that can be sympathized with.  As well as undergoing emotional overhauls for her character, Burstyn endured several physical transformations, all of which entailed four prosthetic necks, two fat suits and nine wigs.  Her final scenes as a cadaverous and delusional Sara are a wonder to behold, Burstyn luminous in all of her character's madness.  Aronofsky personally said of Burstyn's performance, ""What can I say, she's unbelievable.  I hope that audiences will feel they've been robbed by Hollywood, a business that has not hired this woman for twenty years. It's almost a crime on the world because of her abilities.&quot;  I echo Aronofsky's sentiments and say that while Julia Roberts was impressive in Steven Soderbergh's little doozy ""Erin Brockovich"", Burstyn was SORELY UNDERRATED.""Requiem For A Dream"" is not only to be appreciated for its artistry but for tackling an addiction that few of us really understand: FOOD.  The floating mirages of cupcakes, sizzling steaks and such may be humorous to some people, but for others it is inexplicable torture.  To tackle the obsession the world has with physical appearance is a topic that few have endeavored to render onto film and Aronofsky does a terrific job interpreting the anguish that obese people endure every minute of their lives.  Here's some encouragement for those who question watching this dour ditty: Burstyn was nominated for Best Actress in twelve different festivals (including the Oscars and the Golden Globes) and Matthew Libatique won an Independent Spirit Award for his cinematography.  Warning to those who expect an uplifting denouement: stray far from this film - it will take you down with it."	5.0	Nightmarish Jaunt Into Despair	2001-06-13	11	9	2

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	"Having Attention Deficit Disorder may not be required when watching ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but it probably helps.  If being bombarded with many of the same images throughout the film isn't enough to make you feel this way, then the onslaught of style over substance--sped up action, rotating cameras, fisheye lenses, split screen effects--that stands in for a compelling plot will.  Based on the 1970s novel of the same title, ""Requiem for a Dream"" chronicles the predictable downward spiral of several characters whose otherwise empty lives revolve around drugs of one kind or another.  The most interesting of them is a diet-obsessed TV junkie (Ellen Burstyn, who rather disturbingly resembles ""Three's Company""'s Mrs. Roper here)--we see her devolve into a hideous sketch of her former self with the help of physician-endorsed speed.  By comparison, the troubles of blank-faced co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans seem trivial and almost a distraction.  I'm probably just too old to be moved by it all; overwrought sequences of people lazing about, freaking out while searching for their next fix, or turning to one form of human degradation or another in desperation just seem cliched and emotionally sterile, perhaps because I still remember ""Gridlock'd,"" ""Trainspotting,"" ""Naked Lunch"" and ""Drugstore Cowboy.""  Nonetheless, I'm guessing younger people will be pretty impressed, and to be fair, the acting and technical tricks occasionally almost make up for the low budget and paper-thin story.  The soundtrack by Kronos Quartet is also sufficiently hip and brooding to match the mood of the film, but mute the sound during any of the repetitive ""getting high"" or ""tripping bad"" scenes and see if it still seems like something meaningful is going on.  While I saw the unedited version, I'm stumped as to what was deemed the equivalent of ""NC-17"" material, as there's nothing here I haven't seen on HBO--ratings nowadays really do seem rather arbitrary."	3.0	M'eh . . .

Truly a touching movie that you will stay alive in your mind as one of the best movies ever.  Exceptional performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly.  Marlon Wayans was as expected, but still superb.  His history as playing more of a comedic role in films has effected the way I look at him now because his performance was well done, although of the 4 characters, he had the least lines.  But he proved that he can play a serious role in a movie.Watching this film has made me more aware of addictions in life.  There are drugs out there that are invisible.  Perhaps dreams are the cause for overdosage.  Throughout the film, Aronofsky presents multiple scenes where the character appears one way (depressed or not as alive) before taking whatever drug, then presents the character in a different way--happier, more lively.  And each time you see this sequence, you see the character's dream slowly fading away.This film has impacted me more than any other film and is rated my #1 choice.  I recommend this movie to everybody.  This is truly a must see.  After watching it, it will have made a mark somewhere within you.	5.0	Mark This Movie	2003-08-08	4	3	1

Marlon Waylons also gave a great performance as Harry's best freind, he shows us in his performance that he can truly act. And then there's Harry's girlfreind played by Jennifer Connelly in a risky role that will do anything for her next fix. This is one of the most realistic, depressing movies i've ever seen.

First off, Darren Aronofsky is an AMAZING director. The brilliant camera work helped create the frantic mood of the climax of the film. The acting was also very very good. Ellen Burstyn's performance was fantastic as a hopeless widow who has very little reason to live until her life becomes consumed by drugs. Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waylans, and Jared Leto also had powerful performances as addicts who just wanted to find true happiness. This film is graphic, disturbing, emotional, violent....and brilliant. Warning: this film is NOT for casual movie fans who want a Hollywood film.

And even if you're one of the those clamoring over each other on the worship bandwagon, can you honestly say this is something you like owning and watching more than once?  Even in its best lights, this film is very draining to watch and doesn't count anywhere near repeated entertainment value in my book.  As for its vaunted theme, is it really &quot;drugs are bad&quot;?  I'm not convinced, but since that seems to be the concensus, my two cents on that note: duh.Ignore the hype and try to see a clip of this nightmare-on-a-disc before you shell out the bucks.  Chances are that'll give you a good feel for whether it really will be a keeper for you (though my money's on not).This is a good film to help push you over the edge in your darker moments, or as a shining example of why Aronofsky's work is so overrated.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A6R8XUE6MJLMC	Stuart Winer	This film belongs in the category of great-cinema-experiments.  Darren Aronofsky's main work here is about cinematography and emotional tone and the powerful haunting soundtrack.  All these factors were just brilliantly done and very moving as were many scenes which portray mental and emotional collapse. These people are down to their last mental threads - their desolation is total and very compelling.Unfortunately the plot and character development here are just too flat to really allow this film to be truly great. Instead it becomes just stark, powerful art-house verite' - not quite a full entertainment.The chief flaw is that we just don't really know the characters very well, so that when they slip into self-destruction and despair it doesn't have the impact that it should.  We can imagine their suffering - they're all terrific actors..but I didn't really feel them - they weren't full, real people to me.Maybe it's that Jared and Marlon were just unrepentant junkies.  Could they maybe have aspired to become real people?  They were flat, empty shells for years before the movie started, so we never see their decline - they were always worthless, and cruel to say, they got what was coming to them.  I don't mean that I enjoyed their demise, but I found it hard to care about them - they were long gone before the story started and were actively digging their own graves.Jennifer Connelly, however, was really heartbreaking. She's just luminous - I have a thing for her - .  Her acting is completely transparent to me such that I feel I'm looking right through her body and witnessing her hurting spirit.Watching her repeatedly trade sex for drugs was very ugly and disturbing - like a voluntary rape.  It hurt to watch.  So few can tug the hard wiring in the back of the mind that way...she is truly gifted..at least with me.Darren Arranofsky really needs a collaborator to meet his full potential.  I hope he finds him.  Otherwise he'll continue to be an art-house ingenue - and that would be a real shame.	4.0	Great Flawed Movie	2004-04-03	1	1	0

This is the only purpose I see of this movie. Somehow it slipped into mainstream and commercial cinema.

The only scene that was moving was when the mother played by Ellen Burstyn describes to her son how lonely she is, at a breaking-point scene in the movie. I also liked the way the T.V health-show was shown in the movie. How ridiculously and foolishly addictive people are in these shows. And what a let-down by Jennifer Connolly for doing such a role and appearing in all those nude scenes. I wonder what made her accept such an role.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A8QCB68UL50NX	Subterranean	"When it gets rolling, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is perhaps the most difficult movie to watch in the history of film.  This is nominally a movie about addiction.  The four main characters each have their own drug problems - three out of four are addicted to heroin, and the last (Ellen Burstyn in a heartbreaking performance) to metamphetamine crash diet pills.  But this is not just a drug movie.  No, the truth is in the title - this is a movie about people whose dreams, simple harmless fantasies, are completely destroyed.  As such, the movie is ugly, unflinching and sometimes painful to watch.  If you have the slightest amount of humanity, you will feel the characters' despair as your own.A large amount of the credit for this goes to great performances from actors who don't normally get such good roles - you can feel the desperation in each of them, their performances are so scarily plausible.  Watching each deteriorate into their own mental and physical hell is the part of the impact of the movie, and each pulls it off nicely.  The remainder of the credit is divided between director Darren Aronofsky, whose brilliant experimental style plants you in the characters' psyche, and Clint Mansell, whose score alternates between an elegaic string part (which has now been used in everything from car commercials to the trailer for the Lord of The Rings trilogy) and pounding, incessant techno, both of which serve to emphasize the numerous forms of agony that are central to the film.Is it easy to watch?  No.  The drug use is more graphic than anything seen on film before (including Trainspotting), there is  intense violence and a sex scene which is both physically and morally sickening.  For what it is, is it perfect?  No.  Both Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly are forced to work with characters that are slightly underdrawn in favor of the admittedly more powerful stories of Jared Leto's and Ellen Burstyn's roles.  But is it compelling? Yes.  Important? Yes.  This movie will stay with you for the rest of your life.  I can think of no better way to persuade someone to never, ever do drugs in their lifetime than showing them this film.  It's that powerful."	4.0	Shock Therapy	2006-02-18	6	4	2

This movie while highly praised by most reviewers left me cold. Ellen Burstyn's perfomance as an elderly diet pill addict while excellent is not something that I go to the movies to see. Jared Leto was unmemorable. Marlon Wayans was good but I liked him better in ""Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood."" Now that was an entertaining movie-going experience. The achingly beautiful Jennifer Connelly is completed wasted in this movie. Her performance as a junkie who sinks into prostitution to support her habit is excellent. My real complaint is with director Aronofsky. The ""genius"" auteur Aronovsky put Connelly's unique talent in a sexual role; he demeans her with a disgusting lesbian sex-show scene but doesn't even give the viewer a glimpse of Connelly's beautiful breasts. Hubert Selby, the author of the book upon which this movie is based has a cameo role as prison guard which would have ruined the movie for movie if ten other things hadn't already ruined the movie for me."	3.0	Disturbing	2003-07-22	17	2	15

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ATZ0A2BFXPVXH	"""sunvolt99"""	This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, well-paced, and artistically sound, laced with subtle, sardonic humor and perceptive social commentary amid the tragedies of its characters.  Those few negative reviews which argue the movie is hollow at its core are inaccurate--the movie clearly shows the value of loving human relationships and how their loss causes and results from those things we use to numb ourselves--not only illegal drugs, but also tv, game shows, and food.I recognized a number of people in this movie, some who have been mentally ill and others who have watched TV too much.  I can't help but think I'm implicated in the movie in several ways, or have been in various parts of my life...This movie is an absolute masterpiece which, unlike shallow, fast-food quality movies like &quot;Traffic&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, actually powerfully shows meaningful, perceptive connections between drug culture and the larger culture with which it interacts and from which it springs.True, the movie was at times shocking, but never gratuitously, in my opinion (unlike the vulgar, silly &quot;Magnolia&quot; or even the relentlessly hopeless, nasty and brutal &quot;Amores Perros.&quot;)  This movie, in little hints and clues, like the main character's desperate call to his girlfriend at the end, or the embrace between Ellen Burstyn and her friend, shows the value of love, something which our culture's materialism and intoxication often leaves behind...	5.0	Brilliantly intelligent and artistically sound	2001-07-01	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1OV4X8F55C3B5	Supa da licious	This is by far the most depressing and disturbing movie I have ever seen. I honestly can't say that I liked Requiem for a Dream but at the same time it is a brilliant picture. Anyone who gets joy from watching this is insane. Period. Why is this a brilliant picture then? Because it does exactly what it was meant to do: Show the horrible downward spiral of substance abuse. The worst part is that you grow to like these characters and sympathize with them. In fact, the characters are so likable that its like watching one of your friends throw their lives away. Why anyone would want to experience something like that on film....I don't know...but like I said it's brilliant and will leave you more depressed than anything else you've ever seen on film.	4.0	Not for the weak hearted	2002-12-24	3	2	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A5UMUVEV1RUS9	SuperJenn	Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies you'll never forget, yet you'll want to watch it again. Maybe not immediately after you just watched it. The subject matter is hard to swallow as it is depressing, but just so beautifully and brilliantly portrayed. The characters are all doomed and there is nothing you can do but sit back and watch them spiral out of control. Requiem, in addition to an incredible cast, features outstanding cinematography reminiscent of Drugstore Cowboy (and if you look at my review for Drugstore Cowboy, I think I mentioned something along those lines) but I'm happy to see that kind of inspiration shine through so successfully in another film. To me, one of the most touching scenes in this movie is when Harry's mother gets taken to the hospital for her diet/speed pill addiction and her friends from the apartments come to visit her. When they show the friends outside on the bench, crying and hugging, every single time I see it, I cry. Everyone in this movie does such an amazing job at making this seem very, very real and anything but a dream. Don't miss this movie! If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.	5.0	One of the best movies anywhere.	2006-01-18	3	2	1

Forget happiness, this is the most depressing movie ever. With that said, I still feel as if I am a better person for having seen this. I've told every single one of my friends to see this movie and not one person has ever been touched by the movie. The book and soundtrack are amazing as well. The visual techniques, specifically the sequences where they do the heroin/coke/smoke the pot are out of this world. They show the same repetitive sequence throughout the movie, showing the depths of addiction. What unnerved me the most was the tragic descent of ellyn burstyn and her addiction to diet pills. The shock treatment at the end and how horrible she looked just left my stomach in a knot. Every actor/actress in this movie gives a career defining performance, even jennifer connoly (of Labyrinth fame).  This movie is memorizing. This and crouching tiger hidden dragon were hands down some of the best, most original movies to come out in the last 10 years, more so than the matrix, more so than fight club, they have redefined cinema. Darren Aronofsky has a very bright future ahead of him.

The frequent graphic depiction of drug use, mainly use of heroin is seen throughout the film. The disturbing nasty addiction of diet pills is seen as well, as well as nightmarish flashbacks. I was so disturbed and distraught.The film depicts the lives of four individuals, whose drug problems ulitmately lead them into a down-ward spiral into hell. Literally I mean that.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1XLU7SVFO3CME	Sweet Revelation	"I had a couple of friends at school mention a certain scene from this movie and from that point on, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy. With the confusion on what this movie was about in the first place, I decided I had to figure the film out for myself. I was surprised to find it was a thoughtful, captivating movie that was about addiction, but delved much deeper than that.Requiem for a Dream is a novel by author Hubert Selby Jr., written about the story of 4 characters in search of their own ""American Dream"". They are so jaded to what's going on in their lives and the path they're taking, each character experiences a type of addiction. For example, Harry's mother, Sarah Goldfarb, she is addicted to the television and later on ""diet pills"". Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel is able to connect to people through the characters in Requiem for a Dream that are so vulnerable to elements around them, when all they want to do is achieve something in today's society.I believe that some people will be turned off by certain graphic scenes in Requiem for a Dream, but you have to remember that part of this book is about the addiction and dealing of drugs. The life of a user is not visually pretty, it does not make you feel emotionally at ease. The reason this movie is so powerful is because it causes you to feel so deeply about what you're experiencing and what the characters are experiencing in this movie. Requiem for a Dream should end and cause you to feel pity for Harry, his girlfriend Marion, Sarah Goldfarb and Tyrone, no matter how against drug use you are. I'm a strong advocate against drug use, but seeing such horrific stories makes you feel such deep pity for the characters.I suggest that anyone interested in visually interesting movies to see Requiem for a Dream. It's dark and moody, fitting the story's whole plot. I suggest those who love a film with a good soundtrack to either watch Requiem for a Dream or to simply buy the soundtrack. It's main track, Summer Overture, has been used in such pieces of work as Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers movie trailer and various others.I also suggest to anyone who's looking for a straight out pleasing, entertaining, gut-wrenching, tear jerking, all over surprising, spectacular and brilliant film to go and either rent or buy Requiem for a Dream."	5.0	Both Visually and Emotionally Stunning.	2006-12-08	6	5	1

Well, not entirely...But this is one of the few movies that had me just sitting in the dark when it was over, numb and overwelmed. The final 3-4 minutes of this film are so intense it would be hard to believe anyone could turn away; Yet this beautifully acted, sharply put together drug-love-tragedy doesn't end well for anyone, and will likely have a profound effect on those who make it to the end. Burstyn, like Keitel in 'Bad Lieutenant', throws herself into her part, devoid of any vanity or worry about how she looks on film. It is a brave, heartbreaking performance that remains one of the most unforgettable ones in recent film history. Everyone shines in this movie, and while the editing was an annoyance for some, I found it appropriate for the film...Strap yourself in and get ready to be be floored and depressed...But in a good way.	5.0	You'll Never Forget It	2007-04-21	6	5	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP	Takis Tz.	The reasons this movie is brilliant are -in my opinion- not easily graspable for most people. This becomes more obvious if one reads some of the negative reviews here at Amazon.I read here in some reviews that this movie is poor because...it's depressive! Since when do films need to be cheery to be good? Is life that way? Is reality, anybody's reality that way? I read in other reviews that this film is not good because &quot;there's no message involved&quot; or because &quot;there's no ethics defended&quot;. I really fail to understand such mindsets. This film is a depiction of reality, a very particular reality, that of people being addicted to heavy drugs and the lives they lead. THAT is the message. It's simply a raw depiction of a specific reality that millions of people (esp. in the west) are experiencing daily. Now, as far as &quot;ethics&quot; are concerned, i'll say this: if the director endulged in some heavy pedagogic diatribe via this film to tell us that &quot;drugs can be dangerous for you&quot; i'd simply say &quot;duh&quot; and watch something else. Besides, he does show that in a more than obvious way. But thankfully, he doesnt attempt to shove an agenda down our throats.Now to the film itself: I'd already been super-impressed with the director's previous film (the equally brilliant &quot;Pi&quot;) so i was more than intrigued about this one.I was rewarded again by Aronofsky as a viewer. This film has great camera work (it's through and through cutting edge stuff visually) , great acting, minimal but efficient dialogue,and an absolutely superb conceptual soundtrack (most of it is based on one theme).It surely is hardcore in its visuals but there's more quality here to be discovered as the director doesnt try to impress with cheap and unrealistic scenes. There's nothing in the film that's over the top or exaggerated and that might sound as self-understood but there are more than enough films with a drug theme that stretch things to extremes visually as if depicting things realistically isn't overwhelming enough.No need to describe the plot as 10s of other reviews have already done so, so I'll simply reccommend this film (as many others did too) to anybody with a passion for groundbreaking cinema. Extra kudos for Burstyn's performance which is definately show-stealing but even more credits for the fact that &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; doesn't merely stay on the illegal drug scene but takes a hard stab at the legal drugs. Legal they may be, but there's literally millions of people battling serious addictions from them and they continue to be prescribed massively nevertheless.An ode to antihypocrisy as well as great filmwork.	5.0	Original, cliche-sparing drugavaganza...	2004-02-23	0	0	0

It is one of those movies that sticks with you for days, weeks, months, and years after you watch it. As you watch it, you become hypnotized and can't think of anything but this blur of images pounding on your brain, one image after another. It is an experience like no other.Requiem For A Dream, based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr.,  is the story of 4 people; A woman, her son, his girlfriend, and his best friend. This woman, Sarah Goldfarb, played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the lonely, T.V. addicted mother of Harry Goldfarb, played by Jared Leto, a drug addict who wants to make it big in the dealing business, Tyrone C. Love, played surprisingly well by Marlon Wayans, his best friend and partner in crime who misses his dear mother, and Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver,  played well, as usual, by Jennifer Connolly, a severely depressed artist who plans on starting her own business.During the summer, everything was perfect; Harry and Tyrone were making hard cash, Marion had ideas for her store, and Sarah had a place in the sun outside with the other old ladies of the apartment building. Life was sublime. Total bliss. Then Sarah recieves a phone call from her favorite game show, which says that she is going to become a contestant. She is very excited, not knowing that she will never ACTUALLY be on the show. She decides she is going to wear her favorite red dress but cannot fit into it. After several diets, she decides to try diet pills.Then comes the winter. Harry and Tyrone's business is failing due to a shortage of drugs and money to buy drugs. The money gradually disappears, and everything falls apart. Now Harry, Tyrone, and Sarah are all hopelessly addicted and dependent on drugs. Marion is performing sexual favors for people in order to make money for Harry's business. All this leads up to a disturbing and shocking conclusion. This movie is truly a masterpiece.This movie is the one thing that really convinced me, never in my life, to do drugs.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; should be required viewing for those high-school poseurs who think drugs are hip and cool.  If the film's final 30 minutes don't discourage you from a life of drugs and addiction, then you are simply insane.  A great, career-reviving performance from Ellen Burstyn, and Jaerd Leto and Marlon Wayans are in top form as well.  The DVD has features galore, including a commentary, interviews, trailers, and a making-of featurette.  Not for the fainthearted.	4.0	Trippy but powerful	2001-10-10	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AP9TSAQICVEVT	The Ion	This film tells the story of four main characters, each of which becomes addicted to drugs and suffers the consequences.The main character,his girlfriend and friend are addicted to illlicit narcotics, in the fictitious universe in which this film is set these become harder to come by as the film goes on, their search for a new 'score' leads each of the three into their own personal hell, the hells are physical, spiritual and sexual respectively. However terrible their fates are, the sympathy evinced at their plights pales compared to that evoked by the suffering of the fourth victim - the main characters' mother who unlike them is perhaps completely innocent and blameless for her addiction to legal medicines over-prescribed to her by her unscrupulous doctor. Her hell is mental.Extremely harsh, pessimistic and fatalistic throughout, the film takes the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster as we watch inevitably as their lives are torn to pieces. The world minus the four characters is extremely callous and unmerciful, from the opportunistic 'John' who trades the girl drugs for sexual humiliation to the hospital medic who deliberately misleads the mentally obliterated woman into signing a form allowing them to pulverise her brain with (perhaps) unnecessary shock treatment to the redneck doctor (the film is very harsh towards the medical profession) who instead of treating the main character Harry for gangrene has him jailed instead. The acting is superb (particularly the old lady and the young woman) throughout and the soundtrack is excellent, chirpy jarring violins evoke sentiments of melancholy and an impending crescendo of doom. The director uses some innovative methods, the quick flashing images of pupils dilating and chemicals being sucked down a syringe and the slow motion effects used to portray the feeling of being drugged are very effective particularly.This film is also perfectly titled (ok credit to the author not the film), a requiem is a prayer for the dead/a dream is hope for a new beginning, the film leaves us in absolutely no doubt which of the two is most appropriate here. I  admired the careful interlocution between sickly melancholic fantasy and terrible crushing reality in the lives of the four characters. You may feel for these characters long after you have left the cinema, sadly i recognise one of them.	5.0	Haunting, superbly acted	2005-03-10	7	5	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	I'm not sure why anyone would want to watch this movie more than once.  As great as it documents the hellish descent of four people into various drug addictions, it can't possibly be an enjoyable entertainment experience.  That said, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM stands along with DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES as a gripping film that bares all the pain and sadness of characters who fall victim to their vices.The cast is wonderful, especially the ladies.  Jennifer Connelly continues to rack up her impressive resume, and Ellen Burnstyn commits to film one of the bravest performances I've ever seen.After catching this film again on the Independent Film Channel just now, I've switched over to a news program where the talking heads are discussing legalizing drugs.  The smarter people know how deadly drugs can be, and the more cynical can shrug dope off as another method of natural selection, but the drug problem in this country--whether crack or pills or whatever--is a poison seeping into all of our lives.I know people who have died of drugs and, sadly, I know a few more who will.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is the kind of drug movie people need to see.	4.0	Disturbing and Important	2005-10-25	8	7	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AC2MN8QHY93SI	The Man	"Requiem For A Dream is one of those movies that claims it's twisted, anti-wholesome movie, tactics convert to a work of art. While most movies that fall into this category, do this with ease, Requiem will leave you with such a bleek and depressing outlook, that you will soon forget the redeeming qualities it posseses. This movie follows 4 connected people as they build fantasies in their minds of a happily ever after world, and how drugs destroy these fantasies. By the time these characters realize that these fantasies are exactly that: fantasies, it is too late. Each one has drifted away from the others, and fallen into a whole new world of horror. The movies ends there, and leaves you shocked, tongue out, and grim. This movie plays like a long tunnel that in which these characters see light, but at the end, after pain, suffering, and turmoil, there is nothing but a dead end.This movie gave me the closest thing to nightmares, that I've had in years, feeling grim and self-possesed to never let what happened to these characters happen to you. In this way, the way that this movie plays with your deepest darkest emotions, it shows signs of a masterpiece, yet I am too numb to see the beauty in it.If anything, this movie is an excellent way to keep kids away from drugs. One viewing of this movie, is guranteed to be the equivalent of a million anti-drug campaigns. This is not to be shown to anyone under 13-14 though. Teenagers who see this movie must be mature, and learn from the themes presented.In the end, if I haven't intrigued you enough, see this movie because it is different. I watched this movie alone, after my girlfriend had brought over Legally Bonde a couple hours earlier. As you can imagine the transition is stifling.Proceed with caution-this is one of those ""outlook on life distorting"" movies similar to The Matrix and Fight Club.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director:  Darren AronofskyCast:  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Janet Sarno.Running Time:  102 minutesRated R for intense depiction of drug addiction, graphic sexuality, strong language and some violence.""Requiem for a Dream"" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it is family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favorite red dress, which she wore to her sun's graduation, on television; however, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at; Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high'; all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.  Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast that some viewers may find it hard to keep up, and it will literally take your breath away when the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that audiences haven't felt much since ""American Beauty"" and ""American History X"".  As the title indicates, ""Requiem for a Dream"" does not contain a happy ending. It is in no way optimistic and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness; however, it does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety. It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies."	4.0	Requiem for a Dream  (2000)	2006-01-18	2	1	1

If you buy it and proceed to watch it, look closely at what makes the characters feel good. If you have watched it, remember why Harry's mom wanted to be thin, go into it. Remember what Maryann told Harry in the first half, what he made her feel like. And of course, remember Tyrone's ""flashbacks.""  Finally, remember the guys at the party with ""maid maryann.""

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AXLTOG3Y6AHWR	tijikja	This film begins innocuously enough but gradually becomes somewhat difficult to endure, and this is intentional.  Aronofsky has masterfully woven the visual, aural and thematic threads of Requiem into a tight, captive dynamic meant to be as excruciating for the viewer as it is for the characters.  (Ever wonder what Alex in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was being forced to watch?)  Yet the consensus seems to be that this is primarily an anti-drug film, the bad taste it leaves in your mouth is explained as some kind of &quot;scare-you-straight&quot; tactic employed by the director.  Don't believe it, drugs are a sidelight here.  Which is not to downplay the devastation they wreak on the lives portrayed.  But the truly frightening aspect of Requiem is the hollow relationships on display even before drug addiction becomes the uncontested villain.  We begin at zero humanity-wise and it progressively gets worse, relationships that cannot stand on their own are actually reinforced (in that emotional interaction/bonding occurs) precisely because drugs introduce a sick passion, a direction for lost souls to pursue.  When a certain character takes to turning tricks for her fixes, it makes her less ambiguous; she finally has something engaging to do.  Each character has some kind of self-prescribed or imposed deficiency that precedes and exacerbates his/her drug problem.  This alienation is the most realistic aspect of the film, not the depths they sink to.  The bleakness, the oppressive absence of connectedness, almost makes their flight into oblivion understandable.  The most disconcerting aspect of Requiem for a Dream is what we allow it to show us about the things we value.  Recommended, but not for everyone.	4.0	not so fast...	2001-11-26	2	1	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2QSN9JTY9CLDW	Tim Bare	Requiem for a Dream is one of the best movies of the last decade, and possibly even in the history of cinema. It is a movie that speaks to the soul, a film that connects with the deepest stirrings of humanity that every man, woman, and child harbors within them. It is not a fun movie; by no means is this a piece of entertainment. But it is art, a powerful, engaging, harrowing piece of art that will be remembered for its brutality and honesty for years to come.The film follows four people in Brooklyn, all in some way trapped in addiction: Sara, a middle-aged woman who gets a call that she is going to be on television, and in an effort to reclaim a time of lost happiness, goes on diet pills to fit into the dress she wore at her son's graduation; Harry, her son, who has become addicted to heroin after high school and quests with his friend Tyrone to get a pound of uncut heroin; the aforementioned Tyrone, who has slipped into drugs to remember the comfort of his dead mother; and Marion, Harry's girlfriend, who slips into sexual decadence to get money for her addiction as Tyrone and Harry's plan falls through. The four begin at a stage when everything is easy, and slowly they spiral into the hell of addiction, always clinging to the hope that it will be as good as it once was.The movie is beautifully shot, with Aronofsky's trademark rapid montage style being used to good effect here. The score is one of the best I've ever heard, played to perfection by the impeccable Kronos Quartet. And the acting, my god, the acting.Each of the principal performers gives a tour de force performance, truly capturing the joy and despair of addiction.As Aronofsky himself said of Hubert Selby, Jr., the author of the novel on which this film is based, there is light and darkness. And this film is about the darkness. But its there, with a flashlight, searching for our humanity in that darkness. And that is the kind of film any filmmaker should aspire to make.	5.0	This is storytelling	2004-08-24	5	4	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ZYH9XRO507OB	"""time-traveller"""	That right there is proof that this masterpiece goes beyond the realm of conventionalism. Pi was disturbing enough but this takes the cake. There isn't a positive &quot;eighth-note throughout this tune!&quot; Drugs, prescription or illegal, and the ignorance of self-inflicted deathwish and utopic pipedreams governs this mental mind-f**k from start to finish. Definitely, a keeper. Avant-garde at its best but still stands alone within the avalanche of Hollywood-made drug movies that infiltrate today's theaters. Excellent work from veteran actress Burstyn and Connelly who's addiction that's her to a new level. Not for your ignorant and/or conventional movie fan.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ATEUDGGU80IYA	Tim __Miller	This is the single most vehement argument for not using drugs that I've ever experienced. This should be a requirement for every high school student. More shocking than *warning Spoiler* the amputated arm, or the self-deprecating sex, or the whole prison thing, was the loss of sanity by the well meaning mother whose addiction shifts from watching TV, to food, to her weight loss pills/speed, to her final obsession of a perfect life. The feeling of hollowness that is evident after watching this movie is translated to the viewer most effectively by the continuation of all the characters misery. This is left undefined and entirely to the viewer's now brutal imagination.This all being said this is a brilliantly filmed movie that is most certainly worth watching even if you have already decided on your opinion of drugs. It may be hard however, to see it twice. This is just a testament to how well the message comes across the first time.I highly recomend this movie (not literally, in fact I know people that have freaked out hardcore doing just that.)	5.0	Needle Drugs?

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3I2GBE2KGQV1U	"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley"""	This is a film where the low-minded go in, joking about its &quot;adult&quot; nature, hoping to see some good skinny.  When they come out, though, they shut their mouths and try to hold back the sobs.Yes, this film went unrated.  Yes, there is an explicit sex scene.  Now that that's out of the way, we move on.This is also easily the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, chronicling the downfall of a small group of Coney Island residents, due to their despairs and their addictions.  Springboarding off of the novel by Hubert Selby Jr, director Darren Aronofski picks up where he left off with &quot;Pi,&quot; using the camera to express the mental phases of it's characters.  Consider a scene in which a character is dealing with the conflicting effects of taking uppers and downers at the same time.  As we watch through a distorted lens, everyone around her speeds up and slows down at random, creating a disjointed effect.Playing with speed and sound may seem a bit gimmicky to some, but no one can possibly doubt the power of Ellen Burstyn's performance.  As she plays out her characters descent, there were many times I forced myself to remember:  &quot;It's only an act.  She's really just fine.&quot;  Also of note is Marlon Wayons.  Yes, *that* Marlon Wayons.  This is his first truly serious role (please, don't tell me you count &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; as serious!), and he does it with aplomb.  I hope we see more of him!Oh, and that score!  Clint Mansell (&quot;Pi,&quot; &quot;Resident Evil&quot;) along with the Kronos Quartet create a plodding, relentless, yet mesmerizing score, which only underlines the fact that this story can only go one direction.&quot;Why would anyone want to see a film that's so effectively depressing,&quot; you may be asking by now.  Easy:  this is as bad as it gets.  No matter where you are in life, if you can rent a video you most likely are not this bad off.

The music, direction, acting, dialogue, photography,...Saying something or repeating the story would ruin the experience.  You all should rent it (or better, buy it so that later on, you could watch it again which is recommended) so you can see a real disturbing yet beautifull movie.  From the beginning, you know this movie isn't going to have a happy end.  Which is a good thing, because the movie's purpose is to shock and let you behind with a sense of ""what the hell have i seen?"".  Although the rating seems to say this isn't for all ages (there are some scenes which could be rated 16 or older, but only for these scenes in theory contain nudity or foul language or else), i think that it would be a great idea to show this movie in schools where teachers would like to organise an afternoon about ""being against drugs"". Because when you have seen this movie, you are definitely going to think twice when someone asks you if you want to have a joint or something else.  The most effective anti-drugs movie for years to come, with enough in it to satisfy the most movielovers.Now, I hope that I have made you curious.  Make sure that you see this one.  It doesn't happen much that I rate a movie 5 stars, but this one deserves it all the way.P.S. : the fact that i don't mention anything about the story itself or other things, i really don't want to spoil anything by saying ""in this scene this"" or ""in that scene that"", i fully understand this movie but I believe you should watch this unprepared.

It has a very original feel to it and it will keep your interest throughout the whole movie, with a few neat surprises but sometimes I feel this movie is just a tad overrated when I read other people's opinions.  It goes without question that its a 4 star movie, maybe 4.5 but 5 is pushing it.  I saw the edited version but I didn't know it was edited (I rented it) until I turned it on, and now I wished I had seen the unedited version.  As I mentioned in the subject it does get a little artsy at times, especially when it comes to not actually showing anyone take drugs (except for the guy's mother).  Instead they use a quick 5sec piece of random drug related images in double speed to respresent when they take drugs so the fact that they are borderline junkies is assumed but not actually fortified visually.	4.0	Interesting, but sometimes more artsy than entertaining	2001-05-25	1	0	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2AEEHFCTNBEIN	"TritoneAngel ""tritoneangel"""	"A powerful and graphic depiction of the horrific experience of addiction, Requiem for a Dream leaves the viewer shocked and painfully enthralled. Director Darren Aronofsky's genius shows throughout the film with his unique and arresting style of capturing the painful stories of his four protagonists, most famously in the specific story of Ellen Burstyn's obsessive and disintegrating character.  Critics argue that a viewer knows the end as soon as the movie begins -- that the lesson will be the tired ""drugs are bad"" after-school special message.  However, to dismiss this film in such a simplistic way deprives the viewer of the overwhelming experience of the film's engrossing story.  Each and every scene fills the viewer with emotion without fail, from terror to suspense to despair.  While film students may revel at the artistic use of various cinematic techniques, the amateur viewer appreciates each and every pan, split-screen and rapid-fire cuts that all serve a directly applicable purpose to the plot element they serve to illustrate.  The real message of this film, as Aronofsky himself says, is that hope itself can become the most dangerous of all addictions when it is allowed to dissassociate from reality.  Dark, dingy and desperate, Requiem for a Dream gives every moviegoer an unforgettable experience and for viewers like me, who love the sugarless realism of an unhappy ending, a stunning look into a brilliantly constucted cinematic world of misery.  Those viewers searching for a revelation about the dangers of drugs will not find it here.  However, those viewers seeking the experience of a brilliantly directed movie with an unforgettable story and haunting moments at every turn will see this nightmarish film as a dream come true."	5.0	Powerful, pessimistic, and memorable	2002-10-04	3	2	1

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3HKVQURDD7MCB	"T.S. ""La Maquina Del Sexo"""	Let me start off by imploring you to get this version, the director's cut, if (hopefully when) you choose to get this movie.  The rated version leaves out a few minutes of the end, and since the director's cut is cheaper anyways, it should be a no-brainer.The story follows Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend, Marion, his best friend, Tyrone, and his mother, Sarah.  Harry abuses drugs with Tyrone and Marion while neglecting his relationship with his mother, only visiting her to steal and pawn her TV for drug money.  Eventually Harry and Tyrone explore the prospect of dealing heroin to get rich, and it works.  At first.  Meanwhile, Harry's mother finds out she's going to be on TV and grows ecstatic.  What program she's going to be on is never made clear to her, but she's determined to lose enough weight to fit into her favorite red dress and impress her friends on the show.  To make this happen, she turns to diet pills.  Problem is, they turn out to be amphetamines.Obviously there is no viable happy ending to any of these scenarios.  The characters have dug themselves into holes too deep to get out of and are left without the power to dig themselves out.  It's by how likeable they become throughout the film that makes the finale so incredibly moving.  This is most due to rock-solid performances from the cast.  Jared Leto plays Harry wonderfully and creates good chemistry with the rest of the cast.  Marlon Wayans takes a turn for the dramatic as Tyrone, Harry's closest confidant, and knocks the ball out of the park.  Jennifer Connelly is also noteworthy as Marion, the talented artist that just got lost along the way, but Ellen Burstyn is mesmerizing as Sarah Goldfarb.  Every note she hits as the doomed widow is perfection.  I'm now certain that she only lost the Oscar to Julia Roberts because of Julia's star power.The direction and cinematography are, as already mentioned by countless others, solid, but the best thing about the entire film is Clint Mansell's score and how well it accentuates the entire mood and atmosphere.  It's often very effective in amplifying the emotion of any given scene and giving the film a world of its own which is what makes the whole experience a triumph.	5.0	Best film I've ever seen	2005-07-24	3	2	1

There is nothing redeeming about this movie. You will watch people destroy their lives for two hours, and then the movie ends. I don't know what message the filmmaker is trying to make here, but the only thing I could make out is ""Drugs are Bad"". I've only been told the same thing over 1000 times throughout my childhood. Thanks for the original message, Mr. Director.Furthermore, this movie is very simplistic in how it portrays America's drug problem. Not every old lady who takes diet pills turns into a nutcase. Not every chick who uses H turns into a whore. Yet 100% of drug-using characters in this movie are destroyed by the drugs they take.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AZG1PVIQJY6IK	T.W Trotter	"As can be seen from the heated commentary copied here regarding the DVD version, this movie is guaranteed to evoke a passionate response from even the most jaded of moviegoers. This in essence is the movie that TRAFFIC should have been. Stylishly filmed, well written and superbly acted the film successfully takes the viewer into the addled lifestyle of substance abusers, chronicles the pitfalls and burnouts unsparingly and avoids cliche sentimentality. The characters are compelling and well written (and acted)and are most notable for their unsparing ambivilance for the welfare of themselves and others. As someone who works among addicts and abusers I immediately recognized the self-centred, self-deluding attitude in these characters that is the sine qua non of the junkies existence. Cinematically the movie is also breathtaking with its accelerated pace, thematic montages and its unsparing accuracy. Certainly not a movie for kids to watch without their parents; properly viewed this movie could be a very strong learning tool for those who find thereselves lured by drugs (of any kind). Furthermore the movie is a stunning condemnation of modern society's preoccupation with ""having it all now""..a promise that drugs (and the drug pushers)seem to offer to the unwary. Everyone in this movie is looking for the quick fix - money, fame, power, and all seek it through drugs, with devastating results.  There is no doubt that this is an entertaining, compelling and sobering film and I heartily recommend it. There is just one point that troubles me. Like its more milque-toast compatriot TRAFFIC this movie uses the example of a white woman having sex with a black man to mark the ultimate decline of the character. Now its clear that the act itself is centred around drugs, but the use of the ...black drug dealer as the emodiment of her demise is a little trite. It would have made it a stronger and more balanced film if the drug dealer had been white. The message would then be clear that it is the act and not who she does it with that marks her demise. Watch it yourself and see what I mean, but by all means watch it."	5.0	Requiem for a Lifestyle	2001-05-25	0	0	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A2ONGY8318SUN2	"""tyler16"""	This film is wonderful...its almost unbearable to watch Sweet old Ellen Burstyn become an abomination of drugs... or Jennifer Connely change from an aspiring dreamer to a dark trashy whore... just to feed her addiction. Or Jared Leto changing from loving son to barely even human. You just want to jump into the sceen and smack Ellen and Jennifer (especially) around until they come to their senses. Needless to say this is not a happy ending... in fact the director slaps the reality of them losing ALL of their hopes and dreams FOREVER right into your face with no remorse. They're gone and they can NEVER get them back. Seeing Ellen's friends crying on the bench makes us cry too... seeing jennifer cry in her bed where even there the nightmare's torment her. Bottom line is... Reqiuem for a dream is a wonderfully crafted, acted, directed film. There ARE no flaws. Everyone should see this at least once... to throw it into a drug users face would be the great pleasure whether its to say &quot;look how stupid you are?&quot; or just to demonstrate what happens. This isn't a film about Drugs... its a film about losing all you hopes, dreams, family, friends, lovers, homes, and you life. And your never getting it back.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AIEFHVCQDWYZ4	Tyler Alan Sharp	Some of the reviewers on this site are either unintelligent or willfully ignorant. I read through some of the reviews and a common reason for a one star rating was because they did not know the meaning for why the film was created, or what it was about. To these people I would say open your eyes...this film is about addiction. This film shows the lengths to which people will go to satisfy an addiction. It shows how any addiction, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can tear apart a family, a friendship, or even a marriage.This film is not a happy go lucky tale with a happy ending, and that is why I think it has made some of you angry. This isn't a movie that you can cuddle up and eat popcorn to, this is a movie that makes you think, makes you bleed with the characters, and makes you examine your own life.The primary purpose that I can see for this film is to be a prevention method for anyone considering taking any drug or illegal substance. Watch the movie and see the reality of what can happen...that is what I liked about this movie, it was gritty, dirty, and real. So real, in fact, that I think it might have scared you, made you feel dirty yourselves, and forced you to take a microscope to your own heart.The characters spiral out of control, they stumble, and they fail, but in the end you don't see the characters anymore, you see yourself in all your faded glory, exposed to the world, and if that idea scares you then I am sorry.	5.0	Reviewers on Amazon....hmmm	2005-11-20	17	15	2

This is the only movie I have ever seen that caused me to rethink the way I was living my life and without this movie I would be heading down the path the characters in the movie were heading. I feel that this is the most realistic, beleivable story about drug abuse. I felt like I was watching real people live their lives and never have I cared so much about the choices they were making and the outcome of everyones choices than while watching this. I have seen many sad, disturbing, and heartbreaking movies, but none have affected me like this. When it was over, I just sat there with a feeling of hurt in the pit of my stomache, thinking about what I just experienced. Even though they weren't real people, I wanted to know what happened to the characters and hoped that they escaped the hell they were stuck in. I was addicted to meth when I first saw this and it opened my eyes to the reality of what I was doing to myself, changed my entire outlook on drug addiction, and gave me the motivation to turn my life around. I am forever changed due to this film, and if you are having drug problems I highly suggest watching this. What happens to these people can happen to anyone and no one should have to go through what they go through.	5.0	Forever Haunted	2005-08-01	3	2	1

I would never have seen it if i would have known the main topic before, because personaly these are not the kind of movies that you take the lead to see. But the most beautiful characteristic of the film is simply how the director displays the emotions of each one of the characters and prints them into your brain until you get as much anxiety as the character itself. Yes, it IS graphic, but don't confuse violence snd cheap pornography with the art of handleing the camera. The first half of the movie may seem a bit tedious and repetitive; in the second third, you'll start to get interested, but on the last part you'll be sweatting (maybe crying) on your couch. The end of the movie is something you really shouldn't miss. As a recomendation, don't get interrupted along the film, or you'll get lost in the story.	5.0	Let Darren play with your emotions	2004-07-27	1	1	0

I recently re watched this film and still feel that the mother's story is the most interesting. The other three characters are young and have the ideals that nothing can hurt them since for awhile it seemed true until the world of drugs hit them hard.  Their story is one you have probably seen before but still worth watching the graphic depiction of the dangers of drugs. The mom's story was one that at the time this movie first came out was not talked about and is just barely  (because if recent celebrity events) getting the attention that prescription drugs are Drug Drugs. Just because a pharmacists hands you the bag and not some dealer in the alley does not make them safer.

Requiem for a dream is a very touching movie, the music fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film and captures each moment perfectly. The camera work is also superb, the director uses certain camera angles to capture the feeling of drug usage, anxiety, and depression in a way that is intelligently artistic.  This movie is an absolute stroke of genius.

Each of the main characters each have dreams and means in which to reach them..the main charachter harry sets out to help his girlfriend to be free from her parents grasp and the grasp of others that are doing nothing but giving her money and loaning to her, by coppin an ounce of pure to fund for her to be able to open her own clothing shop.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3VOW473J03GOB	"Wayne ""waynesworld857"""	"This is the most powerful condemnation of substance abuse ever put on film. Darren Aronofsky has used his artistic vision first to suck you into the world of the four main characters, then to take you on their slow, inexorable plunge into the hell of addiction. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely widow living in a small, modest apartment near the abandoned beaches of Coney Island. She naively views her son Harry (Jared Leto) as a ""good boy"", even though he keeps pawning her TV to buy heroin. Harry has a best friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and a girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who are also into drugs. Sara's dream is to appear on television; she is obsessed with the idea and virtually addicted to a show by a self-help guru. Harry and Tyrone dream of one day making a big score, raking in a fortune and putting their financial worries behind them. Marion's dream is to design clothes and run her own business. But mind-altering chemicals cloud their judgment and dissolve all of their hopes.The screenplay was co-written by Hubert Selby, Jr. and Aronofsky, adapted from Selby's novel. Aronofsky's use of unconventional film techniques, sound and music is nothing short of brilliant. He is unflinching in his portrayal of the depravity to which addicts are driven. Harry and Tyrone, though drug users and dealers, are not thugs; they are sympathetically portrayed as misguided misfits, as is Marion. When Harry and Tyrone are unexpectedly exposed to the violence inherent in the drug trade, it leads to their introduction to the criminal justice system. Marion is finally reduced to selling her body for a fix.  Meanwhile, Sara's dream to be on TV is about to come true. Her mistake is in trusting a quack doctor who prescibes amphetimines to help her lose weight fast so that she can fit into her favorite dress for the big event. She starts to over-medicate which causes irrational mood swings and eventually, hallucinations.  Ellen Burstyn's performance earned her an Oscar nomination (she should have won). By the end of the film, she is almost unrecognizable; a burned out, babbling speed freak. All four characters are reduced to self-loathing, pitiful shells of themselves, curled up in a fetal position. Their nightmarish, gut-wrenching journey is mesmerizing and disturbing. If a positive movie experience for you is a sugar-coated adventure to the land of happy endings, avoid this one.The DVD is available in an R-rated and Unrated version; the unrated version has slightly more explicit sex, but nothing that impacts on the plot or the overall effect of the film."	5.0	A BRILLIANT WORK OF ART	2003-11-24	32	24	8

But as I thought over it for some time I became very upset.  The style of Aronofsky is impeccable.  His cast is stellar.  The settings are perfect, and the effects and soundtrack are very pleasing... BUT this film SUCKS.  At the end I kept saying to myself &quot;requiem for a dream, requiem for a dream&quot;.  the title is absolutely true... Similar to &quot;Final Destination&quot;, I found myself repeating the title.  When you go to a film you expect the unexpected... this film only lived up to its namesake, which wasn't profound to say the least.  I honestly consider this film to be &quot;directoral masturbation&quot;.  I would be shamed to show this to my family and friends.  I have no inclination to see this film again... which is very sad... I saw Pi 3 times while it was in the theatre, and I treasure my copy.  Another reason why I have turned against this film is because of its peculiar similarity to Magnolia.  Magnolia more or less paints the same picture, but in a much more refreshing and entertaining manner.  i will have to wait for aronofsky's next feature!	2.0	terrible disappointment...	2000-11-27	25	6	19
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A137NC0D9F4EJY	We Live	I get sick of people labeling this as a drug movie or a movie that says that drugs are bad.  Requiem for a Dream is far from that.  If you stopped short at thinking of this movie just as a message against drugs, you failed to let your mind travel into the depth of this movie.The movie is more so a presentation of 4 people's lives rather than a movie that's trying to make a message.  Requiem speaks on dreams and the obstacles that one has to go through to achieve them.  The drugs serve as the obstacles.  They're the easy way out-- think, Mrs. Goldfarb wanted badly to be in that red dress but instead of taking the tough route, she relented to taking the easy path to her dreams like so many of us do.  The same goes for Harry and his friends dreams of living in the easy lane.On top of the things I listed in the above paragraph, Requiem is a very touching movie because it reminds us of how hard it is to let go of something you really love, something you really yearn for.  Even though the 4 carachters lives were going down hill, they still stuck to their belief in their dream and went through insane measures to get to it--driving from New York to Florida.  Requiem is the sad tale of 4 people losing everything in the process of reaching for that dream of theirs.  It's not just a anti drug movie or a drug movie, as so many people like to label it as, it's a movie about life, hopes, and the sadness that comes with failure.	5.0	Misunderstood movie	2006-05-13	10	7	3
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3KWXO6QE62Z5E	Wes Martin	Requiem for a dream, in my opinion, was the best movie in Y2K.  Sure, there are powerful performances, but what's makes this film even more special is that you actually feel for the characters.  Also, I thought the score throughout the film was haunting, and all the editing (esp. the fast forward parts), was very fun to watch.This DVD is the unrated DVD that was shown in theaters.  Basically, the film is rated NC-17.  But you can also buy the movie in an R-Rated version.The only difference between the unrated and R-rated versions is that Marion's party scene at the end (which is explicit), was cut shorter.  WOW, that's a really big difference, yeah right!  One big difference between the two DVDs is that the Unrated version has a lot more features, and the R-rated only has theatrical trailers.I totally recommend this movie and DVD, and it ain't for the kids, but anyone who is addicted or plans to be, should consider watching this movie.

A plot development I've wanted to make and now have seen:  sub plots gradually converging into a cataclysmic ending.  Though the movie contains a few minor Hollywood celebrity actors and has fairly wide release it is remarkably devoid of the usual Hollywood narcicissm and formula.  That the director allowed the movie to be released as is with a NC17 rating is evidence of artistic integrity because this restricts the potential audience base heavily.  This movie is hard core, making Trainspotting look G rated.	5.0	Harrowing, Great	2000-11-07	3	3	0

This movie will haunt you. The final chapters are harrowing. It's not just a cautionary tale about drugs, it's an eye opener about the addictions we all have and how otherwise good people can be thrown into chaos by an obsession.

Others, who were not moved by the plight of the characters just found it boring and annoying.So it seems like the very best you can possibly hope for after watching this movie is to feel bored and annoyed. Well, I'll give it 2 stars because I guess some people probably need to see it. I mean, if you're actually dumb enough to consider using, then maybe there's something in it for you. Otherwise, if watching a movie about people destroying their lives via drug addiction doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, I'd give it a pass.But if you still want to see this movie, I'd just rent it. It's sort of like watching a documentary about the Nazi concentration camps and the horrors therein; I can't imagine why any person who is not emotionally disturbed would want to watch it more than once.	2.0	Before you watch this movie ...	2008-04-13	8	4	4

And tonight, with another grape-y friend of mine, I watched it.Let me just say, there will be SPOILERS so please read at your own discretion.The first time you see those quick cuts of the syringe filling, the eyes dilating, the cotton balls, and the sighs of pleasure in the background, it's inevitable...you think &quot;wow! COOL!&quot;But as the movie progresses and these 4 characters become less and less human, it ain't so cool no more.  You see that montage of cuts over and over again and each time you see it, it means more doom.  You start thinking &quot;oh please, Harry..please don't do that..please...&quot;  It becomes ingrained in your head that this is no longer fun..it's a habit...it's an addiction..and the fact that it is shot so magnetically, you can't turn your head away no matter how much you start hating it.  Much like drug addiction itself.Ellen Burstyn, in that scene with Jared Leto in her apartment...when she talks about that red dress and Seymour and her hopes and dreams for Harry...I don't think you can get any more heartbreaking than that...her pathetic nature, her descent into madness, it's all up there and you can't stop watching.  This is a woman on the cusp and you have no doubt in your mind she's going to go over...what an incredible performance in this scene...Marion's prostitution and transformation into a full-blown junkie...you love her so much, and you hate her too for doing this to herself.  Her degradation at the end was so un-sexual and I have no clue as to why the MPAA made such a big deal out of it...but what it was, and this is why I think they censored it and slapped it with an NC-17...was that it was NOT senseless....this scene is in there to show her humiliation, not her pleasure.  And that this will surely not be the last time she does this.  And sex that isn't mindless is not palatable to us sheep.  Thus, the NC-17.  What a pity we are treated like morons.Marlon Wayans, what a surprise...'nuff said...and Jared Leto...the center of the film....never thought he had it in him.  When he turns his head away and suggests that Marion goes on the date (trick?) with Arnold for money...my heart broke.Add this to the visual style of the movie, the music, the sound...believe me folks...screw the MPAA and what they think is ok to see and not ok to see...this is an IMPORTANT film...on a critical level, you will never see performances stronger than these in any movie released in the last 2 years.  On a social level...once you see this...once you see these characters (and that ARM!) go from healthy and loving to wisps of souls, you will never ever consider doing drugs...and if you already do, you will reconsider.  Unless you are Harry, Marion, Tyrone, or Sara...chracters who can never turn back.The moral?There is a point where salvation will never find you. So don't even start walking in that direction.Excuse me now, kiddies.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	AM7ANYKNPD1LJ	wtcdean	This movie is about relationships, and how drugs can ruin lives.  Central characters are a widowed mother, her son, and his girlfriend.  The son becomes a drug dealer and tells his mother he is an &#34;import distributor&#34;, which she takes as any mother would...proudly telling her widow friends about her son's success.  His girlfriend is a fashion designer.  Both are recreational cocaine users.  The mother is not happy with her weight, and goes to a doctor to get some diet pills.  The son's drug dealer gets killed, so his &#34;job&#34; and source of income vanish (as well as his source of drugs).  He and his girlfriend then struggle to find enough to satisfy their cravings, and mom becomes addicted to the diet pills.  We watch as the lengths to which one will go reveal themselves and the final outcomes unfold.  An interesting story that shows how ruinous recreational (and even prescription) drug use can be.	5.0	Relationships	2013-07-07	1	0	1
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to ""Requiem for a Dream."" The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary ""tough love."" Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.GRADE: B-"	4.0	Unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse	2012-03-26	1	1	0

I honestly would love to hear a more elaborate argument for why this isn't one of the (if not, The) greatest movies ever made. The acting is incredible, the direction (by the amazingly talented Darren Aronofsky) is a brilliantly eccentric portrayal of an eccentric (and haunting) lifestyle. It's so hard to really find a flaw with this movie. It's a tragedy, pure and simple (and the best I've seen). It follows the book's fast paced, no holds barred style. It shows the nightmare of a drug filled life with such intense precision that I could barely move or speak after the end credits. Please, watch this movie, it's definitely not compatible with everyone, but it is a masterpiece in filmmaking.	5.0	_________________. (speechless.)	2005-05-13	1	1	0

The whole amputation thing didn't really bother me, but seeing Ellen Burstyn getting SHOCKED simply for popping diet pills like candy did.  I had NO idea that something that trivial could drive someone mad, and this madness would actually require that type of therapy, but my mother verified this information for me ... and that's because she herself went a little crazy on diet pills in her younger days.An eye-opening movie, to say the least, but ... if you're squeamish, WATCH OUT!"	4.0	Disturbing, but very good.	2004-09-07	1	1	0

In fact, there's not a lot to like, because the movie is about four likable people falling deep into desperation and despair. The dream mentioned in the title is the American Dream of making it, of having it all, of acheiving your goals. But these people, Harry and his mother Sara, Marion, and Tyrone, all try to acheive their goals in the most dangerous ways. Watching these four change into shadows of themselves is depressing.

I will dissapoint the reviewer who said there is no middle ground with this film: you either love it or hate it. For me, it was neither. I guess I kind of liked it because I wanted to give my opinion on it. I liked it because I know what addiction is like and this film came closest to what I felt like among the ones that I have seen so far. I didn't like it because it was too repetitive and the characters were kind of loose.

B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A3PRY9NFLL6EIU	Zero101	I recently purchased Requiem for a Dream on DVD and was blown away...  all the originality and style of Pi (Darren Aronofsky's freshman effort) had been super-evolved to a state of near perfection.  This movie is simply beautiful to watch... incredibly striking and original camera effects.. wonderful split screens and amazing cuts.  This movie packs a visual knock out.Beyond the sheer delight of how it is presented, the story is very complex and compelling... the 4 characters in which this movie centers on are all very well developed, each of their fates unfolding before you like some wicked nightmare.  Ellen Burstyn portrays her character (Sarah Goldfarb) with particular skill...  her fall into the depths of addiction is an amazingly interesting spiral.Do not watch this movie and expect some uplifting message or moral resolution to all the depravity.  Requiem for a Dream presents you with all the horrors that humanity is capable of, and then walks away, leaving you to deal with it on your own.  It is extremely dark and jaded, but it is in that honesty that the movie becomes so powerful.This is an incredible movie, and I don't think *any* DVD collection is complete without it.	5.0	Amazing, and unlike anything you have ever seen	2001-06-17	8	6	2
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	A209IYX86Q8V2S	Zero Enna	When my girlfriend handed me this DVD, she told me nothing about it.  Based on the title, I figured it would be nothing more than some drama based on some lackluster dreams; and I was right and wrong at the same time.  What I did see was dreams being accomplished and smashed into pieces in the same moment.  Requiem for a Dream is a film you must see.I started watching this film not expecting much of a masterpiece, but I was soon to discover that I was viewing one of the most brutally honest and disturbing films ever to be created, and I do not say that lightly.Now, I am well aware that my previous statement has been said many; many times in just about every one of the seven hundred some reviews on this site.  What more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  The musical score is incredible, the editing is something that can't be matched in any other film, and the acting is top notch on every level.  I sat on my couch while the credits rolled in awe, almost drawn to tears; with a blank look on my face.  I wasn't able to sleep the night I saw this film.  I was thinking long into the night about random things; trying to process the things I had just seen; and I continued to do so late into the next day.Now, I must note that I had watched this film right after I got done watching Pi.  I suggest anyone who likes either film should see the other.  They are both from the same director and they are both mind-blowingly good.Be warned, this is one film you have to see twice to fully understand every little thing, but I can almost guarantee you that you will want to put it away and never see it again after the magnificent ending.	5.0	You will be blown to tears and blown away at the same time.	2004-09-05	0	0	0

Also, the commentary tracks provided by the director and cinematographer are interesting and do a good job of pointing out subtleties of craft that you may not have consciously picked up on when viewing on your own.I have my quibbles with the film, and suspect the ending is a little too Grand Guignol-ish for its own good, but the all-around solid-to-amazing acting, the musical approach to editing and composition, and the creativity and innovation of the director make this one a keeper for me."	4.0	yes, it's worth seeing again!	2002-08-22	1	1	0
B00003CXP1	Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut	ACDZDAW1ZJ304	"""zimri-lim"""	This is an excellent film in many ways.  It is unique, thought-provoking and deals with unflinching honesty about one of the most important yet sloppily analysed facets of our modern liberal society, drug addiction, whether legal or illegal.There are many reasons why this is an important film:Firstly the subject matter - drug addiction and it's effect on all our lives - is intelligently and thoughtfully explored.  Not something one encounters often in films noawadays.Secondly the production and direction are masterful.  The Director uses many innovative techniques to create emotions often outside of the cinematographic repertoire.  The final half of the film feels as if you are in a mad dizzying rush forward as the film drives onwards to it's harrowing, emotional climax.  It may not be the most subtle approach but it succeeds beyond doubt.Thirdly, the film is not hindered by nostalgia, it is brutally honest in how it thinks the protagonists would behave in real life and attains a strong degree of realism.  The result of this is that the film is often harrowing and disturbing but never greatuitously.  The viewer is not manipulated and treated in a condescending way as in so many films - this feels real.Fourthly, the performances are first-rate - Ellen Burstyn in particular puts in a great turn as the doting mother with an inadverent addiction to slimming pills.Darren Aronofsky, the Director, shows a uniquely compelling approach with serious subject matter.  This is a film to watch and consider; it will stay with you long after it has finished - altogether superior film-making.Hugely recommended!	5.0	Superb, Intelligent Film-Making at its Best!	2001-10-28	2	2	0

Yet world of substance abuse was so foreign to me it kept me away from renting or even buying.  Well, I got to watch it on Sundance film channel last night, thinking I'd just watch for 15 minutes.  Boy did it blow my mind...... not too many movies do this to me.  I couldn't sleep well last night.  I kept hearing that powerful soundtrack in my head.  I don't know which I love more, tension building music or the movie itself?  They go together so well.Now I see why other viewers talk about the last 30 minutes of this film.  It is so emotionally intense it made me cry.  I never did drugs in my life and pray that my 14 year old son would stay away from it at any cost.  Yet I truly felt for those people with their vices.  For their lost dreams.  I understood why it was called &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; then.  This is an intelligent and mature film.
