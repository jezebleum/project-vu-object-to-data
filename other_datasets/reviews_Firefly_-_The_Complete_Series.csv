B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A354HH188OAJUU		"After a severe rough patch in the road for science fiction in general (Farscape and Firefly fall victim to a fatal form of the same disease; network myopia!), there's something to cheer about!I have rated fewer than a dozen books or movies at 5 stars in the last 25 years.  I have never been hooked so hard, so fast by a TV show, regardless of genre.  The individual characters gave me that kitten with a ball of yarn feeling... I HAVE to know more! Add lots of action and the creator's signature (rapid-fire, often slicing, and usually unexpected) character interaction, and I thought I was about to escape from network sitcom/""reality show"" hell!  Unfortunately, it didn't last.There is room in good scifi for all kinds.  Over the years, I've enjoyed more so-called ""mainstream"" scifi such as Star Wars, Trek, and Gate, SG1, B5, and countless others for different reasons.  (Unfortunately, far more have landed in the mediocre to sub-sewage categories.) Firefly was one of the few that appealed to my taste for something further out on the edge; a little dark, definitely adult; often laugh-out-loud funny- no laugh track required; where everything may not be what it appears, or it just might be; something you have to work at a little to understand, but always beautifully written and acted.  If that might also interest you, I strongly recommend this series in whatever form it is available, wherever, whenever. My husband and I agreed- we're getting the DVD as soon as it's available; THEN we'll worry about getting a DVD player!!!  Serenity definitely deserves to keep flying!"	5.0	All Hail ONE bright Spot in Recent Scifi...	2003-08-09	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2LOFZGS9HRHPQ		Everything about this series is brilliant. The camera-work is superb, it lacks some of the computer-animated flashiness of Babylon 5 but also absent is the latter's visual phoniness. The laws of physics are for the most part obeyed. The setting is no Trekish utopia, but rather a real, believable world inhabited by a mishmash of cultures and peopled by a realistic mix of saints, sinners, criminals, tyrants and heros.The dialogue was hands-down the best-written of any television show I have ever seen. It was witty and heartfelt. Mandarin exclamations and curse-words add to the realism of the multicivilizational melting-pot of the series while detracting nothing from the viewer's enjoyment.The acting was excellent; all the characters pulled their respective weight but none more brilliantly than Nathan Fillion, who played the sometimes-tortured, sometimes cheerful, sometimes-generous, sometimes-mercenary Captain Malcolm Reynolds with ablomb and great skill.Sadly, the powers that be at Fox killed this series in its prime. Even with the details revealed in the movie Serenity, we may never learn why the Alliance held Book in such high regard, how the civilization depicted in the series developed, what ultimately happened to the Reavers, Niska, or the duo of Kaylee and Simon. And we are denied future quotations from the works of Shan Yu. More's the pity.	5.0	Best. Sci-fi. Ever.	2006-02-21	14	13	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A106016KSI0YQ		FIREFLY is one of the most fiercely loved cult television shows ever made, and it greatly deserves to be. In its abbreviated only season, it managed to produce such a memorably palpable universe and set of characters that it was eventually allowed to continue its story in a film version, SERENITY, that did not do as well as hoped in its theatrical release but that has enjoyed enough success on its DVD run that it has produced a whole new set of fans curious about the original show (myself included). Its central idea is elegantly simple: set in a future analogous to the Reconstruction after the American civil war, a group of renegades, led by a soldier on the rebellion's losing side, try to make ends meet by accepting dubious work smuggling goods (and even sometimes pulling heists) in a very corruptly run political system. The brooding romantic captain and his cohort form the nucleus of the band, with her jokester husband, a tough hired muscle, a sweet-tempered mechanic, a stiff doctor, his mysterious and emotionally disturbed younger sister, and an extremely ethical preacher forming the rest of the group. Oh, and of course in this homage to John Ford's STAGECOACH there is also a (state licensed) prostitute with a heart of gold, whose ongoing bantering love-hate relationship with the captain forms one of the highlights of the entire series (and seems surprisingly fresh).The episodes are written more like miniature films than typical television hour-long shows, and there's usually a fine sense of atmosphere (moreover, the special effects are surprisingly sophisticated and convincing). The tone from episode to episode can shift dramatically, from very jokey episodes to very haunting or grim ones. The show's creator Joss Whedon is best known for his earlier series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, but FIREFLY is surprisingly quite different in style and type from BUFFY, although it retains the very best things about that earlier (and more widely popular) series: the strong and original characters, the funny and unexpected banter, and most of all the emphasis on community and on heart.	5.0	Days of future past	2006-02-04	14	13	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3USP7JY7U3TW2		"First off, I haven't seen the Firefly series and even after the movie Serenity came out, I ignored it. However, due to the repeated recommendations of Amazon, I decided to check it out at my local store. And boy, I didn't realize what I was missing!If you're a Star Wars fan, partial to ""weird west"" cartoons like Trigun, Bravestarr and the more recent Gun X Sword and lapped up the PC game Privateer a decade ago, Firefly is a must-see TV. It also echoes the venerable Star Trek franchise, with the crew dropped in (mostly illegal) situations during their voyages. However, Firefly transcends them all with its witty characterizations, uncontrived plot twists, brisk pacing and all around energy.I would not go into the plots since it's mostly covered by the editorial and customer reviews. But one thing I noticed about the Firefly series is its refreshing lack of space battles. In fact, the ship Serenity itself has no guns and that is a major ""twist"" in space-based TV shows.The show hits all the geek notes in the right way. From a roguish crew, evil corporations, criminal lowlifes, and even lesbian kissing. It's almost like Han Solo: The Series, but better.The DVD set itself is way, way excellent. Aside from humorous and enlightening commentaries from Joss Whedon, it features the aforementioned final three episodes, deleted scenes and a gag reel. One caveat though for parents. Firefly contains sex scenes (you cannot label it ""suggested sex scenes"" since you can see them doing it clearly - there's no other way you can interpret it otherwise - hey I'm not complaining! :)) and other scenes of sensitive nature. The violence part, is surprisingly tame for my standards (even the torture scenes) but there is a substantial chunk in the series.Overall, after seeing the series, you will wonder what were the Fox executives thinking when they cancelled an excellent series like Firefly. Good thing, there's DVD (and movie franchises) to make up for capriciousness and ignorance of network executives."	5.0	Must-see Sci Fi TV	2006-06-05	14	13	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQBRMBQ99ESI7		"I had never heard of this series. I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while.The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a ""shepherd"", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other ""permanent"" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers.Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on some border areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting.The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is ""wrong"". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode.Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers.Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation.Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate.Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled.Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent.War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the ""lady"" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned.The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most.Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well. Things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture. This tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with which they deal. In this episode, a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one. River, though, is not without her own methods."	5.0	Cowboys and Spacemen	2005-11-15	14	13	1

I can't for the life of me figure out why Fox cancelled this series. It had the making to be the absolute best SciFi series ever produced, far surpassing any Star Trek with it's depth, story, believability and addictiveness (and I'm a Trekkie). Because of the very odd way it was aired on Fox (not in order, pre-empted a number of times, 3 or 4 eps never aired) it was extremely difficult to follow it when it was new, but still managed to win awards and a cult following. The series is even more engaging since it can be watched in order on DVD -- get them, if you're a fan of ""smart SciFi"", you'll fall in love with this and end up wishing someone, somewhere would pick it back up and make a season 2 (HBO, Showtime, SciFi???)"	5.0	Firefly ...

A friend let me borrow his FireFly DVD's to watch. My wife and I ended up watching the entire season in a weekend. We just couldnt stop watching them. We even went through a second time and half of a third through the next few weeks. Friend wanted them back, now I am purchasing my own along with Serenity.I do like sci-fi stuff and this is like none other I can think of. The show has a very good sense of humor. I think all the actors did a great job with their characters, they each have their own pesona and they all fit together wonderfully.I can see why this show would have been canceled not starting from the begenning.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3P1WBPDJ1S0B8		"After Battlestar Galactica, science fiction series are not quite evaluated by the same standards anymore. Trying their best in ""Firefly"" doesn't quite make it happen either. Presented as a kind of western in space story results regrettably in a space opera more like what we see in ordinary action series. As science fiction it fells short of its pretensions, as an action story it is relatively entertaining. What are missing are probably a somewhat better plot and more fascinating personalities. But if you are anything like me and misses science fiction series, it is much better than no series at all."	4.0	Spacewestern	2006-07-21	22	2	20

Think: ""Deawood"" (without the sex and cursing) meets ""Star Wars"" meets ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" meets ""The Wild Wild West"" (the good, original TV series).The ensemble cast provides a blended family of nine travelers on a series of marginally legal inter-planetary hauling missions. Led by a Captain Malcolm Reynolds (a former fighter in the losing fight against the current government) they are regularly confronted by malevolent government forces (the remnants of the USA and China, who consolidate their power), uber-zombies (""Reavers"") with a most distasteful three-part approach to disposing of regular humans and various criminals spread among the terraformed planets and moons of a post-apocalyptic universe.Engaging dialogue (that includes sudden and natural injections of Chinese), dark and slapstick humor, suspense and intrigue as the late 19th century American west meets the future in space.If you're don't appreciate the best of either westerns or sci-fi, you might not like it.

I am not a Sci-Fi connoisseur, but in comparison all other space based shows lack the soul, the grit, the humor, the creativity and the excellent dialogue of Firefly.  Other shows certainly had bigger budgets and to some the sterile looking bridge of the Enterprise probably holds more appeal.  I'm not one of those people.  In the short space of 14 episodes, I grew so attached to the characters that the cancellation of the show was actually painful.  I still get angry at Fox when I think about it, even when part of my brain realizes that the Fox execs probably had good business reasons to commit their heinous unforgivable disgusting horrible abhorrent detestable crime.	5.0	The best Sci-Fi TV ever made.	2013-03-09	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FGL5OSBA1403	"Aaron Glassman ""AG"""	"This is a great set. If you were a fan of the series it is great to be able to watch these whenever you want. The best thing this set does is takes the fan of the film Serenity and enhances their enjoyment of the film by giving an expanded view of ""the verse."" With the same writer/director as the film the series has the same feel as the film with just a bit less in the budget for F/X, but the writing more then makes up for that and in my opinion actually makes it so only multiple viewings brings out the slightly lower F/X and by multiple I mean it took me the 6th time through to see anything and then it is only fleeting or just could be that way with any F/X movie you see and so it could just be the same as when you realize the camera is moving and not Galactic Cruiser in Star Wars, a little of your innocence dies (OK that is an exaggeration, but it fits the mood).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZRCEYATM635G	"Aaron J. Marshall ""Extremus"""	Love the originality of the sci-fi/western and the character interactions, but the show did contain themes I found highly objectionable (especially the &#34;respectability&#34; of Inara's being a licensed &#34;companion&#34;...and her doing business with both sexes).  Given the show's short run I'm not sure whether this readily apparent conflict of legally endorsed moral depravity would have been explored for its real-life impact on our own society (abortion, gay marriage, etc.), but I find that highly doubtful.  It also seemed like the show more than once went to heavy lengths to make &#34;Christians&#34; (or people who were transparently similar) look very backward and superstitious.I love Joss Whedon as a director and his handling of large casts as he demonstrated in The Avengers.  But as much as I wanted to fall in love with Firefly and its intriguing universe, to me it was held back by these issues.  Sometimes I'm left wondering how much the writing of a show simply reflects the larger nature of its world and those who inhabit it, or is actually propagandizing an agenda.  With sci-fi especially, the latter has often been the case throughout the genre's history.	4.0	Great sci-fi in many ways, but not for everyone	2013-10-04	3	1	2

I would put it in the same league as Stargate SG-1 and early seasons of Andromeda.Of the 4 dvd's included.  The 2nd dvd is by far the weakest of the episodes.  The show starts off great with the first dvd... but then I was like is this all there is.  But good thing the 3rd dvd is really good.  More interesting plots.Despite the kinda lackluster special effects and sometimes stalling action.  It is worth it to get this dvd set.  The characters are great and the dialogue is really good.

Netflix and Amazon Prime are the future of home entertainment.  Offerings like Firefly, and the movie sequel Serenity will see the masses leaving network television in droves.

In spite of being advertised as a science fiction, I, for some reason, tend to think it as a drama with a science fiction angle. I like everybody esp. Captain Mal. He is simply superb and steals the show. Extremely unpredictable, demanding yet caring, decisive as a captain should obviously be. I'd postponed watching it for quite a long time even though my friends kept on bugging me to death to watch it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2O8RIDCJ0H83V	Acoma	"Hearing how fans were fairly rabid about this series, I decided to pick it up based on all the raves. I finished watching all the episodes and Special Features from the DVDs last night. All i have to say is wow...I mean seriously, wow. I thought after watching Battlestar Galactica that nobody could ever make a compelling lifelike show with a space theme in it.Firefly definately lives up to the hype. Once i started with the first episode Serenity, also the name of the upcoming movie in September of this year, I was hooked. To sum it up the series background is a twist of western and space. Sounds corny? It's not. To make a better analogy in my mind is that the Human race is heavily colonizing planets and thusly has a ""Go West young man"" feel.As Joss Whedon summarized in the Special Features ""It's about throwing nine people into space on their own and getting nine different perspectives of what that would be like"". The background of the world is never overwhelming in the sense this series is first and foremost about the characters. It gets to the point where you don't care about the cool space stuff or planets, but what is going to happen to each person next. What can I say about the cast...amazing casting. Each person is just perfect for the role. I won't really say too much about the characters other than they are all very well-tailored and unique and throughout the 14 episodes you get on this DVD collection you will see each one fleshed out well and clammering for more. If you aren't convinced about the reviews here you can catch it on Sci-Fi channel at 7pm EST. Sci-Fi is rebroadcasting the series mostly in part due to the upcoming Serenity release.It is truly a shame this series ended so soon. It had all the qualities of a great TV series. Possibly with the introduction to Serenity in theatres it will be reborn back into our living rooms."	5.0	Before the Movie Serenity, there was Firefly.	2005-08-11	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3CR0BV4S19P3F	"Adam 9 ""dragonstrider"""	I'd just like to say up front that I'd never seen an episode of Buffy or Angel before Firefly came on, and considered the whole craze kind of, well, crazy. Firefly gave me so much respect for the work of Joss Whedon, however, that I decided to go back and give the other series a chance. They're quirky and enjoyable enough, but don't hit their stride so quickly or as well as Firefly did in my opinion.As for this particular series, I saw a preview of it in a TV Guide article and thought it looked interesting, especially since I've seen similar shows such as Cowboy Bebop. I was shocked by how much these characters and episodes were able to move me, particularly in episodes such as Out of Gas, where we see exactly what Captain Mal Reynolds feels and remembers about his ship and his crew. I've heard only a few negative reviews of the series, mostly people who couldn't grasp Firefly's concept for the future. Whether it was a lack of aliens or understanding of the cultural integration and western/colonial influences, I don't think it's possible to like this kind of series if you can't understand it. (Nor should we as fans berate those at Fox that can't or won't ever understand it.)A movie and soundtrack are currently under production at this time, and I'm excited for both. I just hope for the day when an exec at Fox goes to Joss and says, &quot;Boy, your movie was sure successful at the box office.

After seeing the episodes in order and the ones that were never aired it looks like an even bigger mistake that Fox cancelled it.  The movie is having a tough time getting approval though.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1L3OGI42VBJC9	Adam Sterling	I received the 'Firefly' box set as a Christmas gift this year and while, I am sorry to say, I was not a fan of the show when it was airing on FOX, I love it as I love all of Whedon's shows, although 'Buffy' remains my favourite.The show has an interesting feel to it, something that gives you that sense that it is 500 years old, rather than the other way around.Canadian Nathan Fillion delivers some of the best lines in television history with surprising ease, and Gina Torres has me convinced that she could kick my ass.One of the other things that I love about 'Firefly' is that, unlike Whedon's other shows, none of the characters have any 'super-powers', when in a tight spot they aren't doing to use karate and gymnastics to escape, they're going to fight like they're in a bar-brawl.The score for this show is wonderful as well. If you are a fan of this score, as I am, I highly recommend David Goodrich's album 'Accidentals of the West'.For those of you who watched the series while it was on FOX, and while enjoyed it, aren't considering picking up this set, I implore you to do otherwise. This series was meant for DVD, and the order that they are in is also the way that they should've been seen/aired.I hope that this review has helped you somewhat.Thank you,Adam Sterling	5.0	Pleasently Surprised	2003-12-26	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WRNBOO4J2KDD	Adam W. Jones	First, I have to admit I came to Firefly late in the scheme of things. When it was on TV the first time, I ignored it (or more correctly I'm not sure I even knew it was on). I have since become a rabid watcher (and re-watcher) of the program. The thing with Firefly that makes it work, I think, is the dialogue. Sometimes science-fiction programs loose an audience because the technical or fantasy aspect of the plot requires characters to do all the stories exposition in conversation. They don't talk to one another so much as explain why things are happening in the story. This can feel very phony, or at the least reminds one these are characters--not real people. Firefly's cast not only come across as real individuals, but they way they talk works towards building a realistic world you get sucked into. Conversations in the show are laced with slang, inside jokes, and the kind of familiar language anyone will identify with as genuine. It POPS! It's a fun show, and worth watching. Be prepared though, like so many REALLY GOOD TV Sci-Fi this gem was canceled before it's time, so there is only one season and a movie to feed the obsession I am sure you will develop like so many of us have.	5.0	Quirky, well written, and campy all in one--whats's not to love?	2013-10-19	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1U8969MYK9V7U	"Addison J. Dauber ""College Student"""	I bought this boxed set blindly.  I had never seen an episode, but was going off of the hype surrounding the movie Serenity.  At first I was worried, I had read some reviews on the site saying that the fans had inflated the rating by spamming the site with multiple accounts.  But, after receiving and viewing the series I am glad to say the show deserves the 5 star rating it currently has.  This show was excellent and I can't believe it got cancelled.  Upon receiving it my friends and I watched the pilot episode and after viewing it everything else came to a standstill.  Plans for later that evening were cancelled as we proceeded to watch the first half of the boxed set.  We would have finished the whole series in a single setting, but unfortunately college classes and a calculus test got in the way, so we finished it the next day after classes got out.  There was not a single episode that went by that my friends and I didn't laugh out loud at the humor in the show, and there were many times that you were on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next.  This could very well be the best television show I have ever seen and would highly recommend that anyone see it.	5.0	A masterpiece...	2005-10-07	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1DS0IESVWVVPF	Addison Phillips	"With over 1600 reviews, I'm not exactly going to be forging new territory here, except to add to the hum of ""me too"". If you're reading this then you already know that Firefly was a short lived Western-themed TV sci-fi series... and that this description hardly begins to describe it as a show.The eternal debate among ""fanboys"" is over which show is best. Is it B5 with its story arc? Is it BSG with its relentless darkness? Is it Farscape? Doctor Who? Trek? Blake's 7?  In that debate, Firefly, with a mere 14 episodes, has to be seriously considered. Cut off before it really got going, we'll never really know what the series would have been... but we are left with an amazing mini-series that is eminently watchable. Each episode, in fact, is a nifty piece of television--I'm one of the few that found and watched Firefly in its original run, where the story arc made no sense because the episodes were shown out of order.There is humor here and there is some poignancy. But what always strikes me is the sense of realism that was forged. The sets and effects are not what I'm talking about: it's the characters. For example, in the (intended) first episode (Serenity), the captain makes a series of decisions that result in the doctor remaining on board. But each of these decisions is utterly real: the captain really would have killed him if one of the other characters had died. And late in the episode he plays a practical joke on the doctor by telling her she's died which is pitch perfect. It is a mark of pure craftsmanship that good writing and characterization runs through every episode.So I got tired of Tivoing the re-runs on the Sci Fi Channel and ordered up the DVDs. They're nicely packaged and you'll enjoy them many times over. Firefly is a small gem, but a brilliant one."	5.0	"One of the very best, or, ""me too"""	2005-09-27	11	10	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	Needless to say, Firefly is one of my favorite TV series. And, needless to say, I already own the DVD version. Now, that I finally bought me the Blu rendition, I can say that Firefly in Blu is, definitely... a SMALL improvement over the DVD and I am not sure that the slightly better DTS HD 5.1 sound and the marginally brighter, clearer picture can justify paying twice for Firefly.Personally, I am not unhappy with my purchase. The Blu version IS better and I already gave the DVD away to a friend. Not everybody may agree that the this edition's improvements are worth getting it.Briefly:- Contentwise, a couple of extras were added to whatever was inherited from the DVD edition, everything nicely squeezed on 3 discs.- Packaging is pretty neat, not much thicker than a one-disc Blu box.- As I mentioned already, the sound gets a clear upgrade with DTS HD 5.1.- I agree with the other reviewers that the CGI appears fuzzier than the rest of the content, probably because they were produced by the computer on a resolution lower than 1080. This makes the CGI objects to 'stand out' clearly and visibly on top of the 'real world' filmed backgrounds and they do so more than in the DVD version where they are seamless. Luckily, there's not A LOT of CGI in Firefly.- The non-CGI content is of a better quality but, clearly, the original producers had to make do with a rather tight budget and I suspect that they couldn't afford the very best in cameras and image processing.In the end, I might have splurged on this purchase with no very good or easy to defend reasons but it's good to know that at least a little change off what I paid is going to end up in the pockets of those nice people involved in making this too short-lived but already a classic TV series.	4.0	Incrementally better than the DVD, some extra content, improved sound	2009-06-27	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1RS0P7CPT6LA3	"Adeptus ""_adeptus_"""	"I've just scanned through the 313 (as of the start of this posting) reviews of the Firefly DVD series.  By my count there were but 8 negative reviews (2 or less stars) and 2 middling (3 stars.)  Over 96% of the reviewers here enjoyed the series enough to rate it, overwhelmingly, 5 stars.Also, at the start of this review, the DVD is #13 on Amazon's current ""Top Sellers"" list.  It's moved up 5 slots in as many hours.  Clearly, this is an excellent series.  Which begs the question: Why the *heck* did Fox cancel it?!  I mean, what the crap were they thinking, gorramit!  Those ruttin' stuffed suits  have their heads jammed so far up their fouth points of contact that they can't understand how lack of advertisement, constant preemption, episode shuffling and general abuse and neglect of even the *best* series on television (for which I believe Firefly is a definite contender) will *obviously* result in low viewership.!  !  !As you can tell, I liked this show, but to give you some perspective I'll tell you that I am a definite Sci-Fi fan, but I'm very demanding.  I won't watch any piece of luh-suh with laser guns in it for very long unless it's got good acting, a decent plot line and just the right amount of special effects.  For instance, I didn't get into B5 (much to my chagrin) because I felt that the acting in the first episode was very stilted and that there was a lack of chemistry amongst the players.  (I know, I missed the boat on that one.)Also, I'm not a Joss Whedon fan (well I am *now*.)  I'd seen a few episodes of Buffy and Angel, and liked 'em well enough, but not so much that I'd set aside time to watch them.  Firefly would have been set in stone on my schedule (had they kept it at a regular time.  Had they kept it.)  This show had it all, great acting and chemistry.  It's hard to believe that the cast hadn't already been working together for years.  Excellent writing and developing story.  One of my peeves with SciFi series is that they tend to string you along (i.e. Voyager) and just when you think something wonderful or dreadful has happened, at the end of the episode, they're right back where they started - nothing changes.  From the few episodes I'd seen of Firefly, and having listened to commentary and interviews, I *know* that would not be the case.  *This* story would have evolved.  It also had great special effects that weren't overstated.  The focus of this series was the characters, not explosions and laser blasts in space.  Also, I must say that I was initially very skeptical of the Space/Western fusion, but Whedon didn't just pull it off, he made a new genre in my opinion.If you want quality TV, buy this DVD Set.

Thanks to Fox's refusal to advertise the series, I didn't know about it until it was too late. I am a fan of all things Whedon (Buffy &amp; Angel), but even I have to admit that this truely is his swan song. The cast is perfectly intune with their characters and each other. This show is filmed so cinematically it feels like you are watching 1 hour movies, not episodes. The special effects are phenomenal. The 14 episodes made me laugh, cry, but mostly they made me mad (this is what going mad feels like), because there are no more. I pray for a movie and until then I watch and rewatch my episodes, you should do the same. Take my love, Take my land, Take me where I cannot stand.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVPB9P7ZPE88S	"Adrien Boudreau ""Farmer A"""	This series is the brainchild of writer/director Joss Whedon (whom you might remember from the Buffy and Angel series).  He has a wonderful sense of ensemble cast dynamics and a terribly witty writing style(Swearing in Chinese is a nice touch).  This series is action comedy at it's finest.  Even the theme song, which Joss wrote his-multitalented-self, is catchy.The characters are well developed and uniquely funny(even the witless thug Jayne is endearing at times) and the interaction they have with eachother are complex and quirky.  The swearing in Chinese is a nice touch.The acting is also excellent.  Nathan Fillion is especially superb as the saavy Captain Malcolm Reynolds.  From the interviews I saw in the box set, everyone in the cast really felt a part of something great and loved working on the project.  Their enthusiasm shows through.  Each person brings his/her own strength to the table.The series starts out a little slow on the plot side, focusing more on developing the characters and mis en scene.  You can tell he had big dreams for this series and was going to develop a rich and entertaiing story, but studio executives wanted more whiz bang right away.  For some reason they didn't give the series much of a chance and cancelled in the first season.  The box set tells air dates for the episodes and includes the unreleased ones.I'm hoping that the theatrical release of the firefly movie Serenity will evoke enough interest to jumpstart the series again.  After watching the final episode in the set, I was left wanting more of the witty camaraderie and tricky plots.  There are a lot of questions left unanswered (maybe some will be revealed in the movie) and a feeling that there are many adventures still to come.Unfortunately, the execs didn't feel the same.  But I, for one, am delighted to add this box set to my DVD library and look forward to Joss's future projects.	5.0	Joss Whedon vs. studio executives	2005-09-06	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1CNDQIH0RRHS1	Adrienne B.	"Firefly is an absolutely amazing show. It's set mostly in space and some offworld places. If you can picture a sort of ""space cowboy"" feel that is what it reminds me of. Each individual episode is brilliant in its own right. And it is very easy to fall in love with all the characters; even River. It is very disappointing however to find out that this is the one and only season this show was allowed. The day this show was cancelled was a very sad day for television.However on a sidenote, Firefly had such a huge fanbase, that they were able to raise enough money to make a movie sequel so that the characters (all played by the same actors) and show could have some closure.Anyway this show is very entertaining and fun to watch. The characters are very appealing and they have some really humorous ""one-liners"" that just help to make the show great. They have the perfect actors playing their perfect roles phenomenally. It has a great overall plot, though I would have loved to see more development about River and the group that has the ""hands of blue.""

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJZVT9VC79MXS	A Fan	"In a long running series of stupid cancellations by stupid networks, this has to be THE stupidest. Before we get too far into recriminations and name-calling, let's start at the beginning, where one should start.I am a SciFi fan, but not overly so. I do not attend convetions, I don't know the names of every secondary character on every show, I don't collect memoribilia, and I do have a fairly wide field of interest which includes things other than adventures in space. Yes, I watched Star Trek, Star Wars and  other SciFi shows and films, and I do own DVDs of Stargate SG1, but that's about it. I like SciFi, but I don't go overboard with it. That is why I sat through about 10 minutes of Firefly on TV when it first premiered and then shrugged it off. In addition to being shown on a Friday night which is a night out for me, the show just didn't interest me. I barely remember the show.Couple of months ago, a friend of mine mentioned that he bought the Firefly DVD and was blown away by it. I thought he'd gone mad. This usually mild mannered fellow became enraptured over some silly western in space. I resisted his invitations to borrow the discs, I simply did not want to waste my time with a show that was cancelled and a WESTERN IN SPACE, for crying out loud.I finally gave in. Well. I am now a converted fan. I watched all the episodes in two nights. I bought my own DVD. I follow every bit of info about the series and the upcoming film. I've gone nuts. This can't be good for my health.Acting: fantastic. The ensamble is great even at this early stage of the show. They gel very well, almost as though they've been doing the show for a number of seasons.Stories: creative. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, there is a twist. I thought that the horsees and western themes would be a disaster, instead, they are so well executed as to be totally believable and more importantly enjoyable.Sets: could this be the reason the show failed? The sets are rich and look VERY expensive. Perhaps the moneybags got nervous about spending so much money? Whatever the reason, the sets are very, very good. The neat and clean sets of other scifi series are not here, and it's a good thing as it adds to ""realism"" of the show.Cinematography and CGI: Oh, yes. Bravo on both. Well done and finally, realistic portrayal of outer space, with no sound effects.I could go on and heap further praise on ths show, however, others have done that already. I will simply say that I am exteremly upset with FOX and their decision to cancel the show. To FOX: you guys messed up big time. You started off by NOT showing the pilot episode, instead jumping right into the action. A universe as rich and complex as the one gifted to us by Joss Whedon, deserves and needs a proper introduction, giving us a chance to get used to the characters and setting. As I've said at the top of the review: start at the beginning, you... you... bad people.Firefly vs other scifi:1. Firefly2. Battlestar Galactica (new series)3. Star Trek The Next Generation4. Stargate SG-15. X-Files.I do hope the film is successful. I would love to see Firefly make a return to TV screens. Perhaps the SciFi channel can pick it up and dump some of the gosh aweful stuff that passes for scifi these days."	5.0	The stupidest thing I've ever seen.	2005-01-27	19	17	2

The success of this disk set is an indication that DVD sales could actually be a good forum for Joss and Company to distribute future episodes of Firefly. I for one would be willing to pay a few extra bucks for DVDs and cancel my Cable subscriptions. Who needs reality TV, shopping channels and sit-coms.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2JD5RTJG1YO81	afeitarse	Ever since a certain late 60's sci-fi sitcom (*ahem* trek) laid the groundwork for the genre, we've gotten more of the same: cheesy, heartwarming, and optimistic to the point of idiocy. This is nice in some cases (Star Wars), but, let's be frank, we've all had enough. This is the 21st century and we can handle something more than that.So along comes 'Firefly'! It's irreverent, playful, and funny, but it maintains a realism and seriousness that gives much more weight than most sci-fi. Kudos to the writers for having the courage to put characters and relationships before mindless techno babble! Sci-Fi isn't really about realigning the Tacheon pulse beam or what will go wrong with the holodeck in the next episode. It's about creating a world different than our own, but one inhabited by people not much different than us. This way, no matter how foreign the world is, we feel a connection to it and are drawn in. That's what 'Firefly' does and that's what makes it so satisfying to watch.And check out 'Serenity' in your local theathers on Sept 30th!	5.0	What sci-fi should be!	2005-08-02	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"Firefly is like no other television program.  Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair.  How could it go wrong?  A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets.  Why did it only last one season?  Marketing.  FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the ""fair and balanced"" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness.  For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago.  Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap?  Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting ""reality"" television?  From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be ""yes"".  Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, ""why"".  Yet, in all of its power, it was cancelled.Firefly is perfection on a stick.  The twang of the guitar, the stone-face stare of Mal, the goofiness of Jayne (is that a girls name?), the questionable past of Shepard Book, the humor of Wash, the power of Zoe, and the innocence of Kaylee is exactly why I fell in love with this show.  This is honestly, one of the few series that I could go back from the beginning and watch again, loving every moment of it.  Whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes, and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive.While some will argue that Firefly was full of nothing more than C-rated actors who were ""shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom"", I thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming. I wanted to know the truth behind River and the darkness behind the good Shepard.  I continually waited for a snappy comeback from Mal, and was excited whenever he showed humility.  Jayne was a big favorite of mine, always questioning authority, yet as loyal as the family dog.  The love between Zoe and Wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci-fi series.  It wasn't just about paying for the ship, flying through unmapped terrain, or stealing, it was about humanity.  That sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled ""Serenity"".  In it, the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo.  Inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever.  For this series to work successfully, as it did, we needed human characters that bled, felt compassion, and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us.  Mal's ship, Serenity, was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally.The characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them.  Listening to the words that pass through Mal's mouth, the charm of Wash, or even the inconsistent ramblings of River, you could only wonder where Whedon could have gone with all of them.  In each of these characters, Whedon had written secrets.  While, sadly, we may never know what they all were, that is what made you itch for more episodes.  You not only wanted to see the creative ""western"" adventures that Whedon was sending his crew, but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades.  They were good, but possibly darkness reigned inside of them.  The character most guilty of this (outside of River) was Shepard Book.  I loved this character.  Whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction, yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable.  He is an excellent example of what this series was like.  He represented the smart words of Whedon, the humanity of his character, and the secrets that each of these shared.  He was a ""priest"", yet he knew more about the Alliance than anyone aboard that ship.  If anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words, I would simply say, ""Shepard Book"".George Lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future, or a galaxy far far away, Whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not-too-distant future of 500 years.  Prostitution in legal, in fact respected in the community, the Chinese and Americans have forged one super power called the Alliance, and our hero is a war veteran, still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the Alliance control.  While Lucas gives us far-fetched characters and situations, Whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future.  I think that is why this series worked so well for me.  I could imagine this future.  I could see it past the characters.  I wasn't bogged down by dopey looking aliens, but instead a plausible man vs. man situation.  Firefly was simple, yet so complex.I could honestly go on forever about how much I enjoyed this show.  I have never watched a series where I found myself prepared to watch over and over again. Firefly blends a power mixture of comedy, western, and action all together ... and the characters bleed.  Villains die in this series.  How often do you see that?

Yet, I never even knew this fantastic show, ""Firefly"", even existed. After taking a leap and purchasing this DVD set (after watching the movie ""Serenity""), I will unabashedly admit that, in my opinion, this show blows Joss' other two completely out of the water. A fantastic theme song (that I just spent time trying to figure out on the acoustic) leads into possibly the greatest sci-fi TV show ever made (apologies to Trek and Galactica fans). Very funny how many actors turned up on this show that were on Joss' other shows. At least he is loyal! Great writing, phenomenal acting, very good special effects for a TV show budget, I will be loaning this DVD set out to everyone I know in the hopes of sharing how great this series is (was).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A28QJTKQY0LS7P	"A. Havel ""angelsong76"""	I have to admit, I watched from the beginning.  I started because I heard about it from a friend who watched Buffy.  Honestly, I loved it from the first five minutes.  And some have commented on the theme song.. I loved that too!  Never have I seen such an original, funny, interesting and compelling show on TV.  And now we have the movie to look forward to..Although you don't need to see the show to understand the movie, you should still buy the DVD set for the background and then go see Serenity on 9/30/05!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3UP79N9BFBECF	A. Hawley	Firefly was one of those rare TV shows whose early demise made me genuinely sad. I don't know how many other &quot;failed&quot; series have grown in stature and popularity after cancellation, but this DVD release is sure to make Firefly one of them.This treasure-trove contains the entire series in its correct order--far more logical and engaging than the order in which the network mindlessly aired it--including three episodes never broadcast during the Fox TV run in the U.S. In addition, all episodes are shown in wide-screen as the producers originally intended. The sound is crystal-clear. Cast-and-creators commentaries (available on about half of the episodes) are enjoyable and informative. AND there's an extras feature with gags and bloopers.With the minor exception of the slightly unattractive menus, everything about these DVDs is top-notch, as befits this outstanding series. For me it was like Christmas. Only three weeks early.	5.0	&quot;Shiny!&quot;	2003-12-15	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A12NQ4FPP2CXDE	A. Horowitz	"We're always taught that history is determined by the winners. We usually don't bother to find out what happened to the losing side, even though their story may be the more interesting one.  Firefly distinguishes itself from other TV shows by following Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a former soldier who fought on the losing side of a civil war.Earth's resources have been used up, and humans have colonized another galaxy.  A civil war was fought over whether the galaxy should be unified under one government, or if each planet should be independent.  The ""Independents"", including Malcolm Reynolds, lost this war, and now have to find a place for themselves in a universe that does not want them there.Firefly strikes the perfect balance between sci-fi and western; it has the exciting technology of a sci-fi classic, yet has the down-to-earth feel of a western, helping viewers to better connect with the characters.  While most sci-fi shows are about the action and the technology, Firefly circles around character development, following the outcasts of society: war veterans, fugitives, a preacher in a place where religion is not popular, etc.  While only 14 episodes, each character in Firefly will find a place in your heart, leading to you craving more.Although Firefly won't give you something to watch for an entire summer, it will give you a show you can watch in one weekend with a group of friends.  It's the type of show you can watch over and over again, and there are always connections to be made that you missed the first time."	5.0	History is often told by the winners	2012-05-25	3	3	0

(I vaguely knew about it when it was out but could never find it when it was on then it was gone.)  From the first line of the first disc to the last, we watched it straight through on a Sunday and were hooked!  I loved the series and all the characters.  They did a terrific job of truly tying all of them together so that each was interwoven through out all episodes and each was an integral part of show.  I'm not sure that the notion that this is a ""sci-fi western"" ever really covers it.  Yes, it's in space and yes, it has a feel of a western but it's more than that and becomes less than that as the story goes on so don't let either of those labels scare you off."	5.0	Can't say enough good things about this one!	2007-06-15	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PDN9AI5TQYB0	Aiken	I understand that not everyone is keen on science fiction, and further that many would giggle at a scifi western, so I guess it didn't surprise me that somehow Firefly was given a terrible timeslot and was dispatched before the first season was even finished.Those of us who gave Firefly a chance were absolutely bereft when it was taken from us.  We stayed home on Friday nights or we exercised our VCRs and TiVos.  We took it on faith that, just as Buffy did not turn out to be 90210 with vampires, so too would this not turn out to be the Lone Ranger with spaceships, and we were right to do so.  It was witty and charming, fun and interesting.  After a few episodes, we gave a damn about the characters.  It had the potential to be another Buffy for Joss Whedon.  In my opinion, it already was.  Alas, it was science fiction, very expensive to produce when produced as well as Firefly was, and not geared to appeal to the lowest common denominator, so in tough economic times it was cancelled in favor of inexpensive and popular reality television.If you like Joss Whedon's other work, buy these DVDs and watch every episode.  Even though you'll lack closure in the end, you'll be glad you did.  Try it, you'll understand.  Then join the rest of us in wishing Joss luck getting a Firefly movie off the ground.	5.0	What a loss.  At least we will have this to remember it by.	2003-09-20	4	3	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25JLR1WKWU1WM	"A. I. Manousakis-katsikakis ""Senior Partner"""	It seems, even to me, to call a t.v show, a work of art. But let's face it, that's what it is.I'll go back a couple of months. I knew nothing of Whedon's wit and wisdom, i was under the impression, BtVS sucked--i kinda liked the movie you see and learning years ago, that it was made into a t.v show, kinda freaked me. I would laugh in your face, if you told me, BtVS can stand in comparison with Citizen Kane.Now, a devotee in the Whedonverse, i worship every little bit of whedon's work. Having watched Buffy, Angel on DVD--actually i have yet to see season 5, but i bet it rocks-- and Firefly (for which i had my doubts, but you must excuse me for that, 'cause i was only halfway into the Buffyverse) i can say for sure that Kubrick, Leone and Gilliam have found their match!So, that brings us to Firefly, a DVD totally worth its (amazon) price. Excellent dvd features--i still have to listen to a bunch of commentaries, but lemme tell you, Joss Whedon rocks, if you have listened to his Buffy commentaries and loved them... well let's say, you haven't HEARD nothin' yet(this being his commentary in Objects in Space)! Funny little gag-reel, although i'd love a huge gag-reel since i am sure there is one, Joss always has some rib tickling anecdotes to mention in his commentaries. And several other clips and documentaries, i don't really have much to say about those--NAthan Fillion's video is fun to watch etc--.The main feature: I suppose if you have come all the way to amazon, in order to buy the DVD, you must know or have seen the episodes. But anyways, a quick summary: Captain Reynolds and co-fighter Zoe Warren, are on the opposite side of the law, having lost some kind of intergalactic civil war, they become thiefs. They shape up their crew and battle for freedom and... cash! Moral ambiguity ensues(unlike Buffy's mission statement and morality, firefly moves to another level) , even the priest, of the ship, says at some point, that even if the bible is clear about killing people, it's fuzzy around the area of kneecaps...And to top all things, comes one of the single greatest episodes in the history of T.V, Objects in Space, for which you should really listen to the commentary(which i mentioned above) to completely comprehend its depth. And ofcourse great performances all the way round. I shall say nothing about how genius the writing is or how cool the visuals are, you already know that!Plus, there are a lot of sex jokes, you know for the kids! ;)	5.0	One of the best works of art.

I admit I wasn't too sure about the whole western/sci-fi thing.So, we pop the first CD in, start up the first episode, and 10 minutes later....WE WERE HOOKED. This series is probably some of the best work I've ever seen and I've watched a lot over my years. The dry humor, the characters, the storylines-fantastic. We were SO disappointed when the last CD finished-we wanted more! We watched the entire series this weekend, front to back.Afterwards, I was trying to figure out why the heck the show had been canceled. My guess is FOX is afraid of quality television?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQFSP18QA411T	Aire26	I watch TV but had never even heard of this series, until an enthusiastic friend loaned me her DVD set and I put it on one night - amazingly, I have now become uncharacteristically obsessed with this show. It's incredibly, incredibly good! It's a western/sci fi so yes there's a lot of action, but it's also laugh out loud funny, poignant, romantic, and mysterious (it's also truly sexual and erotic occasionally). The characters are some of the best ever written for TV and the actors are just picture perfect in the roles. I cannot believe how likeable they are - all of them.Much to my regret, I did not see Serenity in theaters because I totally missed the entire buzz surrounding this film and its Firefly background. Since I've become obsessed as I've said, I did some research on the web and it's clear that there is a huge following for Firefly, and within this set, Serenity was the event of the year. But I do not think marketing was done properly for this film outside of that group and now it looks like Serenity sadly has not done very well. Everyone hooked into the sci fi world knows about this show, but I think it needed to be marketed to a wider audience like me - someone who isn't necessarily a sci fi fan but who will devoutly watch a show with a great storyline, acting, poignancy and humor. The one good news about the film is that I think it brought more people to view the series DVD.In any case, the question now is, how can this show be brought back? There is so much more great story-telling to be done for this series and it will be a TRAGEDY if it never gets told. So any creative ideas? If a network such as HBO or Sci Fi picks it up, I'd be willing to bet that millions of viewers will happily pay weekly/monthly fees to keep the show going (set up a special PayPal account?). Or alternatively, we can set up a special fundraiser and have all the fans chip in so that a check can be handed to a network as a down payment to pick it back up. I don't think I'm being Pollyannaish in saying that I think this can raise tens of millions of dollars. Firefly can be the first truly viewer supported series on TV. Over the years there have occassionally been new TV shows that got cancelled which I've liked.  I regretted them but got over it pretty fast.  Firefly is different. Something has to be done here....it simply cannot die like this...it's just too damn good.	5.0	What can we do to bring this series back? I'll pay and pay a lot!	2005-11-18	19	18	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2MUFVIKKPT0EM	AJ1905	"Annual watching and find myself ever more perplexed that this show, the best of the Whedon's in my HO, was axed by an undiscerning network.  Especially in light of all the irritating and vacuous reality shows that get money pumped into them. Can't decide if the show's genius is that the elusive and rich characterisations were hinted at and never quite realised.  Having said this I can't help contemplating that Angel and Buffy finished beautifully but, in my opininon, the writing team were powerful enough that they could have continued to emotionally and intellectually plumb the story for years without hitting a dry note (particularly Angel with the intro of the Spike/Angel dynamic in the last season).  In the absence of reality as I know it I can't conceive of a world where I wouldn't have been an ardent fan of an ongoing Firefly series.  However, I am guilty of never watching anything on regular tv (ads are so irritating) and only watch dvds.  But, hello network of 2003, you failed to appreciate the changing world where there are heaps like me who revel in dvd (ad free) releases.  I just had to post my deep sense of narrative incompletion that the Serenity movie just doesn't quite satisfy (still loved it though).  Firefly truly was a ""story with scope"" but I will always feel like I'm forever looking through a lens fixed permanently on only a tiny part of a rich landsacape.  This makes me feel gloomy because nearly ten years have passed and most of the actors have moved on to other successful parts (Castle, Homeland, Suits, Chuck) and the unique chemistry they develoepd is now lost forever."	5.0	Still mystified	2012-09-09	2	2	0

Wonderful characters, very good acting, good settings. Nice balance of heroic and ridiculous. Real emotions and real reactions to developing situations. I lately feel fed up with grandiose special effects and Firefly's gritty feeling of frontier reality was wonderfully refreshing.The thing to do for Fox would be to re-start the series while the cast is still available (and close in age to the Firefly crew).

The writing is flawless, the world is believable, and the story is entrhalling.Often, when my husband and I have company over, we bring out Firefly so we can bring a few more people into the fan club.

There was so much potential in this series, so many tales that beg to be told, but Fox killed that all.  I never even heard of Firefly while it was on TV, but now it is the first TV series that I have bought on DVD.  I even saw the movie.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A19PVHJPVRZV0D	Alden	Firefly is not for everyone; after all, the show was canceled by Fox TV after only a few episodes. But for those it IS for, it's a real gem; users at the Internet Movie Database (imbd.com) give it a 9.5 rating - higher than any movie ever, and higher than any other TV series I've come across). Other polls have rated it the best sci-fi show of all time.Firefly is both sci-fi and a western, both comedy and drama, with an ensemble cast that clearly enjoyed working together - all of which contribute to what is for me the most enjoyable thing about Firefly: Every genre, every story - including Firefly. - runs according to certain established patterns, certain formulas, certain clich&eacute;s; but Firefly abounds with subtle and casual departures from these patterns. The departures may be just a few words of dialog, a minor character's reaction to some situation, or the way a whole episode turns out. The result though is an all-pervasive sense of mystery and delight to the viewing experience.I won't offer any specifics on these departures. For one thing, it all works just fine without being aware of any. For another, the enjoyment of these subtle departures is far greater when discovered on your own. Watching Firefly episodes is a bit like eating chocolate cake or drinking a fine wine; you can do it again and again and enjoy the experience every time.The Firefly series, having been canceled early on, didn't get to properly end, or even develop, during its TV incarnation. But it did, a few years later, get to have a well received feature movie called Serenity come out as both a sequel and series finale.  When I first saw Serenity in a theater, I'd never even heard of Firefly and so found nothing particularly wonderful about it. But then I did hear of Firefly, saw the whole series on DVD, and saw Serenity again. Amazing! Astounding! Wonderful!	5.0	Best of the best	2007-03-08	2	2	0

Intelligent folks or at least folks who want to sound intelligent are always disparaging the ""junk"" on TV. To be sure they have a point. With the proliferartion of garbage on the box it's easy to overlook a real gem in a sea of manure.Firefly is that gem.I never got to see the show when it was broadcast and I guess I should be thankful for that. Had I discovered it and gotten hooked only to have it yanked out from under me would have been an extreme disappointment. At least now when I bought the DVD set I knew it was finite and limited so I cherished each episode that much more.Firefly is the most imaginative television show ever broadcast. It was intelligent, fun, funnny, touching and poignant. The ensemble cast had to be the best fit with each other I've ever seen, and the writing, oh the writing. Any episode would have worthy of a full length motion picture, and better than 95% of the motion pictures out there.I watched the series on disk at a rate of one per day until the third disk. Then I stopped and went at it on per week to extend the experience until the inevitable end.The series is difficult to classify. Is it a Sc-Fi/Western as others have described? Maybe, but that simple description seems inadequate to understanding Firefly in all it's nuances.I think it is a celebration of freedom more than anything. All human desires distilled into a form that is at once entertaining and profound.I am not sure of FOX's motivation for even producing it to begin with since if it fulfilled it's promise it would have had to been exactly what the network claimed it was and the reaosn for cancelling it to begin with. They said it was too deep or two complex for the average viewer. Well boys, that had to be obvious before putting the first scene to film. Had that been the case the show would have never been authorized to begin with.So we have a mystery. No matter. It's limit is also what makes it more valuable. Enjoy each episode knowing it will end and it will make each one that much sweeter.Bravo to the cast the crew and to Joss Whedon for chasing a dream and bringing it to life.TV doesn't get any better than this."	5.0	Proof that TV is not a lost cause	2004-08-26	13	12	1

It had fantastic writing, by arguably one of the most creative minds in television today, Joss Whedon, and his brilliant staff of writers. The cast was one of the best groups of actors ever gathered, each bringing a beautiful facet to the show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NXGK1L6P2D4D	Alex D. Mcconnell	Not since M*A*S*H have I seen a show so perfectly blend drama and humor. The quality of this show is at a level normally only seen in movies, and the fact that the writers, directors, producers and actors were capable of producing this week after week says much about their abilities. Sadly, FOX destroyed any chance of the show's success with misleading advertising, bad scheduling and by rejecting a wonderful two-hour pilot episode, forcing the creators, Joss Whedon & Tim Minear, to come up with a mediocre one-hour pilot that was rushed, introduced the characters very poorly and clumsily, and proved to be by far the worst episode of the series. (still better than most television though) Thankfully, Whedon loves this project, and it looks like Firefly may well be making the jump to movies faster than any show in the history of television.Simply put, Firefly is the best television show I have ever seen.	5.0	Like no other show on television	2003-07-23	66	60	6

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GYJRW6IRMS3L	Alfred J. Badger	"I have been a Sci Fi fan for over 40 years and must admit that traditional popular Sci Fi shows such as the  ""Star"" thing-a-ma-bobs (like  Star Trek to Star Wars to Star Gate)  have lost their appeal because of over domestication of its honorable warrior aliens and save-the-world plots. All the formally great shows like those  have evolved from shows with unique aliens and story lines to episodes with human centric invaders and aliens. The story lines got boring and the tame aliens were taking themselves too seriously to be considers serious Sci Fi. I was losing interest in Sci Fi and figured the era of unique Sci Fi had gone the way of the dinosaurs.Then came  Fox's best kept secret:  Firefly.Why is it the best kept secret? Well, I only saw one commercial years ago about the series airing. However, I am a busy person; and for about two years, I could not find the show and forgot about it until it appeared on the Sci Fi channel less than a year ago. If a die hard Sci Fi fan like me and my friends couldn't find the series even when we looked, then  Fox could have advertised much better than it did. Sadly enough, Fox did us Sci Fi fans a disservice in not getting the message out. Had enough of us known about the series when it first aired, we could have blown the ratings out of the blackhole where Fox promoters hid Firefly so deeply.Anyway, I was hooked on the show on the first showing. There are no aliens of which to speak, which makes it a little Asmovian (aka Isaac Asimov), but that is all right. The characters are down-to-earth people trying to survive as best they can in an environment hostile to most. The actors are natural in the roles and have great timing in delivering some of the more humorous lines.The Wild, Wild West theme and the characters trying to survive works well in this context. However, the appeal does not stop there. Being speakers Chinese as a second language, my family and I particularly enjoy the scenes where the characters interject Mandarin Chinese into their dialogue. One scene in particular that I found endearing was when the doctor referred to his little sister as ""Mei, Mei"", which is a tender Chinese term for ""Little Sister.""The writers must be geniuses to incorporate a language, which more than a billion people speak today. It made me wonder about the marketing possibilities of the show overseas, but I digress.To continue, the injected humor based on the imperfect nature of people, the establishment, and the universe make the series not only more entertaining but also truer to what we might expect of the future where humanity is still exists. You would find nothing like this in the perfectly ethical Jon Lu Picard or his Federation in the Star Trek: Generations, where everyone and everything takes themselves too seriously.To conclude, I can only hope that the release of the movie Serenity will revive the series so more Sci Fi fans can get a chance to enjoy this Space Western know as Firefly. I am just afraid that it may be too late to change the minds of the Fox decision makers, who probably never watched the series or really cared enough to check the reason why this show wasn't getting the ratings they wanted. Well, the simple answer is that no one told us about it. If the show really does get cancelled in the end, it will be our lost; and that is a shame."	5.0	Fox's Best Kept Secret:	2005-09-29	19	17	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A28MYC8KKCK2FZ	Alice L. Moore	"This ranks as a great sci-fi/futuristic fantasy series.  There is a strong ensemble cast and a strong plot premise.Firefly is set 500 years in the future.  In this future it is more like the Wild Wild West than the Jetsons.  Illnesses like diabetes are present and cat gut surgery are used to treat injury.  Any future in depth space exploration would be for resources and colonization.  It also shows the prevailing earth power in the future would be authoritarian with the Chinese prevalent.  In the Alliance they have the Prime worlds as shown in the episode ""Ariel"" and in flashbacks to River's childhood.  These worlds are what you may see in ""Star Trek"" or pre occupation Caprica on BSG.  The outer worlds have a lower standard of living.  This does make sense.  In the 17th century North America and South America were dependent on shipments from the Old World(readThe Winthrop Woman: A NovelThe Winthrop Woman by Anya Seton)just as a comparison.If you like more emphasis on technology this may not be the show for you.  This show is character driven.  Some reviewers fault the science for being dodgy but this is true of ALL of the sci-fi series.  This show is also short on idealism as exhibited in shows like Star Trek or Star Wars.All of the episodes have something to recommend them.  The series raises interesting questions about the Reavers and River Tamm.  The movie SerenitySerenity (Widescreen Edition)is recommended as a follow up for that.In summary, Firefly, the series is an excellent ensemble drama in the tradition of Star Trek and Star Wars(liking one doesn't mean that you have to dislike the others)."	5.0	Firefly	2007-09-26	6	5	1

What's there to know, well it's set 500 years in the future, where the Earths resources have been used up, so a whole new verse full or planets and moons have been terraformed to support the human race, some are rich with new technologies, some not so much....The series is amazing, it takes charecter-driven stories, with an ensemble cast, fantastic script writing, award winning special effects and then adds that little bit of &quot;Wheadon Wit&quot;, that fan of Buffy and Angel are all too familiar with.Basically it's an intelligent SciFi drama with moments of intense levity.....If your looking for somthing that doesn't treat you like a four-year-old (&quot;STar Trek - The Next Generation&quot;, for example), buy this DVD NOW!!!	5.0	Good Old Fashioned Strory Telling!	2004-05-09	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FUSHJ71BMMP3	Allie H.	There are countless firefly fans out there in the world who will tell you the exact same thing, that this show shouldn't have been canceled. There are also countless firefly fans out there who never had the chance to watch the show when it originally aired.Please, watch these episodes and see how amazing Joss Wedon is and how he brings such power to characters whom you hate to love as much as you do. Mal will take you to the far reaches of the universe in such a short period of time and the finale will leave you with so many unanswered questions that you will want to cry, but you'll go back in a month or two and rewatch them all because these characters in such a short time have ripped their ways into your hearts.This is a show that brings people together, and that just shows you how amazing Joss is that he could do this to all of us fans, that he could make us connect with every character to the point that even ten years from now someone is going to be fighting to bring firefly back.	5.0	A show ahead of it's time...	2013-06-08	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A14GC8O61RXFT9	Alp	I'm a fan of Joss Whedon's work (Buffy, Angel, Toy Story, ...) and yet I didn't watch this show when it was on the air. I'm very sorry about that because I just finished watching the series on DVD and it's full of engrossing stories and real characters. The crew is made of real people, nobody is a larger-than-life hero. They all have their strengths and weaknesses.One problem I had with the series was that there is Mandarin sprinkled in the dialogue, but the subtitles don't translate it.  I understand Mandarin, but the actors don't have a good Chinese accent and most of the time I couldn't understand what they were saying (the longer phrases). For those, I had to refer to the different web sites that show the translation.The series leaves you with lots of questions because it was cancelled prematurely. But it was still worth watching and I will watch it all over again. Good news is that there will be a movie that hopefully will tie all the lose ends.	5.0	Why did it get cancelled?	2004-11-23	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2TCAP5M1GK5CN	"Alun Lewis ""Amateur media critic"""	Firefly is one of the best TV series of the past 20 years, if only for how well it gelled as a product within what is normally considered half of a North American TV season and the chemistry between the cast members! This show was the initial proof that Nathan Fillion could be a charismatic leading that ABC has bet on for the last 6 years with the hit dramedy &#34;Castle,&#34; along with being a major stepping stone for getting its various leads more face time to show off their acting talents.If you like Westerns?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A36EYBB0QS4YFI	alyssumz	It is impossible for too much to be said about the merits of this amazing yet short-lived performance. (I shy from calling it a &quot;tv show&quot; because it is so much more than that.) I watch very little television, but I distinctly remember previews to Firefly, and wanted to see it but never did while it was aired, which is probably due to the terrible scheduling by our good friends at FOX. Fortunately some friends taped it and I watched all the episodes, pilot first (again - cheers to FOX for not airing the pilot first.) I was absolutely astounded by the production - the characters, the story, the presentation, every detail is meticulously perfected. The combination of scifi/western is never forced, but seems like a natural progression of the human plight in the future. I, like hundreds of thousands of fans, am completely disheartened by the fact that one of the most entertaining performances ever given was hardly given a chance. I can't think of a single person who will not find something or some character to relate to. The DVDs have only strengthened my conviction to tell everyone I meet to watch Firefly. Do not miss this opportunity!	5.0	Why FOX? Why?	2003-12-28	3	3	0

I loved the characters, the stories, and the plot.I think Fox should stick to reality TV and never ever produce another real tv show again.

I can safely say without hesitation that Farscape and Firefly are two of the finest shows to grace our screens.Some folks may be uncomfortable with the idea of mixing a western with a space faring show.  (Not to disregard the point that the original Star Trek was marketed as Wagon Train in space.)  But within that context the show was superb.  I hope that with enough attention, Fox may reconsider picking the show up again.  Or perhaps another network will get wise to it.The writing, directing, special effects, sound, and especially acting in this show were of the utmost caliber.  The characters all had charisma and, most importantly, chemistry.  It was a joy to watch.My wife hasn't let me delete the episodes off of Tivo until the DVDs came out.

In its original order, in widescreen format as originally shot, and with original content, before Firefly had to go back and change things in an effort to make it work for Fox.  The commentary itself is a reason to buy this set, never before have I seen and heard more passion from a cast and crew than those who had the pleasure to work on this show and who wholeheartedly believe that it is the most fulfilling work they will ever do.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1HNOGVSUXQR51	"Amazon Customer ""Author"""	"This show and its cast, writers, and crew deserve far more credit for this series and the film that came after it than was given them. The show was fresh and innovative, and yet bore a humble and lasting character reminiscent of old world values devoid in many of today's shows.These were characters refusing to live within the reign of a brilliant, yet repressive technocracy. They did all the things you might expect such outlaws to do, but with an underlying moral code that stood them out as unsung heroes rather than rag-tag hustlers.I am disappointed that no sequel appears to be in the works, but I for one applaud Nathan Fillion (Mal),Gina Torres (Zo), Alan Tudyk (Wash), Morena Baccarin (Inara), Adam Baldwin (Jayne), Jewel Staite (Kaylee), Sean Maher (Simon), Summer Glau (River), Ron Glass (Shephard Book), and Joss Whedon (Writer & Director) for making a wonderful show that our entire family still watches. We have bought the movie and the series, and they hold a special place in our collection.While we are on the subject, allow me to offer a bit of viewer praise for several aspects that I thought stood out in both the series and the film.Nathan Fillion's performance as Mal served as an enigma to me from the beginning. He was capable of making the hard choices to keep the ship and its primary crew safe even when the options were all unsavory. That quick and brutal hatchet of leadership made me wonder at first why anyone would serve with such a man. That was because I did not trust him, but as the series moved further along we viewers began to see the world through his eyes. We sampled in small doses the poison of this vile space empire and started to ask ourselves how anyone could NOT see the galaxy through Mal's perspective. Mal was such a strong character because his human frailty threatened to overwhelm him at any moment. He forced down that weakness and demanded better of himself, all the while with a wry humor that made him truly endearing.And Nathan Fillion played him. I'm not sure there's a better compliment for an actor out there.Adam Baldwin's ""Jayne"" is a refreshing distance from his usual upstanding, hard-nosed, straight-laced military officer type roles. Even his portrayal of Commander Casey on NBC's ""Chuck"" is no where near as lively and heart-felt as the rude, untrustworthy, and conniving Jayne. He is the living personification of the term ""mercenary"" and yet Adam never lets any of his former roles slip in. Jayne is always just one step away from total corruption. Jayne would have made the perfect nemesis for Mal except for two things; opportunity and wit.Joss Whedon, sir, this was a thoughtful hybrid genre that I never found overpowering. There was enough tech to keep one's feet firmly planted on the deck of the Serenity, and enough gun-slinging and damsel rescuing to keep its spirit of adventure alive. There was so much more to do with this show, so many avenues to explore, that this show could have gone almost ANYWHERE and been great. The writing was thoughtful, the dialogue well chosen and yet entirely believable. This cast was endearing and their work inspiring. You could feel that they loved working together, and that translated into a great show.I really enjoyed the show. If I had a billion dollars, I would not only invest in Serenity 2, but I would back it 100%. Once again, excellent show."	5.0	An excellent show cancelled before its time!	2012-01-08	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AIUUL89JGI07O	"Amazon Customer ""Avid Reader"""	"I miss FireFly!Star Trek was good but it always seemed to present such a one-sided view of the future.  The main characters didn't have flaws, they had blemishes.  They always rose above their blemishes to do the right things at the end of an hour.  Good and bad were pretty much black and white.Now FireFly showed a much more realistic possibility of the future.  The characters were more real, flaws and all.  There were so many indications of storylines to come that I was waiting each week for the new, the entertaining, and the sometimes silly.  What had happened to River and where was she heading?  The relationship between the Captain and the Companion?  The Shepherd that wasn't always a shepherd?  What did Wash do during the 'War'?  Bubbly Kaylee and the insecure Doctor?  They were an eclectic and an amazing group of people gathered for cross purposes, but became part of the family.My favorite moments was seeing the whole cast gathered around the mess table enjoying a great laugh.  But while the possibilities of potential stories was endless, the patience of a network to allow a new, and intricately creative, show find it's legs lasted only 11 shows.  It was a shame!  Fox gives something like Arrested Development two whole seasons to find an audience, but can't give FireFly 22 episodes.This DVD is great!  Being able to watch them in the order envisioned by their creative team was a blessing.  The extras add a little, but the real beauty is being able to watch each episode and the three never aired episodes.  It was well worth the price!  Share this with your friends who may have missed the short life of the series.Don't forget fan support convinced a lot of people to support a feature film of FireFly.  It's called ""Serenity"" ([...]) and it's being released on September 30, 2005.  Who knows maybe some network exec will see it and say ""Why don't we turn that movie into a series?"""	5.0	Looking forward to Serenity (FireFly motion picture Sep 30, 2005)	2005-08-31	8	7	1

I might have not fully understood how amazing this show is if I had seen it out of order. Recently, after reading nothing but the praise on this show heaped upon it by friends and colleagues, I broke down and purchased the DVD set, and boy am I glad I did. This has to be one of the most amazing pieces of televised storytelling I've ever seen. The characters are deep and fleshed-out. The writing is amazing, and the mixture of action and humor has never been more pleasing. The top-notch cast really got into their characters, and you can tell they they're having a ball. Overall, if you caught an episode on Fox and didn't &quot;get it&quot;, or if the successful mixture of Sci-fi and Western genre's appeals to you, do yourself an immense favor and pick up this DVD set.

I am not a huge fan of many TV shows in general, but this is one that I really enjoyed.  The fact that the networks decided to cancel it after one season just goes to show you how clueless TV executives can be.  Anyone who likes Sci-Fi will enjoy it.  Love the theme song as well.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2E7C1QQJMVAQJ	Amazon Customer	After hearing so much about this series I decided to try it on hulu.com. After the third episode I was hooked, and wanted to enjoy the rest on my couch instead of at my desk.Each episode is well thought out, the characters are interesting and the whole cast did an excellent job. While there are spaceships, there are no aliens. It's about people having to decide how to get by with, or in spite of others. I've finished the series and am looking forward to renting the movie Serenity.Watch each episode in order and savor them, you don't see good TV like this anymore.	4.0	Too bad it ended too soon	2008-07-09	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2000M71D9K4FM	Amazon Customer	"Firefly is unquestionably the best thing to air on television since Captain Kirk. It's a flawless blend of sci-fi, western, and drama. The acting is superb. I had a lot of difficultly disassociating Nathan Fillion from the role of Captain Malcolm Reynolds when I started watching Castle. Don't listen to the people who say this show could have been great if Fox had not canceled it. It is so good the way it is. Yes, I would have liked the first season to have been completed (there's no ""omg what next??"" that would seem to finalize the season). and perhaps another season or two, but the real magic is the depth of the character development, especially with Mal and Jayne. Oh, and don't bother watching the movie Serenity. It was awful."	5.0	Watch it. You will not be sorry.	2013-03-13	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3CD5UBRB6HRAD	Amazon Customer	Firefly was a series that was definitely ended way before it deserved to be ended. As in all great shows, the strongest part was the characters. Every character was very well developed, and I would have gladly followed the series to see their backstories unfold. Watching the characters interact with each other and the amount of nuance they displayed in different situations was incredible, It's a tribute to the outstanding quality of writing, directing, and acting that was put forth in this series.Another aspect I find very interesting is the vision of the human race 500 years in the future as imagined by the writers. It seems to take a more realistic approach than other sci-fi stories. There aren't alien creatures and technology has evolved at the rate that seems believable, if you consider the history of technology and the rate it has progressed.It's too bad. Fox gave up on a series that had the potential to be as big as the Star Trek franchise.I always recommend this series to my friends, whether they are fans of science fiction or not.	5.0	Just scratched the surface on a great series	2013-02-18	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A8DMQT6S54CZR	Amazon Customer	I can't believe this excellent series barely made it through one season.  For sci-fi lovers and non alike, this show had everything one could possible want.  The ensemble meshed immediately with each character being infinitely interesting, the action was crazy-fun, there was good humor, the plots were unique and interesting, there was a hint of romance, the violence wasn't too graphic......just an all-around fabulous show. I could have watched this for years.  It's so sad that it didn't make it. Big mistake, in my opinion.  I think it would have gained a huge audience, as obvious just from the huge number of 5 star reviews here.	5.0	Has everything a good show should have	2012-08-16	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A32NQAUFD1KODZ	Amazon Customer	I did not expect much of a series that was cancelled after just one season, but it was free and I was in the mood for SciFi, so... I was positively surprised. The Western SciFi mix requires you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but after that, the characters are unusual, funny, and the story is interesting. I would have watched it for more than one season.	4.0	Surprisingly good	2012-12-13	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1L8NK5VZTS1U5	Amazon Customer	I first purchased this DVD set well after the series had been cancelled. I was deployed to Iraq and was doing a search on Joss Whedon and this title came up. Unsure, but comfortable in my love of the rich universes, wonderful and often tongue in cheek dialogue, and very deep character creations and development, I ordered. And I am glad I did. This series quickly became my favorite series of all time, quickly supplanting even other Whedon fare.The characters are more realistic than any other on either television or the big screen. Each character has their own agendas, whether it be as altruistic as Simon's desire to protect his sister at any cost, Kaylee's innocent desire to be noticed by Simon as more than a crew mate, or Jayne's selfish desire to improve his financial standing in life. Each character has a rich back story that Whedon did a delightful amount of time to build up to, a history that was as simple and well written as anything he ever wrote. Whedon's choice to utilize several actor's that he has used in the past was well made. Although I did find it humorous that three of the protagonists were antagonists in his prior casting of them.Whedon's many decisions throughout the series, such as the decision to use no sound at all for any scenes in space, while rooted in some financial choices, all led to a wonderfully built universe, as human as any show ever filmed.That Fox dictated that the series be aired out of order showed as much intelligence as Fox's cancelling of this show even prior to all the episodes having been aired. The uproar of all the fans, while it may not have led to the reinstating of the series, led to the green lighting of the movie Serenity, a wonderful if somber conclusion to this universe.	5.0	Cancelled too soon	2009-03-23	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1EJEQWHX2DAJF	Amazon Customer	I had never heard of this show until it was referenced on Big Bang Theory, and then I got interested.  The reviews increased that interest until I finally decided to buy it.The show is engaging, and the characters are generally believable in the setting where they live.  I am happy that I watched the series, and if I had been watching it when it was aired, would have been disappointed when it wasn't picked up for another season... but as it is, I knew that it had a definite end, so I could be prepared to be left hanging.It beats much of what is on TV, so go ahead and buy it and watch it instead of some current garbage for a couple of months.  :)	4.0	An interesting series for a 1 season show...	2013-01-17	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1QS9OZOMXVN4J	Amazon Customer	I have been a Star Trek fan for years.  One, actually two friends suggested that I watch this series.  Well, stupid me watched them out of order wathcing them as the date they came out.  Well, I hated it, after one. (The Train Job) I gave the DVD back.  So for Christmas I got a Kindle Fire with Prime (Love it.) I was encouraged to watch the series again.  And I have watched it again and again.  Every time I watch it I get more out of each episode.  I have become a TRUE Browncoat. I have also watched Serenity several times.  I love this series because it not as rigid and sterile as Star Trek. It is a another writers take on what could happen in the future, 500 years in the future even farther then Star Trek.  Only wish there was more then one season(Let down)Side Note.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A6SO1CY6VID67	Amazon Customer	I've been a Joss Whedon fan for a while, and own all three of his series on DVD. Firefly is my favorite. There are more DVD extras in this set than there usually are, for the simple fact that the show was canceled well before it's time and the cast and crew were still invested in the show when the DVD was produced.The show is wonderful; any Whedon fan will enjoy it. Far too short, though. Fox did the show and it's fans a great disservice by not following Joss's vision for the show (airing the episodes out of order primarily, and not giving it a chance to find a fan base outside of die hard Whedon fans).	5.0	Excellent DVD set	2008-09-05	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1W9O781W3ZQ8N	Amazon Customer	The unique idea of a sci fi western set in the distant future was so original that it was bound to get a large fan base from the get go.  I discovered this series on Amazon Prime Streaming, instantly I was hooked and enjoyed every episode. The characters work so well together and the stories are clever - that's enough to get and keep my attention and is a lot more than the average rubbish that the networks seem to be happy serving up today.  Yet it was cancelled after the first season and I have to ask the question &#34;Why?&#34;  Were the networks smoking crack ? This was a winner that died too young even though the film Serenity was produced. Perhaps in the future it will be picked up again and a second season will debut - I certainly hope so.	5.0	Unique and Entertaining	2013-09-08	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ADE8FAGTIOLGV	Amazon Customer	What can I say, I'm a Whedon groupie.  He seems to have a special talent for putting a team of people together to tell his story in such a compelling and endearing way.  There was something particularly great about the chemistry on Firefly.  It is rare when you can feel a connection to a character--like you really know and like them, not just for their strengths (that are easy to admire) but also for their failings and frailties.  To get attached to a character as if they're family or friends, so that you actually miss them when they're gone--that is a special talent...that is SO Joss.  BTW--Colbert bump is the reason for the re-visiting of Firefly.  It was great seeing Joss but it made me miss Mal and his band of outlaws.	5.0	Oh Mal, how I miss you...	2013-08-14	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A26CMNH5NOYCXA	Amazon Customer	I watched this for the first time.  It was quite entertaining.  It is sad that there isn't more because I have developed an interest in the characters. You can tell that the director had a lot planned as so many ideas were set in motion.  I can't give it 5 starts for two reasons: Firstly, The Blu-ray transfer wasn't that good.  Lot's of noise.  The opening battle scene in the first episode was terrible in terms of video noise.  It made me feel that the whole series might be like that.  Fortunately, it wasn't as bad but still not a clean transfer. Secondly, it's not appropriate for younger aged children due to adult themes (sexuality, violence and brief nudity).  I realize that this was intended but I find this unfortunate because I believe this series could have had a broader reach which may have helped it to survive (or not - no one really knows).	4.0	I can understand the enormous following	2013-01-13	1	0	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2O4VVEBKI0E6N	Amazon Customer	"Set in a future that is believable and exciting, this show is an excellent example of science fiction.  Joss Whedon, the shows creator, says it best when he says ""Serenity is the type of ship the Enterprise would've just blown right by.""The show is the story of a captain (and his crew) who are just trying to survive.  They pilot a cargo transport doing whatever jobs they can find.  They smuggle goods, steal from the wealthy, whatever they can to make ends meet.  The catch?  They aren't in a battleship, they in an unarmed cargo ship.The acting is surprisingly good, mostly because the actors play a role that they seem well-suited to.  Acting ability may not be particularly gifted, but when your character seems to fit (fairly closely) your own personality, how much acting are you really doing?  The stories are exciting and interesting.  The characters motivations are realistic.  They have emotions and goals.  They have wants and desires, but they sometimes have to shelf these feelings for the greater good, survival.Other sci-fi shows often times give the epic fight of good vs. evil.  Here, it can be similar.  The crew is obviously good.  But what do they do when in order to survive they have to steal?  Well, they steal.  The bad guys come after them?  They run.  They aren't super heros, they are simple people caught in a bad situation, life.I would highly recommend the show.  I am, of course, a fan.  The fans of this show are extremely dedicated.  Odds are, if you are even bothering to read my review, you are a fan like me.  The fans to this show were so dedicated when it went off the air that they raised funds to advertise for it.  They wrote in again and again to try and keep the show on the air.  We failed, but we got something anyway.  A motion picture.  Serenity is a movie follow-up that takes place after the show.  I'd highly recommend both."	5.0	Great Show	2003-12-19	1	0	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2V0U7FH1J8P3G	Amazon Customer	I think you will either like it, and drop it and wonder why you spent an hour watching it.This is a low-cost show mixing spaceships and western movies (think horse-back riding, 6-shooters...).Shot in 2 locations (I'm exaggerating): indoor studio (in the spaceship). Nothing fancy here, the ship is a big dirty hangar, that's about it. And outdoor in any location looking like a California/Nevada... desert.So the value is in the characters's development, their relationships... Nothing too surprising there. There's the good captain, the pilot, the mechanics, the brute, the doctor... and a couple more unusual characters.After watching the first season, I think I will watch season 2. But it's mostly &#34;watching while doing something else&#34;, and &#34;because I've Amazon Prime and it's free&#34;.3 stars means &#34;it's okay&#34;, and that's where I'm putting this.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2BF1VKM8N3K7	Amazon Customer	I'm of two minds regarding Firefly. Every time I revisit it, I feel immersed in a world I don't want to leave. Each time, after viewing the last episode, I feel the same pang of regret that it was cancelled. And I immediately scramble to load the movie sequel, Serenity, which takes the saga in a scant 2 hours where it could have gone if it hadn't been axed.But in an odd way, I'm also happy it all worked out this way. Almost as much as I value the show, I prize the bittersweet melancholy of missing it. The few episodes crafted have become singular jewels, the characters, the universe and the noble values now steeped in the coppery glow of legend.If you haven't seen this show, if you've skipped it because you're not a fan of science fiction, do yourself a favor and watch the first episode. It's ninety minutes in which you fall in love with one character after another, care instantly what fates await them. The stories are inventive and fun, building this new universe layer by layer. The look of the show is fantastic and convincing. The humor is sly, loving and knowing, and carries over into later series like Castle. The action has the panache and wisecracking, accidental quality of the first Star Wars movies. The music is like a set of wings that buoy each story aloft, leaving a twang in your ear after the credits fade. And the performances are as letter perfect as you will find anywhere on screen or stage.Enjoy it, and be prepared to enjoy missing it...over and over.	5.0	Missing it is half the fun	2013-05-02	1	1	0

I had actually managed to forget about this show since then, untill a couple of weeks ago when I noticed the DVD on Amazon while doing some Christmas shaopping. I ordered a copy and promptly forgot about it again. On Christmas Eve, I noticed it in a stack of books and DVD's and thought that it might be fun to watch while wrapping presents. I watched the first DVD Christmas Eve, and finished watching the last one tonight. I will never forget this show again. From the first disc to the last, this is one of the very few nearly flawless television series that I have had the fortune to watch. This show is one of the best examples that I have seen of entertainment becoming art, and art becoming entertainment. The only criticism that I have to offer about this series is that there isn't more of it, and that there isn't more like it.	5.0	Art as Entertainment	2003-12-30	1	1	0

I love the fact that you do not have to be a sci-fi nerd, like myself, to love this show.  If you like Nathan Phillion on Castle you will love him in Firefly. Plus there are several references to this series in Castle.  The firefly cast brings Whedon's universe to life.  The chemistry of the chararters is a perfect combination of funny and endearing.  The comedic banter is flawless and once you start watching you won't want to stop.  I would also recommend watching the Serenity movie which takes place 18 months after this series starts and helps to complete Whedon's story.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3D4OMZOFES5IQ	Amazon Customer	After falling in love belatedly with this series when it was rebroadcast on my favorite network, I convinced most of my family to go see the movie with me (my sister 2 times back to back!).  Then, I lent them the DVD's I had bought knowing that SciFi wouldn't finish airing all the shows before the movie was released.Now, knowing that the movie and the DVD's are all there is, my Mom is mad at me for getting her hooked.  She called me up this morning to tell me she had just watched 'Out of Gas', and loving it, her fondest part was the last scene of Mal looking longingly for the first time at Serenity.How does this help you?  While I am a staunch sci-fi fan, my Mom is the Survivor and Amazing Race type. She still watches ER, and The West Wing.  If, despite her preferences, she can fall in love with this series, so will you.Besides, the more people who buy this, the greater the chances of there being more shows/movies made, the greater my chance of getting back on my Mom's good side sometime this decade!	5.0	My Mom hates me	2005-11-06	13	12	1

However, upon recommendation by a friend, I decided, what the heck. I purchased the complete series on Blu-ray.It started a bit slowly, and was completely unlike any other Sci-Fi adventure I had previously enjoyed. (Incidentally, I have been a fan of this genre for probably 45 years or more.) After the first couple of episodes, I was absolutely hooked and could hardly stop watching. As many other reviewers have said, I did not even know about Firefly until several years after its demise, but I totally agree that Fox made a terrible decision to pull the plug well before it should have.This series is a MUST WATCH for any serious fan of science fiction. I just wish it would play on my Blu-ray equipped laptop, but WinDVD complains that it is only playable on a Region A or B drive, else I would be watching it at this moment over 500 miles from home.

I had heard from several Battlestar Galactica fans that this was an ""awesome"" series, almost as good as Battlestar, so I bought the DVDs . . . uh, No, this is not great science fiction.  It is a silly, over-the-top melodrama set in an improbable future with some really bad acting.  It's a comic Western (they even talk in campy 19th-century cowboy-speak) set on a space-barge whose crew flies from one ill-concieved scheme to escape-the-law, get-rich-quick, save-the-girl, save-the-universe to another and somehow gets out alive before the end credits.

I'm a huge Star Trek fan, mainly for it's futuristic view of humanity once we are able to achieve efficient space travel. (Of course, the myriad collection of starships and techno babbles are fun as well)The founder/visionary of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, sold Star Trek to network as ""Western"" in space. While the humor and style of original crew was like typical western TVs in the 1960s, I find Firefly a much truer ""wild, wild west"". It's nice seeing through the eyes of people fight-for-survival deep in space in alien communities, rather than from the eyes of Starfleet crew.I'm still bigger fan of Star Trek, but I'm glad I bought Firefly and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The acting was great and it was created so that we would eventually get to know each character bit by bit. I felt incredibly slighted whenever the show ended because there was so much room for character development and background to come out and they hardly scratched the surface of what they had planned.All in all, I highly recommend you buy and watch this amazing TV show!	5.0	Firefly: Greatest TV Show That Wasn't Given A Chance	2010-06-08	3	3	0

I truly believe this show didn't last longer because it was just ahead of its time. Firefly takes you to a future so unique that you will be immediately drawn in and have trouble imagining it any other way. There is a character for every viewer out there, and whether it be Jayne's lewdness,Mal's innate leadership and bravery, or River's adorable innocence and genius, no one is capable of watching this show and not LOVING it!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A16503E59MMTIQ	Amazon Customer	Firefly was a great TV show, which of course means the networks had to cancel it right away. I never actually saw it on TV (I had never even heard of it when it was on TV), but I later saw the movie Serenity, which has the same cast and is based on the same overall story. The movie was great so I went hunting for the TV series and I have not been disappointed. If you've seen the movie, it is basically the Reader's Digest version of the whole story arc, while the Firefly TV series is like a few chapters somewhere near the beginning.The first season of any TV series is always a little rough around the edges, and so while the same is true for Firefly, I'll also say that it is less so than with most other series I've watched - it's high quality, it feels like there are years of backstory in place, and the crew of the Firefly don't seem awkward together at all - it comes across as if they've been together for years and we're jumping into the middle of their adventures.The premise of the show (the adventures of outlaws on the frontiers of space) and the decision to unabashedly draw parallels to old Westerns were both pretty big risks because it would be so easy for it to fall apart and become a pretty corny show. Somehow they manage to pull it off though, and the result is a great mix of humor, drama, characters, and story.The writing is excellent, the production is excellent, and the acting is excellent, so really my only regret as I watch the episodes is knowing that there won't be any more to come.	5.0	Proof that networks don't get it	2010-10-07	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1LOC9LLMBES2	Amazon Customer	"I first watched this series by borrowing a friend's copy, and by the time I watched the first disc, I was hooked.  I bought my own copy and now loan it to others to get them started on Firefly.This is just a great series.  The way I describe it is a ""Space-West-Far-Eastern"", since it mixes Westerns with Far East influence, then shows it in space.  The episodes are well written, and very entertaining.  The casting is superb, with the characters really coming to life as you watch.  Luckily, the movie, ""Serenity"" is coming out April 22, 2005, so buy the DVDs and go watch the movie.  You won't be disappointed."	5.0	Unique and entertaining	2004-10-19	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GNKBLTB4KS19	Amazon Customer	I just bought Firefly last week and have watched it all; I've even watched some of it twice. It's just that good. Where to start?I figured that a science fiction genre series crossed with Buffy-like writing sounded like a promising match. I'd watched a bit of Buffy (though I never became a real fan) and a couple of Angel episodes, so I knew some of what to expect: interesting characters shrouded in various levels of mystery, some built-in friction and/or romance between main characters, witty humor, and plot twists at every turn. I'd seen two episodes of Firefly when it was running, but not enough that I really got it. Since they were aired out of order, I may never have. When I watched it as it was meant to be seen, I was surprised and absolutely astonished at how well this story and cast worked. Let's be reasonable; there are spaceships and horse-drawn wagons in the same episode. How can that possibly work? But yet, it worked fine. When I reached the last episode of Firefly (in two long settings - I just couldn't quit watching), I was very distressed that there wasn't another season I could pop in.The humor in this series took me by surprise. There are a number of good lines in Buffy, but I thought the humor quota was raised a few notches in Firefly. I think the fact that there were nine major characters (ten if you count the ship) instead of four or five allowed a lot more humor to be interjected. There are very few movies or shows where the humor level is intense enough that I laugh so hard that it brings the others in the family running to see. Firefly is one of them.I also found the cast extremely believable in their roles. Like any series that really sucks you in, I started caring how they would fare. One benchmark for me is that I learned their (screen) names quickly. Unfortunately, this series was just beginning to reveal some of the mysteries behind the characters (for those characters who were meant to be mysterious) when it was cancelled. It's obvious that there were 2-3 seasons worth of stories we'll likely never get to see. I know there's a movie due out in April 2005, but unless it's five hours long, there's no way they can wrap this story line up and maintain the integrity and quality of writing this series contains. (I'll go see it anyway though.) It's pretty easy to tell when watching the episodes (and the DVD's bonus material confirms) that this cast really enjoyed working with each other. It's easy to believe that this group would hang around with each other for hours even if it weren't part of their job. The roles of the main characters were so varied that the potential number of stories to tell should have been quite large without being repetitive.My typical fare in the science fiction genre is a bit more special effects laden and plot light than Firefly. I'm strictly looking to be entertained and to not have to think too much. However, this series is done so well, the lack of special effects really doesn't matter, and the stories are so intriguing that I don't mind the fact they make me contemplate where they are heading. I so wish that I could buy seasons two through six of this series so I could see if I was right.	5.0	How could a series this good get cancelled?	2004-06-09	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1IVIY6XH0AM3F	Amazon Customer	The lead editorial review of the Firefly boxed set does a good job of telling you why you ought to own a copy of this collection but, in reality, it could use far fewer words to get the point across. For anyone who knows the work of the folks involved with making the show (Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, Ben Edlund, etc.) then really that's all you need to point out. This is another stellar series created by a group of people whose collective output has been critically VERY well received.For those people who DON'T know the creators involved... Well, the first question that comes to mind is &quot;Where have you been living?&quot; but perhaps a more relevant question is &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Firefly is a show that crosses all KINDS of genre boundaries to create a show that is extraordinarily fun to watch (even if watching it is a little depressing at times since it was really never given a chance on Fox).So, get this boxed set, watch it, enjoy it, and get your Browncoats ready to see Serenity on the big screen in the near future.Thanks, Joss and Company, for creating another classic bright spot on network TV!	5.0	TV at its finest	2004-03-22	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQHGJHW46OXEY	Amazon Customer	Indeed, from the SF point of view, this is the best that has ever been filmed--a serious and well-thought-out view of the future, one that would have done credit to Isaac Asimov, with a truly human and humane vision worthy of a Ray Bradbury or an Ursula LeGuin.  At the same time, while this is true SF, not mere &quot;space opera&quot; (for all that, unlike Star Wars or Star Trek, it actually is a &quot;Western in space&quot;), anyone who is truly open-minded and willing to try new things will find that the characters and stories have universal appeal.Part of this is the exceptional writing--Joss Whedon and Tim Minear set a high standard, and the rest of the writers lived up to it--which features some unusual things for Hollywood, like real characters with depth and individuality (who actually grow and develop), story arcs that move beyond the obvious and trite, and a sense of humor that has some actual subtlety and wit to it.  Part of it is the exceptional cast of actors (the only one I'd ever heard of was Ron Glass, but every one's a find, especially Nathan Fillion) and guest stars, who bring the material alive in ways that most actors don't.  Part of it's the exceptional crew who gave the show a convincing and unique look and feel.  Put all together, they made one of the best shows of any type ever seen on television.  If you don't believe me, buy the DVD and see for yourself, then hang on for the ride . . . and join the rest of us in waiting impatiently for the movie.	5.0	Great science fiction, but not just for SF fans	2004-02-13	7	7	0

Even with the network's efforts to bury the show, it shined.  I had all episodes recorded, but the box set is so shiny!!  I preordered it as soon as it was available.  The writing, the special effects, the scenery all top notch.  Not to mention the cast and how seamlessly they embody their characters.  Normally it takes a couple episodes (or a season) for the actors to fit their rolls and be comfortable, but from the moment its starts you believe. Its real, its gritty, and not always pretty, but buy this set and you will rewatch it again and again, I have every couple months since getting it.

I just watched firefly this past summer after it being recommended to me by people I worked with.  I kept putting it off, thinking, oh, I'll get to it.  Then when it came time for me to go into the hospital to have my fourth baby (yes, I'm a woman), I bought it to watch on my iPod touch to kill time during labor (nothing reduces labor pains more naturally than a good distraction).I was hooked from the beginning.  I watched it in the order it was intended to air (starting with the pilot), not with the order that fox actually aired it in (which would have made no sense).I loved the design of the ships, the special effects (which others have criticized).  I thought the acting was very natural especially considering how dialoge-dense the show is.  They have a lot of words to remember!To me, the concept is more realistic than Stargate, BSG, or even Star Trek.  The idea that mankind might move out into the outer reaches of space to colonize when we've used up the resources on this earth made sense.  The idea that some settlers would opt for a return to simpler technology also made sense to me.  How many times have we wished for that on Earth-that-Is?If you like Hard Sci-Fi, this may not be your cup of tea.  Also, although I'm a mother of four, I don't watch this with my children.  It is not appropriate for young kids.  The Reavers are super scary, and even more so in the movie Serenity.  ALso, if you are a conservative Christian, which I am not, you might not appreciate the idea that being a ""companion"" is considered respectable work.  There is a ""shepherd"" or preacher on board, but that doesn't make this a ""Christian"" show.  I am a Christian, but not a conservative, and I appreciated the doubts of the Captain, and the conviction of Shepherd.Don't be put off by the fact that this show was cancelled, it had more viewers than most critically lauded cable tv shows.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2F7KIN0SL00I6	"Amazon Customer ""Proverb"""	Firefly was an incredible show.  I never got a chance to see it when it was actually on television, but being a fan of Joss Whedon's other creations, I had to give it a try.  And I must say that I was blown away.  I was expecting something like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel and thought I would have been disappointed if it weren't like them. I was wrong.  It is nothing like Buffy or Angel, and I was not disappointed.  I'm under the impression that Joss Whedon can do no wrong when he is in charge.There are several things that make this show absolutely fabulous:1.  The characters.  There aren't too many shows that have character development that could surpass Firefly.  The characters work off of each other and you find yourself relating to them.  The actors and actresses who portray them are perfect.2.  The writing.  Joss Whedon, Tim Minear and an array of other wonderful writers have compiled some of the best scripts in television.  There are several episodes that are brilliantly written.  The story is incredible and has so much room to grow.3.  The acting.  The actors and actresses in this show, both regulars and guest stars give memorable performances.  There isn't a poor performance in the entire series.All in all, Firefly is an amazing show that would have been a ton of fun to follow for years.  Unfortunately, television executives don't always see eye to eye with viewers.  Who knows, if the movie is a huge success, perhaps another network will try and pick it back up.  I sure hope so. If you watch this, chances are, you will too.	5.0	Truly Amazing - In Joss we trust!!	2004-01-27	12	12	0

I'd actually sworn off the network. But Firefly looked so intriguing that I decided on a compromise; I'd watch it, but I wouldn't let myself get hooked so that way I wouldn't be crushed when it was cancelled. (It was innovative, smart, and sci-fi and it was on FOX--of course it was going to be cancelled. *snort*) HA! I managed to resist for a while, but by the end of the episode &quot;Out of Gas,&quot; I was completely enthralled in spite of myself.What's great about Firefly? What isn't great about Firefly? The characters are real, three-dimensional and loveable to the last one--even the surprisingly cuddly Jayne--the dialogue is snappy and witty, and the seemingly-implausible premise turns out to be one of the most original and best-executed ideas to come down the science fiction pipeline in years. It could teach the Trek franchise a thing or two, that's for sure!I've already hooked two friends on the series with the DVDs, and I'm reminding myself all over again why I couldn't help but love it. But the best part is getting to see the series the way it *should* have been, in the correct order. I'm just taking it slow, trying to make it last until the movie comes out, so I won't go into withdrawal. But somehow I don't think I'll succeed, since every time I put in a DVD I end up watching all the episodes on it. *g*	5.0	it can't be said enough	2004-01-26	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AFG4UPOYWM13K	"Amazon Customer ""- Tech Geek"""	As has been said before in all these reviews, FOX broadcasting should take the execs that cancelled this show out back and have them shot.Firefly is one of those one in a million shows where all the right people just happened to be picked to work on it.  Everyone from the fx crew to the cameramen to the writers and most amazingly, the actors, gelled into what would have been one of the most amazing tv series of our time.  And if you think I'm just some fanboy here to plug the DVD's, then do a Google on &quot;Firefly&quot; and read some of the other online reviews.Granted the backdrop is unusual - spaceships and cowboys, but the acting was just superb, and the chemistry between the actors became apparent in the first hour of the pilot (Which somehow FOX decided to air only after they cancelled the series.  Talk about not giving a show a chance!)  The music was simply amazing, the cinematography was fresh and new, using focus and sudden pans in ways TV should see more of, and the writing!  Oh the writing!  The writing is such that you will be laughing one moment and crying the next, with storylines that would twist and turn as if Hitchcock himself had helped pen them.  For the writing alone, you should get this DVD.  I guarantee that after the first disk, you'll be a fan, and after the last, you too will be looking for FOX exec's heads to roll...	5.0	One amazing ride...	2004-01-08	7	4	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A175SWC0FJMW5W	"Amazon Guy ""AmaG U"""	First off, I'd like to say.. I've always hated sci-fi series.. People can not understand why I don't have an appreciation for what they consider the best genre.. Well, whatever.. To each their own... Secondly... I own over 60 different Television series on DVD box sets.. It's the only way I ever watch Television.. Third.. This is the very first review I've ever written on Amazon...With that said... I was very apprehensive about buying 'Firefly', but I was so intrigued by 'Serenity', that I felt the need to know the backbone behind the entire story.. And I've never been given more satisfaction with a Television show than the one received with 'Firefly'. The production was amazing from start to finish. Extremely well-thought out story lines.. A vast variety of personalities within every single character (Very likable characters, might I add) and a cast chemistry that can not be beat... The show has a beautiful blend of action, drama, and humor.. And that could be the reason why I felt it was so different from other sci-fi shows, films.. It was light-hearted, yet inexplicably serious when it needed to be.. I don't want to get into too much detail, but every single person deserves an opportunity to enjoy this work of art...This show brought a few different sides out of me.. It made me appreciate sci-fi, took a hundred mile lead against all of my favorite TV shows and it inspired me to write a review on Amazon.com... May not sound like much, but all of that put together is a real rarity for a fella like me...To put it in simple terms, IMHO 'Firefly' was the perfect show.. It was flawless.. Actually.. I take that back.. The only flaw was that it ended.. But like all good things.. it eventually came to an end... But please please please.. Give this show a try... I don't think you'll ever regret making the choice...	5.0	Best show to ever hit Television	2010-07-14	3	3	0

We even watched all the episodes through again with the commentary--that, and the featurette were actually really entertaining.This DVD won't disappoint.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AASFMSENXJAZ6	Ammy Woodbury	The Firefly DVD set is perfect. In it's short tenure, Firefly gained an enormous following of loyal fans. Fox showed a lack of faith in what could've easily been their next huge money maker akin to the success of the X-Files. They cancelled the show after less than half a season.This DVD collects the 11 aired, and 3 unaired episodes, into one boxed set. The quality is excellent, and I especially appreciate the slimline cases for each DVD. It makes taking one with you easy, while keeping the overall size of the box set relatively slender. The extras, like the gag reel and Adam Baldwin's rendition of the Hero of Canton, all demonstrate how this show was loved by it's creators and participants as much as by viewers.The real star of the set is the show. The unaired episodes are as good as the ones that aired, and each one makes you wish there were more. Few shows have such a magical blend of characters, from the alluring Companion, to the amoral Jayne, to the pilot who plays with dinosaurs, to the brother/sister team like a modern Laertes trying to save Ophelia. Each character brings a special charm and depth that could've been explored for many years to come. Exploring the mystery of the preacher who is not what he seems is enough to fuel Firefly for at least 3 years.If you've not seen Firefly, buy the set and enjoy, but expect to be left wanting more.	5.0	More than complete, yet not enough	2004-01-21	19	16	3

I hope the crack smoking monkey at FOX responsible for this mistake was dragged out into the street by their unmentionables and burned at the stake.  But alas, I digress...The show is original and has a depth and realism that has redefined the medium.

However, the HUGE number of fans and the cool fansites they have set up is testiment to how great this series was and its ability to entrance audiences and create a cult following in such a short space of time.It's a clever premise - an assortment of rebels, lost souls and wanderers travelling the frontiers of space on the run from the law and sometimes their pasts. It has been beautifully executed by the brilliant Joss Whedon (of Buffy and Angel fame) and an endearing and talented cast.

As always she is lovely and a lot of fun, as is the episode and the entire run of Firefly. When I first heard Firefly described as a cross between sci-fi and a western, I was a bit dubious, but I have never yet been disappointed and the shows remain fresh even with repeated viewings. I highly recommend the entire series for writing, acting and social commentary.In this particular episode, Mal takes care of a thief that has been preying on a small community and finds himself with a wife in payment. The rest of the crew is amused and amazed and as usual finds themselves in trouble. Getting themselves out of trouble requires even more finesse than usual. A great episode of a wonderful show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3W22WWFF6RIUA	Anderson Imes	I (like a lot of people, it seems) missed this series when it aired.  I'm not typically a fan of Joss Whedon's series, but this one is absolutely fantastic.The writing is original.  The cinematography and set lighting are very good.  I really like the eclectic mix of cultural past, present, and future that is portrayed in the movie.  Any show that can pull off a 19h century formal ball with a futuristic floating chandelier in the same room is great, in my book.This series is highly recommended to anyone that is missing some really good sci fi.	5.0	Where have you been?	2005-09-20	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AMPH0H15CISIQ	Andrea Fulmer	I tried SO hard to like this show.  My friends raved about it.  Nathan Fillion is a great actor!! Alan Tudyk is great in anything he does!!!  But I could barely get through it.  I read a few dozen reviews trying to &#34;get it&#34;, to try and figure out why i don't like it and I still don't &#34;get it&#34;.1. I find the plot schizophrenic - the show doesn't know what it wants to be.... a western or sci-fi??2.  This may be especially harsh, but I couldn't bear to listen to the bad grammar. I know this is set in the future andthe entire world has changed... but they took it to an extreme.  Thank you to my high school teachers for finding such bad grammar unacceptable.3. Why do the characters start speaking Chinese at random times? There is no reason for it.There isn't enough Chinese influence popping up in other areas of the show to justify it.4. The &#34;companion&#34; character & story line - just bad all the way around.I don't want to waste any more of my time writing any more about this horrible show. I tried to like it, I really did!!!	1.0	tried to like it...	2014-07-10	2	1	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A6H1FII5F0UHZ	Andrea	Well, with current television programming of reality tv shows, oversexed and slick idiot characters, and no depth of story or character development, shows like Firefly are a relief.  Joss Whedon's vision of the blend of new and old in an amazingly detailed future is both intriguing and entertaining.It was a stupid move on the part of Fox network to cancel the show after only airing eleven shows and making it almost impossible for the audience to even find the show.  It is quite unfortunate that the series never answered some of the big questions raised and developed in the plots of the first shows.  This collection is worth anyone's time who wishes to see a show that treats its audience intelligently with humor and drama,  plots that are both fun and interesting, appealing to the smartass within.	5.0	We love Joss Whedon!	2004-06-21	2	2	0

I discovered it by accident on ebay, while searching for Buffy rarities, and, trusting Joss Whedon, came her to find out more. And bought it.A truly amazing series; obvious from the pilot what the potential was, obvious that Mutant Enemy had a surefire hit, but also clear that it would be a slow burner. The characters and the acting are simply amazing, and the production team deserved more than one award.As Whedon claims on the DVD, this was a new way of telling a story. And a good one. All credit to the team for not giving up on it, and all credit for taking it to a studio with just a little faith and imagination.A great series, and a fine DVD.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	Doesn't it seem odd that a show that failed would be put on DVD?  I thought so too, but I kept hearing good things about Firefly, and I am big fans of Joss Whedon's other shows, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, so I decided to see what it was like.  I couldn't be happier that I did because Firefly is definitely a great show that was killed before it could even begin to reach its full potential.  The show tells the story of nine people on the firefly class ship Serenity, which was named for a battle in a war for independence.  This battle was, for the most part, the last stand for Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his fellow Independents.  After this fight, victory seemed imminent for the Alliance, a government who wanted to unite all planets under one rule.  Mal and his friend and later first mate Zo (Gina Torres) wanted each planet to rule itself.  After the war, the pair bought Serenity and assembled a crew consisting of Wash (Alan Tudyk), the pilot and Zo's future husband, Kaylee (the beautiful Jewel Staite), the cheerful mechanic who definitely has elements of the Buffy character Willow (the also beautiful Alyson Hannigan), and Jayne (Adam Baldwin), who is kind of muscle for hire.  They also have Inara (Moreena Baccarin), who is a companion, which is the new term for prostitute.  Apparently, 500 years from now, prostitution will not only be legal, but it will be a respectful career.  She rents one of Serenity's two shuttles, and her presence is mutally beneficial to the crew and herself.  Her clientele is increased, and she opens some doors for Mal and the crew.  In fact, her nickname is the Ambassador.  The group will do anything to keep going; they will pick up passengers and do any job, legal or illegal.  Mal actually seems to prefer the illegal jobs just because it means thwarting the Alliance.  Then in the first episode (strangely, it was the one of the last ones aired), three new people join the crew.  There is Shepard Book (Ron Glass), the preacher and conscious of the ship, Dr. Simon Tam, and his insanely intelligent and intelligently insane (yes I know, that didn't make much sense) sister.  Simon and River are on the run from the Alliance; River, who is a genius, was sent to an academy run by the Blue Sun Corporation, which is heavily funded by the Alliance.  However, the acadamy turned out to be a lab facility where researchers did experiments on River.  She sent coded messages to Simon, and he had her cryogenically frozen, and then resuced her.  Now Mal and the crew have to deal with a crazy young girl who is a wanted fugitive.The writing and acting on the show are definitely worthy of Joss Whedon's name; in fact, after Firefly ended, Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres were cast in Buffy and Angel.  I loved this cast, especially Jewel Staite.  She was priceless!  I was so afraid that she was going to die in the first episode, and I was very relieved when she wasn't.  However, her situation allowed for one of the best scenes in the entire series; the thing that happened when Mal told Simon that she was dead was so funny.  Some of my favorite episodes include Serenity Pts. 1 and 2, The Train Job, Shindig, Ariel, Our Mrs. Reynolds, Trash, The Message, War Stories, and Objects In Space.  Oh, and speaking of characters in Joss Whedon's shows, did you see that, in Serenity, Carlos Jaccot, who played Dobson, also appeared as villains in Buffy and Angel (although in Angel, he wasn't really evil, despite the fact that he was a demon who wanted to eat Doyle's (Glenn Quinn) brains).Unfortunately, we may never know how much some of these characters will be developed.  In fact, there are so many things that we may never know; such as Book's origins; something was up with him.  He could shoot too well, and the bounty hunter, who may have been a little crazy, said without any doubt that he was no Shepard.  We also may never know what those blue-handed men from the Blue Sun actually did to River, and what they wanted her for.  The Simon/Kaylee and Mal/Inara relationships will never be fulfilled/revealed/destroyed, and we won't find out if Inara actually leaves.  I really hope that the Firefly movie gets made, so that we can see what happens next.  I would also like Fox to revive the show, the way that they are reviving Family Guy, because they lost a true gem when they cancelled Firefly.UpdateAs of August 7th, 2004, I have shown Firefly to four people who, like me had never seen it before.  All of them are now big fans who are angry that the show was cancelled, and are waiting for April 2005 for the movie.	5.0	We'll Still Have The Sky	2004-01-20	12	9	3

Everything from character to setting to morality is done brilliantly--this is nearly a must-see for anyone.But among the many other things that Firefly represents, rarely in our television landscape does a show come along that shows such an incredible picture of leadership.  While many central figures in television coast through using pure charisma, Malcolm Reynolds shows us that even in friendship there are times when the good of the whole must come first.  When watching this show, you continually live with the feeling that no one comes above the rest of the crew--thus giving viewers a belief that none of the crew is safe (emotionally or physically).  This gives the show a raw edge that feels very genuine.If you like the thrill of adventure without the bore of predictability, Firefly is an excellent choice.	5.0	A true portrait of leadership	2006-12-22	5	5	0

Everything looks feature-film slick.  It's great, smart Sci-Fi -- for instance, there is no sound in the space scenes (unlike the ""whooshes"" on Star Trek when the ship goes into hyperspace etc), because there is no sound in space.The characters are smart and brave and very funny, with a gorgeous and talented cast, and all 15 episodes are wonderful and offer a moment to savor.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AXLHSXE3B9HIZ	Anna Maria Martin	A western in outer space?  Who would have conceived of such a concept, but It doesn't just work it's magic. The characters are well written and well developed, with so much substance, that you will find yourself thinking about them - Mal, Jayne, Shepard, Zoe, Wash, Simon, Kaylee, Inara and River.  Even Jayne, who doesn't make the best choices at times, is someone that you will care about in the end. Malcolm Reynolds is the leader and a bona fide hero with a strong moral compass.  All the characters have a little hero in them.  Zoe is the queen.  Strong, smart and gorgeous.  She is so believable as a fighter that you would want her next to you in a battle. The Shepard is an excellent character and there is so much more to his story, but it is not fully developed because of the show cancellation.  Inara and Mal have this love for each other, but there was no time to develop that either.  Above all the show is witty.  In the mist of all of their great adventures is laughter and the Firefly feels like home.	5.0	Best T.V. series ever!	2014-02-21	0	0	0

I wasn't able to catch it when it was on the air, what with the numerous pre-emptions and bad timeslot and I didn't think it was a huge deal. Why would I want to watch a space western for? Sure, it's Joss Whedon, but was it really going to be any good to people the genre didn't attract?The answer was a resounding 'yes'. I bought the series after the end of Angel and only on a whim, because I missed Joss Whedon's storytelling. I was afraid of being disapointed. I was a complete idiot.I've since been compelled to sit, write and send a letter of apology to Mister Whedon (and who has time for that?) for having doubted him when the show first came on. So have the three friends I've lent the DVD to. You know the show is good when you cringe as you hand the pretty box-set over.

(they were having a free HuluPlus trial. I got it just for this show!) Boy, was I ever impressed! I couldn't believe there were only 13 episodes!You'll laugh at the high-larious jokes, cry whenever Kaylee's life is threatened, get incredibly angry at Yo-Saff-Bridge when she shows up to wreak her particular brand of terror, and feel a thrill of pride every time one of the main 9 characters grows as a human being.Once I had seen them all, I was thirsty for more!  I sought out the DVD set, and I was not disappointed. There's SO MUCH to explore on this DVD set.  Aside from rewatching--or watching for the first time!--the episodes themselves (which I've done so many times I'm surprised my DVDs aren't all worn out and scratched yet!), this set is also great for all the commentaries and behind-the-scenes features it contains.5/5 would definitely recommend!

These baker's dozen episodes, however, bear repeat watching, even though it's hard to get past the frustration of never being able to see the development of many tantalizing plot seeds (enough to fuel many years of good drama) which Joss Whedon sowed in the brief time before the series was dumped.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2R1ZCQ4NJMWCL	Anonymous	"1)  In other sci-fi series, by 2500 a.d., they got lasers.  Firefly?  Guns.  Guns that SOUND like lasers.  Very, very weak move.2)  Westerns and spaceships is an awful mix.  With the low budget showing.  Harrison Ford contemplated suicide after Cowboys & Aliens.3)  I'd not be enticed by any female crew member of Serenity.  The ones not the ""companion"", are like in behavior to children.4)  Companions:  This show was wrote by women.  Whores are, in fact, whores.  Having tea beforehand is awful foreplay, too.5)  These things bugged me more than enough to write this review.Now, as in title of said review, this show could have walked with a four, or five star rating from me.  It did not, because there are no physics.  There are no references to why things like guns sounding like lasers could come to be, not enough crew members on board to alleviate your growing dislike for stagnant character interactions.  It's all so...cheap.  Star Trek: The Next Generation was cheap.  It had a horrific budget to work with, and still they turned lead into gold!  They had round a thousand crew members.  There was room in the story lines to allow you distance from the bridge crew once in a while.  They discussed the plausible physics and mechanics that allowed their tech to exist.  There were explanations aplenty.  Here, in the ""universe"" (with like four rooms) of Firefly, it's all spaghetti westerns with decrepit tech masquerading as new tech...fail.  And where's the inventive short dialogues to cue you in as to why it blows so much?  Why put this thing on the air while it's in such a state of...idk, incomplete immaturity?!"	2.0	Could have been 4-5 stars...	2012-05-10	18	5	13

When I heard it described as &quot;Wagontrain in space&quot;, I got worried.  Once I show the first show, I was hooked.Stop and ask yourself why &quot;Star Wars&quot; was a hit.  Then ask yourself why the prequels stink.This show has fully developed characters ... and they are interesting!  You want to know more about them.  You fall in love with some, you hate some, but you will have an emotional reaction to each and every one.  *THAT* is good writing.The premise is cool, even if the western theme gets a little corny at times.  Still, it works!If this show had gotten a better timeslot, better marketing and not cost as much per episode, everyone would be reading about (and watching) the new run-away hit &quot;Firefly&quot;.If you like &quot;old school&quot; sci-fi and/or space opera, this is your show.

The shift to undemanding ""blue-sky"" sci-fi seems unstoppable.At lewst we can pay tribute and see the three unscreened episodes via this DVD. But surely that ""Full Screen"" is a mistake?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A22UW60T9HWOKW	apeman505	"I hate this show. There, I said it. I know a lot of people are going to hate on me for saying it, but it's the truth. I. DON'T. LIKE. FIREFLY. Now that you've probably already clicked ""unhelpful,"" please allow me to explain/vent.I'm sure you're aware, dear reader, of Firefly's immense popularity. Many of my friends recommended it to me, saying it was like Star Wars, except somehow better. Also, the internet made the show sound totally awesome, so I ordered the the complete series on blu-ray and when it came in the mail I IMMEDIATELY put it in my PS3 because I was so excited to watch it. However, my first impression of the show (other than it wasn't really at all like Star Wars) was that I didn't like the style of it at all. I think it was the country music theme song playing over the menu screen that put me off initially. I hate that theme song, it's horrible. Dude's got some sort of speech impediment. Anyway, then the pilot episode started and I can't say I found it anything but boring and waaay too long. Still, everyone did say the show was the best thing ever, and dagnabbit I was going to see what the hype was about. I forced myself to watch the rest of the first disk, but it took me a couple weeks because it kept getting harder and harder to make myself push that play button. After finishing that one disk I still can't bring myself to watch any more.Don't get me wrong, though, I love the premise of the show. I mean, space pirates and smugglers? Sign me up! Plus there are plenty of space westerns out there that I do love, like Star Wars, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Outlaw Star. Firefly is just... really badly done, though. It's like they made a cowboy show and shoehorned in spaceships and space-age technology, not even trying to make it seem logical or fluid. I mean, Joss Whedon even said the Reavers are supposed to be Apaches. SPACE APACHES. This sort of thing would be okay with a cartoon or something, but it just doesn't work for a serious live action show because all the space stuff seems out of place when they're on the ground, and all the cowboy stuff seems out of place when they're in space.So yeah, I honestly tried as hard as I could to get into the show but wound up hating it. That's okay, right? I'm allowed to dislike some things that other people do like, right? WRONG. If you dislike Firefly of all shows, everyone makes you keep watching it until you tell them you like it. ""Did you watch them in order?"" YES. ""Did you get to the one where--"" YES. ""You should try rewatching them, I'm sure you'll eventually 'get' it."" NO. It's like people can't believe that Firefly isn't perfect, just as I can't believe people actually enjoy it. What makes it even worse is the fact that you can't swing a dead internet around without tripping over some Firefly fanblog or T-shirt sale or facebook post touting it as the greatest work of art ever created, or condemning FOX for cancelling it when it wasn't getting enough ratings to warrant a second season (don't give me anything about `time slots' either, I hear no one even watched the Firefly marathon they played after it got cancelled!)... But I digress. If you haven't already been turned off by my negativity and want to keep reading I'll tell you exactly what it is I hate about Firefly.I think the main thing that really kills the show for me is the characters--I can't stand any of them, except the engineer. Allow me to enumerate.First you have Wash, the pilot. His quirk is that he plays with plastic dinosaurs. We're obviously supposed to find this hilarious, which I find insulting. The idea sounds funny on paper, but Wash comes off as annoying instead of funny. Robin Williams he is not.Wash is married to the first mate. If you've ever been in the same room as an over-affectionate couple that can't control themselves, then get ready for the same awkwardness because they're always talking about tearing each other's clothes off. When not conjuring up unsavory mental images, the first mate acts all tough and serious. I don't know what she sees in Wash because... well, look at him, he's an idiot. The first mate is actually kind of cool when she's not hitting on her husband, so I think they should've made her captain instead of the other guy.Then there's this guy who isn't the first mate but apparently carries the same authority. He looks and acts like a friggin' criminal, and nobody in the crew likes him. I remember in one episode the captain asks this man if he would ever accept money to assassinate him, to which he answered yes. He also tried to abandon the captain and first mate on some planet while stealing command of the ship for himself at one point. Why would anyone would keep this person in their crew, let alone give him a place in the chain of command? If I was the captain I'd fire him and take his guns away, if not push him out the airlock. Or, y'know, just not hire him to begin with.There's also (for some reason) a space hooker, called a 'Companion.' She, being a prostitute, is inexplicably given VIP treatment wherever she goes. She is sometimes used as a plot device, but otherwise contributes nothing to the show and annoys the crap out of me, especially with her 'I Dream of Jeannie' wardrobe. I think she and the captain have some sort of attraction going on or something, but they can't do anything about it because space prostitutes are like royalty in this universe.Then we have a priest named Book. I kind of like the priest, but the captain's always yelling at him and I hate that.OH GOOD GRIEF then there is an annoying doctor and his even more annoying stowaway sister, River. The doctor WILL NOT STOP WHINING, and River is worse!Now, before I'd seen Firefly the internet told me that River was awesome, and she was probably the number one reason why I wanted to watch the show. I had seen a picture of her with swords in a karate pose on the internet and was excited to see her in action. Imagine my disappointment when I got halfway through the series and all she's done so far is cry and babble nonsense. I was seriously pissed off, I felt like I was a victim of false advertising. She probably starts doing cool stuff by the end of the show, but I'll probably never watch to find out. I have yet to hear her say one complete sentence, even though she's supposed to be some sort of prodigy.Next there's the engineer, the only character I do like. She is bubbly and friendly and is the only character that isn't rude to all the other characters. Oh, and they make you think she dies at the end of the pilot episode! I was like, ""WHAT?! Did they just kill off the ONLY character I like?!"" Yeah, the captain just walks up and tells the audience she's dead ...and then you see her alive and he's like, ""April Fools, she's alive!""  HOW HILARIOUS. Up until that point, the captain had been absolutely nothing but grouchy-serious and the last thing I expected was a joke out of him, not that tricking people into thinking someone is dead qualifies as a 'joke.' Good grief, that pissed me off so much I started yelling at the TV, and I almost stopped watching the show because she's the only thing that made it almost tolerable. Imagine if someone pulled a prank like that in real life? The captain is such a friggin' psycho.Which brings me to the captain himself. The internet told me he was a funny, quirky, lovable rogue with a heart of gold, and he was my number two reason for wanting to see Firefly after River. I gotta say though, I hate him. He's absolutely nothing like how I heard. He's always all dark and moody, and he yells at Book just for being a priest EVERY TIME HE SEES HIM. I mean, isn't Book a paying customer?! Who yells at a paying customer?! What an awful character!What I REALLY hate about the captain, however, is that he doesn't even play his character consistently. Usually he's grouchy and moody, being a jerk to almost everyone else. Then, after he's worked up a huge amount of dislike from me, he will unexpectedly make a lighthearted joke and then immediately go back to being a grouchy douche. This happens maybe once every episode, and it really bothers me because the jokes not only seem out of character but whenever he makes them my reaction is, ""Did ... did he just make a joke?? He's not allowed to ... you're not allowed to be funny! You're a jerk, captain!"" (I actually yelled this at the TV while watching.) If he was ALWAYS that lighthearted and quirky I would probably like him, but instead it just feels like the writers couldn't decide on what kind of character to write.Speaking of the writing, I remember yelling at the TV quite a lot about the idiocy going on in some of the episodes. For instance, we have the Reavers. I'll grant that the Reavers are a cool concept--they're a bunch of castaways that got Space Madness like in Ren and Stimpy--but if you think about it, these people have space rabies, so wouldn't they just all kill each other instead of giving themselves prison piercings and acting like Animal from the Muppets? What makes these violent crazy people say, ""We'll kill, rape, and eat people as long as they're NOT Reavers?"" And how can these completely irrational human beings pilot something as sophisticated as a spaceship? Plus I find it hard to believe that simply seeing a Reaver doing Reaver stuff is enough make you to go crazy and become one of them.Also, the people on all the planets they visit are impossibly backward. There are SPACESHIPS in this universe, how are there people that still believe in witchcraft?! Is there no internet or education in the future? It just pushes all suspension of disbelief out the window! (They even dress like they're in Little House on the Prairie, for Pete's sake! MAN, I hate that!) And how does the captain, with ABSOLUTELY NO SWORDFIGTHING EXPERIENCE, kill an expert fencer in a swordfighting duel? He doesn't even cheat to win! Speaking from experience it's just not possible, but come to think of it, why are there still swordfighting duels in the space age?! Haven't they invented more civilized (or at least more hi-tech) means of settling disputes by now? How stupid does the captain have to be in order to get in a fight to the death with an expert swordsman over the honor of a SPACE PROSTITUTE?! It's mind boggling!Then there's the awful dialogue--everyone's always mean to each other, and I hate that. Not only do I not want to watch it, but it just feels like they injected arguments into the show as a feeble attempt at making the characters more believable. (And then after it's established that everyone hates each other, they show everyone playing basketball together in their spare time as though they're best buddies. I was like, ""What?!"") Anyway, besides the unlikable characters, the dialogue has to be the biggest reason why I can't stand this show.Also, all the storylines are lousy. That train episode kept making me think of FF8, and then there's another episode about ballroom dancing (of all things) that was completely boring and stupid. (Why were they all dressed in Elizabethan clothes in the future?! That's not even fitting with the Western/Sci-fi theme of the show!) And another episode was about a space version of the Crucible that didn't make any sense. Okay, so first River says something about a mute child talking to her, and then for some reason the villagers' immediate assumption was that River is a witch?? Then they were going to burn River and her brother on a stake, even though they kidnapped the brother because he's a doctor they're in desperate need of! And then the captain, who doesn't even know the doctor is in trouble, comes to rescue them even though it's established that he hates the doctor! The reason the captain gives for rescuing the doctor is that he's ""part of the crew."" No, captain, he's a passenger that everyone on board hates, and his sister is a stowaway that the police are after. Plus, the doctor jumped ship voluntarily because he was stupid, and I don't think that it's ever explained how they knew the villagers were going to burn them. I remember being angry most of the time while I was watching this show, and wondering just how anyone could like it because the writing was so bad.That being said, the special effects are actually pretty friggin' good for a television show. Color me impressed. I don't like the spaceship designs, though. I think the Serenity looks like they took an average looking spaceship, put a big red light on its tail end, and then stepped on it to make it crooked. It bugs me every time I look at it. I've heard people complain that the guns in this show look like old west guns but shoot lasers, but to be honest I didn't even notice.Overall, maybe I'm being too harsh. I don't suppose it's a TERRIBLE show, I just can't stand it personally. There were two parts I did kind of like--the part where the captain kicks some dude into an engine, and the part where the engineer was talking about spaceships with random guys at the ballroom dance. The rest of the show I can do without. I dunno, maybe Firefly just didn't live up to my expectations, or maybe being constantly reminded that it exists has made me jaded. I don't suppose it deserved to be cancelled based on its merits (I think CSI is a hundred times worse), but I also doubt it would have reached the popularity it currently enjoys had it not been for the scandal surrounding its cancellation. Anyway, I could never give a show I hate this much anything more than one star, so bring on the haters."	1.0	Huge disappointment, didn't live up to the hype	2014-04-11	27	6	21
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1PR530F0MH7K8	A. P.	For years I'd been told Firefly was amazing but I didn't want to believe it (considering the fact that it was cancelled before it finished its first season. How can it be that amazing?) But it is. With fully rounded characters, great sets and effects without a high budget and such wonderful storytelling that it can have you in tears and then immediate laughter (or vice versa) it qualifies as not only amazing but so much more.I can't wait to rewatch.

It has every component of awesomeness; the plot, character development, action, and underlying themes are well done.  In fact, it's my favorite show I have seen in years.  How this series didn't get carried on for a second season is beyond me.  I suppose everyone was too busy watching The Bachelor.  Sad, so sad.  There is also a movie called Serenity that should be watched after viewing season one.  It makes me want to find Joss Whedon and give him the biggest high-five ever.  It's masterful.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AX6SYIOKW5NV5	Ariel Cinii	"When FOX aired the ""Firefly"" series, they fell into the typical network programming trap of under-promoting and irregular airing, or pitting it against a ratings monster like ""CSI"". It's like executives don't understand that some shows need time to build an audience. But oops, here comes Ratings Time; your show doesn't get the numbers, so off you go! I had only seen half the aired episodes (if that) and by the time I could find the show again, it was gone. Then I heard there was a fan club and through it heard that series producer Joss Whedon was coming out with ""Serenity"", a ""Firefly"" movie. Joy! Panic! What have I missed? Can I ever catch up?""Firefly"" wasn't crash-bang from the start, it wasn't an epic, it was just a decently written space-cowboy show, only nowhere near as cheesy as they premise would have led you to believe. (Anyone remember groaning at the title, ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer""?) By viewing one show at at a time on DVD, you discover an arcane oddity they used to call a ""story line"" and you realise what a wonderful TV series we've lost. Like a good book, it takes a little time to get into it and open it up, more time than a network is willing to give you before trying to sell you something.Basically, if you want to completely understand ""Serenity"", see the whole series as it was intended to be shown. Watch all the special features. Listen to Ron Glass laugh out loud for the first time since ""Barney Miller"". Crawl through the Serenity set by set. Feel ""caught-up"", as I did, and then go see the film and catch what the rest of the audience missed--unless they're already Browncoats."	5.0	Serenity's Pre-Requisite	2005-10-12	5	3	2

Set in the future, with shocking parallels to our own times, the series is set on the edge of space, in the frontier worlds.  It captures the lives, emotions, and energy of the characters as they try to make their own way in the world.Every episode is a blend of seriousness and humor, and every story is well-told, with great special effects, superb acting, and an attention to every little detail - from camera angles to the music - that will undoubtedly having you fall in love with this series.If you missed it on TV, don't miss it on DVD.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AWU32P0LFLNGJ	Arnold, Kevin	"I bought this show on blu-ray at the urging of a friend. I didn't have high expectations but after the first episode (Serenity Part 1 and 2) I was blown away. This show combines a western feel (and music) with sci-fi, drama, humor, sex appeal, and a unique originality that cements it as a very entertaining and enjoyable show. Every character has a story to tell along with the many ships, races, and planets. I urge everyone who is a fan to call, write, or e-mail creator/writer Joss Wheadon to bring this show back in some form on any network, perhaps the Sci-Fi Channel (would be a perfect home if Fox wouldn't take it back). If not a revival of the show, at least give the fans another movie! The fact that the movie Serenity was even made after the shows cancellation speaks volumes...how many shows do you know of were given a movie after only 11 aired episodes? At the time of writing this, Firefly has been in Amazon's top 100 bestsellers for over 215 days!! It's currently number 1 under Fox TV, sci-fi and fantasy TV, and sci-fi series too! Fox messed this show up when it originally aired by moving time slots, airing episodes out of order, and not giving it a good promotion...thus not even giving the show a real chance. May I remind you all that the show Family Guy was canceled by Fox but the fans who bought the DVDs loved it so much that they demanded its return and look what happened...it worked! The same can hold true for Firefly if we all make the extra effort to show our support. This is one of the best shows I've ever seen and it deserves a second chance.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A20UJP1JSTIOL6	artanis65	"There's so little that's good on television now that any halfway decent show stands out.  So it's hard to be objective about a show like ""Firefly.""  However, I am convinced that Firefly is such a brilliant genre-defining show it would shine in any era, and that science fiction fans will still be watching and talking about this show in thirty or forty years as we do about the original Star Trek today.When I first heard that Joss Whedon was doing a sci-fi Western, I looked forward to it.  I thought ""that's great; he's figured out that Science Fiction is the successor genre to the Western.""  Both offer limitless possibilities for adventure and action.  It's no coincidence that the popularity of westerns faded around the time movie science fiction started to become popular.  One genre looks back; the other looks ahead.  But I hadn't guessed that Whedon would put the two together quite literally.  One criticism the show gets is the unlikelihood of high and low technology existing together.  I'm sure Whedon has read his Robert Heinlein (Tunnel in the Sky, Farmer in the Sky), and low technology makes sense on a frontier world where there's not much money for power.  (They don't use modern tractors for farming in many parts of the world even today - they use horses and oxen.)  Firefly combines well thought out, logically coherent world building with the adventure and sense of wonder offered by the best space opera.The dialogue, special effects, acting, and even the music is top notch.  The worst you can say about the series is that the plotting in some of the episodes is fairly pedestrian.  If you watch the extras, you get the sense that the cast, especially Nathan Fillion who clearly has a deep appreciation of what Whedon is doing, knew that it was part of something special.  The attention to detail is stunning.  Several of the episodes are among the best television I've ever seen - the last half hour of the pilot ""Serenity"" just moves, and Out of Gas, and Objects in Space.  Most of the episodes are worth seeing more than once.Here's hoping the upcoming Serenity movie lives up the show's quality and becomes a success and that we get several more Serenity movies.  And here's hoping that the money people in Hollywood give Joss Whedon carte blanche to do what he wants in the future.  He's the rare talent who can transform genre fiction into art."	5.0	genre defining show	2004-07-28	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3B249FQ2OJBCQ	"AstroNerdBoy ""AstroNerdBoy"""	"Likely you already know about ""Firefly"" so I'm not going to bore you with a review of the series (which I love).The original DVD release was kind of annoying in that you couldn't watch all the episodes at once.  Instead, you had to go to each episode's sub-menu and go from there.  That's gone with the Blu-ray release as you can watch all the episodes with the nifty ""play all"" feature.The HD version does look better than the original DVD release, though at times there is grain in the picture (as was in the DVD release when played on an HDTV).  This comes through mostly during scenes that aren't well lit.  It also comes into play during some fast-motion action sequences too.  It isn't bad, but it is noticeable especially after a moment where things look ""shiny.""The extras are pretty much what came with the DVD release, though I believe there is one or two new small extras.The bad comes from the fact that the BD disables my player's resume feature completely.  What does this mean?  Simply put, it means that when I press ""stop"" on my fully upgraded Blu-ray player, pressing play again makes me go through the entire 30-seconds of loading, anti-piracy messages, and then finally the menu.  While this is true on quite a number of BD titles, this is the first one that does not have the compensation ""bookmark"" feature so that at least after you go through the annoyance of having to go through the load stuff again, you can then start back up at your bookmark.  As such, if you need to stop in mid-play, you better just press ""pause"" or be annoyed (unless you don't mind wasting time to get back to where you left off, to say nothing of trying to remember where you left off).So in upgrading your DVD set, you'll get an overall better picture, better sound, and you trade one annoyance with another.  Whomever came up with the idea of disabling a BD player's resume function should be punished."	3.0	Series Fine, HD OK, Resume Function Blocked	2009-07-18	6	3	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2W04YE5OSLNO9	Audrey	I never saw Firefly aired on television. Actually, I saw the movie, loved it, and decided to watch the series. If you only saw the movie and think you've seen everything the series has to offer just by that, think again. The movie doesn't come close to introducing the characters the way the show does, and I have to say, contains some of the best characterization I've seen in years.From the fiercely protective Captain Malcolm Reynolds; Inara, the registered companion; would-be doctor Simon Tam and his sister, River, the genius who went crazy after her head was messed with by the government; Shephard Book, who seems to know more about the world than a man of the cloth should; the sometimes cowardly but hilarious Jayne; polar opposite husband and wife team Zoe and Wash; and Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, the show is more than just a sci-fi space spoof.They steal, they fly, wear brown coats and combat boots, and curse in Chinese...I don't want to give plotlines; it isn't needed. But it isn't just the action or the cool comebacks that make this series truly special; it's the underlying meaning and fierce bond between the characters. They are intensely loyal to one another, and with each episode comes something new learned about each one.With excellent dialogue and engaging characters and tales, Firefly is in a genre of its own, mixing cowboys, a future stuck in the old west, moral dilemmas, and outer space. Firefly is a one-of-a-kind show, and there will never be another like it, ever. I don't understand how this didn't make it longer, especially when considering the kinds of shows that do last. When I think about all of the shows I've seen, I can't seem to remember one that tops Firefly, at least, not for me. So, to undermine my earlier comment, 'one of the best television shows of all time,' I'm going to correct myself and say that, for now, and after all the years of watching shows last and last, season after season after season, Firefly, a television show comprised of only fourteen episodes and three extras that never even aired beats every single one, hands down. Now, what does that say?Have I said how much I love this show? Probably, but I'll say it again. I love it. I love the characters. I love the stories. I love the dialogue, the jokes, the outfits...I love everything about it. Firefly feels like some long lost friend who I spent my entire childhood with, that's what. I watch it and I want to watch it right over again, and then, maybe a third time, too.Now, we're all left to enjoy and mourn what was and what might have been.Oh, yeah, and if you've seen this, or even if you haven't, check out the movie; it's awesome.	5.0	One of my all-time favorite shows	2008-03-09	0	0	0

The truly outstanding shows (that are often cancelled) have the ongoing storytelling quality that I love.  Most television writers these days lack the storytelling ""gene"" for lack of a better word.  We can probably name the ones currently with this skill on one hand.  Joss Whedon, Michael Strahczinsky, um.........and storytelling is what makes us go back and read stories over and over again. It is what makes us watch the same movie or tv series repeatedly...it's the story telling.  You have to be drawn into the ""universe"", you have to care about the characters and want to know them better. Whedon accomplishes this in the series and in the movie also.

On the other hand, the series premises allow for ANY scenario - e.g., an old-fashioned, wild-west train hoist - of a maglev train.  Or Deep South with a touch of Old England.  The writing is a bit uneven, but when it is good, it is VERY good.  The special effects are superb and I want my own Firefly, even if I don't know what it uses in place of gravity.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3QY32WS6CSFPO	A viewer	I have never wrote any review for anything before so this is my first time. I honestly felt I should write a review for this show because it deserves a recommendation. I don't watch much TV, and although there are a few shows on that I like I would never buy the DVDs. Heck, I don't even know why I bought these, guess I was just bored and had a few bucks to spend and was looking for some good entertainment. The number of 5 star reviews for this show sealed the deal for me (although I found out later some of these were written by devoted fans to bump up the DVD's sales... I probably would have thought twice about buying if I found out earlier. I am glad I didn't). After watching the entire set I know why the fans are so devoted. The dialog is witty, the characters(and their relationships) are interesting and real, and the storylines are solid. Some maybe turned off by the fushion setting but it makes perfect sense in context. Each episode is fresh and honestly better than most TV shows and movies out there. There's a good balance of action, drama, and comedy. This show will lead you to think the plot was going one way then completely surprise you (in a good way). Even if you knew things weren't going the way it seems you wouldn't know where it would end up. Special effects are good. Watching the cast/crew interviews you can tell they loved working on this show and the results show. This show is not like your standard scifi with the techno babble and boring moral people. The characters are real people in a gritty world. I just wished this show was longer since by the end you can see hints of real interesting things developing on the horizon. Too bad FOX cut the show short, they had a real gem on their hands (what the heck were those guys thinking?). At least there's a movie in the works. Hope another network picks it up if it's a hit. Overall I recommend it to anyone who likes scifi, westerns, or just plain old good TV.	5.0	Glad I bought this set	2004-04-19	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38CLXXFIPNXHF	"A. Wingate ""Awing"""	Firefly is the best series you never saw.  Full of heart and humor, character-centric and clever-dialogue-rich. A science fiction series without aliens, and still the most entertaining sci fi to come down the pike in decades.  I'm a die hard Stargate fan, and I love this one as much, if not more. There are 13 &lt;?> episodes in all, all included in this set, and not a stinker in the bunch.  They are well worth watching again and again.  You'll come to know and love the gang as much as I have and you too may be buying more sets to give away.  The extras included are priceless for those who have seen the series and just want to delve more into it.  If you think you saw it on TV, this is so much better.  Crystal clear, wide screen and the commentaries are to die for.  I'd buy it again at twice the price.	5.0	Firefly- Get it, you won't be sorry.	2006-01-31	5	5	0

When I saw the previews for it, I thought oh finally something interesting. I agree with several of the other people here, that there is just too many reality TV shows out there and I hardly watch anything from the networks. I only got to see a few episodes of Firefly (usually had to work, so I would record what I could. And then only three months into the season it was canceled.I have never understood Fox's thinking with the shows that it keeps (which a lot to me are a waste of time, with a few exceptions) and the shows that it cancels which several seem so promising. And then there is the order in which Fox aired this, not showing the pilot ""Serenity"" until the end. It never really showed you the complexity of the character some of their backgrounds and how they came together until much later on.But then doing some searching on the internet, I found that they were doing a movie, which is a rare thing (a show getting canceled being able to be put into production for a movie, and not being done by Fox, but by Universal). It just shows how popular and good this show was in its run. The cast is excellent, the humor is perfect. I don't think there is a episode that I didn't laugh my head off. And I saw the movie, it just brought it all back to me.It is a shame that Fox canceled a another jewel among all the rocks out there, but that is why I bought the series.

It's about time and thank you Fox!! I love these shows and I've been anxiously awaiting their release.  What can I say about a show (now only on DVD) that is humorous and clever.  The episodes were written to a smart audience because they didn't assume that they had to explain every little detail.  The characters let you fall in love with them even though they may be slightly quirky.  If you can't relate to a guy the has honor and morals while having to be a smuggler then this may not be for you, but if you are looking for a really fun ride and the flight of the decade, buy the DVD's and hang on.

Intelligent, witty, artful entertainment is even more rare.Firefly is the most rare of commodities. It is intelligent, witty, artful, sexy and intriguing and addictive and this is all accomplished in only 11 televised hours and three hours that never made it to air.The people feel real in their skin and 'not too fancy' clothes. Malcolm Reynolds feels loyalty to his people and his ship.  Serenity and her crew are the most important things in his world.The Serenity set show a ship that has been hard used.  Dented, battered but obviously loved with tiny touches of home.Their conversations and situations are those of people who have to work hard to make a living on the edge of a prosperous society.Some networks give crummy shows endless months to find an audience.  Fox did their standard job of taking a forward-thinking science fiction show and placing it in the hardest hour to suceed:  8:00 Eastern on Friday night. Then to follow this bit of genius, they pre-empted it, moved it to other nights, showed it out of sequence and generally did everything they could to make it fail.Despite being cancelled, it didn't fail.  Firefly stirred the imaginations and hearts of fans.  We want the movie and we want the TV series the movie will doubtless spawn.Buy this DVD but be prepared to go without sleep until you've seen each one at least three times.	5.0	Another FOX Murder Victim	2004-02-03	2	2	0

I stumbled across this gem years after it had come and gone, having heard of it and not paying it much attention. Eventually in spite of its quirkiness (a space western, what?) I said, ""hey what the hell I've got nothing else to do."" What I found was all of my childhood fantasies of being a(n): cowboy, astronaut, soldier, and do-good desperado rolled into one. All the while told in a fashion that feels just right, organic even. Firefly's universe is full of danger, desperation and no doubt adventure. It is just plain fun. Without a doubt the worst aspect of this series is that Firefly is but one season and a movie in length. The trip will be brief but it is a journey worth every step.

VIZ:Someone talked about the planets being terraformed 'by magic.'  Not magic--technology; so what if the ins and outs of the technology weren't explained?Some others said that the mixture of English and Chinese was 'ridiculous.'  How so when the the two most powerful countries on Earth are the United States and China?  Hence, when Humanity left Earth-that-Was, is it not logical that English and Mandarin would be the two dominant languages?The idea of having some colonies being almost pre-industrial while others were as 'futuristic' as any in science fiction was a refreshing departure from the sf convention of everything being squeaky-clean.  The juxtaposition of the two is a perfect metaphor for modern society, where in the most wealthy country on earth we have people who don't even have indoor plumbing.I will agree that the characters weren't as well-developed as they might have been, nor were certain questions fully answered (like what, exactly, was the Blue Sun Corporation up to, and what was it that was so bad about the Alliance government?) but it is hardly the writer's or director's fault that the show was cancelled before they got around to that.  I'm sure that there are unused scripts gathering dust in desk drawers which would fill out these issues, and that the upcoming movie will do so.The most interesting and enigmatic character is the Shepherd Book. I agree with the writer who said that he was given little to do.  I suspect that in a former life he had been a high official in the Alliance, and that during the War he had done something horrible, something for which he could not forgive himself; after spending some time in the Abbey, it was laid on him as a penance that he find a group of die-hard Independantists who had suffered from the war and to minister to themJW wanted to be the 'anti Trek.'  Where on Trek the universe was so full of sentient life that you almost couldn't turn over a rock without finding it, in this show humankindis alone. Where on Trek we were shown a ship that was the apogee of technology and a crew who represented the best and the brightest of the culture, here we are presented with a barely-spaceworthy bucket of bolts crewed with assorted riff-raff.  Gene Roddenberry, bless his idealistic, romantic, humanist heart, was sure that by the time we reached space we would have overcome all the baser parts of our nature; here, however, we see a universe populated by the same horny, greedy, selfish S.O.B.s that we meet every day--and the same noble and generous ones, too (and sometimes they're the same people!)I never saw ""Firefly"" when it was on the air; I was introduced to it by a bit of fanfic by someone who had written stories I liked in another fandom.

When you combine the quality of the acting, writing and visuals with Joss Whedon's unmatched creative direction...you've got a recipe for greatness.  I'd you appreciate Sci-Fi at all, then you'll love this.  If you've seen star wars, you'll wish George Lucas was as good at character development and background details as the creators of Firefly are (albeit a lot of inspiration is surely found from the classic Sci-Fi saga).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2NOS0BCMY40B	B. Cameron	"Firefly is one of those shows that really didn't the attention it deserved.  Sure, it got a movie even, but still was relatively unknown by even hardcore sci-fi fans.  By mixing both Western and Sci-fi genres, Firefly accomplishes what other shows have only tried and failed at.  A nice looking, well written, funny, action packed, FX'ed western-sci-fi hullaballoo!!!If you've seen the anime ""Cowboy Bebop"" you'll see the similarities almost immediately.  The series was way too short, but in that matter, it's easy to appreciate... accompanied with the film ""Serenity.""If you're thinking of giving it a shot.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1MZ81QSFXJE2I	B. Crist	During its brief stint on broadcast TV, I managed to catch only a few episodes of Firefly, but I never really got into it.  Probably because, like many of the best TV dramas, Firefly is a highly linear show.  If you skip episodes or watch them out of order, you just don't get it.  But I had heard from friends that the show was good, so I decided to buy it, and it did not disappoint.  Once you start watching, it's hard to put the discs down.  And make sure to watch Serenity when you're done with the season.	5.0	Battlestar Galactica meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid	2007-10-11	2	1	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IZIBK01H8GQM	"B. Daggerhart ""Ishmayl"""	"I grew up watching Sci Fi.  My parents got me started on the original Star Trek.  Then, as they came out with new episodes, I watched MacGuyver and Quantumn Leap.  Star Trek: The Next Generation came out, and I didn't think it could get any better than Captain Picard, Data, and Q.I also grew up *reading* Sci Fi.  I read the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was 9 years old, then again when I was 13, then again when I was 17, and have read it once a year every year since then.  I read the Star Wars novelizations, Star Trek novelizations, D&D; books, ""Choose Your Own Adventure,"" and any other fantasy/science-fiction I could get my hands on.  It was all golden to me.The reason I preface with this information is to inform the reader that I have an extensive background in science fiction and fantasy, and take that background relatively seriously.So when I say that ""Firefly"" is the best science fiction show ever, hopefully that holds a little bit of weight.From the first minute of the show, the viewer is captivated.  Joss Whedon, the show's director and creator, put his heart and soul into this startling vision of the future.  He made it as realistic as he could, subtley using fantasy and western overtones the whole time.  There is no ""Prime Directive,"" and there are very few rules in this future, except the rule that has goverened humans such as ourselves for thousands of years:  The strong survive, the weak fade away.The entire series has a very western flavor to it, as it should.  It takes place in a solar system that is not our own, but one that is based on human culture.  There are no aliens with weird foreheads, and there are no giant, squid-like space entities.  There are simply humans, rich and poor, good and evil, allied and independent, fighting to survive.  Very much like the frontier lands of America decades and centuries ago, the frontiers of space are unlawful, unruly, uncivilized, and unfamiliar.  Bandits and theives rule those weaker than they, and themselves are ruled by the law of the Alliance, who occasionally show up to make a nuisance of themselves.  The central ""Core"" planets have advanced technology, floating cities, and lawful civilization, but the border planets are as dusty and rugged as 1890's Nebraska.The central character is Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, and veteran in the losing side of a war against the Alliance years before.  He has forged out a name and place for himself as a pirate, leading a crew of extraordinarily well-developed characters.  The acting is superb in a day when episodes of ""Friends"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" seem to air nonstop on most television sets, and the special effects could put many high-end movies to shame.Alas, the show only lasted 14 episodes (only 11 of which were aired), because FOX TV fumbled.  They aired the episodes in the wrong order (opting to show the second episode first, since it was more ""action-packed""), and failed to advertise the show at all.  It faded into obscurity, and now has mostly just a cult following.Everyone who loves TV should see Firefly.  If you love science fiction, fantasy, western, drama, special effects, hot girls, hunky guys, danger, evil, spookiness, or any combination of these, then this show will make you happy.  You'll fly through 14 episodes in 2 days (as I did) and feel like weeping that there are no more shows to come.  And there's a good chance you'll think to yourself, ""This is the best damn science fiction show ever."""	5.0	The Best Science Fiction Show Ever	2005-05-09	9	9	0

I did not watch it when it was on television, but discovered it by watching the set I bought for my daughter as something for the entire family to enjoy.  I am not a fan of science fiction so I was not expecting to like the show, and was pleasantly surprised.  It reminded my of the early `Star Trek' with a mixture of 'Mavrick' and 'Support Your Local Sheriff'.  The tongue in cheek humor was especially enjoyable and I expected it would be the new genre in Science Fiction television. It was bitter sweet to learn that there would be no future episodes to watch. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for substantive entertainment, even if you are not a fan of Sci-fi, or Westerns, the seamless miscellany of the two take a back seat to inspired writing and salient character development.	5.0	Even baby-boomers will enjoy this gem	2004-01-13	76	67	9

There is some violence and sexual content, but we were able to talk about it.

My husband and I started watching the series on DVD right after finishing the Six Feet Under series, which we loved. Maybe we needed more time between shows to lower our standards, because by comparison, Firefly plays out like a high school production. The dialogue is poorly written, the jokes are predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is VERY average. (Nathan Fillion does a respectable job, but the rest of the ensemble I expect to be unemployed for a long time.) We are simply stunned at the response to this show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	"The handful of episodes on these DVDs range from the merely enjoyable to the great, but Joss Whedon's Firefly is somewhat frustrating as a ""complete series"" because he wasn't given time to complete it, or even to put a satisfactory ending on the show's television incarnation.Mysteries abound after the final episode, with the secrets of many of the characters frustratingly only hinted at, at best.That said, the series is one of the strongest science fiction television series to date and marks a maturation of Joss Whedon's craft -- many of the same archetypes from his Buffyverse appear here, but in more complex and satisfying form. Well worth seeing for any science fiction fan, particularly those who prefer their starships a little more Millennium Falcon and a little less Enterprise.Strongly recommended."	5.0	Maddeningly incomplete -- Thanks, Fox suits!	2006-03-17	7	7	0

It's better to watch in order, but even then you can watch most episodes and still get a kick out of 'em individually.Every episode has something new, exciting, fabulous - and every character has a story. Not all of it's laid out, leaving you wondering and wanting more out of each show. And that 'more' is certainly delivered. HIGHLY recommend buying the series, and the follow-up film (same name as the first episode, and the craft itself), ""Serenity"". It's all wonderful - I've rewatched the series more than I can count, and I'll keep watching them again.

The characters are original and well developed, the writing is hillarious and insightful at the same time, and all the episodes fit together to tell a bigger story.  The story takes lots of unexpected turns, but if you go back and watch the earlier episodes again, you can see the clues that were cleverly embedded.  On top of all that, the show is just plain fun -- a sci-fi/western combination with lots of action, shot in a way that makes it feel like you're there.It's too bad fox didn't give this show a fair chance.

Let me put it simply: I love this show.  I have not loved a show like this since I sat glued in front of the tv every week to watch ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" way back in the day (when i was just a kid being introduced to sci fi).  This show is just so FRESH.  I adore sci-fi shows but really, the pickings have been slim and rather lame in recent years.  Joss Whedon brought a whole new vision and feel to a tv genre that, I for one feel, has been dying a slow death.  The people at Fox who didn't ""get"" this show and not only didn't properly promote it but actively sabotaged it, obviously have had their brains rotted out from watching too much ""reality"" tv.  I only hope there's a special circle in hell reserved for them.  (I'm kidding!  I think...)Reportedly, there is a possible movie in the works if this DVD set sells well enough (fireflymovie.com) so I can only hope that I will get some closure on these incredibly vivid characters and the unique universe they live in.  This DVD set is well done and you can really tell on the commentaries how much everyone who worked ""Firefly"" adored the show (and detested Fox).  If you love science fiction, westerns, either of Joss Whedon's other shows (""Buffy"" and ""Angel""), or UNIQUE and INNOVATIVE tv, pick this set up.

However, I was disappointed with the blu-ray version. I don't know if it was the remastering but all the episodes looked uneven, some scenes were high quality and others were grainy. Give me one or the other, not both mashed together. Its not a high-quality blu-ray copy and I wish they spent more time making it look better. In some scenes the blu-ray copy goes extremely bright and you can't see what's going on. As for the blu-ray special features, there are hardly any. Although the Lunch with Joss Whedon is a good addition, it doesn't constitute selling a whole new box set. I would rather stick with the DVD's, they look better. What should of happened is a high-quality blu-ray set with tons of special features, maybe a new episode. However, firefly is still a amazing series and although the blu-ray part should score a 1, firefly is a 5 and brings it up to a 3.	3.0	Good Series Bad Blu-Ray	2008-12-12	10	7	3
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2I2MTECJ4GLG	Benjamin H Hosford	Wow! After 10 years I realized there was no excuse as to why I never saw the show, and borrowed the DVD set from my sister. This series is absolutely amazing, and I cannot stress that enough! Yes, it was dead before its time, but like Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan it only adds to Firefly's legacy.The series centers on 9 characters aboard the Serenity, a Firefly-class freighter roughly around next Sunday AD. The thing that makes this show work so well is the interaction between the crew and the unique personality of each member. When I started watching YouTube clips of the cast at comic con events I was pleased to find out the chemistry extends to real life, as the cast members were (and still are) good friends. It shows through their performances throughout the series.I was 4 episodes in and I knew this was already a 5-star series. &#34;Out of Gas&#34; is quite possibly the best TV episode of any show I've seen, ever. Firefly does an excellent job balancing drama, comedy, and action, and this is a textbook example of lightning in a bottle. Not only should you stop reading and buy it, but pick up Serenity because you can't leave the story unfinished.The fact this show was aired out of order and cancelled before its time is baffling. You've heard the hype, so stop putting it off and climb aboard. I did, and I can't figure out why it took me so long.	5.0	You can't take the sky from me...	2013-08-30	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ABFMBLOJ0SIYY	Benjamin J. Moore	I might actually watch TV once in a while if there were more shows like this.I saw the pilot episode of this on the Sci Fi channel and immediately went out and purchased the DVD.  Now I understand why a DVD TV series that was released in 2002 is sitting up at #3 on the Top Sellers list in the waning days of 2005.  This is just really great acting, writing, directing, music, and everything.It's an accidental conglomeration of wildly different characters,  brought together by fate and bound by love, hate, honor, and betrayal.  The interactions and frictions between the characters helps to drive each episode in new and unexpected directions.  Through the 13 meaty 40+ minute episodes and hour-long pilot (well worth the price of this set), you will meet each of the 9 central characters and grow quickly to know them.  Many you will love, some you will hate, some you will hate to love, and others you will love to - well, you get the idea.Many memorable lines and moments will grab you as you take in the entire series.  I personally had a hard time putting it down once I started.  I recommend beginning your viewing early on a Saturday, in case you get hooked like I did.  Going to work the next day with only four episodes under my belt, knowing there were so many more yet to see was near torture.  As soon as I finished watching, I started them all over again.I am not quite sure what Fox was thinking, or any network for that matter.  I guess there isn't much room on TV for witty writing, heartwarming characters, exciting action, and clever plots.  Since there isn't, I guess we can say thank god for DVDs, and thank god for the internet so we can find out about gems like this that might have otherwise have been missed.I know it's weird, but I actually think my life has been enriched for having seen that someone out there is making material with this much heart.  The entire series was some of the best guilt-free entertainment I have had in years, and my only problem with it is that there aren't 100 more episodes.Rent it first if you're not sure this is right for you, but whatever you do, give this series a chance.  This is not something I would have normally picked up on my own, and I am so glad I stumbled across it.  Thrilling adventures, clever story lines, witty dialogue, and the best gorram TV show nobody ever saw (although with DVD sales the way they are, perhaps that's not exactly true anymore!).If you happen to like this and you're hungry for more, check out Serenity.  It's a Big Damn Movie that takes these same characters on a silver screen adventure (hopefully not the last!) which takes place after the events in the series, which only got made apparently because this DVD sold so well.  It's a must-have for any fans of this series.	5.0	Engaging, immersive, irreverent, all kinds of FUN!	2005-12-27	11	10	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GS30SQ26YC61	"Benjamin Mund ""Night Moves II"""	I decided to buy this series after watching the movie Serenity. Even though I had never heard of the show before, I went on a limb and decided to get into it. This became the most amazing, and in turn, disappointing fact about the series. The positive is that I was able to buy every episode of the show for only $20. The disappointment came when I found out just how great the show was, making me want more.This series is worth buying if you are interested in the story. My advice would be to watch Serenity, and if you like it even a small bit, buy the series. For the price it can't be beat.	5.0	Instant classic	2007-07-10	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2H3IQDVJSR12U	Benjamin Nelson	I can't say enough good things about this show. From the pilot to the last episode, it is strong all the way through. It episode got noticeably better as it went on. Just when you thought that there was no way from them to top the previous episode, they did. The Character's are some of the best I seen. They are so interesting in their interactions. The dialog is top notch and extremely witty. Some episodes are non stop one liners that will have you rolling on the floor while other episodes can be quite chilling or dramatic. This show has it all and I truly think it something that can be enjoyed by everyone. It doesn't suffer from the same sci-fi stereo-types, in fact it goes against them somewhat. I can almost guarantee that you will like this show. Like I said, it has a lot of appeal for a wide group of people. Give it a shot, you WILL NOT be disappointed.Just go buy it, It's only 35$ and it's worth it!	5.0	The Best 35 bucks you'll spend on a DVD set.	2004-04-08	7	6	1

When my Stanford son and Duke daughter visited over Christmas, I showed them the series.  They resisted the idea of a space western, but at the end of the pilot my son said, ""that was good,"" to which my daughter replied, ""yes, that was very good.""  I realized I was enjoying it even more on the second viewing than on the first.  From then on, it took real discipline to limit ourselves to two episodes a night till the series ran out:  someone always said, ""one more.""  Even my wife, who is foreign-born and normally doesn't like American humor, was gripped by this series' wit as well as by its action.  Starfly had everything, imaginative concepts, great cast and writing, truly special camera work -- all in all brilliant!

You can see my Serenity review for more details on the movie.This series has all my favorite characters from the movie. The series was of course made before the movie. The series has most of the same characters and loosely the same base story. I can see where the series closed down too soon.Some space ship, some cowboy, and a lot of people to people situation interaction. Each episode brings in a new problem and we see how our characters are to solve the problem or at least leave us with the thought of what we would do if we were there.I saw the complete series on Blu-ray DVD as I wanted more control over the display and repeated viewing without having to subscribe to a service.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GHZUJKROEVK8	Bevan Lee	The mind boggles at the thought processes of Fox Network Executives.  The opening two hours of this series is a fantastic, intriguing. compelling launch in to the world of the crew of Serenity.  The second episode is a rather lack-lustre, pedestrian, formulaic and unintriguing follow up episode to the arresting opening two hours.  And the bozos at Fox decided to open the series with this second episode rather than the dedicated introductory telemovie.  No wonder viewers who sampled the show on opening night were not hooked.  After I viewed the opening telemovie I was a convert.  After the second episode I felt totally indifferent, but due to having seen the opening telemovie was intent on persevering on to the better later episodes.  If I had seen only that second episode as an introduction, there is no way I'd have bothered to sample the show again.  Also, without the set-up of the telemovie, the second episode as an opener must have been very confusing to viewers.  How did these lame brains who made this decision get their jobs?.  This decision must have broken Joss Weedon's heart.  A man of his creative skill at the whim and caprice of such know nothing fools.  Hollywood is truly a strange place.	4.0	Network Idiocy	2004-10-07	9	7	2

The characters are all well defined and fit together nicely into this world, into which I just love to be drawn.  I like them all, from the more upright to the slightly darker and morally ambiguous.  There's also the fun battle between integrity and being practical that these smugglers, especially Nathan Fillion's ""strong man of few words"" character, struggle with.  They all have their issues, things to hide, and things they love or want, that make you want to keep watching them.  And their relationships with each other are very entertaining to watch.And everyone's so beautiful that this whole world is put on a different aesthetic level.  Within it the more plain or ugly people might still be supermodels in the real world.Supermodels, cowboys, science fiction.  It's a great combination.

Secondly, I was never a fan of Whedon's until I saw the Firefly short-lived series in its entirety.  My husband convinced me to go see Serenity when the movie came out.  I was reluctant, but went anyway, and fell in love with the characters and story immediately.  I must say that I'm glad I saw the movie first, as I wasn't as emotionally involved with the characters until after viewing the tv series (therefore, some losses did not hit me as hard!).  Went out to pick up the DVD set after seeing Serenity.  After viewing the complete first season, I am convinced that television executives are clueless when making cancellation decisions.  To cancel a show like this, and keep some of the other crap shows alive is beyond me.The series was smartly written, characters were multi-dimensional, no cheesiness, no corniness, none of the ""what were they thinking"" moments.  Plots were fun, lots of action crammed in, special effects were top notch in terms of television limitations, and perfect timing on injecting humorous moments and/or comments.  The actors were perfectly cast in their character roles, and you could tell they loved their roles, unlike other shows where the actors phone in their lines.  If you love westerns with an international flair, sci fi, great acting, great plots, comedy, and drama rolled into one, I highly recommend this dvd set.  But, keep in mind, when watching the dvds, it's like Lay's potato chips, you can't just watch one - you'll go through all four dvds in one day.Side note - if there is a drive to resurrect the series, sign me up!"	5.0	This is what entertainment should be about	2006-01-02	6	6	0

How did I miss this when it first aired and why would a TV network cancel such an original series?  Didn't the network know what they had?  Firefly should have received the opportunity to build an audience based on the quality of the material.  Firefly is the best written hour of TV I've seen in some time.  It ranks with Deadwood and I'm amazed at how Josh Whedon has brought a western to space, with all the fun, snappy dialouge, and wit that is missing in the recent plodding Star Wars efforts.  I'm in my forties and my girlfriend, who is no fan of science fiction, loves this show.  I see that the series and the recent film, Serenity, are #2 an #3 on Amazon's DVD Best Sellers list.  Hopefully, this will spur some network to resurect the series so more episodes can be made.  This really is a gem of a series and deserves a better fate.	5.0	How Did I Miss This?	2005-12-30	6	6	0

Joss Whedon is a master of plot, character and story. The actors relate to each other like a family, warts and all, which makes the viewer feel comfortable.

This series is more episodic when compared to other series such as Battlestar Galactica or 24, but there are several arcs that work well and it definitely follows a clear order. Of course, be sure to catch the follow up film ""Serenity"". This DVD set has already proven to be a must have for every DVD collection."	5.0	Outstanding series	2007-12-13	3	2	1

A better show than any Star Trek series (and I love Star Trek), the characters quickly moved from two dimensional ""character types"" to multi-dimensional characters with heights and depths that in most cases (Jayne excepted, perhaps  :) would not have been expected.Even more surprising, this show had broad appeal. Both my wife and I loved it, and outside of comedy, our tastes in TV and movies differ radically. She is simply not interested in most science fiction, yet we both enjoyed Firefly. It was a rare, quality TV show that we could both appreciate, even though episodes were aired out of order - the storyline continued from episode to episode even though the actual stories usually did not - and was preempted by sporting events several times during it's 12 episode run.Fox dumped the show that, could quite possibly have been the next Buffy, or perhaps even the next Star Trek."	5.0	The best TV show I've seen in 20 years.	2003-08-19	12	12	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3HMB7PEY567OD	Blackout Nights	In an age where the viewing public is assaulted by unscripted TV shows - from &quot;Survivor&quot; to &quot;The Bachelor&quot; - it's rare to see a show come along that aims for genuine entertainment that combines great acting and writing with a team of visual experts who are not afraid to explore techniques that offer the viewer a different perspective.Joss Whedon's &quot;Firefly&quot; is such a show.While the fans despise network executives for canceling the show, I applaud the folks at FOX (though they did make some poor decisions afterward) for taking a chance on it - and giving us this DVD set. It's really, really good stuff. If you haven't seen it and appreciate good fiction, you're in for a treat. And being such a great creation, it is far from dead. I'll leave it to you to find out what BDM means.Now for the negative, while I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I have friends who didn't and found it boring simply because of the lack of action. It's a legitimate complaint. If you don't enjoy characterization and want an unmemorable mind-numbing viewing experience along the lines of say, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; or &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; - or if you're looking for something more realistic such as &quot;ER&quot; or &quot;CSI&quot; - this isn't for you.However, if you're looking for something new and enjoy sci-fi and, in particularly, westerns, you likely will enjoy this feast.

Still, I bought Blu-Ray for simple convenience of having everything in one spot and in high-def.Short short desc of the show: Future. A band of mercenaries flies around in a ship that has a glowing b*tt (thus Firefly) and does stuff for money. Not always nice stuff, and that's your 1st clue that this series is different than usual good vs. bad kind of stuff we get on regular TV.Characters are beautifully created, with stories behind them that you can relate to (well, some of 'em). Story is always interesting and rarely you will look at the first few minutes and say ""I know how this is going to end."". Main character is balancing between goody-goody and ne'er-do-well personality.Somebody already did a great job by doing a review of the series, so I'll keep it short and sweet: if you like UNIQUE and HUMOROUS stuff, here's the best deal you're going to get anytime soon!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1UIFX5O8PTNZJ	Blair A. Petterson	"I despise television.  I even gave it up last year, and now only see a few shows a friend and I watch together.  ""The West Wing"".  ""24"".  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".Until last fall.  Then I saw ""Firefly"", named somewhat whimsically about a cargo ship whose end lights up when it accelerates.  But this is no flashy futuristic show about technical wonders, but rather a very nitty-gritty character study of nine very individual people.Joss Whedon, who created ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"", had an idea for a science fiction show unique to that ""Southern California born/spent time in Britain as a teenager"" background of his:  He read a book about the ground level grunts of the American Civil War called ""The Rebel Angels"" and wanted to do a TV series about the people who didn't make the history books: the people history stepped on.  He wanted to do a story set in a future about a ship and where it went.  Not a vast engine of war or a great vessel of exploration and diplomacy, but an old tramp steamer of a ship, so small it didn't even have a mounted gun, that made its way through thick and thin by taking any job, anywhere, no questions asked.The nine people on board the Firefly-class ship ""Serenity"" aren't rich, famous, particularly smart or particularly gifted, for the most part.  They all have pasts, and not all of them are comfortable about talking about themselves. They live in the aftermath of a major war that lead to the forceable unification of all of humanity, and not all of them were on the same side. The ship's name, ""Serenity"" is that of the climactic battle of that war, and they find themselves still trapped psychologically in a war that ended six years before. They have doubts, fears, old pains and new concerns, like where their next job is coming from and whether they'll live through it, because the few people that can hire them and will hire them have scant concern for ethics, the law or good manners.  Sometimes your employer is more dangerous to you than the law you're trying to avoid.And this is a show about the outskirts:  there are laser guns, hoverships and advanced technology, but few can afford them.  Big Dumb Bullets are still cheaper than Flashy Powered Blasters, and on the frontier reliability is more important than fashion, particularly when the other fellow has a habit of firing first.  A horse will do you better than a powersled if you have lots of grasslands but no repair facilities or money to pay.  A man dressed like a cowboy may have artificial organs and a revolver, or own a space station and need to pick up advanced medicines or even transfer a herd of cows.  ""Serenity"" flies between the Core worlds of advanced technology and the newly terraformed Rim worlds, where people are grateful to have a wooden roof overhead.It is this peculiar mix of the old and new that fascinates those looking for the unexpected: the comically serious and the deadly comical.  Any given episode will shift you from adventure to terror, farce to drama, slapstick to deep thought and a sense of ""boy, I didn't see THAT coming"" without a sense that no-one is at the wheel, or that the screenwriter is merely playing with your expectations.  More importantly, there are no ""cheats"": every action more deeply reveals the characters and who they are becoming.  Unlike the broadcasts, this DVD shows the episodes, including three new ones, in their intended order.""Firefly"" is seldom what it first appears to be, either in terms of appearance or behaviour.  No plot works out as expected, and people can surprise you.  Joss Whedon indicated that ""Buffy"" was about growing up, ""Angel"" is about getting to work and ""Firefly"" is about being grown up and the choices you have to make as an adult.  It's not like any other show you've seen:  a story of the nine people who find themselves on board a ship, looking into the black of space, and seeing nine different things looking back at them.Even if you've seen all the first season episodes broadcast on FOX and are waiting for the forthcoming 2005 Universal motion picture, this DVD has all episodes to date, including the three not previously broadcast in the U.S., and such extras as cast and creator commentaries, a blooper reel to equal any other show in history and a few other easter eggs here and there.Like such great television shows as ""Hill Street Blues"", ""Babylon 5"", ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" or ""The Supranos"", this will introduce you to people and places that will enrich you and your concept of the world.  I still hate television.  I'm buying this DVD."	5.0	9 faces looking into the black, seeing 9 different things	2003-07-23	1171	1126	45
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A11YV6VC51HJTV	"Blake Petit ""Novelist, columnist & reviewer"""	"I'd heard for three years how great a show ""Firefly"" was, but I'd never seen an episode until this week, when I borrowed the DVD set from some friends of mine. It was... phenomenal. And like too many shows on Fox, cancelled far too soon.The show follows the crew of the Serenity, a group of ""transporters"" with no scruples about taking a less-than-level cargo if the pay is right and with a bone to pick with the Alliance, the official government. There's a brother and sister on board, both fugitives (she from a top-secret government academy that performed mysterious experiments on her, he for rescuing her), a ""Shepherd"" (preacher) with some mysterious ties of his own, an official ""Companion"" (do the euphemism yourself), a spunky mechanic, a tough-as-nails second-in-command married to the wisecracking pilot, a dirty-fingernailed grunt and, of course, a captain with a past to live down. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, real personalities and real histories. They're what make the show work.Here, I think, is what hurt it - it couldn't be classified. A lot of people who saw it didn't know what they were really watching - not a far-flung space opera, but a western in the sky. These characters aren't noble Starfleet Officers, they're gunslingers with a definite sense of right and wrong and no qualms about striking out against the ""wrong"" as they see it. They carry firearms, wear dirty, dusty clothes and even ride horses when they're planetside. There's more than one episode where you could watch the first five minutes and think it's a show set in the Nevada territories in the 1880s until they finish up whatever job they're on and go back to their spaceship. In short, it was a great show, but one that people couldn't pigeonhole, and while the die-hard fans love that sort of thing, the public at large, sadly, doesn't.The DVD set includes a few nice extras, including a half-hour-long ""Making of"" documentary, a few other featurettes, a gag reel and an audition tape. A decent package, considering what they had to work with... but not enough. I'll be there opening weekend for ""Serenity,"" and I can't help but hope that somehow this show makes it back on the air."	5.0	Cancelled too soon...	2005-08-17	11	10	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJOD95832SWWS	Blossom Burkitt	Some would surely disagree with me as to the above assertion, but I am dumbfounded as to how I missed this when it was on the air. This is a surprisingly good show, to which I was introduced only when the DVDs came out. I tried this show because of Joss Whedon, as I was such a big fan of Buffy, and Nathan Fillion, whom I enjoyed as Caleb in Buffy season 7. I don't know how Joss does it, but his shows have a way of sticking with you, his characters linger in my head long after they have disappeared from the screen. Firefly is a perfect example, a show built around nine space travelers each of whom are dynamic, fleshed out characters including the captain, a registered companion (legal form of prostitute) who rents a shuttle, a brother and sister who are fleeing the Alliance, a chaplain, and a man who is a veritable mercenary and tempted by the financial possibilities of betraying the crew. Additionally, Joss has a way of creating an amazing backdrop for his stories. In Firefly, there was the war for unification between the Alliance and the Independents (a.k.a. Browncoats) which leaves a world with central Alliance-loyal planets and outer reaches where the law does not extend, home to all manner of people, including the flesh-eating Reavers who might not be called people at all. Add to these things some great sets and special effects and a memorable bluegrass theme penned by Joss himself, and you have a wonderful show. It's a shame it only lasted one season.	5.0	I don't watch enough television...	2004-01-23	14	14	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NCKHPHA0HQG5	blue	"So.  Firefly?  Not your typical sci-fi.  Not even close.This show may have been promoted as a ""space western"", but that has little to do with why I love it.  Forget any preconceptions you might have about its premise -- what's important is that this show is a storehouse of wit, drama, great dialogue, and gorgeous cinematography.  Best of all is its ensemble, which is possibly my favorite out of all the shows that I have ever watched.  Here, Whedon has developed nine compelling characters whose relationships and intentions are never black-and-white.  I cannot say enough about them, especially the siblings -- fiercely protective Simon and his damaged sister River.  Their ship Serenity is all about the unexpected -- it's a place where the mechanic is a cheerful prairie girl and the onboard Companion (aka prostitute) has the most class of the entire crew.  Together, their heists and exploits make for an expert mix of comedy, action, and mystery.  Additionally, the show leaves room for romantic pairings: the ups and downs of Zoe and Wash, tension between Mal and Inara, and the burgeoning relationship between Simon and Kaylee.The season gets off to a modest start, and the first few episodes might strike viewers as nothing special.  In fact, I think the weakest episode of this set is Bushwhacked, simply because the plot is not compelling enough to fill an hour and ends up dragging.  It says a great deal about the quality of this show, however, that I have nothing but praise for the rest.  Just keep watching -- it's the later episodes following Shindig that truly distinguish Firefly as brilliantly written and plotted.  My favorites include Out of Gas, which contains flashbacks to how Mal chose his crew, and Objects In Space, a dreamlike episode that centers around River.  And even after the series is over, the special features are just as entertaining.  It's immediately evident how much the cast and crew enjoyed working on and discussing this show, which makes the features and commentary more than just a few perfunctory exercises.My only major criticism of this series is that the Chinese pronunciation (a result of the futuristic premise) is atrocious, which can be very distracting.  And while nothing integral is said in Chinese, it can be aggravating for both non-speakers and speakers to miss some dialogue.  I'm a native speaker, and even I wish this set had been accompanied by a translation guide.  Even so, that's a small price to pay for 14 hours of solid television.If you're still hesitant, borrow the DVD's from a friend, rent discs from Netflix, etc.  Leave your preconceptions at the door, and there's a good chance you'll end up buying this set.  (That or singing rounds of ""The Hero of Canton"" all day.)  I know that Firefly might not be the show for everyone, but it certainly deserves that chance.  And with Serenity's upcoming release and the reairing marathon on Sci Fi, there has never been a better time to give it a try."	5.0	An absolutely fantastic series.	2005-07-19	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3SVXOC1N4O73C	BlueRevolution	"Do you or have you enjoyed at any time in the past science fiction, westerns, comedies, or any other genre of movie or TV show? Do you own a DVD player or computer with a DVD drive or have the means to purchase one of the above in the near future? If you answered yes to either of the above, then Firefly's the show for you.Even though it never made it past 14 episodes, the scale of emotions dealt with by these 14 episodes is immense: laughter, despair, terror, relief, acceptance. There has never been and may never be another show like it. I've watched no episode less than about half a dozen times, and each time I appreciate more and more the mastery of the screen that is contained within.Small touches make this a much more believable and less sanitized universe than that of Star Trek. Coloquialisms change with time, this is the only show set in the future that I've ever seen where the English language has actually changed since the present day - words that would be commonly used by those living and working among the stars are shortened. Universe becomes 'verse, atmosphere becomes atmo, that sort of thing. They also always refer to the Earth as ""Earth that was"" - there is not explanation as to exactly what happened to the Earth, but it is certainly no clich&eacute; alien attack - there is no such thing in this universe, making it a refreshing change from the constant theme of strained diplomacy with people with bumpy foreheads.If you're hooked on the idea and are disappointed by its cancellation, take heart that there's a movie coming out April 22, 2005, called Serenity, that tells the story as it was going to be told before being interrupted. You can check it out over at [...]In all, Firefly is a breath of fresh air in an industry where the top brass considers the route to success is to say to their writers, ""we need a script like the one we released last year, but this time instead of aliens they'll be fighting a rogue human faction"" or something along those lines.

(Firefly was always conceived as a 16:9 show, but Fox, as a policy, does not broadcast any letterboxed shows. That being said, their HDTV broadcasts do go out widescreen.)As for any differences in what you've already seen, we might have rendered some of the title work in 1.85:1 (anamorphic) but I really can't remember.The bottom line is: What you are getting on DVD is what Joss intended: 16:9. No fake letterbox bars on a 4:3 show, no ""panned and scanned"" anything, just Serenity and her crew in glorious widescreen!Hope that clarifies things.Best,Buchanan-----------------------------------------------------------------As for my review, this show had the potential as being the best show ever produced for television.  I am an enormous Buffy fan and own many things Buffy but this show grabbed me from the beginning and the storyline just got better and better.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	"Let's be quick, because this review will sink into the crowd in a few days.In spite of a small budget and rudimentary effects and broken laws of physics, this may be one of the very best interpretations of the ""Space Opera"" genre. It had at least four mysteries in its back story. And in these scant 14 episodes none of them were resolved, however in the film, ""Serenity"", two are resolved. There is also the arc of the romance between two characters. And with nine characters on the ""Serenity"", four of which have mysterious backgrounds, that's more than enough to keep things interesting. But that's water over the dam.If there is anything which defines the difference between ""Firefly"" and ""Star Wars"", its the way Nathan Fillion interprets the character of the captain of the ""Serenity"". Fillion is much, much more realistic than Han Solo as both an outlaw and a captain of a ship with some noisome crew members and ""passengers"". Most fun comes form Adam Baldwin, who is playing his signature ""Animal Mother"" character from ""Full Metal Jacket"".One very important law of physics which is obeyed is the time required to travel great distances. Unlike the universe in Star Wars, the venue for Firefly is just one planetary system. One or maybe two suns around which several planets and their moons circle which are capable of being terraformed, and have been made earthlike several generations before. Therefore, there are no interstellar jumps, and it is harder for the transporter / smuggler / bandit crew of the Serenity to hide from the authorities of the government of the inner planets. That mean it is not at all implausible that the outer planets have a wild west feel to them, not unlike Tatooine. It is probably easier to transport a colt to a world with no gas, but lots of prairie, and use horse power.One wonderful backstory unexplored is why so many actors break out in Chinese speeches. It's a lot like better Sci-Fi back stories like ""Clockwork Orange"" with its Russian slang and ""Blade Runner"" with its ""city speak"" (sic). Only in the audio comments do we hear that its based on the idea that before emigrating to this new system, earth was controlled by two cultures, American and Chinese. So all business is conducted in English or Chinese, or a bit of both.One thing which adds a strong sense of reality to the filming is that the entire interior of ""Serenity"" was built as one complete set, with loads of realistic looking ""used future"" fixtures. They can film long steadycam scenes from one end of the ship to another without a break.Here's hoping someone gets the wherewithal to do for ""Firefly"" what they did for ""Star Trek""."	5.0	Subtlties abound.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A13M4580KA6B9Q	B. McCoy	While the series is very interesting (based on episodes I've caught in re-runs), the DVDs in this set are defective.  Disks do not play on multiple players or in computers.  This has been noted in other recent reviews.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVU290CKC8SU7	BME	Like Joss Whedon's other projects, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Firefly relies on FANTASTIC characterization to make the show.  There are no cliches here.  No cardboard characters or boring dialog.  Joss Whedon is a genius when it comes to dialog and characterization, and Firefly is no exception.My only complaint about the show is that it was cancelled--quite undeservedly.And my only complaint about the DVD set is that in a couple of places the dialog doesn't match the characters' mouth movements when the sound track is off, but really, that's pretty minor.  I'm still giving it a solid 5 stars.	5.0	Characters make the show!	2004-09-24	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FRQSAPALGP1L	"B. M. Moloney ""neomo123"""	Honestly, this is why I don't watch TV anymore! Fox has lost yet another viewer. I can't stand when big wig corporate types finally get something right and they pull the plug on a show before it finally takes off. They'd rather show mind numbing reality shows, then stick it out with a possible classic. Being in the military I rarely have time to watch tv anyway. The best thing to come out of Fox was Firefly and Stargate SG-1 reruns. Just put the corporate guys from Fox in a small room with some Reavers and let the guys from Sci-Fi figure the mess out. Anyways, This is probably one of the best shows to ever be cancelled prematurely. This box set is highly recommended to anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor.

One of the best endorsements I can give Firefly is that it was cancelled by FOX before it had a chance, the same network that cancelled Futurama, Dark Angel, John Q and Harsh Realm after screwing with their time slots and failing to promote them. Firefly is in fine company here.There are no weak links among the characters--simply a marvelous ensemble with witty writing, great humor, adult themes and engrossing stories.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2JIURZ68STBYM	B. M. Petre	Firefly is an original, extremely fun, cliche-less combination of  western and space-faring. Is that possible? Yes, because the stories are very well written, with attention to detail and packed with good humor and plot twists, the actors are awesome and the general look (ship design, costumes, weapons, special effects, etc) is quite believable.The pilot episode starts rather suddenly, without much explaining of the main characters, but as the show goes on one gradually finds out more about Serenity's crew. After the first DVD I was a complete Firefly addict. However, after watching it all, I feel many promises were unfulfilled [chinese muttering].I can't believe anyone in his right mind would cancel such a wonderful series just when things started to get more interesting. The upcoming Serenity movie is good news though, and I'll be sure to bring all my friends to see it.	5.0	"""shiny"" grown-up scifi"	2005-08-11	4	4	0

For those uninitiated, this was one of the best hidden gems as far as shows go.  Damn shame Fox was so short sighted.  Ironically, they back the idea of Space Cowboys (see Universal's Cowboys and aliens)in a mainstream movie now.  Wheadon's version is substantially better, on the small screen or the large.  Enjoy the show, it has a potential to be another Star Trek if Fox would just get the legal stuff squared out.PS - for the reviewer re: Summer Glau's character, see the movie.  It would have been great to expand it, but the series didn't run long enough.  For those watching - another interesting story/plot arc not investigated is the background of the Sheppard Book character.	5.0	Easy to stream and biggest damn hero show ever!	2011-12-25	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GBX18JX5UOFA	Bojac6	"Many people review this show coming from the ""I'm a Joss Whedon Fan"" standpoint, so I thought it was time for a different point of view.  I never watched Buffy or Angel.  I was not against them, I just never felt that I should make time to watch it. So when a friend of mine who has never failed in introducing me to great stuff recommended Firefly, I borrowed his DVDs and that was the first time I can remember seeing the name Joss Whedon.  About 5 minutes after the opening credits on Serenity, I was hooked.  The initial battle scene is good and has some dark humor, but it was a moment right after that where I realized this was going to be a great show.  In the very beginning they break into an abandoned spacecraft.  The way they do it is with some sort of gel that, when they shine a laser on it, melts through the hatch.  What got me was that it was completely silent.  No explosions, as there is no oxygen to burn in space, no sound, as there is no air to carry sound.  That made the series for me.  It is apparent that a lot of time and effort had gone into making this show look and feel real.  CGI shots are unsteady not because of bad effects but because its supposed to look like it was shot with a handheld camera.  A new world was created by this show, and unlike many sci fi shows, this one is very believable because it all makes sense and the focus is on the people, not the sci fi. There is never a problem that consists of ""Tachyons"" that is fixed by a ""Beta radiation pulse."" (I liked Star Trek, but lets face it, how do you relate to a subatomic particle?)  This is a show that takes place in the future, its not about the future, and that is what makes it so good."	5.0	Excellent Series	2004-08-17	8	8	0

The good thing about that is it means you can watch the (far too few) episodes more than once, and still find new things to laugh about.One caveat: the pilot episode doesn't ease you into the large cast or the background of their situation. You are plunged into a fast-moving story, and a complex cast who mumble quick dialogue (interspersed with technical details about spaceship engines, plus some comments in other languages). I was so confused through most of the pilot that I hesitated about continuing to episode 2. But I am glad I did. Once I figured out who everyone was, and what the world they live in was all about, I was hooked.The show is clean enough that teens or pre-teens could watch it, but it would go way over their heads.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A28FM25VI6WEHE	Booklearnin'	After reading such glowing reviews I was really eager to sink my teeth onto this show. And after the first couple episoides I was hooked. But then.... the storylines just didn't live up to the early promise. Subplots were weak on non existant. Capt. Reynolds seemed to inexplicably punch someone in the face every 15 minutes. And throughout the remainder of the box set I kept praying the Reavers would show up - they seemed one of the most exciting story elements and yet they never got used after the first two episodes. No doubt they would have had the series continued, and maybe they'll be in the movie.I am definitely a fan of good television, and I certainly think Deadwood, Six Feet and Arrested Development deserve their frequent 5 star ratings. Firefly had the potential, but the series as a whole didn't live up to the promise. At last for me.	3.0	Honestly, a bit of a letdown	2005-08-16	40	12	28

My husband has no use for series television. Unless it's on the History Channel, Discovery or Science Channel he's not interested. So when I pressed him to please watch Firefly with me, he reluctantly agreed.NOW, he's as big a fan as I am! He walks around the house spewing lines from the shows (Gorramit) and pretending to speak Chinese! :-) My college student daughter does the same! I have converted them all!!

However, this is the only sci-fi TV series that she would not only watch with me, but she loved the show!  We both wish they wouldn't have cancelled it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2AA00U9FO4UAC	Bradley J. Keusch	"absolutely, undeniably, one of the greatest shows that has ever aired on network television, and my personal favorite dramatic television show ever. It's perhaps a bit daunting to both camps, those who like sci-fi, and those who don't, because although it looks sci-fi (flying space ships, and what not), that's really not what it is, at it's heart. All of Josh Whedon's shows have been about creating and finding family, and focused strongly on character development, and this series has both in spades. Whedon writes dialog with such effortless flair, and he is a master of never letting the viewer get bored...or comfortable. The good always has a little bad mixed up in it, and the really bad moments always seem to be hilighted with a bit of black humor (one of the absolute funniest moments in the series occurs early in I believe the pilot when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead, and she's not...watch and see). This is much how life IS though, it's never simple, and if you are bothered by such things then go back to watching your ABC sitcoms. The ""western"" elements that are often advertised come in in the form of the rim planets, where conditions are poor, and many people live in poverty. Hardly a episode passes where you don't see someone riding a horse. But it all fits, and feels very natural. Regardless of how advanced technology and society gets, there will always be those on the outside of it.The characters themselves are magnificently crafted, none more so than Mal, the reluctant protagonist. He fought against the Alliance (think Star Wars' Empire, but with far less sinister overtones) and lost, and is now something of an outlaw, and takes pirating jobs with his crew to scrape out an existence. What Serenity (the name of his ship) is to him, is a sense of freedom, and a family. The absolute greatest moments in the series come when this is felt strongly. When the crew is sitting around the table eating dinner together, when they are on a backwater planet singing and dancing and drinking with the locals (and Mal ends up getting married...); the show is without peer in its ability to create a sense of camaraderie, and truly, of family. In instilling the belief in you that no matter how big the galaxy may be, as long as you have someone next to you,  its always managable.The show is intriguing, poignant, hilarious (if you don't laugh during Jaynestown, you might in fact be a robot), and absolutely a MUST see. Watch the pilot immediately, and welcome to the ranks of the browncoats.VERY highly recommended"	5.0	phenomenal	2007-03-14	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NH75WG35GR0P	Brad Torok	To start, I haven't finished the season.  However, so far, while the characters are likeable enough, it isn't the gripping sci fi western I was expecting.  It's more of a modern twist on the original Star Trek idea of a western dressed up in sci fi clothes.  The characters are narrow and predictable, but fun to watch, the acting is variable, and the stories aren't particularly inspired.  Nonetheless I enjoy watching it, I love sci fi, and will see the rest of the season out to see if it improves, as the show has so many fans!	3.0	likeable characters	2014-02-12	1	0	1

It is a shame that it didn't make it past the first season, but this set is a fine tribute to the show.  Nathan Fillian, Summer Glau, and Adam Baldwin played unforgettable characters that help to make this such a great show.  In addition, the movie Serenity is based on this show.  It is hard to believe that its been off he air for 10 years but it still holds up as one of the finest scifi shows ever created.	5.0	Shiney! Lets be bad guys	2013-11-12	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3D6TX8ZHHXM6I	BrandonArt	I have nothing to say that's not already been said, but I feel the need to shout my love for this series on the internet! I first picked this series up at the local library when I was in high school. I needed something to watch, and I had just finished Babylon 5. I was hooked on this series from the very first episode and quickly devoured all of them. I was so disappointed to learn that the series was no longer on the air. Firefly had the perfect blend of action, suspense, and perfectly-timed comedy. It's just a shame that most of my favorite series are short-lived sci-fi shows like Firefly, BSG, Dollhouse, SGU, etc.This world does not like forward-thinking or morally-ambiguous shows, which is why I think most of them don't last very long. At least we managed to coax a movie out of them!	5.0	Love. &lt;3	2013-01-21	0	0	0

They obviously missed the point, and felt that attacking the fans and actors of this series was a way to avoid anyone noticing that.  They apparently approached this show expecting something and upon not receiving it, lashed out in anger.I'm as harsh a critic as they come, and while this short lived series isn't perfection, it needn't be.  I, like many of you here now, was lured into watching Firefly after seeing the movie trailer.  After watching the first half of the pilot on The Sci-fi channel I needed more, and quickly accuired the DVD set.  I think I made a mistake by watching the entire 14 episodes in 2 days, as my Firefly experience was sweet yet too short.  I cannot wait to see if many of the questions we all have from the show are answered in the movie.As far as those 3 I mentioned before, they're just soulless reavers who can no longer appreciate something fresh and original.	5.0	We're professionals...	2005-07-27	6	6	0

Another fun thing, is in Nathan Fillion's series Castle, there are many references to &#34;Firefly&#34; - things they have done, said, certain sayings, even his Capt.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3AVOJHYTMIS2X	"Brattain ""Jester"""	Many SF shows started out slow and found themselves in later seasons, B5 and the terribly underrated DS9 being prime examples (I think even Joss appreciates DS9 as being the superior Trek given previous comments).Well, I should have known better from Joss. I loved it right away, even though Fox aired the episodes out of order. I remember hoping that somehow at least these episodes would be released on DVD. Never did I imagine so many others would feel the same way and make this such a big seller. I've bought several sets for friends and family, all of whom now love the show (or are just pandering to me so I'll leave them alone, but still).I'm thrilled the movie is getting made. I'm the GM of a small theater in Florida and I plan to do whatever I can to promote the hell out of Serenity. I'd love to throw a mini-convention in the lobby and dedicate the entire theater to the movie when it opens. Maybe I could host the (central-Florida) premiere of Serenity. Okay, I'm getting a little ahead of myself here. Still, the thought of having an Alan Tudyk or Gina, or Jewel, or Adam, or even Joss or Nathan visit my little hole in the wall is like thinking about winning the lottery. Fun to dream a little.Either way, we all just have to make sure Serenity does damn well at the box office so we can have the show back.Of course there are other issues in this country that need addressing, but appreciating art is part of what makes life worth living.  Firefly is one of those works of art.	5.0	I've won over 6 people, with more to come.	2004-07-27	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1TR0WPC93BEC8	"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn"""	Boy, Fox sure has a bad history of cancelling good shows. First Dark Angel got the axe after a second successful season, and now Firefly, the heir apparent to Buffy, never got a chance to stretch its wings.Oh well, at least Whedon's making a movie, and until then, the DVD will more than tide over rabid fans. This thing is packed, even going so far as to include the 3 episodes that never made it to the air. And this series just feels at home on DVD, as it was aired in widescreen format. It also features the best visual effects that have ever graced a television show, and an ensemble cast that, in a few episodes, accomplish what some casts never do in 100 (Friends anyone?).The intriguing story of a ragtag group of outlaws in space makes for a compelling backdrop, and all the episodes play off of the characters, not just their struggles against the Space Mafia and the tyrannical Alliance, though these conflicts are certainly well done. Each character grows somehow over the course of the all-to-short series, and in addition to the story, there are some great action pieces as well.The extras on the set are great. There are a number of episode commentaries, a behind-the-scenes look with interviews with the cast, as well as interviews with crreator Joss Whedon. Topping off the bonuses are original script drafts and some picture galleries. All solid stuff for collectors and casual fans alike.All in all, if you missed the show, pick this up, as it's a fun ride and will introduce you to the characters before they fly to the big screen next year. If you've seen the show. . . well, I don't need to tell you that this set is well worth the money.	5.0	The Definitive Space Western that wasn't	2003-10-28	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2S0DU8QTQSKWK	Brendon Spencer	How many 5-star reviews have I given?  Bloody few.I'd never heard of this show then one day I got a package from Amazon that a girlfriend had sent with the FIREFLY series inside. She loved it and was just sure I would, too.You know what? She was right. I had to fight to limit myself to one show a night, it was that good from show #1. I found myself amazed beyond understanding over a number of points: Like, why hadn't I heard of this show before? How can a TV SHOW be so damned good? Why on earth did Fox cancel it? Will they really do the movie or is this just wistful thinking on the part of the fans? I have no answers for you here.It begins with a song and a guitar, almost western sound, and very, very good. The voice, the song, both are perfect for the show. You see the ship and the sets and you have to be amazed at the quality. There is no down side here, unless you count the untimely demise of a great show. The American history reminders  are unmistakable. It's at the end of a terrible civil war, the Captain and his first mate, Zoe, were on the losing side. Now the whole 'verse is trying to rebuild and do the best they can. There is an old west feel with a new frontier. The bad guys are scary and the good guys have heart. There are no aliens.The actors are exceptional. I fell in love with the Zoe/Wash relationship. I liked Captain Mal Reynolds. All three characters are beautifully played. One of my favorite shows is the one where 'how' everyone came aboard. Jayne Cobb, the mercenary, was particularly good.Two things are certain here: 1)FIREFLY is worth every star I put up there and more. 2)When there is a movie made, I will see it on the big screen, then I WILL own it asap.	5.0	Worth a lot more than five stars	2005-02-07	9	8	1

In a continuing series about a tramp freighter in space, we got humor and adventure in one package.Nathan Fillion has proved in both Firefly and Castle that he can carry a series, and the rest of the crew made an interesting mix of characters played by fine actors who have solid performances elsewhere.It's great to have a Blu ray set to show off this series at its best on your TV, and the price is right for a complete season on Blu ray.Highly recommended.	5.0	Short but fun series	2014-01-08	1	1	0

When I learned about the movie Serenity coming out, I decided that I needed check it out so that I would know what was going on when the movie hit the theaters.Therefore, I rented the four disc set of the Firefly show from Netflix.  All I can say is, WOW, what a great show.  After I had watched all the episodes, I told my sister and my Dad about it.  My sister and I watched a couple episodes together and she loved it. She then proceeded to watch the rest of the series over the next three days.  It is so good, it's addictive.I went with my sister on opening night of Serenity and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I now find myself appreciating both Firefly and Serenity to the point that I decided to purchased two DVD sets of the Firefly series, one for myself, and one for my sister for her upcoming birthday (hope she doesn't read this).

However, after finding this DVD through save firefly websites, I had to give it a chance. If my review somehow makes you pick up this DVD set and see what an amazing show it was... maybe we can see this show in the future together. I originally didn't watch the show due to the bad advertsising, and the scheduling left much to be desired. I was shown this show when I moved down to FL by a friend of mine, almost immeadiately I was drawn to these characters. This is not simply a ""western in space"", it's a beautiful dichotomy of science fiction and drama. I thought I never would have said this in my life, but if this show had been brought out I think it would have become my favorite TV show of all time. I say this as a great testament to what this show offered in it's very short run. Give this show a chance, and you will see that it will grow within you and suddenly when the show is done you'll be left with a hole... and nothing will be able to stop the aching you'll have for the continuation of the story. Okay so that's maybe a little overdramatic, but it's a great show, you'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll be at the edge of your seat.

With very few exceptions (Bradbury, Butler, Verne), most scifi/fantasy strikes me as having been crafted by thumbless monkeys.  Too one-dimensional and no artistry at all, not in the sense of Nabokov, Toni Morrison or Faulkner.  'Star Trek' I enjoy purely as camp. But this is different.  ""Jaynestown"" made me laugh so hard (thank you mr. edlund, you demi-goddish type fella. Spoon!)and in ""Objects in Space"" River's speech, her selfless concern amidst her own confusion and pain, broke my heart, if only for a moment.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PN4A2FBK4HK3	Brian	I was tired of hearing all the nerdy friends I knew talk about how a great of a show this was.  Even worse, I hate tropes and cliches.  Having this show described as a combination of a western and sci-fi in space made me want to gag.  So I sat down and watched the first episode of the show.  Then I proceeded to watch every single episode and the movie in a span of 3 DAYS!!  The acting is fantastic, the would-be cliche moments are spun to a different effect, the mood of each episode was self-encapsulated yet also fit a grander continuous stream for the series as a whole.  I truly do understand why so many were upset at this show being cancelled.  I wish Joss Whedon had the means to continue to produce this brand and  simply release it off-network as I believe intelligent television viewers have lost something special.	5.0	Must watch	2011-12-18	0	0	0

If Star Trek's &quot;Enterprise&quot; (pick any version) can be compared to a CD stereo, then &quot;Serenity&quot; could be compared to an 8-track tape player. But that lovable bucket-of-bolts ship is their lifeline of daily survival in space and on the western-themed planets on which they do business. There's a price on their heads, so they have to operate slightly outside of the law, but they always manage to eke out a livin' somehow while remaining free.There's lots of subtle and outright humor throughout almost every episode (and weirdness like characters speaking Mandarin Chinese at odd times), but that's THE main thing that ties it all together so well. The characters never take themselves too seriously and, when they ain't a squabblin', usually cover each other's backs (but not always). The western flavor comes and goes, so it sometimes plays as more of a straight-forward sci-fi series than a cowboy comedy, but the perils they get into generally tend towards funny and less towards tragic. There are a couple of episodes, however, that are darkly serious.Try not to get too attached to this 14-episode space soap opera because it's over before you know it. It wasn't supposed to be cancelled so soon, so the storylines were never totally resolved, but it was good fun while it lasted. You might find yourself shedding a tear during the last playing of that haunting theme song. Sob.	4.0	They're a lonely group of space cowboys...	2003-12-16	2	2	0

This show is on of Josh Wheedon's earlier endeavors and showed early on what everyone would later discover as his genius.  The show's ensemble cast is subperb being lead by Nathan Fillion who would go on to Castle fame.  The writing is superior and the overarching storyline is fantastic.  People sometimes refer to Star Trek as a space western with the Enterprise being akin to the early American west's trappers and explorers, however, if you are looking for a true space western in every sense of the words and not just metaphorically, Firefly is the show for you.  Also, don't miss out of the movie Serenity which was the capstone to end the show after it was prematurely cancelled.	5.0	FANTASTIC SHOW, GREAT CAST, SUPERIOR WRITING	2014-06-30	0	0	0

Having not been a fan of Buffy or any of Whedon's other works, I actually came into Firefly expecting very little.  By the time I was done with the first episode I was very optimistic.  When the series was through I was floored.  I pray as many others do that this series has a future on Sci-Fi, though the prospects are bleak.A word on special features: I am not much on special features, I will rarely watch them even on DVDs of my most favorite of movies.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2MDHSEWPOYLDV	"Brian Kevin Hudson ""hurricaneh"""	It's a pity that today's TV viewing habits leave little room for expansion or inginuity.  If it's not reality TV, trash TV, or comedy, then it's not good TV.  Who says?  Firefly proves all those notions wrong, while still being able to throw mixtures of all those elements in.Want reality? The crew lives with each other 24/7, through all kinds of trials and tribulations.Want comedy?  Anyone that doesn't giggle at some of the one-liners, smirky comments, and wity backhands needs to check their funnybone.Want trash?  How about one of the crew being an intergalactic call-girl?Other elements are a given.  Drama, sci-fi, and action are plentiful, and the special effects and graphics are just superb!I never saw the series on TV, so though I have to wag a shameful finger at myself for not supporting this show at launch, after seeing this DVD, I'm a firm supporter.  Not since Buck Rogers have I loved a sci-fi series so much.  Please oh holier than thou network suit people....please grab this series.  Sci-fi?  Spike?  Someone?  Though I'm elated that a possible movie is in the works, I still feel the show has too much depth to wrap up in a 2 hour movie.  But I digress, as any continuation of Firefly is a blessing.  Mr. Josh Whedon, with Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, you've single handedly re-invented my interest in television!	5.0	Great scope!	2004-09-20	5	4	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A10XMAVE1363WV	Brian Layman	"I bought 5 copies of this box set for friends and family for Christmas, already having my own.  Now at six days into the new year, I've gotten NOTHING but ""Thank you""s from people, as they finish it.  Actually, I'm sorry that's not true.  My friend from DC has called me twice to say ""Curses on you for recommending such a good show that was cancelled after one season.""  The first call was after he and his wife watched all of the episodes. The second call as he and his wife were in the midst of the second viewing.  He particularly mentioned the quality of the music, the unique camera shots and I pointed out how even in the very first episode, you could see little things, like the signs on the billboards and other details that Whedon has worked into the show to give it longevity.As you can tell from my friend's testimonial, if you buy this DVD set, you can expect to get your money's worth.  You will be begging for more at the end of it.  It is very worth watching a second time.  I've watched most episodes three times and I am on my forth time through now listening to the audio commentaries.Comparing this series to other prominent sci fi shows reveals Lexx too far on the fringe, Farscape as never fully grasping its potential, Star Trek TNG first season as toooo fresh, Stargate SG1 as too predictably linear (although this compare better than most), and Red Dwarf as too... British ;).  This show is shot with cinematic quality and tried to force too much innovation on the network too quickly (Wide screen?  Why would Fox broadcast in wide screen - no one wants that!).  It paid the price for innovation, but at $25 from Amazon, you don't have to.While I do not watch this show with my young children in the room, it is a show that works equally well for both genders.  If you want to spend quality time with a friend, spouse, or older family, watching Firefly will be an almost guaranteed success.  The moral aspects of the show are seeds for good discussions on morality, marraige, religion, faith, trust, strength and reliablity.  Any geek will be hooked by the first space scene where Whedon was bold enough to film with no sound in space (ships don't go ""whooosh"" as they fly by).  Some will be facinated by the merging of the American and Chinese cultures and language, while other will be facinated by the morality play of a ""Shepard""'s relation ship with the female ""Companion"" who gains the ship access to many ports of call.  Firefly has so many levels that it appeals almost all personalities.Perhaps the Fox executives made a slight mistake as they decided to air the two hour series pilot LAST after canceling the series...  There is no reason this show should be off the air."	5.0	THE Christmas gift for 2006	2007-01-07	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3SJ2VSCHZB18	Brian Markowski	After watching a show like Firefly, it's harder to watch a show like the current Star Trek franchise. It's harder because the flaws are so much more notiable. Visually Star Trek is great but the writing is as dated as an ego driven Shatner monologue.Firefly is great not because of it's niffty effects, or it cool western/sci-fi genre, it's great because the writing's great. The characters are familiar, yet fresh. The plots are simple, yet intriguing. We feel for this crew of outcasts as they take their beat up cargo ship from one port to another. They're small time criminals just trying to get a little more than what they have.The DVD does a few things that the FOX TV airings did not. It shows the episodes in order, which is amazingly important to this series which incorporates a broader story arc over it's brief run of 14 shows. It also includes several unaired epidoes which are wonderful fun, but don't give us all the answears to the questions fans crave of the series. The good news is that a movie of Firefly is scheduled for theatrical release sometime in 2005. Luckly for us this DVD series is here now for us to enjoy and savor until the movie hits the big screen.	5.0	A Breath of Fresh Air	2004-12-17	13	12	1

I forgot completely about it until about a year ago I saw the DVDs on Amazon and bought them part on a whim and part from the great reviews it has.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3LQ3LHKBP45ZM	"Brianna Shultz ""design junky"""	Reading the other reviews and then seeing the number of episodes, one tends to feel a sense of disbelief. How could a half season of any show top all other TV?The key, I believe, is density. In the half-season, Whedon crafts a world more rich and well-thought-out than series' others take 4 or 5 seasons to create. As a prior sci-fi fan I was stunned to find that after 14 episodes, I know Captain Mal Reynolds (and 8 other characters!) far, far better than I ever knew, for example, Captain Picard after hundreds of episodes. TV tends to be slow, repetitive and empty. We go to the theater and get the same amount of story in 2 hours that we usually get in a season of TV.I never caught this show on TV. I never heard of it when it was on TV. A friend talked me into buying it after it was released on DVD and my husband and I have seen it 4 or 5 times through now. It's amazingly rewatchable. The density accounts for that, too. We find ourselves laughing at jokes we missed the first few times through (because we were laughing at others), and seeing details we never bothered to look for before. (The world is so real that you see brand names and similar references to THEIR pop-culture, and references to things that appear in LATER episodes!)Watch it. You'll love it. Only one caveat: the first half of the first episode is *relatively* slow. Don't give up in that first hour and dismiss it as just more TV. It's worth it.	5.0	The best TV series ever.	2005-05-10	10	10	0

I love Star Trek and Star Wars (been a Trekie since I was a pup)but this show offers something completely different. It almost makes you feel like you are watching home movies. The stories and acting make you feel as if you are watching a family going through their business. I am told we owe that to Joss Whedon who took his time to hand pick a great crew. I have limited myself to watching the TV series/movie to just once a year because I simply get too depressed knowing that I will never be able to see any more of this FANTASTIC show. Do yourself a favor; find a friend who has the DVS's and watch the first episode. You will be back here on Amazon buying the whole series plus the movie.

It's so cleverly written and well directed that I can't even believe it was ever cancelled.  The movie Serenity was amazing as well, but that movie could have provided another season or two since they had to rush the storyline and left so many things unfinished.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Z76YAHWYNXB7	Brian Prothero	"Firefly was an interesting TV series that mixed sci-fi high tech with realistic pioneer surroundings. In real life, we have a mixture of high tech and low tech all around us. You see this mix even more when visiting small back woods towns and especially third world countries. Firefly took this reality as a premise by showing the pioneer colony worlds on the fringe of civilization with only the most basic technology backdropped by the frontier world like it was in the old west. In contrast, the inner planets where the capital cities were was very modern and hi-tech.The television show only lasted one short season due to the short sight of the network execs. The show was followed by ""Serenity"", a feature film that brought some closure to the story.  There remains a devoted fan base that continues to hope for additional films or a new TV show.The Blu-ray transfer is well done though it seems a bit grainy. This may be due to the film stock used in the series and is preferable to the overdone digital noise reduction (DNR) I've seen in other films that smoothes out all the details and makes the actors look waxy. I'm glad that the Blu-ray transfer engineers chose to keep the original grain and detail.I highly recommend this Firefly boxset and follow up movie Serenity."	4.0	Nice Blu-ray set for a great TV series	2012-06-30	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A13VQ2Z2I1CE14	Brian S. Slaby	"What was Fox thinking when they canceled this brilliant show?  As a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff, Angel, I naturally gravitate to any new series that Joss Whedon is involved in.  In comparison to the aforementioned shows, as well as his latest network series, Dollhouse, Firefly had the strongest first season by far.  Given that Joss is excellent at building stories and the universes that they are set in slowly (it's what makes him so suited for writing TV series), I can only imagine how amazing Firefly could have become 2, 3, or 6 seasons into the future.As a science fiction/western, the show's very premise is unusual.  Yet, it works extremely well.  This isn't a fanciful, romanticized future with shiny, perfect spaceships and characters that face problems that viewers could scarcely imagine dealing with.  No; Firefly is as down to earth and believable as science fiction can get.  Only two assumptions are necessary in order to suspend disbelief in ""The 'Verse"":  1) that humans will deplete the Earth's resources in the future (it's already happened in Firefly, and 2) that space travel becomes possible, and a suitable ""new"" solar system be found.  These are the only ""futuristic"" aspects of Firefly, and other than that life goes on for people just as it has for all of human history.  They fight in bloody wars, oppressive governments spring up, and the biggest worry that the common folk have is getting enough money to put food on their plates.  The Alliance is a classical Empire that has overextended its reach; it is unable to effectively govern the outer planets, and thus they are neglected.  These planets are literally on the frontier, which is where the ""western"" aspect of the show comes into play.  Overall, a very rich world.Of course the real strength of the show, as is usual for everything that Joss Whedon writes, is the dialogue and the characters.  Fans of his other shows will recognize the witty lines and liberal amount of humor interjected even into storylines that deal with very serious issues.  Walking that balance between drama and humor can be difficult, but Firefly definitely delivers.  Furthermore, every single character on Serenity (the name of the Firefly-class ship that they travel in) is likable and believable.  In one of the extras Joss Whedon mentioned that at it's core, the show is about 9 different people looking into the blackness of space and all seeing different things.  And there is quite the diversity of characters; from the uneducated mercenary, and resident tough guy Jayne, to the ""proper,"" top-of-his-class doctor who lost everything saving his sister (a child prodigy driven to insanity through government medical experiments which turned her into an empath/mind reader, as well as a near-perfect fighter).While not all of the 15 episodes in this set are equally strong, there aren't any really ""bad"" episodes (though there are several really good ones, with my favorite probably being episode 8: Jaynestown).  This is an incredible feat for any show to accomplish, and makes you wonder even harder how this show got canceled.While its cancellation was most unfortunate, it's a testament to the show's strengths that it was able to be wrapped up with a major motion picture, Serenity.  How often does that happen?  A show gets canceled halfway through its first season and then it gets made into a movie!"	5.0	Another masterpiece by Joss Whedon	2010-01-26	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVA2OCRYH6PA7	Brian Waller	This quirky, witty, and intelligent series is an instant cult-classic among hardcore sci-fi fans.  Basically a crossbreed of Star Trek's technology, and Wild, Wild West's settings and bravado, Firefly chronicles the travels of nine unique characters, as they ply the spacelanes.  It's not a show about exploring strange new worlds, and seeking out new life;  the show's writer, Joss Whedon, made it a parallel to our own world, just setting it 500 years in the future.  Any one of the characters aboard - like the Shepard Booke, a roving missionary, or Simon, a surgeon with serious family problems - could be one of us.  Ship's Captain Malcom &quot;Mal&quot; Renolyds is an ex-soldier that's always looking for work.  Sounds kind of like my life, actually.Too bad Fox didn't realize what a hit it had on it's hands.

What can I say to much politically correct Star Trek had made me think the future was sterile, and had problems with time travel continuity oh and alternate universes.The draw of this series for me more than anything else is the character interaction.

I should have skipped over this oneThis is a show about how the human race reached out across the galaxy to teriform and populate planets. one of the shows i watched today was about MUD FARMERS in a hick little farm all dressed like they were from the early 1800's erth. I don't get it.In Star Trek you meet alien life, you see different worlds as different the Earth. for the most part it seems like only white earthlings got anywhere in the galaxy in Firefly.If westerns are your thing, if you like riding horses, bar fights and guns (yes fire arms, not phasers), then this is the show for you. they could have made this better having a gang of 9 riding in the wild west saving people and doing illicity deeds for the shady....but no, they went and put in a space ship instead	3.0	Just another Western	2010-08-11	13	4	9

Compared to this, Buffy was practice.  Joss Whedon's great concept was cut tragically short by a network that (we hope) is kicking itself at the moment.  The firefly series is only four discs.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1AFO63ZV3DJ5L	Brown Rage	Just read in Hollywood Reporter that a feature film version of Firefly has been green-lit by Universal (who acquired the rights from 20th Century Fox)! I'd suggest buying this DVD set and getting acquainted with the characters before seeing the film.Firefly, right off the bat, had compelling, complex characters, extraordinary SFX (which, instead of substituting for good writing, served only to create a realistic, gritty atmosphere), and a nuanced premise that was unique among the space opera genre. It managed to create action and suspense without the usual laser-filled space battles.Buy the DVD, and go see the movie when it hits the theaters. Who knows, if it all sells well, maybe Universal (which may soon be owned by NBC) will revive it as a series in the future for NBC or Sci Fi Channel.If not, at least you'll get to see all the episodes in the correct order, unlike the way they were shown on Fox.	5.0	See this before you see the movie!	2003-09-04	9	9	0

I enjoy this show and wish their were more episodes.  It is offbeat and the characters are an interesting group.  I have not finished the complete season so I hope that the remaining shows will be as enjoyable.  I also intend to view the movie that sums up this show.  To bad they decided to cancel this show.

Me, too, but I'm more used to idiocy in high places.But now we have the DVD set--and it's gorgeous. You have not seen ""Firefly"" until you have seen it in widescreen and real sound on a large screen (in my case, 42"" plasma HD) TV. The images are sharp, the effects hold up very well, and the cast is as quirky as ever. Heck, the pilot episode alone is probably better than 90% of all SF films ever released. And, as my wife says, ""No commercials.""Firefly was intelligent, witty, a bit goofy, character-driven, and a lot of fun. Also had one of the best theme songs of any show of recent memory. So, of course, the network executives moved it around, forced the episodes to be shown out of order, then cancelled it abruptly.Imagine if those same executives had been running Fox when The X-Files started a decade ago. All we'd have would be a VHS set of a dozen or so episodes of Scully and Mulder. Bozos. All I can hope is that Joss Whedon succeeds in bringing ""Firefly"" to the big screen--and then back to the small one.  ..bruce.."	5.0	The only SF series my wife really, really liked	2003-09-06	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3IRS8XOM457UL	Bruce P. Barten	"Television is hardly the ideal format for an epic story with so many characters, exotic settings, and a serious attempt to update the Audie Murphy story for an audience that is so familiar with science fiction that the bionic surprises in the final episode have been expected all along by everyone whose childhood included dreams of taking the hood off Darth Vader.Having all the episodes available on a 3-disc DVD set with a few extra features at the end allows those who are used to inhabiting books to devote every available moment to deciphering how well the writers of the `Firefly' series were able to build stories based on transport jobs capable of earning enough to buy fuel to keep hopping from planet to planet.  The writer responsible for the `Shindig' episode in the special features appears to be a woman.  Populating far-off worlds is risky business, but an upper crust manages to promote as much glorification of the culture of the old west as circumstances allow.Torture is a topic which is foreshadowed early with a wife's nephew hanging upside-down as a result of his failures.  A clean get-away at the end of the early episode does not preclude the capture of members of Serenity's crew much later in the series.  The pleasure to be derived from finally having the opportunity to torture someone who has been duly warned but still did something deserving electrical voltages that barely avoid killing familiar characters is skillfully drawn out in shocking sequences of questions, comments, and wild spasms with flying sparks.  This might be a suitable introduction to some Japanese philosophy for some people who are bound to associate limit situations with the idea of meeting the man.What makes `Firefly' so modern is the ineptness of the alliance, which is so concerned with security that anyone who has talked to a certain doctor, or his little sister, are likely to be wiped out before they have the opportunity to communicate with anyone else.  Living under an administration which seems truly astounded whenever it encounters assertions which counter its basic beliefs, my favorite line in the entire series must be the doctor saying, ""This must be what going crazy feels like."""	5.0	Top state of the art stories	2005-11-27	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1HG2DOSBZEX4I	Bryan A. Pfleeger	"Joss Whedon broke new ground with his short lived series Firefy. He did not just create a unique space western he created great television. The sad thing is that the powers that were at Fox killed the show before it could ever really develop. True, Firefly, had some issues such as the airing of episodes out of order and in strange timespots but it was certainly a show that with a little development could have survived beyond fourteen sparse episodes. Firefly was so much more than the sum of its parts it was a show that dealt with the bonds between people that come together to create family.The many reviews here adequately describe the plot and the characterizations. If Whedon could do anything it was to develop strong characters whith great dialogue. The characters made this show and will be a part of Whedon's legacy along with Buffy and Angel. The crew of the Serenity joined together a group of diverse characters threw them together in situations that made them help each other, that made them bind, that made them form a family dynamic unlike many that are seen on  regular television. This, in my opinion, is what made the show worthwhile. Sure, the action and special effects were fun to watch but the dynamic between the characters was even better.The series comes complete on four discs. The episodes are presented in the correct viewing order and are presented in widescreen. The widescreen treatment was one of the sore points for Fox that Whedon found to be necessary. The audio is Dolby Surround 2.0 but is quite robust for the presentation. The set offers commentaries on six of the episodes and all but the last are of the anecdotal sort. On his final commentary Whedon waxes philosophic about the episode ""Objects in Space."" There are the usual making of features and gag reel. Watching this material shows a cast that enjoyed working together that worked together quite well.This is one of the finest network series that I have seen in quite a while. Check it out. You will be glad you did."	4.0	Take My Love, Take My Land....	2008-04-05	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AYGQXNJANKFJJ	"Bryan E. Gibbs ""Blueholy"""	"I will take a different approach on this review.  I have read several that state, ""I don't watch that much TV.""  They are trying to make the point that they are well rounded individuals that love the show instead of people that spend 40 hours a week watching TV.Well, I consider myself to be well rounded and I DVR a lot of TV shows (tough to fit it all in).  Shows like 24, Lost, Alias, Veronica Mars, Everwood, and The O.C. (my guity pleasure if you will).So, when I say that this is quite possibly the best TV show I have ever watched, it comes from a person that is well rounded and has the ""experience"" that comes from watching a lot of TV to call myself a critic.Firefly is quite possibly the best TV show I have ever watched.Joss Whedon, for those not in the Whedonverse (he did Buffy and Angel), is one of the best out there right now in terms of being able to write and produce witty, suspense/tension filled shows.  The dialogue in his shows are sensational.Firefly had the amazing ability to pull you into Mal and the crew's world from show to show.  24 pulls you in from a different angle.  It is the twists and turns of the plot that pull you along for the ride.  But when I think about it, I could really care less about the majority of the characters.  I just want to see what the next danger is that Jack Bauer can get out of.  Firefly does both well.  You truly care about each character and the storyline of each show never ends up where you think it would.  The show hits all emotions.When you watch the shows in order on the DVD, a luxury we didn't have when the show aired on FOX (those morons), you will fall in love with it and also think that Fox should have a place reserved in ""that special hell"".I also was one of the fortunate ones to see the advanced screening of Serenity, the movie spawned from the efforts of the cast, crew, Joss, and the fans.  It was an amazing piece of work.  Watch the DVD set of the TV show first then go watch Serenity.I can't say enough great things about the show!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A28KLQWBJKZEBL	"Bryan Hoppe ""Historian"""	I guess I'm one of the fans that helped make this show a cult hit after the fact, because I had never even heard of it while it was after on the air.  I was a sci-fi fan and was referred to it by a friend, and I found myself mourning the cancellation of the show years after the fact.  The only complaint I have of the show is that it was not given sufficient time to fully flesh out off of it's intricacies, and so the studio wasted great potential when it was cut loose.  Make sure to check out Serenity as well, because it at least brings some degree of closure, but I still would have preferred a few seasons between the end of this show and the movie finale.	5.0	Fantastic, despite it's brevity	2008-05-29	1	0	1

Hatfield ""hatfield78"""	First off let me say that I have never bought a DVD of a TV series and this is my first TV series on DVD I have bought and my first review. The premise of this show as has been stated by other reviews is that it is a Space/Western, which to be honest overly simplifies this great TV series. The great thing about this show is that it has something for everyone. It had action, comedy, drama..in short it had it all. When I tell people about this show I tell them it's a mix between Sci-Fi and Western. To which I get a perplexed look, but once someone sets down and watches this show they are hooked, they &quot;get it' so to speak. The best example I an give is my wife. She doesn't like Sci-Fi or Westerns, but this was one of here favorite shows. She sat down every Friday night and watched fatithfully just like I did. She doesn't really know why she likes this show since it mixes two genres of T.V. that she doesn't care for. She just says it's something special that really can't be defined. I guess that it the highest complement both her and I can give to Firefly. It was and is something special. If you truly want to be entertained this is the series for you. I'm sure the movie will do well and more people will see what a great show this was.	5.0	Arguably the best T.V. show ever.	2004-02-20	9	9	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1M7HM3P4NRLHA	Bryan S. Sampsel	"While Firefly has some spectacular CGI renders, it doesn't get lost in special affects or techno-babble dialogue.  Instead, the technology is but one piece of the storyline's backdrop.The concept is simple.  Earth was used up and with only two superpowers left, the USA and China, cultures merged on some level as humanity left for the stars.  Some planets were started with precious little funding after the terraforming was completed, so those planets tended towards being agrarian with a spartan use of technology.  Picture a good western with a high tech spacecraft landing behind the gunfighter, or a high tech communications device sitting in a corner opposite a wood burning stove.Anyways, at some point in time, the wealthier, more industrialized planets decided it was time they were all united under one central government.  The more independent planets protested and fought back.  Despite an impressive fight, the ""Browncoats"" (from the poorer planets) lost.The series is set in a kind of ""Post American Civil War frontier West"" theme.  There's 19th century looking individuals with revolvers, M16s, shotguns, and once, a laser pistol.The themes discussed and presented put any Star Trek to shame, as it focuses on the individual over the government.  For fans of Robert Heinlen and his themes of individual rights and freedom, Firefly is for you.  If you prefer the Big Bird of the Galaxy's droppings, consisting of a Socialism utopia, you probably won't like it.If you're a Babylon 5 fan, you'll probably love the show."	5.0	Richest Sci-Fi concept in years	2004-10-11	10	8	2

It's simply the best written, most involving, most perfectly cast TV show ever produced.I've watched literally hundreds of TV shows over the span of my 25 years and never, not once, have I ever enjoyed a show or movie (the follow up Serenity) as much as Firefly.  If you've never seen this show, you're really missing an incredibly good, although brief, ride.It's true that it's not for everyone in the world.  But I'd be willing to bet that the VAST majority of people who watch the pilot ""Serenity"" through at least ""Shindig"" will really enjoy the show.  If you make it to ""Our Mrs. Reynolds,"" I guarantee you'll never regret your 7 hour time investment.I've had such an emotional connection with TV characters until this show.  They're written with such depth, humor and most of all reality, that they really do feel alive at times.  Joss's hope that it seems like a ""found"" show is fully realized.  The dynamic of each of the 9 characters playing off one another works absolutely perfectly.  Without any one of them, it would be a totally different show.There is really no reason not to buy and enjoy this too-good-for-Fox-anyway DVD set.

There is a build-in fan-base and the re-emergenence of the genre (from LOTR, other theatrical releases, to BSG, Stargates, Lost, 4400, Invasion, Surface, Triangle, etc) would bode very well for new episodes of Firefly.All in all, this DVD set is very reasonably priced for what you are getting: a quality and rather unique/original sci-fi show.	4.0	Deserves a return to TV!	2005-12-06	4	3	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJCD358GE27BR	Bulk Slash	Firefly was a show never given a chance by Fox when it was first aired in the US, they even aired the first episode last! Thankfully these DVDs give people a chance to see the show as intended.The background of the story is set in the distant future, where Earth has been left behind by man and many planets have been colonised. After a very recent war a grouping of planets called &quot;The Alliance&quot; have taken control of the galaxy, their planets are rich and properous with high-technology, whilst many other planets are neglected and poor. These poorer worlds have to rely on the basic means of survival such as using horses instead of cars and traditional guns instead of lasers to defend themselves. Presumably The Alliance has learned that their citizens cannot rebel when they have nothing to rebel with.Some people dismiss the show as &quot;cowboys in space&quot; because of the low-tech look of the poorer planets, but it makes perfect sense that on worlds the Alliance has conquered you would have to go &quot;back to basics&quot; when you can't get spare parts for your car.The show follows the crew of the &quot;Firefly&quot; class ship &quot;Serenity&quot;. The crew travels the space ways trying to stay on the fringes of civilisation to avoid The Alliance. They'll take any job (they don't usually care what it is) and this leads to them being involved in all kinds of capers from illegal jobs like robbing trains to shipping a hold full of cattle!While the story is always interesting, the characters are even more so. The captain, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), was on the losing side during the war and after being betrayed by his superiors has lost his faith in god and man. He wants nothing more than to avoid the Alliance and live his own life, but if he can find a job that will annoy the Alliance he and his crew will take it.The rest of the crew is very diverse: the Doctor called Simon, and his sister, River, are high-profile fugitives from the Alliance. Then there is Shepherd Book who is a priest with a secret, he naturally has issues with the &quot;godless&quot; captain too. There is also a &quot;registered companion&quot; aboard (a government sanctioned prostitute) called Inara, although in reality she is more like a Japanese Geisha as she is required to choose her clients most carefully. Amusingly, in the future having a companion on board means you are much more likely to be warmly greeted when landing on a new planet!The crew is rounded out by Zoe (first officer) and Wash (pilot) who are married, the twist being that Zoe is more like the dominant male of the relationship! There is also Jayne, who often seems on the verge of betraying the crew for money and finally Kayley who is the ships gifted engineer. All of the characters are funny, and every episode has laugh out loud moments as well as moments of high drama and tension.I highly recommend this to anyone with a taste for well written, well acted Sci-Fi, especially if you are suffering from over-exposure to Star Trek, as this show offers a very refreshing and different take on the future of mankind.	5.0	An under-rated classic	2004-04-12	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3HF8LX8F0LW8W	Bumbie	When Firefly first came out, I didn't watch it because I was already watching too many shows (Buffy, Angel, Star Trek, StarGate, Farscape, and a few others) and I didn't want to add another show to my already full VCR tapes!  Now I am kicking myself for missing out on what was a terrific show! I bought the DVDs this summer right before SciFi announced they were going to air the reruns and at first I was going to just savor the show and watch the SciFi channel versions -- one a week. Well, I couldn't help myself and ran through the DVD set in about 3 weeks. Now I am mourning the show's cancellation just like I did Buffy's and Angel's. But at least we have the movie to look forward to so I can't wait until Sept 30!I think the show failed on TV because (mostly) Fox Television was stupid to not air the pilot first. Duh!!!  Anyone knows that it is character development and 'secrets' that keeps shows popular not cool action or sets. There was plenty of action in the 2 hour pilot to grab and intrigue the fans while also creating a few 'secrets' to make you come back for more. If you disagree, just think about why a show like Desperate Housewives is so popular -- everyone wants to know what secrets everyone has!  Other than that, the show is just a boring slow moving soap opera! But alas, I still watch DH just for the secrets! :)I think it's also possible there were a lot of people like me that were fans of Joss' other shows (Buffy, Angel) and couldn't commit to another show or were afraid that maybe it wouldn't be as great as the other two shows so they didn't watch it at all. I didn't know at the time, either, that Joss had contributed so many successful projects (Toy Story, etc.) so I had thought Buffy/Angel was a uniquely successful creation that couldn't be repeated. I am now properly educated and convinced Joss is a genious! :)	5.0	I will now watch anything Joss makes!	2005-08-24	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AF4G72FH0B2KL	BunniesKill	I never watched this show during its short run; I got the DVD set for Christmas. It might be my favorite present ever. I parceled it out half an episode a night so it wouldn't end too quickly!My heart is breaking because this incredible series never got to fulfill its potential. It has everything: action, romance, fortune and glory, the snappy dialogue for which Joss Whedon is famous. The space Western hybrid with Chinese influences WORKS brilliantly. You never question it. Whedon cast out some of the most overdone sci-fi stereotypes: conflicts with aliens, battles in space (Serenity is a cargo ship and doesn't have guns--almost a punchline in and of itself!), and heroes who are heroic.The crew is led by the brash, disenchanted Capt. Malcolm Reynolds, who combines the sexiest qualities of Han Solo with Indiana Jones. Every member of the ensemble cast is crucial and fascinating.This series surpasses Buffy and Angel. Do yourself a big favor and buy it. (Every boxed set sold also improves its chances of hitting the silver screen.)	5.0	Egg-Noodle Western	2004-01-25	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1QHV7DSX40L03	burningbushsacredheart	Buying from Amazon was as professionally handled and well done as their usual level of excellent and trustworthy business service.As for this series, I was not able to see the Firefly series it when it first came out on TV, but I sure wish I had and that it was given the opportunity for a longer run. The series does tend to have more mature themes, but they are well done. This series is not just entertaining to watch but it also considers such weighty issues as: the relationship between imperfection and freedom; social governance and the drawbacks that occur when human domains of activity are subsumed into power-imbalanced forms of government; ethics of experimentation on human subjects; the meaning of human relationships; and questions concerning God and the contemporary world. The episode on Ariel particularly led me to have a new appreciation for the biblical phrase [When you hurt/loved my people], &#34;You did it to me&#34;; as well as &#34;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&#34; [referring to Saul/Paul's persecution of the Jewish Christians].

This DVD set must be one of the most highly rated and most reviewed items on Amazon, and deservedly so. If TV execs could read these responses, perhaps they would see that this would be a huge success, and convince Joss Whedon to make another season (or 10).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2BPYQ7X1WSH5U	"C. A. Brewer ""Christy, the walking t.v. guide"""	"I don't know what to say about Firefly that other reviews haven't said before.  But I can tell you other things.I was not an original fan of the show, I'll grant you that.  I wish I can say I was one of those few people that watched it from the original beginning on t.v.  But I shall speak the truth and say that I was not.  In fact, I remember catching the middle of an episode once before going to bed on a Friday night.When I heard Fox canceled the show, I was sad.  Buffy lasted for seven years, and Angel for five.  I was a HUGE Buffy fan, and had since the very beginning.  I knew that Joss has staying power, because his shows are smart and well-written, and touch every single aspect of the emotional spectrum necessary for a great t.v. show.  I was sad because I knew Joss had a good show, but he just wasn't given the chance necessary to show it off.I say, Blame it on Fox.But of course, they're eating their words right now of cancelling Firefly.The fanbase of Firefly is amazing, and that's how I stumbled across it.  Through connections, I was able to view Firefly.  I watched the episodes in the order that Joss Whedon wanted them to be shown.  Immediately in episode 1 I was blown away and needed more.  Nathan Fillion is just captivating.  Malcolm ""Mal"" Renyolds (""Mal. Bad...in the latin"" River honestly states in one episode) is that kind of character you latch yourself onto, wanting to go deeper into his psyche.  Adam Baldwin is a riot as Jayne Cobb, and Alan Tudyk is wonderful as the pilot we all come to know and love as ""Wash"".  Jewel Saite makes you giggle, especially in episode 4 in that dress of her's.What makes Firefly so great is that it's realistic to the fact that all these characters can exist, and that we can relate so much to every single one of them, even the preacher that well, some don't really suspect is a preacher at all.  I raved for weeks to my best friend, telling her what a fantastic show we were missing out on.  When I finally was able to get the DVD set for my own, I gave myself a mini-marathon (Putting off a paper one night, to say the least) so I could watch them all over again.  My best friend watched the episodes, and then yelled at me why I hadn't gotten them to her sooner.  She just recently purchased them herself.Now with the movie coming out soon, it just proves to Fox and the rest of world what they had missed out on.  Something so fantastically brillant that it /had/ to be brought to the big screen.  So start your journey here.  Settle down with your tv and dvd player, pop some popcorn, and let the violins in the opening credits help you to escape to the future with the people aboard the Firefly class ship, Serenity."	5.0	Only one word necessary: Brillance	2005-07-05	14	14	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1PJZKEZQGREDY	California Dreaming	I started watching &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; earlier this year.  Surely, I waited way too long to watch it; it is very funny, perhaps the best sitcom on television.  I've been trying to catch up on all six or seven seasons as quickly as possible, and I'm getting close.I was watching an episode last night, where Leonard -- Johnny Galecki -- won a trip to visit the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, and Sheldon -- Jim Parsons -- automatically assumed that Leonard would take Sheldon as a guest.  Instead, Leonard decided to take Penny -- Kaley Cuoco -- and can you blame him?  Especially since it was on Valentine's Day.  I'm sure that Leonard had a lot of colliding on his mind. . . ..Anyways, Sheldon gets mad at Leonard, calling him a &#34;traitor&#34; or something, and a traitor so severe that he was nearly as bad as Rupert Murdoch.  When Leonard looked puzzled by the reference -- everyone is always puzzled by Sheldon's references -- Sheldon said that Mr. Murdoch was a traitor because &#34;he owns Fox and he cancelled Firefly.&#34;  I had heard of Firefly but had never seen it.  Until today, but only by recommendations by Sheldon.After watching the pilot, I'm puzzled by Sheldon's remarks as well.  &#34;Why did he like this series?&#34; is my immediate thinking.  Oh it has the standard &#34;diverse cast&#34; that everyone loves, and it's got some not-quite-lame special effects.  But the dialog is iffy, at best.  At the beginning, some commander dude says something like, &#34;We've just done the impossible.  And that makes us special.&#34;  Now, even Sheldon would have trouble with this logic, because if you've done something, it can't be impossible, unless of course you're in an alternate universe where the rules of Physics are different.  &#34;Well, they didn't do anything impossible then, and therefore they may not be special,&#34; would be my response.At another point, something bad happens and someone else says, &#34;Good God in Heaven.&#34;  I agree with that.  &#34;Good God in Heaven, why did they ever create this series?&#34; would be my question, not &#34;Good God why did Mr. Murdoch ever cancel the series?&#34;My apologies to Sheldon.  Kinda.  And leave Rupert Murdoch -- and Leonard -- alone.	3.0	Sheldon, What Were You Thinking?	2013-10-24	3	0	3
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVBOCSETZ2VQ9	"California Dreamin ""sr538"""	"I bought this after hearing all the references to Firefly in the bonus material on the Angel season 4 DVD, where I first saw the fabulous Gina Torres, who plays the executive officer on Firefly.Firefly is worth buying and watching.  It is an sf western with a few brave rogue heroes in a spaceship fighting an evil empire (""the alliance"").  The music and sets are extremely multicultural, and any cussing or expletives are in Chinese, which adds a wonderful flavor to the dialog.  How does such an impossible combination fantasy world work?  I'm not sure exactly, but it does work.  Kudos to Joss Whedon.  Having amazing sets and special effects certainly helps, and the dialog and acting are well done.However, the (English) dialog lacked quite the same humour and depth of literary reference we know and love from Buffy.  I would have appreciated the DVD's more if the DVD subtitles were to translate the Chinese slang rather than just saying ""(speaks in Chinese)"".  And unlike Buffy, where dialog was at a college grade level, Firefly uses a simpler subset of English language, at more of an advanced high school level.Nathan Fillion, who plays Mal, the captain of Firefly did not work for me as a convincing leadership figure.  His natural character is quite different from the part he plays, and to me he never completely seems to get in character.  There always seems to be a detached and ironic mein that does not seem compatible with the leadership role he tries to play.Lastly, there is not much season arc.  Each episode story stands (quite well) alone.  This was fine with me, but if you need a season arc, or you need more than the 14 episodes in this set, you will be disappointed.In summary, despite a few failings, this was a great series which died prematurely.  It is worth buying, and taking the time to watch on DVD.PS for Chinese translations try the following website -[...]"	5.0	Not as good as Buffy or Angel but still 4.5 to 5 stars	2004-10-16	9	4	5

I was not disappointed.I've watched 12 of the 14 episodes, and I can confidently say that if this show were currently in production, I'd make a point to watch it.  The writing, casting, and acting are all top-notch.  Despite what you might think, the Western theme works well.  It's certainly one of the more original things to appear on  TV, and if you liked Babylon 5 and/or Deep Space 9, you should like this.

When my wife and I first sat to watch ""Firefly"" when it first aired, we were not sure what to make of it. It almost seemed like a cross between ""Wagon Train"" and ""Star Trek"". Was Gene Roddenbery's dream finally realized? No, Gene had nothing to do with this one, and Fox didn't seem like they wanted to give it much of a chance. Being fans of unusual SciFi like ""Farscape"" and ""LEXX"" we were willing to give it a chance. While we could my wife and I watched and thoroughly enjoyed the unusual characters, stories, and settings. I'm glad they were smart enough to make the ""Serenity"" movie as a pie in the face to Fox for cancelling this series. Great movie and great series. I recommend it to all, not just fans of SciFi. This appeals to a much wider group of people and beats the tar out of all the reality dregs the networks came up with at the same time. If there were more series like this and fewer reality shows, I think more people would be watching TV again. This reminded me a little of a future Western, and most of us wouldn't mind seeing a Western again after so many years of absence. If you think about it, if people were in fact colonizing new planets, they would in fact start out very low tech since they wouldn't have alot of money and it would be expensive and hard to get high tech equipment. I imaginge they would probably live very close to what is represented in this series. It is ashame the set only includes 11 episodes. It is good though to see three episodes that weren't aired originally. I still highly recommend it to fans of SciFi."	4.0	Barbequed Short Ribs	2007-07-25	4	3	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APMEHK268IHX9	Capt'n Rad Bud	Science fiction, when it's good it is inspiring, when it is bad I yell at the TV and throw socks at the screen.  I am not a fan of most of the cheesy sci-fi shows that most people love.  I'm not a fan of any of the new Star Trek's, or Farscape or the Hercules/Zena shows.  I have greatly enjoyed Stargate SG-1 and thought it was the end all of TV sci-fi.  Then a friend sat me down and forced me to watch Firefly.  Five minutes into the pilot episode, a person should know that they are watching something SPECIAL.  No sound in space AND IT WORKS!  Artsy-fartsy camera angles and zoom effects make the CG look as if it were actually filmed and not just rendered.  My wife hates sci-fi and she fell in love with the characters and stories, and has asked to watch episodes back-to-back since getting the DVD.  You can't ask for better character development or for better actors to bring the wonderful script to life.If you love the Anime movies that come out as boxed sets, you WILL love Firefly.

That would have made steadfast viewers for the long stretch.  Then they changed time periods, etc. and then prematurely cancelled the show.  I love Buffy and Angel but I like Firefly even more.  When the Twin Towers went down on 911, the psychologists said that everyone was tuning in ""comfort"" shows.  I was watching ""I Love Lucy"" reruns.  But the last few years I would watch Buffy or Angel whenever I was under extreme stress.  Now it's Firefly.  It's now my number one comfort show when things aren't going well.  I've watched it over and over and I don't think it will ever get old or boring.  I can't wait for Joss Whedon's new series ""The Dollhouse"" coming sometime soon on Fox.

We have a crew of 7 (OK nine after the two mysterious siblings have been picked up) renegades fleeing from the clutches of the boo-hiss Alliance (who wear uniforms not dissimilar to the Federation in the B7 universe). We have splendidly complex and rounded characters, who are not 100% good or bad. Captain Reynolds owes more than a little to Paul Darrow's Avon I reckon. Whereas alien planets would generally be represented by a quarry or similar in B7, some Wild Western scrubland does the same job in Firefly. The scenario in the Firefly episode Bushwacked is *extremely* similar to the B7 episode in which the gang first find the Liberator. Finally, I noted some dialogue in Firefly (""I was aiming for his head"") lifted directly from the B7 scripts. Sincerest form of flattery? Yeah maybe. But so what? I thoroughly enjoyed Blakes 7 (wobbly sets and all) and I am thoroughly enjoying Firefly too.This is undoubtedly thought-provoking, intelligent sci-fi with very strong characterisation. Whedon's notion to set it as a Western may require some viewers to suspend their disbelief quite a bit, but if you just go with the flow you will not be disappointed. There's a great sense of fun in here too. Trust me, this is light years ahead of Voyager or Enterprise.Decent enough extras - commentaries and stuff. Sadly no 5.1 sound though.Two disks still to go!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A22PAYOX7217YS	Cassie E	Firefly is a good show, actually it's a great show. But then again, a lot of people say so. In fact they're probably right and I wouldn't disagree.First off, the writing is for the most part solid. All the character's have interesting quirks that pull and suck you in their world. For example, the genius/pyshic River Tam, on the run from the Alliance. Captain Mal Reynolds, a man hollowed out by war and loss, but still manages to get himself in trouble, with help from his crew members. Jayne Cobb, the crude and greedy mercenary, with a strange sense of loyalty. Inara Serra, the beautiful and mysterious Companion with a hidden past. Kaylee Frye, the joy and innocence of Serenity. Zoe, war veteran and steadfast first mate. Wash, the pilot; humor and dinosaurs abound. Simon Tam, the doctor, getting a glimpse of the real world for the first time. And Shepherd Book, a preacher with more secrets than a man of the cloth should have.  It's the world of Firefly, of Serenity. A great mixture of the old west with scifi elements.The plotting is excellent, the stories again pull you in and never let you go. Firefly was smart, making you think about certain themes represented in the show, freedom, loyalty, and survival to name a few. Things that matter. The acting was fantastic, Joss Whedon couldn't have cast any better actors and actresses for the show. Firefly has memorable performances from Adam Baldwin, Nathan Fillion, and especially new comer, Summer Glau. Morena Baccarin, Alan Tudyk, Ron Glass, Jewel Staite, and Sean Maher were also a joy to watch.The show had enough scifi elements, but at the same time remain realistic to some laws of science. The only thing that I didn't like that it was ended too soon before it's time. Had it been given time, better handle promotional wise, and a better timeslot; I am postive the show would flourished as it still continues to do so in the fandom. Just as Mr. Whedon's other shows became cult favorites, Buffy TVS and Angel. My only consolation is that I look forward in 2005 for the Universal motion picture, Serenity, featuring the whole cast from the show. And that it'll make Fox realize the gold mine it lost in canceling the show. I recommend the DVD set for anyone, the first episodes move slightly slow, according to some first viewers, but I assure you that it's worth your time and money, even though you might have to save up for it. Firefly was an example of Big Damn Good Tv, lost among the sea of filth of reality tv. A Big Damn Loss, make sure it isn't yours.	5.0	An example of Big Damn Good TV	2004-05-09	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1L48W8FO1CTGV	cass teague	I absolutely love &quot;Firefly&quot;! But Fox has done it again.  First, the tv network sabotaged the excellent work of Joss Whedon by tampering with the sequence of the episodes in its Fall 2002 airings. Now the Home Video division has placed several episodes out of sequence on the make-up dvd offering.  In the series, the first two episodes form the pilot, 'Serenity', which gives viewers initial exposition and sets the tone for the series, as well as introduces the nine key characters who form the crew and passengers of the Firefly-class starship &quot;Serenity&quot;.  Well, Fox tv decided not to air that pilot, but instead to air several episodes out of sequence in an attempt to grab audiences with action and mystery.  The result was a confusing and bewildering mess, which those of us astute enough to investigate, learned was network flubbery of an outstanding work of theatrical art.  When FOX attempted to cut its losses by reneging on funding the back nine episodes of a complete first season, and tossed out a few random episodes and the Pilot as the series finale, the result was a slap in the face to the sci-fi televiewing community.  When news of the dvd collection complete with the unaired episodes came, it was encouraging in that maybe now we could see the entire show the way it was intended to be seen.  By and large, mission accomplished.  The video is crisp and allows us to see the detail and remarkable craft of the technical aspects of the production, even without high definition tv, and to see the detail with exquisite clarity, especially in freeze frame modes, a dvd specialty. Additionally, the acting is superb, and the chemistry among the performers is extraordinary! The commentary adds to the enjoyment immensely.  BUT, once again, FOX erred in the sequencing of the product! The first two discs of the four-disc set accurately follow the sequence of events and the flow of the story as it unfolds.  However, for some indeciferable cause, probably not a reason, they have inserted the penultimate episode at the end of the third disc, and the finale at the beginning of disc four, leaving two other episodes disjointed and lost at the end of the set.  Hopefully other viewers will have done the necessary research prior to viewing the set, and observe the correct sequence.  Others will get to the end, watch the special features at the end, and realize that &quot;The Message&quot; was the finale, not &quot;Objects in Space&quot; and possibly feel cheated, once again.  For those who watched the original run and were thoroughly confused until the pilot 'Serenity' aired, seeing it again will be a welcome start to re-visiting what should have been one of televison's brightest moments.  Hopefully, this box set will re-ignite the flame of the Firefly fans and whet the appetite sufficiently to ensure the successful completion and presentation of the planned feature film due in November.  I have enjoyed the stories tremendously and highly recommend this set with the recommendation that you watch it in the order it was intended: Start with 'Serenity' on disc one and watch straight through disc three, and then stop after &quot;War Stories&quot;; go to &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and watch it and &quot;Objects in Space&quot; on disc four; then watch the last two episodes, &quot;Trash&quot; [last on disc three], and the series finale &quot;The Message&quot; [first on disc four].  This is the way the show should have aired, and, if so,  it would likely still be airing today.  Thanks, Joss, for the great vision, and I'm so glad we can finally share it with you.	5.0	Nitpicking at Perfection	2003-12-29	0	0	0

This is true character oriented science fiction. Unlike the space opera shows like Star Trek next generation, this show doesn't get wrapped up in fake science like graviton fields, etc. Firefly uses it's science fiction canvas to do what science-fiction was intended to do, to examine human interactions in a different environment to show how they are in real life. This show was only allowed to run one season. But it ends on an episode that forms a reasonable ending so you won't feel too much like reading a book with the last shatter torn out.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1P66KPH7WFDL1	Catherine Victoria Peregrin	I'm a traditionalist when it comes to a movie.  I look first of all for a strong story and characters I can care about.  Firefly has both, plus humor and action, again, traditional marks of solid entertainment.  A recent book on Firefly pointed out that the show is masterfully constructed, with, for example, sightlines and camerawork used to build a relationship between the human characters and the ship they are in.  I had, for example, noticed subliminally that the character of Inara, the geisha/ambassador, had a particular aura, but had not realized that her character was deepened by set design, including especially the use of the color red.  Nor had I given a great deak of thought to the music, which, I realized only on reflection, not only set the mood but moved the story along as well.  This is a potential classic, defined as a work you can watch time and time again, learning or appreciating something new each time.  I'm on my third viewing, looking forward to the movie, and hoping that this wonderful story continues through many sequels.  There are memorable characters here: the beautiful, dignified and vulnerable Inara, the thuggish clown Jayne, who may have an ounce of decency somewhere, and the inscrutable Shepherd Book, to name only a few.  This is one of the triumphs of television history.	5.0	A marvelously crafted entertainment.  Very nearly magical!	2005-06-07	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1T3X56N85ETBJ	Catmandew	"A new high point in sci-fi westerns with cursing in Chinese. Okay, it's the only point, but it is a high one. Most episodes are great, and one or two are merely good. The DVD extras reveal that the experience the cast and crew had producing the series was just as special as the experience the audience had (and now by virtue of this set - has) watching it.Joss Whedon, who created the series and wrote/directed some episodes, put together a cast with great chemistry. I found myself getting fully drawn into the stories, action, imagery, humor, and characters. The addition of colloquialisms-of-the-future was a nice touch. If you like the Buffy or Angel series (which he created too), this is different though the amount/type of humor and some of the character (not characters) are similar. You'll also recognize several of the actors.It's a great series that was cancelled many years too soon. Check out the 'pilot' movie, Serenity. It explains quite a bit that the series never got around to.There is violence, foul language in Chinese, and surprisingly harsh attitudes displayed toward Inara, the resident ""companion."" So, it may not be appropriate for children, perhaps even less appropriate for Chinese-speaking children."	5.0	How did this series not make it big?	2006-11-09	4	3	1

And lo, the young show tried to fight back and conform to the evil empire's whishes. And so pander they did! Make the captain more joyful, have the hooker be bi-sexual, naked scenes ahoy! But it was not enough, for the villainous fox had already tasted the young show's blood.They trapped them in their own cruel game of cat and mouse, forcing the show to fight for its life. Putting it on in random time-slots, airing the pilot last, and blaming it all on the show. So when they cancelled, many did weep. For the young creature that held so much potential that was so brutally slain.Weep for the poor and precious show, but do not think that this is its finial end. For there is a new hope, for the fans of brave little Firefly, who showed such strong support for this show, that they where able to have a movie made in its honor, the spawn of Firefly, the great and lovely Serenity.So weep for this show, and curse the villainous Fox, but do not forget because if you buy these DVDs, you too can shout.""I don't care I'm still free.You can't take my firefly from me."""	5.0	The great and whimsical tale of Firefly	2008-06-07	2	1	1

The dialogue is remarkable - absolutely the finest writing of characters. The pace of the show is like drinking in a novella - great action fixes, but the balance of the crew's down time takes us into their world like no other show has been able to replicate.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1YPJSNRBE84IA	"C. Baumeister ""Amateur Critic Extaordinaire"""	An excellent concept for a science fiction series.  Excellent characters are well developed and acted, and this is one of the few SF genre shows which does not rely on just action the special effects.  Too bad Fox cancelled it, as the second season might have been even better!  Much more realistic than the sanitized Star Treks, the parallels with frontier America are taken just a wee bit too far, IMHO.  The country/bluegrass style musical score was a turn-off.  My only complaint, but enough to take it down to 4 stars.	4.0	Firefly - Some Call Me the Space Cowboy...	2005-06-07	11	5	6
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1AY1M6GEP2ZSS	cblads	This was an excellent science fiction series that, like Star Trek in the 60's, was canceled prematurely - Firefly even worse with only one precious season to view over and over again.Love anything Josh Whedon does.I think Whedon's Firefly view of us in the future is, unfortunately, a more likely reality than Star Trek's view:We've headed off into space (not to explore as a unified earth with a prime directive of non-interference, but to occupy and expand our resource-guzzling footprint with the all of best and the worst of us in tow);we're all speaking Chinese (or at least cursing in it);there are still malevolent, power-hungry, greedy humans wanting to control everyone and everything in space through a corporately-controlled government [sound familiar - sans the space of course?]};there are those who fight that evil and fail;and finally, amidst all the turmoil and tribulation, most of humanity merely seeks a way to live, raise a family (or create one on a space craft like Mal and his Serenity crew) and die in peace and dignity.Kudos to Josh Whedon and shame on Fox.  Glad to see that most everyone on the staff and cast went on to a lot of other fine and enjoyable projects.	5.0	Another mistake by TV execs; imagine that?	2013-07-05	1	1	0

The writing, the ensemble cast, theproduction style, the effects, the ship itself, all arefantastic.  The DVD is in widescreen, too, so you can see it asthe producers and directors intended it.  It is beautiful, andclunky, and riveting, just like a tin can in space.  And it istruthful about human emotion and experience in a way that few tvshows try to be.While I watched the DVDs, and especially the episodes that hadremained unaired, I was overwhelmed with sadness that thisseries was killed by the ebil fox empire.  Why producers continueto work with Fox is beyond me.  They seem to buy up greatmaterial just so they can submarine it.My only complaint about the DVDs themselves is the musicthey chose for the menus.  It really isn't moody and evocativeenough.If you haven't seen this DVD/series, buy it immediately.  Youwill want to watch it again and again.  And who knows, again,when the movie comes out.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3JGWNUF9ZYBL2	C. Bradburn	I read some of the bad reviews and most sounded like they were by people who had only seen 1 or 2 episodes AT MOST.  The series did start cold, with maybe a little too much emphasis on the western aspects of the series.  But colonies, no matter how far into the future, are going to be dirty, low tech, thinly populated planets where local traffic will likely be on horseback half the time unless by then someone has invented a cheap universal fuel source.This series is all about the crew and the relationships between them.  Just like Buffy, these relationships develop over time but, unlike Buffy, there's a history to them, which is why it might be hard to get into it at the beginning.  By the time we get to the episode where Jane turns in the doctor and his sister, we know what that's going to do to the captain.  Whedon doesn't just gloss over that - he spends the whole last 15 minutes in the confrontation between the two and it's an entirely believable discussion of Jane's lack of mores and whether or not he deserves to be in that crew.  The fact that at any second the captain could just space him adds that extra edge to it.If Whedon had been allowed another year to develop these characters, I'm sure that the acting and scripts would have been touted as emmy-worthy (though, of course, ignored as all SF is in emmy-land).  So, 3-4 stars for the first couple of episodes, 5 stars across the board for the rest of them.	4.0	Just watch the darn thing!	2003-12-20	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3IBYRSA490ZOA	C. Chow	"Wow, an average of 5 stars from 1400 viewers that's some rating on Amazon. But I suspect theses were probably the only 1400 sci-fi nerds who ever saw `Firefly'.Being a sci-fi nerd myself I was intrigued by `Firefly's reviewers. All very die hard Joss Whedon fans. Whedon is of course famous for `Buffy; The Vampire Slayer' and is also well known for his interviews in which he comes across not as a studio suit but as a sci-fi fan you might meet at a convention. I too was enthralled by Whedon in that I could identify heavily with him.Sad to say `Firefly' does Whedon no credit.The plot: As you've already discerned from Amazon, `Firefly' is a futuristic space odyssey based on the wild west. Sure they fly space ships but they also chew bakky carry peacemakers and ride horses. Whedon's crew of the Serenity is not out to save the universe but merely survive in it by going from score to score and evading the Big Brother-commi/nazi-Empire ""The Alliance"" and the ""Reaver"" cannibal pirates.Why `Firefly' fails:Space odyssey genre rarely works. Whedon was doomed to fail here. So many others have tried but so few have succeeded. I can only name three space odyssey shows that have worked and two were `Star Treks'. Whatever your favorites you must admit that while there are many great sci-fi shows, very few are space odysseys.Characters are flat. While Whedon is best known for his characters, `Firefly's are not the be remembered. First off, there are tooooo many. The pilot and his warrior wife serve absolutely NO PURPOSE as well as they holy man. Whedon should have learned, keep your core to 4 or 5 characters not 9 like the crew of the Serenity. Serenity's prostitute whom was obviously added for sex appeal is neither glamorous nor funny, and adds NOTHING to the story. Give the poor pretty something to do, even if it's just repeating the computer like in `Galaxy Quest'.The acting is substandard. To call the acting ""pathetic"" would be unfair. It's not so god-awful I had to turn off the DVD, but the acting is certainly below the expectations of television as many other  Amazon reviewers have noted.Thin narrative hooks plague the show. While Whedon could get away with this on `Buffy' it doesn't work on `Firefly'. Let's face it, those plots were pretty thin. ""The gym teacher's a zombie."" Here we have, ""Let's rob the train."" The stories are not compelling.By far the worst thing about `Firefly' which kills it, is our hero captain Nathan Fillion. He is neither an honorable hero nor a hard ass tuff guy, instead he comes across like a Hamlet uncertain of the right thing. Whether this is on purpose by Whedon or unintentional, it doesn't work. The whole time I kept struggling to think, ""Where have I seen Nathan Fillion before?"" After reviewing his filmography I realized I haven't seen him before, he's just a TRULY MEMORABLE BAD ACTOR. He comes across like a poor imitation of Colin Farrell.In conclusion, `Firefly' is bad actors playing worse characters acting out a plotless script in the most difficult of television's genres."	3.0	Overrated Sci-fi	2005-07-23	121	15	106
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1M76XZZTQH6YE	"C. Chung ""Topher"""	One word: IncredibleI initially missed this series when it aired, but watched the DVDs and was miserably hooked. I had no idea that I would stay up still 4AM watching every single episode! It's that good!!!When you watch the series, I had to get past the cowboy in space (with a little asian culture thrown in) genre.  But the real power of the series comes from the actors and their execution of the story.  I think I can speak for most of these reviewers, and say that you fall in love with the characters, and feel the relationship that they can provide the viewers.All of the characters (including the ship) are deeper than you think. Through out the series bread crumbs are dropped around each character.  The depth of each character slowly become clearer, and is used cleverly in the story line. The scripts are written with wit, and the plots are thick.I'm not sure why the series was cancelled, but it should not have been. When you have over 2500 (at the time of this review) amazon customer reviews... AND none bad, that's got to say something!The show is gorgeous. Special effects, sound effects, the ship, costumes, etc. There are shows that are cheesy. FireFly is not. The show done so well that you don't even notice how good the effects are. It sucks you in, and you don't realize it until the an episode is over.Bottom line: If you love science fiction, you'll love this series.	5.0	A Must Buy: One of the Best Mis-Understood SciFi Series Ever	2006-07-06	10	9	1

The characters and performers playing them are all top notch, the stories in each episode are extremely funny, profound, deeply moving and exciting from beginning to end. If you love Sci-Fi, you'll love this, but even if you don't, that's okay because despite this taking place in space and on other planets, the emphasis is on characters, emotion and a feeling of family. Truly one of the great television series of our time.The dvd comes with fun commentaries, a revealing retrospective documentary and a few other fun featurettes.

But now...now I own the DVDs, have had Blue Sun custom tee shirts made, and am eagerly awaiting the release of the movie.  I'm a professional, really, and I usually don't respond this way to television, it being television and all.  Ahh, but Firefly is different, my friends.Why?  Because this is the best science fiction series I have ever seen.  It's full of sympathetic characters who act like real people in tough situations.  It's got pathos, it's got ethos, it's got gorgeous women who carry big guns and kind of scare me.  I cannot fathom why Fox cancelled it, but it has made a big damn fan girl outta me, that's for sure.Let me hear you sing it, Browncoats!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AD4MYQ173I417	"Cece ""cece"""	I'll admit it, I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon.  I'll watch just about anything he's involved in at least once. However, my love of this show has little to do with the fact that it's Joss.The simplest description of this show is that is basically a Space Western/Cowboy movie.  But the characters are so real and dynamic and complicated that you can't help but love every one of them.  There's big-time mystery (what did the Alliance do to River? who is Shepard Book really?).  There's romantic tension that you half hope will be resolved and half hope it won't be because it's so fun to watch.  There's humor and there's drama.  There's plenty of action and good old western style gunfights.  This show pretty much has it all.  There's one liners that'll make you die laughing.  There's insightful dialogue here, too.  The main hero of the piece is complex and dark and not really trying to be a hero at all.Pick up the DVD set and treat yourself to some backstory before the Serenity movie comes out.  Even if you watched while it was on the air, this set has some shows that FOX never aired in the US and there are some nifty special features and behind the scenes stuff.	5.0	Something for everyone!	2005-02-17	0	0	0

Thank heavenfor a series that really put a whole, loving twist on two genres at once: westerns and sci-fi. Great fun to see some of the actors reappear in Supernatural later on. Of course, not everyone is old enough to remember Ron Glass's detective character in Barney Miller, but even back then he was, and still is, a great actor who used to wear a bigger 'fro than the way his hair looked when he scared River.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2H3TGP5WIJNHK	"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com"""	1) An intriguing sense of futility.  Yeah, &quot;Firefly&quot; takes the concept of science fiction as a western (&quot;Star Trek&quot; was sold to NBC as &quot;Wagon Train to the stars&quot;) and treats it literally. But what struck me more was the sense of loss, from Simon and River's home to Captain Reynolds' ideals.  American science fiction tends to accentuate the positive, and this darkness made the characters that much more interesting.  In addition, the show made it clear the Alliance, an evil empire that Reynolds fought in a civil war, was there to stay. No one -- not Reynolds, not anyone -- was going to overthrow it.  In that sense, &quot;Firefly&quot; reminded me of &quot;Blake's 7,&quot; a late 70/early 80s British science fiction show where the heroes fought a huge government and won a few victories but never came close to upsetting the underlying order.  Captain Reynolds' motto isn't &quot;Use the Force&quot; or &quot;Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; but &quot;Keep Flying,&quot; which is as close to resignation and defeat as you'll get.  But it feels a lot more realistic than other sci-fi aphorisms.2) Great ensemble acting.  The cast was largely full of unkowns (save for &quot;Barney Miller's&quot; Ron Glass) who jelled quickly and shaded their characters effectively.  In particular, the mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin) gets the funniest lines but is probably the darkest person on the ship, one who would -- and nearly does -- sell out the crew if the money is good enough.  It's likely other characters would have blossomed, too, given enough time.3) The story.  &quot;Buffy&quot; fans know Whedon's ability to tell a great yarn (I actually saw all of &quot;Firefly&quot; before a single &quot;Buffy&quot; episode), and there were some brilliant ongoing tales in the show.  The plot on River, a super-intelligent teenager who had been cruelly experimented on, is probably the best, and gradually unrolls over the 13-episode run, showing not only the impact of what had been done to her but the love between her and her brother Simon.  There are some great stand alone stories, too, especially &quot;Jaynestown,&quot; a moving meditation on faith and heroism.  The show wrapped up without leaving too many hanging threads, but the ones that remained (including the relationship between Reynolds and the prostitute Inara) were enough to make you wish the show had continued.4) The likelihood of a &quot;Firefly&quot; movie will increase exponentially if you buy this DVD (the studio is keeping an eye on sales of this set).

Somehow it weaves the genres of western and science fiction to create the most compelling story line i have seen on television.  I wish I heard of this show earlier, maybe while it was actually on television.  Fox brought back The Family Guy after it did well from DVD sales and also viewership on The Cartoon Network, perhaps if sales of Firefly do well and it gets syndication on some cable network, such as The SciFi channel, then it too can be brought back on some network.	5.0	A great show whose time was cut short	2004-09-20	4	4	0

It has great characters and conflict, and the story world is compelling: A band of people surviving by taking mostly-illegal work, and staying on the fringes of civilization to avoid authorities.The glaring fatal flaw can be seen right in the (original) pilot episode: The Serenity crew are going to meet someone (Patience) to make a deal, so they fly several light-years, park their space-ship, WALK through a desert for several miles, the other group shows up on HORSEBACK, and an old-west shootout ensues. Utterly ridiculous. This scene should have been two ships docking in orbit, or sneaking into some futuristic ""neutral territory"" to work the deal. The injection of actual old-west settings makes no sense (horses, sweat-stained bandanas, bandoliers draped across the chest, revolver-looking guns, sacks of coins being tossed back and forth). If the writers wanted the ""frontier spirit,"" they could have shown this in futuristic settings. In fact, they already did for the first hour of the pilot, and it was going fine.I couldn't even watch the second episode more than 10 minutes. It's an old-west train robbery, but on a high-speed train. Ugh. More recycled Western stuff? I had to turn it off. And I was actually liking the characters at that point.

They banished this show to the Friday evening basement, changed its timeslot three times, presented the episodes out of order and didn't even air the pilot which introduces all of the great characters!This show is far above anything we've seen in science-fiction TV (or regular dramatic TV, for that matter) in decades.  You don't have to be a fan of science-fiction, fantasy, or westerns to love this show.  It's rare to care about characters in science-fiction and fantasy TV shows because there's a certain level of believability that has to be suspended.  But this show has such a great, attractive cast of real humans ( without the usual hackneyed alien makeup!) who speak dialogue so crisp and funny, and who work so well together that you are captivated by them from the start.I could go on and on about the terrific special effects and the compelling storylines, but all I can really say is get this box set.

For TNG, DS9, or VOY fans, I would highly recommend Firefly. It's a nice contrast from the Star Trek realm.

By the time I got to the 3rd disk I was enraged at how STUPID the network was that let this go.  Trust me- if you have never seen Firefly, even if you aren't a Sci-Fi fan (both of which qualify me to write this) you will LOVE this show. Every episode was like a mini-movie and the characters were beyond description. The stories are as well written as novels and the special effects were better than anything you see on TV today- but without a doubt, it's the characters.Whereas most TV shows put cliche' characters in 'pounded-to-death' situations, these guys played these roles as if they were the first EVER to pull it off. The 'rouge pilot on the run' the 'cute girl mechanic' the 'out for himself soldier'- all these cliche's are done just PERFECTLY!! You will watch these all too short 14 episodes over and over and over again. It's worth twice the asking price and you'd still love to pay for it once you traveled aboard the Firefly.	5.0	Firefly was just too good for TV. That's my story...	2004-04-06	14	14	0

The brave dashing Captain that would sacrifice everything he/she believes in for the greater good.

Even knowing that, I would recommend this to anyone every day of the week.

(No offense to you retards out there)The story of Firefly flows along throughout the series. Bits and pieces are picked up and explained in different episodes.There is rarely a quick, cut and dry answer to the problems the crew faces. Which, gives the show a more real, grounded feeling than the usual ""episode problem"" + 40 minutes of FX, bad dialogue, cardboard characters = resolution, move to next episode we are used to.I could go on and on but, the bottom line is this show is worth your time and money.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ERZIZ48CBCSB	Charismatic Creature	In all fairness, I only caught one episode of FIREFLY (&quot;Shindig&quot;)before Fox yanked it. So I am giving it two stars to be fair. I will also make an sincere attempt to rent the video set and watch the whole thing. I have to admit that in my one-episode view, I was very put off by the whole Wild West thing -- in my humble opinion, when a futuristic sci fi series utilizes 19th century costumes, it isn't some act of great cleverness...it's because it is far cheaperto dip into the movie studio's big archives of western clothing from various cowboy series of the past than it is to come up with neat, interesting futuristic costumes (and requires far less imagination).I have to mention, also, because I just read all 158 reviews here on Amazon, and not a single one of mostly enthusiastic supporters managed to say: This is basically a re-do of Joss Whedon's &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; plot minus, of course, the copyrighted Aliens. Honest.I always thought that &quot;Alien Resurrection's&quot; crew of the freighter &quot;The Betty&quot; had some kind of backstory that never made it to the screen. Unfortunately due to the demands of the Alien franchise, half of the Betty crew gets eaten...and early on. I think Whedon always wanted to develop this idea, and &quot;Firefly&quot; was his big chance.Don't believe me? Re-rent &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The Betty is also a small, dirty unregistered freighter running slightly illegal operations, occasionally smuggling or doing mercenary work in a ragtag universe. Just like FIrefly, aside from the famous &quot;Aliens&quot; (who are unknown to most of humanity) there are no other extra terrestrials (ala Star Trek) in this universe. Despite being set 500 years in the future (just like Firefly), the sci-fi setting looks contemporary and industrial...no fancy high tech anything. And it's very dirty. The Betty originally had a crew of 8 (cut down in the final shooting script to just six) and the Serenity has a crew of 9.The Betty captain is crude mouthed, morally ambivalent but is basically a decent guy, who thinks of the crew as a kind of family -- he calls the ship the &quot;family wagon&quot; and its constantly out of food or supplies. While he isn't exactly married, he is clearly in a long-term romantic relationship with the ship's pilot. The ship's mechanic is a fiesty, cute young girl, just out of her teens. There a &quot;muscle man&quot;, who is big and burly but a nice guy underneath it all. The ship's female pilot and second-in-command is a tough cookie who is just as smart and strong as the guys.I can only guess that this is an idea Whedon just can't get out of his system...he was reportedly VERY unhappy with the final shooting script and production of &quot;Resurrection&quot;, as were most hardcore Alien fans. Maybe it would have worked a whole lot better to have started &quot;Firefly&quot;  off as a movie, maybe on the Sci Fi network if not big screen, and THEN spun off a series... .when there was a measurable fan base. Cuz THIS method sure didn't work.Clearly everything to do with the advertising/promotion and the scheduling of Firefly was blown, big time. I am generally a sci fi fan, and would have given it a chance, but the reviews were very damning and the whole western thing really put me off. It will be interesting to see what kind of movie Joss Whedon comes up with out of the flotsam and jetsam that is left...for example, will he shoot the movie with the same cast as the TV series?Not really a good or bad review here....I just think that fans and even non-fans ought to know what the back story is.	2.0	People -- have you never watched &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;?	2003-12-06	244	39	205

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FM8XXAZHRL8Y	Charles Feduke	I'm not sure how I missed this series when it originally aired on Fox.  Firefly is by far the best science fiction series I have seen.  I've never liked Star Trek and saw through Star Wars as a giant marketing platform.  Firefly is something entirely different.  There is originality here; its not the cookie cutter outer space science fiction bred in the 70s.  This is a series that I think anyone who likes action, in depth characters, superb acting, and good special effects would thoroughly enjoy.	5.0	Best series... ever!	2005-09-08	8	8	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AEVNUEDRGTC4P	Charles J. Rector	"Firefly was hands down the single best TV show of this decade thus far.  The movie version ""Serenity"" was good, but the TV show is much better.  Hopefully, the rumors of a new season of Firefly being produced for distribution on DVD turn out to be true.Firefly displayed great humor, well written dialog and there was excellent chemistry among the crew.  The scenes  around the dinner table were truly wonderful.Firefly was conceived as a ""space western.""  It does invoke the concept of space as the final frontier as well as the original ""Star Trek"" and Firefly was far superior to any of the latter Star Trek series.Firefly is a great science fiction show full of that sense of wonder for which that you read/watch SF in the first place."	5.0	Magnificent SF Series	2005-10-19	12	11	1

One of the biggest mistakes ever made in television! If you ever see a list of shows that were cancelled way too early, this show is either at or near the top.Joss Whedon, the writers, directors, producers, and of course the cast came together brilliantly to bring Firefly to the screen. This is one of those Kismet moments in television. Intense action combined with well written stories and dialogue grab the viewer by the adrenal glands, the funny bone, and the heart. As different as the world of Firefly is, it retains enough of the link to our world that you can really relate and come to care about the characters.Buy this series! Plain and simple, it is a piece of television history that you want to have in your collection.	5.0	"At the top of every ""Shouldn't have been cancelled"" list!!!"	2009-02-24	1	1	0

Character driven in an interesting &#34;'verse&#34; where high tech, modern and old-West meat and mix with some Chinese influence. May sound strange, but they made it work beautifully. Spaceships don't battle here, but gunfights happen and there's even a classic &#34;train job&#34;. Does have a slightly darker side that lends realism to the often light-hearted dialog.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT	Charlie Brooks	Firefly is a unique science fiction series that got canceled thanks to some historical incompetence by the executives at Fox. With interesting characters, a compelling setting, and generally good storytelling, the series showed all the potential in the world before getting pulled off the air.The series follows the adventures of Mal Reynolds and his misfit crew aboard the smuggling ship Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship that travels an area known as the Black. The setting focuses around the premise that in the far future an American-Chinese alliance has begun settling a distant section of the universe. The Alliance itself is tyrannical, causing the audience to sympathize with Mal and his lowly band of theives as they try to cling onto whatever freedom they can find.Firefly is blessed with a terrific cast of actors. Nathan Fillion carries the show as Mal, and is helped by steller performances from Adam Baldwin as the thuggish gunman Jane, Alan Tudyk as the wise-cracking pilot Wash, and many others. The actors fall in their characters terrifically, pushing the show along even in the rare moment of mediocrity.While the series' creator Joss Whedon is talented, he is not infalliable, and there are a few flaws in the show. Some of the episodes get heavy-handed in either image or message, and the old-fashioned dialogue sometimes doesn't convey quite what it should. Whedon's biggest problem seems to be writing female characters, who always seem to fall into one of four categories: the overly cheerful helper, the abrasive wise woman, the butch combat fiend, or the crazy woman with super powers. Those categories aptly describe not only the women aboard Serenity but all the women in this or any other series done by Whedon. Thankfully, the actors again manage to carry the show along and mask its weak spots well.Despite a few minor flaws, Firefly is a terrific television series that should not have been pulled from the air when it was. Had it not been for some bungling by Fox, this series would likely still be on the air and on its way to becoming a science fiction classic rather than one of Fox's best-kept secrets.	4.0	Canceled before its time	2009-01-23	1	1	0

Absolutely nothing...but I feel compelled to chime in anyway :)Unlike many, it took me a little longer to fall in love with Firefly and to truly 'get' what all the fuss was about. I'm mentioning that in case someone else reading this was relatively underwhelmed initially but willing to give the show a second chance. The series might just not be your cup of TV tea, of course...but you might, as I did, find that a second or even third viewing hooks you for the remainder of your TV-viewing life :)The show is a space western, and generally combines traditional elements of both genres in creative, engaging ways. As always while viewing Whedon shows, there are a couple of characters who didn't quite resonate with me---but it ceased to matter, as other characters rose quickly to the very top of my personal ""all-time favorites"" list. The dialogue took a little bit of getting used to for me---after all, it's not every day that one hears a blend of Queen's English, Old West slang and the occasional Chinese phrase ;) (Rest assured that the inclusion of Chinese phrases makes perfect sense in the context of the show's background mythology, so it's not nearly as random as it sounds!) Once my ears and I got used to it, though, I became totally enamored with the dialogue and many of the clever, witty, hopeful and thought-provoking quotes that are now happily lodged in my memory.Firefly is brimming over with humor, drama, action, mystery, and even a little romance. It's a true pleasure to look at and listen to. The thing that makes it unique for me is that it can be enjoyed as both a comedic, high energy thrill ride AND a more sneakily deep, intriguingly philosophical sci-fi drama. The cast seems to genuinely love the show, the fans and one another like none other I've come across.As I'm typing this review, this set is on sale for a comparatively inexpensive $9.99. (I spent three times that amount...but still somehow feel it was worth it!) If you're on the fence, this may be the perfect time to hit that tempting orange 'buy' button. I can honestly say that these DVDs have---and will always---get more use than nearly any other in my collection! Happy holidays---and happy viewing :)"	5.0	Firefly	2013-12-29	0	0	0

Everything comes together so perfectly and that is rare on TV today.  I recently had a chance to watch this show on Hulu and was immediately drawn in. Compared to all the garbage on TV today this was a gem.  I don't watch TV much anymore...most of the programming is so very bad.

She can't wait to watch it with me at night.I can't believe this show was cancelled. I hope it lives on in some form or another.Two years later: I now watch the whole series every six months or so. It's still the best TV (no longer) on TV. I'd even go so far as to say it's on par with the best video entertainment ever. The cast is perfect, the sets are beautiful, and the writing is phenomenal.

Like what I can only assume is more than a few current fans, I became aware of Firefly/Serenity after having seen the movie, knowing nearly nothing about the television series.The most poignant thing about the Firefly sensation for me is the sadness (yeah, sadness about a canceled television show...crazy i know) that I feel when I think about how much more it could have been, had it not been cut so incredibly short.  Within not even one complete season's worth of episodes, this program captured my attention, heart, and mind in a way that no show every really had (or has since, really).  That's special folks, and I'm obliged to know that so many other people have been as taken in by Joss' and the crews' moment in the sun as I.If you haven't seen this, you NEED to.  You need to see it, you need to talk about it, you need to keep it alive.  Even though every day that goes by might be one day closer to the realization that we may never see anything new for Serenity and her crew, deep in my heart I'll never completely give up hope that we'll see them again, in something new and amazing.*Laughs* All this emotion over a T.V show...it MUST be something special and you owe it to yourself to experience it for yourself.	5.0	Touching, compelling, addictive.	2008-01-26	4	4	0

It still managed to accumulate quite a following, but apparently not as well as FOX would have liked, so they cancelled it about half way through the season.  This DVD is to hold the 3 unaired episodes.Joss Whedon's vision of the future.

For whatever reason this particular cast and story line, struck a chord with me that has me wondering who did the marketing.  A moron?  I had no idea this was on TV.  I saw the movie Serenity and thought that was it.  Talk about bad marketing.  A person that loves SF and isn't even aware of a really great production.  I had to find out about it myself.  If you own Serenity buy this now.  Every episode is just as good.  Same cast and excellent writing.  Did I mention excellent writing?500 years in the future we have terraformed ""dozens of planets and hundreds of moons"" with the central planets forming the ""Alliance"" and the outer planets the ""Independents"".  Science and technology is advanced on the central planets however on the outer planets things are not so easy.  Imagine how would you and your best 1000 friends survive after being dropped off on an unpopulated planet.  Without any real support.  Better have a gun. :)  Imagine a wild west mentality and settings with a wide range of technology and enough ""differences"" to make you belive this really is the future.  Definitely not Star Trek technology nor philosopy.  Pretty much everybody is ""really bad"", ""bad"" or ""not so bad"" and I mean pretty much everybody.If you watched Serenity more than a few times you won't be disappointed with Firefly.

The story is smart, fast-paced and the acting and dialog and timing are top-notch.  The series is very wittily and funny without every resorting to cheap laughs.  I've never seen any cast of characters that immediately had SO much chemistry together; usually that takes a couple seasons, an opportunity Firefly never had due to the not so brilliant people at Fox.	5.0	Brilliant and WAY ahead of its time.	2010-06-07	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ACJ0LIFSX3M41	"Chris Shapcott ""cds7"""	If you haven't bought this DVD set yet, then stop what you are doing and order right now.  You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy Firefly, and you certainly don't have to be a western type either. Those genres are just the thin and subtle dressing.  It's not about ray guns or ten gallon hats.  Nor is it about conflict with weird aliens, or bringing the outlaws to justice.  No, Firefly is far above that, and only uses sci-fi and western aspects to flavour its stories, not be pawns of them.  The true centrepiece and focus of the show is its great collection of characters, and the cast that live them. These guys are shiny !  What they're doing, why they are doing it, and how Joss Whedon and crew deliver it in a unique perspective is what will draw you in.  Where other shows will work hard to keep within the formula, Firefly works hard to get out of the formula.  Refreshing. Situations will happen in the Firefly stories where you think you know what is going to happen next, because all the formulaic shows that you watched up to now taught you that is how the formula goes, and thus, this is how the story should go.  This is likely the exact point where you are reminded that this is Firefly, and things work to make the story and characters interesting, not to follow a formula.Because of Firefly's direction to try and be original, I think it may have been a part of what caused some people to not 'get it' when it was originally aired on TV.  That element, and the back story pilot not being aired, combined to make it very disorienting for the first time viewer. Thankfully, that can't happen on the DVD due to the episodes being organized in the order they should have been viewed.What are you are waiting for ?

Nathan Fillion was Mal, that role was made for him. I can understand why he was heartbroken when the series was cancelled.

I'm  certain that word of mouth will boost sales of the DVD set far beyond expectations.  The characters are three dimensional, quirky and likeable.  Current sci-fi shows like Enterprise or Andromeda constantly leave you wondering why you should care about the characters.  Firefly's pilot episode, &quot;Serenity&quot;, ensnared me with  wounded Kaylee, disturbed River and what's with Captain Malcolm and the companion Inara?  It's worth watching.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A96J117ZUSUZ6	Christopher Collins	"I don't have too much to add to the more than a thousand wildly and accuratly positive reviews of this remarkable achievement called Firefly, but will try anyway!Every single one of these episodes is brilliant as a standalone story.  Unlike, say, Season 4 of Joss Whedon's ""Angel"", a viewer can watch ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"", ""The Message"", ""The Train Job"", ""War Stories"", ""Out of Gas"", and all the others and have a richly beautiful TV viewing experience.  However, stitch them together in proper sequence (as FOX did not, damn their eyes) and you're in for the ride of a lifetime.Which comes to a thudding halt after the superb ""Objects in Space.""  Like the proverbial vaudeville comedians, Joss Whedon left viewers thirsting for more.  Thankfully, and in large part due to the remarkable sales of this beautifully done DVD set, there is more, in the form of a major movie, ""Serenity"", to be released in September.  (I've been to two pre-screenings of it and can attest to its own brilliance, by the way.)  The movie is not enough: I want more TV episodes!  I realize it's unlikely that this will happen, but I can dream, can't I?  Firefly should never have died in the first place.Every character in Firefly is richly drawn and beautifully acted.  Each has interaction with all the other eight (and doing this believably in an ensemble cast is no mean feat) that enriches the already fascinating stories.  Yes, some of them are instantly familiar as western tales retold, but there's a lot of fun in seeing the captain of Serenity crossing a river disguised as a frontier bride...and the hooker with a heart of gold gets an entire new twist...and the Robin Hood legend gets its own brand new treatment...and on and on and on.The writing is crisp, crackling, and very, very often laugh out loud hysterical.  When truly serious and scary stuff happens, as it often does, the viewer is totally drawn in and captivated.  The sense of honor and loyalty, among thieves, remember, is completely credible, if sometimes bewildering.  And the use of various storytelling techniques (dramatic juxtaposition, flashbacks, etc.) is entirely masterful.In short, if you simply like excellence in your TV viewing, I can think of nothing better than Firefly.  I have bought at least a dozen copies of this DVD set to lend and/or give to friends whom I believed would enjoy and cherish as much as I do, and nobody's disappointed me yet.

With the popularity lag that occurs in todays entertainment cycle, the networks aren't waiting long enough to determine what is being appreciated verses what isn't.  As a result many good shows are being cancelled before MOST people are even aware of them.  THIS show is golden.  So much so that the fans actually brought it back from the dead with a fan based temporary reboot:  The result of which is the film &#34;Serenity&#34;, which was as fantastic as the series.  This is well worth a space on your home library shelf as a &#34;keeper&#34;.	5.0	Some of the most innovative science fiction writing ever offered.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AMBD7H16O0BS6	Christopher D. Jacobson	"Before buying the Blu-ray set of this series, I had read some negative reviews on Amazon (as well as some positive ones). I'd never seen the show before picking up this set, although my brother owns the DVDs. Comparing the two, the Blu-ray set is greatly improved over the standard definition set.Detail is generally real high with a lot of appropriate and natural film grain. The series was shot on 35mm film, so I'd expect it to have a filmic appearance. In this regard, it does not disappoint.CGI effects shots don't look as good, as I suspect due to the age of the show that they were done in a much lower resolution and then upscaled for HD. They don't look great, but they don't hamper the enjoyment either. The only way to make them look any better would be to redo them, and I doubt Fox cares enough to put money toward such an endeavor.If you have the DVD set but like hi-def detail and film-like quality, I'd say it's worth the upgrade. It definitely won't disappoint.The show itself? I'm only four episodes in, but I'm enjoying it immensely! I dig westerns and I dig sci-fi. Or rather, I should say I dig ""alternative"" sci-fi. What the hell that means, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll take a show like ""Farscape"" over a staple like ""Star Trek"" any day."	5.0	Blu-ray massive improvement	2011-03-04	3	3	0

Sakal	It's hard to say what Firefly would have become had it not been cancelled after it's first season, but it had the makings of the best show I've seen in quite a while.  It's just one of those gems that all too seldom make it to you TV screen, a well-written series in a well-crafted world full of interesting characters who you actually care about and enough material in their histories alone to have kept the series running for years without getting old.  It's a shame that a combination of expensive sets and high production values combined with poor ratings doomed it, but I would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan on the sci-fi genre (and many who are not) to pick up what few episodes were made.	5.0	Great show, cancelled too early	2003-11-26	7	6	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38C12950IM24P	Christopher J. Cowen	Firefly is a great show that I knew nothing about before I saw it.  I remembered watching this show and saying to myself wow this show is great how come its not a bigger hit.  Firefly comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, who is the mastermind behind Marvels &#34;The Avengers&#34;, Dollhouse, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The show features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.  The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a &#34;Firefly-class&#34; spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity.  Whedon pitched the show as &#34;nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things&#34;.The show explores the lives of a group of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the outskirts of society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures.  The show has a great cast and writing is also great, which is to be expected from a Joss Whedon movie. The visual effect are first class and the show in my opinion is great from beginning to end. Once you see this show you will be a big fan and want to watch all of Joss's other projects. I enjoyed this show and I would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review.	5.0	Firefly is one of the best shows to ever be on TV	2013-12-31	0	0	0

Fireflywas the exception, with great dialogue, characters, interaction and a healthy dash of humor, it moved into something you don't normally get on a TV shows budget. As it was very character driven, it take 2 or 3 episodes to &#34;get it&#34;. It is very regretable it never made it past one season, as the universe created was engaging and much more believable than many other sci-fi flicks.	5.0	Great screenwriting	2014-01-16	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3TTKMUH9REXNH	"Christopher Perry ""Azazel2099"""	"Firefly is a geat show. 1st the characters/actors are awesome. Each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television/movie. Nathon Fillion is the main character he is currently on the show Castle. Kalee, Jewel Staite, was also on the show Stargate Atlantis for a awhile. Also, lets not forget Joss Whedon himself, if you liked the new Avenger's movie then you should like this show for they are both his work. My point is the cast is strong, so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded. As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a ""HUGE"" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called ""Serenity"" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery."	5.0	Joss Whedon's best work!	2012-06-10	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A26SSGMGT1X246	"Christopher Quinn ""cQ"""	"In 2002, when Fox was busy mishandling then cancelling prematurely this wonderful series, 'Firefly,' my family and I were utterly unaware of the show's existence. Then again, how could we have been? Fox is not exactly known for its great programming, and 'Firefly' only lasted 11 episodes (14 were shot but only 11 aired). Further, the two-hour first episode was not aired first, but last.It was not until this year (2005), while we were at a local library (we visit at least once per week), that we chanced upon DVDs of the series. On a whim, and because we love science fiction and fantasy and comedy and history (pretty much in that order), we took the two DVDs (there are four) the library had home with us and found ourselves immediately hooked.We watched those episodes repeatedly. And then we bought the whole (if abbreviated) series from Amazon.com.I mean, we loved it so much we just could not bear to be without it!We learned to loathe Fox for mishandling and cancelling this series.When the film, 'Serenity' (the name of the spaceship in the 'Firefly' television series)  came out, we bought the tickets immediately and were there for the very first showing. And we LOVED it!Afterward, we hounded imDB.com to see how the film was doing at the boxoffice; because we knew the only chance for us to get any more 'Firefly'/'Serenity' was if the film did well.'Serenity' made it to number 2 in the US market in its first week but fell from the top 10 thereafter (probably because familiarity with the series is necessary to fully appreciate the film). But (after several weeks) it is still number 1 in Great Britain (which only goes to show that they have better taste there than we do here)!My children are now ""Browncoats"" (an online 'Firefly'/'Serenity' fan membership group) and are avid fans (as are my wife and I). And we all boycott Fox (except any good sci fi shows they might program someday) and all ""reality tv"" and the usual garbage (especially anything with Hip-Hop in it) programming.Needless to say, when the film, 'Serenity', makes it to DVD, we will order our copy from Amazon.com without a moment's hesitation. (But we are hoping that the foreign market keeps buying tickets and thus postponing the film's DVD release.)It is hard to believe that we would like a television series better than Farscape and Babylon 5; but, fact is, we just cannot get our fill of 'Firefly'/'Serenity.' The idea that there may not ever be any more episodes or film releases is almost unbearable, especially for my children.Here is hoping that Joss Whedon (the writer/director) continues to be driven to make more 'Firefly'/'Serenity' and the avid fan base grows enough, and ticket and DVD sales do well enough, to attract the financing to make more. And here is hoping that he can keep most of that wonderful cast together somehow.If not, it would be a shame.Happily, my children are all exceedingly creative and gifted; so, what with their music, art, writing, animation, and fledgling filming, I suspect that the future may have even better experiences in store for those lucky enough to live there."	5.0	May we have more, please?!	2005-10-24	0	0	0

It's fantastic, you should buy it.However, I've also seen the movie based on the series at a preview screening.  And I have to say...the movie's wonderful.  If you like the series, you'll like the movie.  It has heart, humor, sadness, and action--lot's of action.  So if you buy the DVD and you love the series, go see the movie.  If enough people see the movie, then Universal will make two more.  They might even bring back the TV series.So if you want to see good television, buy the Firefly DVD.  If you want to see a good movie, watch Serenity.  It comes out on September 30, 2005.  Mark your calendar, maybe tape it to your dog.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NP91R1CRPNQX	"Christopher R. Travers ""Einhverfr"""	"I very much enjoyed this series.  The basic premise is that of a dystopian Western in Space, where a totalitarian government has an iron grip on the most developed planets, and the less developed are left to fend for themselves.  These outer worlds are relatively undeveloped and most of the technology seems like a mix of 19th-20th century, and near future technology.  This is a series where horse-riding cowboys with assault rifles and space ships are found in close proximity.  One eventually gets a sense that the disparity of wealth is what's responsible for this.On the outer fringes, however, you see the dreaded Reavers, insane former humans who mutilate themselves and feast on human flesh, chasing anything that runs from them.So, caught between these forces is the crew from the Firefly, captained by a former resistance officer in a previous war against the totalitarian Alliance, and manned with a colorful bunch.  Several of the characters are enigmas slowly being unravelled.The series of course takes some getting used to.  This is not like other great Sci-Fi series.  It's easy to see a couple of episodes and give up on the whole thing.  Moreover the level of sex and violence in the movie is much higher than it is in other series I typically watch (B5, etc), and the violence is often more brutal.  I would not recommend this for family viewing.Unfortunately this series was cancelled after its first season, so the viewer is left with a sense that the author was just showing the pieces.  One wonders what would have been shown about River, Book, the ""hands of blue"" folks or the like.  This is really too bad."	4.0	Something different but not for the kids	2010-12-16	1	1	0

I am forced to try a different tactic. Say it with me: EYE CANDY GALORE! Joss Whedon has a knack for putting together casts that are so pretty it makes my eyes hurt. The women are all stunningly beautiful, from the delicately lovely Summer Glau and Morena Baccarin, the adorable Jewel Staite, to the Amazon goddess that is Gina Torres. Adam Baldwin is twice my age, but I still swoon and get all flustered everytime he's onscreen as Jayne, the ""man ape gone wrong"". Nathan Fillion is all sorts of sexy and alluring as the captain Mal Reynolds and Sean Maher is just way prettier than any girl I know. And Alan Tudyk, way more attractive than most people give him credit for and just as funny. Plus, all these pretty people wielding guns and getting into fights and narrowly escaping death. Who would NOT want to see that?Okay seriously, not only are they pretty, they are some of the most talented actors working today. The writing on ""Firefly"" is impeccable (""JOSS IS BOSS""), but the characters are what really make the show for me. The actors' portrayals are spot on and somehow, within a very limited amount of time, you get sucked into this universe, and want to spend more time with these people who seem so real and appealing and yes I have a life. The show is just that much wittier, funnier, and more involving than anything on TV today. Give  ""Firefly"" a chance and by ""Ariel"" (That was when the show changed from good to amazing for me), you too will be in my shoes, begging all your friends and random strangers to ""Please just watch one episode of the best show ever."""	5.0	Best TV series ever...so of course they promptly cancel it.	2006-01-07	9	9	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38TX5QP70R95Y	Cici	I don't usually review DVD's but I felt the need to write something down for this series.  I had heard so many things about Firefly for years and years from various Sci-Fi fanatics like myself.  I held off on buying it because I had so many other things to catch up on.  When I saw Science channel was having a reunion special in November I decided it was about time to get it and see what all the fuss was about.  Dear lord all I can think about for the last 2 months has been Firefly and Serenity.  I can finally see what an injustice was done to this incredible series.  I had been a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel and just had no idea what took me so long to watch this but I am just so glad that I have jumped on the bandwagon and have become a true browncoat.  For anyone who doesn't like science fiction then this is the perfect series for you.  While the majority of the series takes place on a  spaceship  the heart and soul is in the characters.  A perfect character study of a diverse but equally interesting group thrown together to form a family. In space.	5.0	The Service was great	2012-12-17	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AR3XGGCFLHQY3	"""cihea"""	THIS DVD IS WORTH YOUR MONEY.This collection of episodes represents some of the finest work done in the science-fiction genre in years; the combination of sci-fi, western, and oriental influences meshes in a quirky way that WORKS.  The dialogue is smart; the acting is top-notch.  The stories are well written and well filmed; the effects are mind-blowing (and Emmy winning).It's a shame that Fox TV made such a mistake with their handling of this series; they aired episodes out of order, didn't even show the pilot until the show had been cancelled, marketed it poorly, and gave it a lousy time-slot.  Fortunately, this DVD set remedies some of those problems; watching the episodes in order is a joy.  The pilot episode, &quot;Serenity,&quot; is better than most sci-fi movies that have made theaters.Enjoy the pilot as a great movie, and then start with the regular episodes.  Give the series a little time to sink in.  You'll be hooked by the 2nd or 3rd episode.  It takes that long to really get into the universe enough to turn into a true fan.	5.0	Whedon's Masterpiece, Fox's Blunder	2004-02-05	9	9	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A13LPSOCJXV7UM	"Cindy ""bookworm extrordinaire/ pop culture ju..."	"In the past, I was somewhat interested in this show, but I didn't really get into it until a close friend of mine bought on dvd and had a bunch of us watch it. And then I was hooked. This has to be one of the best shows ever. First of all, the characters are great. You have to love them all. The Tams are my favorites, hands down. But even the characters that appear less lovable, such as Jayne, have moments when you can't help but love them. Who can forget when Jayne got the letter and hat from his mother in The Message. Or when he... no wait. That would be a spoiler ^^ Anyway, moving on. The show also has great writing. It can be histerical at times, and extremely deep at others. To give an example of both, in Jaynestown Book walks in on River ""fixing"" his Bible. ""Bible's broken. Contridictions, false logistics... Noah's Ark is a problem. We'll have to call it early quantum state phenominon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat,"" she say. Well, that may not be verbatim, but close enough. Another thing that is great about Firefly is that it creates a world that is completely believeable. It doesn't have technology that seems completely farfetched. They may be flying around on a spaceship, but that spaceship is literally a piece of junk. They love it anyway. It's kind of like how some people have cars that are on the verge of breaking down, but they don't replace it. Does that analogy work?Anyway, this show is simply amazing. I suggest that you give it a try.(by the way... watch more than just the first episode. while it does have some classic moments and gives you that background story, it's not one of my favorites. i still love it though ^^ just not as much as the others)"	5.0	Light it	2006-01-03	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1E0PMNE8N7DTG	Cionnaith	I had never heard of this show until it showed up as a suggestion on Amazon Prime.  I read a few reviews and saw that it was a precursor series to the movie &#34;Serenity.&#34;  I did see that movie and really enjoyed it.  After watching about half of the episodes I am just blown away by how wonderful this series is.  I am quite sad that there is only one season.  While a part of me cannot understand why it was cancelled, another part understands more clearly.  Mainstream television viewers are not interested in a show of this quality.  It has too many elements that poor imaginations cannot wrap around...and poor imaginations are a plenty in the living rooms of America.  People dressed like cowboys flying around in spaceships?  We all know that, in the future, we will all be wearing tight fitting uniforms issued by the interstellar government.  Everything will be clean and shiny.  There will be a problem and our heroes will solve it using nothing but intellect.  We can't possibly be so base, in the future, as to punch people out in a matter of principle.Firefly is a refreshing, imaginative look at the future.  The characters are complex and flawed.  The spaceship is dirty.  It is gritty and realistic, which makes the characters and the worlds encountered much more believable and accessible.  I would trade just about everything on television these days, especially all of the &#34;un&#34;reality shows for more seasons of Firefly.  It makes me sad that, just when something truly entertaining comes along, it is tossed in the garbage heap in favor of another police drama or reality show about idiots running around a swamp somewhere carrying guns.Well, at least I found this absolute gem of a show and had one fantastic season to watch.  Hopefully, someone will come along and try to bring it back to life...it's been done with much lesser shows!	5.0	What an Outstanding Show!	2014-05-01	0	0	0

The filming was good quality and I loved the theme music (""you can't take the sky from me"").  It wasn't until about halfway though the season that I realized what was bothering me.  The dialogue felt scripted and flat.  The characters were speaking but it felt like they were just reading off lines.  The characters themselves felt flat.  It was like the writers were desperately trying to make three-dimensional characters by adding in generic backgrounds: war trauma, prostitute, preacher, etc.  The whole makeup of the team felt forced and unrealistic.  The preacher's inclusion in the team was especially irking because I can just imagine the writers in a planning meeting and one saying that they need a religious element for balance and the guy next to him says 'okay, let's add a preacher and while were at it we need family drama so let's get a brother & sister.""

Let's give me credit for finally seeing a true gem for what it is: proof that television doesn't have to be banal, can include new ideas, well rounded characters who actual evolve, stirring action sequences, a show that would be classified as comedy due to the stunning array of one liners and humor if so very much other stuff wasn't going on.  A recent sojurn to a Sf/F convention showed large numbers of fans in typical SF/F fashion costumed as characters buying tons of fan related items.  In typical Firefly/Serenity fashion though, these fans were also working on charity drives to assist others.  How many movies or TV shows evolve to this extent?  My suggestion is to go ahead and buy the movie along with the boxed set of the TV show at the same time, you'll want it because you will hate this 'Verse to end.  And buy an extra set, at some point you'll be compelled to share the show with others and you won't want to give up yours on the off chance it won't come back to you.	5.0	Firefly/Serenity still flying in 2006	2006-09-14	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PT9FCRUNT7NW	C Logan	"I became a fan of Joss Whedon.  His sci-fi/western gem, ""Firefly"" is the main reason.  Each of his stories, by turns funny and exciting, immersed me in a world of fantasy at the end of which left me wanting to hear the next tale.  The characters, and their colorful language, the intermixing of English and Mandarin just made it that much better.  When the show was canceled, long before its time I believe, I was pretty disappointed.  But that is all in the past. All we can do now, is purchase collections of the complete series, such as this one.This three disc Blu-Ray collection of the entire fourteen series episodes of Firefly includes some deleted scenes, outtakes, interviews with the creators, producers, writers and actors, gag reels, and some great behind-the-scenes featurettes. There is even some footage of the actors from when they attended a Comic Con event.  Of course each episode can be played from beginning to end, but you can also skip to those never-to-be-forgotten scenes you remember fondly. I found the on-screen controls a tiny bit cumbersome to navigate, but that may have been due to all that beer I had been drinking at the time.Nevertheless, this is a collection well worth having.

If you haven't already - get the box set, another for yourself, for your friends, family, coworkers, strangers on the street, etc. Spread the word - Firefly ROCKS!	5.0	Wow, this is unbelievable!	2005-06-19	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A268LFU34FE1JD	Clucking Bell	"...pulled the plug on the best drama it had.I am one of the apparently few who saw ""Firefly"" when it was on TV two years ago. Unfortunately, I had a hard time at first remembering when it was on (Friday nights) and when I did remember to watch I often felt like I'd missed something important -- continuity, as it turned out. Fox didn't air the episodes in their intended order.Recently, after realizing just how little there was worth watching on TV, I'd been thinking more and more about the series. After reading the reviews here, I got the DVD set and watched all 14 episodes in three days (I probably could have done it in one day, but I have both work and school to contend with). Seeing all the episodes, and in the correct order, it became painfully clear how good this show was, how great it was destined to be, and what a terrible loss it was when Fox canceled it.While it is kind of a sci-fi western, the fact is ""Firefly"" transcends genres. This show is clever, exciting, and hilarious. It mixes the profound with grit and humor. In a single episode, I may be muting the sound and turning on subtitles so I don't spill my popcorn when the big scary happens, and then I'm doubled over laughing and backing up to watch a scene over again, repeating the funniest lines aloud (it's okay, I only do that when I'm alone). Then I'm rubbing my hands together in an ""I love it when a plan comes together"" manner as I begin to see how the episode is going to resolve itself.Also, I think the casts on shows like this never get enough credit. They have to jump nimbly between drama, suspense, and action and still be able to nail their comedic timing. ""Firefly"" has a great ensemble that handles these leaps effortlessly and brings emotional and whimsical depth and nuance to the characters.The DVD release has some nice extras, including a gag reel (brief and punchy), several episode commentaries (one of which provided my biggest belly-laugh in weeks), interviews with cast and crew, and a nice behind-the-scenes look at Serenity, the Firefly-class spaceship our guys call home. All bonuses -- the episodes alone are well worth the asking price.This series was on its way to amazing places, and cutting it off mid-season (or really, as I see it, at anything less than five seasons) left a lot of stories untold and questions unanswered. Can't believe another network didn't snatch it up. Here's hoping the movie (watch for ""Serenity"" in September 2005) is a brilliant success (I'll be doing my part!) and some other network decides it would make a great series."	5.0	My Big Fat Obnoxious Fox Executive...	2004-11-01	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1562PJULOOK3B	C. M. Schreib	Firefly's accurate description (sci-fi, comedy, adventure, western) hardly does it justice. This series has witty dialogue and great writing. The plot is exceptional, the characters admirable. This is the complete first (and only) season of the wonderful show Firefly. The four-disc set has every aired episode, and a few that were never aired. It also has plenty of special features. It's worth owning to watch again and again. The only problem? When I watched the last episode I knew I'd never again get to see a new one; no more will be made. So cherish the ones available for the masterpieces they are.	5.0	The wonders of Firefly	2006-03-26	15	14	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2MI2P80UQWZ0H	C. Nielsen	I recently purchased this series (having never heard of it before, mind you) after it popped up in my recommendations and got good reviews from viewers.My wife and I were blown away. We watched the &quot;Serenity&quot; episode, then couldn't stop ourselves and watched the next three episodes as well, which led to a very late night. Since then, we've been carefully rationing the remaining episodes and wondering how daily FOX News viewers such as ourselves could be caught unaware of one of the best shows ever aired.It's intelligent, unexpected, humorous, character-driven and imaginative (I know, the death-knell for any network television series). The characters are complex and fully-fleshed. The show may have been too good for network TV, but FOX sure as heck wasn't too good for this show.Despite being nominally a science fiction show, &quot;Firefly&quot; doesn't rely on flashing lights and muppets to give it merit - it relies on top-notch writing and a director who capitalizes on the depth and texture an ensemble cast can bring to a production.Fourteen episodes are too few. I am, however, buoyed by news of work on a movie.	5.0	I can't believe I never heard of this!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-02-18	12	12	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Q9JOBR0I9W9Y	"Cody R. Murray ""You can't take the sky from me"""	For those of you that are familiar with Joss Whedon's style of writing and character creation, then Firefly will be a pleasant continuation of that tradition.  For those of you new to the Whedonverse, be prepared for some great times.  Though Firefly was cancelled after only 11 episodes, the characters and seeds for future stories grew almost instantly.From the first episode you get a sense of the universe these characters reside in.  A future not so different from our present, where finding work, friendship and betrayal are an everyday task.  A brilliant fusion of science fiction and western (these guys ride horses more than one time during the show AND use pistols instead of lasers or phazers or lasers or fazers or whatever), Firefly and the forthcoming film, Serenity, are not to be missed.Hey, it's only 13 episodes or so.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Z1DQVQ4N4YMM	cole	This has to be one of the best shows ever. I never saw it when it ran on Fox(I hadn't even heard about it). I was suffering from Buffy & Angel withdrawals and was looking for ANYTHING by Joss. I saw this -- hmmm -- sci-fi and western? Then I started to read the reviews and decided to buy the thing. Was I ever blow away. I stayed up after 1 am in the morning every night to watch this set. I came home from work and that is all I did -- watch firefly until I had completed it. The cast is superb - glad to see Adam Baldwin again as the funny, not too trustworthy Jayne, Gina Torres as Zoe is wonderful as the strong Amazon woman married to the &quot;semi-large muscular man&quot;, Wash. Ron Glass as Book is great and I wanted to know more about him and why does he know so much about weapons? It had so much promise -- what was Fox thinking of? I hope that executive got canned for losing this show & family guy.I have loaned this out to several friends and they have all converted and are just as confused as I am about the cancellation of this series. I was thrilled to find out that this will be a movie; but I want this back as a TV series, so I can get a weekly fix. Lets hope that a cable channel will pick this up!Love, love, love this series -- the only disappointing thing is that there are no more dvd's to watch once you go thru the 14 eps.	5.0	Firefly rules!	2004-08-02	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2OB2RORA2CQBN	"Colleen ""big reader"""	"I don't watch TV but I do buy TV season series after the DVD hits the stores.  I just happened on this series and only purchased it because of the customer reviews.  I liked it straight out of the gate and loved it by the end of the 1st disk.  I also can't get the Theme song out of my head. When I finished the Last show, I felt bereft there was not another season on the shelf to buy.  So what was the appeal?This show is like our future will, most likely, really be someday.  The crew of Serenity travels the galaxy not unlike Captain Kirk or the crew members of the Star Ship Enterprise but with more realistic and believable exchanges.  No disfigured alien creatures, warp speed or inter-planetary molecular transportation.  No... it's more like getting from California to Boston in a in a 1975 Volvo.  Serenity is an old, but sturdy, (Firefly) cargo vessel manned by a semi-renegade crew.  They must deal with shadey individuals, in order to eke out a living among human civilizations who display varying degrees of social evolution and moral consciousness.  There is a lot of humor but the cast and writers never let you forget the bottom line is survival by what ever means necessary.  The show had the perfect cast, writers, composers and directors. Everyone of the 9 person crew appeals, even the less than stellar character, Jayne (yes it's a boy named Jayne and it suits him perfectly). It got better with every episode.  I would have gone straight to Amazon or BestBuy and bought up every season (after I watched the 1st disk) were there more seasons to buy. I feel kind of like I had one Lays potato chip and some ""Big Bad Meany"" tossed out the rest of my (very fresh) new bag.  I could say a lot of ugly things about the person at FOX who holds the scissors but.... I prefer to think it is some big shot's nephew who secrectly works for their competition.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3PMXI3PUQOB9Y	Commenter	Like so many others, I just came upon this show and sequel movie many years after their release.  I watched the entire series free on hulu, but am still going to buy it because I enjoyed it so much and know I will want to watch it over and over - and because I want to support the show.  I realize I'm about the 3000th person to give a 5-star rating, but it's such an amazing show I just had to add as well.  I'm not sure why some of the negative reviews say the acting was poor, because I thought it was great - and not just great for sci fi standards, which are notoriously low.  I thought the storyline was enjoyable and believable (other than perhaps the ability to terraform hundreds of moons with no discernable difference in gravity between them).  And any concerns that one character is a companion (prostitute) - get over it.  There is no nudity, and her job is referenced as very respectable for the time - it is a different universe and culture, after all.  I would (and have been) highly recommend this show to anyone.	5.0	So sad it was cancelled	2009-06-15	1	1	0

The series is big, entertaining, and avoids the perils of perpetual soap opera-dom.  The actors are fresh, the pacing crisp, and the out-take reel created for the Christmas/wrap party made me laugh and cry at the same time.  The DVD set provides excellent back ground for 'Serinity', but both the movie and the series stand on their own merits.  I turned my niece and nephew onto the series and both are now avid fans.I may be making this up, but I believe the network was aware of who was watching; intellegent, thinking people.  When the show's fan base increased, they realized that the cloyingly sweet crap regularly dished out to the masses would no longer satisfy and they would have to actually work (I'll get off my soapbox now).	5.0	Why is Fox still in business?	2006-01-13	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AGR4LKC72JEQ8	coopertex	This television series called Firefly is simply outstanding! And I was so sad when I heard of it's cancellation. Firefly is a science fiction show about a group of rogues that travel aboard a Firefly-class spaceship named Serenity. The universe in Firefly combines past, present and future technologies. There are small towns that looked like they belonged in the western frontier, you'll even see old-fashioned revolver pistols and rifles being used for combat. Then there are the many colonized planets and spaceships and laser weapons used by the elite. The crew of the Serenity ship consists of several strange characters; two war veterens, a pastor, doctor, mercenary, prostitute, ship pilot, mechanic and a young girl with mental problems. They all are unique in their own way, but they become like a family and watch-out for each other's back. The crew runs into; theives, assassins, government agents, gangsters, police, renegades, military soldiers and more. The characters face lots of dangers but they stick together and have a hell of an adventure. I loved every single character in the Serenity crew, and it made me fantasize that I could join them; the characters and dialog in the stories are so intelligent and witty. There were so many times the show just had me laughing out loud and feeling sad during tragic events and just enthralled by the excellent stories from each episode. The television industry and the general public will realize one day that, it's greatest loss in entertainment history is a show called Firefly. The Fox network executives ought to be kicking themselves for cancelling this FANTASTIC show! The extras in the DVD are excellent as well containing optional spanish dub and subtitles, cast and crew commentaries, the making of firefly, tour of set, walkthrough with series creator Joss Whedon (the master), gag reel and deleted scenes! If you enjoy science-fiction, the movie Serenity, intelligent shows, Cowboy Bebop or just excellent stories in general do yourself a favor and watch this series!	5.0	Most Tragic Loss In Entertainment!!!	2005-12-15	9	7	2

With such low-brow entertainment out there to satisfy every perverse voyeuristic urge, it was with great surprise and pleasure that I stumbled upon Firefly. The term 'diamond in the rough' is cliched, but I believe apt. This is a gritty, realistic series that makes a strange, though fascinating mating of the science-fiction and the western. Flawless acting, sharp and dry humour, this is no tale of exploration or peacemaking.

It possessed all the wit, intelligence, drama and Charm of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff Angel, and then some. Every aspect of the show was exemplary: its thrilling plots, clever dialogue, amazingly likeable characters and and a smattering of entigueing mysterious which were never resolved, combined to make this the most unique and interesting science fiction TV show in years.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A33X5YSRG6YRQI	Cory LaFerriere	I'm glad I decided to give this show a chance.  Fellow fans of other Sci-Fi shows I watch all told me I should check out Firefly.  It really was an enjoyable, if brief, ride.  This show really is a western in space, which is basically what Star Trek was originally called in order to sell it to a network.  Who would have thought you could put people on a spaceship, as well as give them cowboy hats and horses, and still have it work out so well.  At the heart of this show is some fantastic drama and a wonderful cast of characters.  Even with only 13 episodes, each of the series regular's comes forward as a memorable character with a unique personality.  By the time this show was cancelled they had barely scratched the surface, yet already there was enough substance to hold a loyal following of diehard fans, who eventually were able to convince the studio to bring the franchise back for a movie.  Firefly is a milestone in television history.  It is not to be missed.	5.0	Great show that should still be running today	2007-05-11	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2CYN5VOLLGTCG	"Cory Robertson ""amrcanpoet"""	Okay, let's get this out of the way first.  Farscape is the best Sci-Fi show ever...period.  Firefly, if it actually wanted to BE a Sci-Fi show, would probably have surpassed Farscape if it was given enough time.What makes this show (Firefly) so fantastic, is that it does not hit the viewer over the head by saying constantly, &quot;Hey, this is a science fiction show, so we'll do a lot of weird, other-worldly stuff that's never been done before.&quot;  Instead, Whedon took painfully careful steps towards making this show an emotionally truthful telling of the human race's possible future.The future isn't all &quot;shiny,&quot; but rather just a more technologically advanced form of functional gadgets.  Think about it, do our guns today look any more futuristic -- at the core -- as they did in the 1800's?  Not really.On top of the realism, the show boosts some truly genius comedic moments, an incredible juggling act of over NINE characters (none of which ever fall by the wasteside as dialog fillers, but actually get their fair share of character development; which is even more incredible when you consider the fact that this show was only on the air for 11 episodes), and some truly astonishing CGI work that perfectly blends futuristic items (such as a personal space ship) with real world beings (such as the same personal space ship flying over the heads of galloping horses).This is genre television perfection, and a little bit more time to develop would have yielded an example of beyond perfection.	5.0	Second Best Sci-Fi Show of All-Time	2004-02-19	8	8	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	Never mind their network was built on the backs of shows like the X-Files; FOX, is all about reality television, (Really now, Joe Millionaire is Reality?) hokey action shows, (like 24) plus some T & A shows, (like the also cancelled: Birds of Prey and Fastlane), and not quality television.  Joss Whedon, famous for his clever writing on shows like Buffy, Angel, and several movies was the creative force behind Firefly.  This was to be a different type of Sci-Fi show. He presented us with a realistic view of our possible future, a contrasting viewpoint, from the overly optimistic, Star Trek series.  If it looked like a western, it was because Terraforming other planets, would be a lot like the pioneering days of the old west.Joss presented us with a future time without particle weapons, transporters, and without alien races.  If you think about it, then you'll see the logic in that.  Aliens are still rumor, and even if they do exist, they seem to hide themselves from us (in some sense can you blame them).  Particle weapons would take an unlikely leap in technology, and expense, (and government policy changes) to be handed over to the layman for his personal use.  Transporters, well it's just not set that far in the future!  The FOX executives, (suits) basically seem to believe we are all morons.  They thought the pilot was much too complex to be understood, (for us feeble minded morons) so it became the last episode broadcast, instead of the first.  Hopefully, they will put these in the correct order on the DVDs, and not in their broadcast order.The pilot had the Firefly, (which refers to the cargo ship they fly) landing on a large city- like settlement.  It reminded me of the sets of Blade Runner, the combination of old versus new technology was quite striking, and very well done.  Like Blade Runner you had a mixed blend of races, with a prominent Oriental presence.  Missing, (since it was a settlement on a different planet or moon) was the non-stop darkness, (it wasn't totally polluted as yet) and relentless rain that characterized the Blade Runner movie.  The pilot had a good combination of plot, character development, and action to help you relate to the story.  The episode FOX chose to show instead of the pilot was weak by comparison.  The Sci-Fi Channel does not seem to recognize a good thing when they see it, and passed on picking this up when FOX dropped it. Instead they spend good money developing proven, past turkeys, like Battlestar Galactica.  Give me a break!The cast on this show was very diverse, but seemed to work well together.  They had the right blend of fellowship, conflict, tension, and personal agendas to keep it interesting.  There was a slowly unfolding mystery, in the unknown origin, of some of the passengers.  Some members of the crew were loyal to the highest bidder, and others crew kept their agendas hidden for reasons all their own.  Joss, (the shows creator) generally has a master plan for each one of his seasons. His stories build to a big payoff in the end, and he does not practice cliffhangers.  I'm sorry this one did not get a chance to play out.  He does say he'll try, and resurrect it one day.  I still wish FOX could have completed one full season at least.  Their decision to cancel this, and replace it with a relocated freshman series had a further effect on their programming.  Fastlane, the replacement in the Friday early time slot, probably cost them the higher rated show that followed, John Doe.  I believe this because it makes too much sense that the Sci-Fi audience, would be more likely to stay around, and watch John Doe than fans of Fastlane.  In the end, FOX lost all three shows.Nathan Fillian plays the captain of this group, and seems to be your classic hero type on the surface.  You forget sometimes he's really a smuggler.  He is tough without being a Rambo, and a lot smarter than he lets himself appear.  He has a few trusted crew, and some perhaps not so trustworthy, but otherwise very useful in a fight.  The Firefly crew would probably be doing honest work, if it would pay the bills. Instead a little smuggling, and some outright theft, is the way they make ends meet.  I believe the questionable ethics explored here would have made for lots of interesting episodes, had the show continued.The crew of the Firefly is not totally bad or good, but perhaps better than most.  The captain's cynical nature, (and probably his criminal ambitions) is forged in a past time, which is detailed at the beginning of the pilot. Diversity is nice in the members of the crew; they have a tough girl, a cute techie type, and a worldly type (actually a socially acceptable high-class space prostitute) with some political connections.  Plus one of the passengers is a mysterious girl, with perhaps unknown, mental powers.  The male crew is made up of a pilot, a tough guy, and among the male passengers a preacher, and a doctor, who is brother to the mysterious girl passenger.As I mentioned before, some episodes after the pilot are a little weak.  Probably they will play better after knowing the story from the pilot.  After that, the episodes will get progressively stronger.  The production values on this show are excellent, as are the special FX visuals.  The ship design is interesting, and it makes for some cool special FX graphics, especially in the pilot.  The price of the DVD set is pretty good considering the many hours of entertainment you get for it.  If FOX includes the unaired episodes, you could hardly find a better bargain!  I can't comment on extras or sound yet since it hasn't been released.	5.0	Where has all the good Sci-Fi gone?  Ask FOX!	2003-11-17	29	24	5

Each DVD is packed with great stories and adventure.This show has prompted the creation of an up-and-coming full-length motion picture from Joss Whedon called ""Serenity"". I was lucky enough to attend a special ""hardcore fans only"" screening of this movie (which will not be commercially released into theaters until September 30th, 2005). The movie is a PERFECT ending to the TV show which was sadly cut short due to being in a bad time slot and Fox's inability to air the episodes in order.

Then one day it was gone.  Poof!  Just like that.  I never heard why, or heard others talk about it.  I felt like I was the only person that had ever seen it.Fast forward two or three years and there is a commercial for this movie called ""Serenity"".  ""Hey, that looks like the same cast from that TV show I saw so long ago"", I said.  Well, needless to say it was.What a great story they weave!  Very cleverly written with humor and just the right touch of Sci-Fi and even a hint of romance.I'm not a great writer, so I won't bore you with the history of Firefly as I'm sure another reviewer has done it so much better than I ever could.  Really, I'm only here to lend support for such a great story and cast.I just bought the DVD for ""Serenity"" today and was blown away.  Now that I know they have the whole series on DVD I'm about to purchase it.I'm so glad I found it again.  I had no idea it had turned into a following.  On the DVD they showed how big this following was, and I was moved by it.  Also was a little sad that I didn't know it existed so I could join in.Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1E8CLVE5QTV1U	Craig M. Ryan	"Need to chime in here a few years late (but thankfully not TOO late) on this FireFly thing everyone's been talking about.  Originally I wasn't the least bit interested in this series because:a.) I never watched Buffy, and although I'm sure it must be good since so many people LOVE it, every episode I ever saw of it seemed pretty campy to me (plus I was too far ""behind"" to want to go through the effort of getting into it).  I decided that this Joss Whedon guy, fan following though he may have, wasn't my cup of tea.b.) I'm not a big ""series"" watcher - not on TV anyways - so it's a MAJOR thing for me to pick up & get addicted to a showc.) the series was cancelled before too long, so - ha ha - ""TV-watching preference"" victory was mine!  Whew - glad I didn't give THAT show a day in court!So anyways, fast forward to a couple of months ago: because of the postive word of mouth I'd been hearing about the new movie ""Serenity"" I decided maybe I'd check out the show it was based on.So then I went online and read some Amazon.com user reviews about the Firefly series, and that made it really seem like I was missing out on this big thing.  So I Netflix'ed the first disc, watched the 2-hour pilot, and...I WAS HOOKED!!!Instantly bought the 4-disc series, and now it's the new great love in my (and several other people who I've told about it) life!Of course, now I feel the buffoon, here writing a review of this thing that so many people have been in love with for eons now, but I feel I must.  What a fantastically-written show!  Even in just the 2-hour pilot they do a great job of introducing everybody and not making anyone ""all figured out"" right away.  Everyone had their own little hidden complexity that made you want more - Jayne was probably the worst in this regard since he was playing the big tough dumb guy, but even he turned out better than I'd hoped (just talking about the pilot here - I grew to love Jayne like everyone else in later episodes).Malcolm Reynolds (the captain of the ship) is my favourite.  Luke Skywalker and Han Solo and Jean Luc Picard and J.T. Kirk all rolled into one, plus a mean streak.  I was hooked on the series by the end of the pilot, in large part because of Mal.I think it's a testament to the writing and the acting that ALL of the characters are so great.  It would've been easy to screw up on the ""secondary characters"", but every single one of them is superb.  Everyone gets their moment in the limelight sooner or later.The setting... sci-fi western that somehow WORKS PERFECTLY.  I feel like this is a show that was made for me - sci-fi cowboy pirates with a noble streak.  Genius, I say.While every episode has been better than the last, one standout episode that I particularly loved was ""Out of Gas"" (the one with all the ""origins""-type flashbacks in it).  I also really like how theres such continuity between the episodes.  In Star Trek: TNG I never liked how something that happened last week was forgotten about the next show (more often than not), but in Firefly all the people and places you run into you see again later on.  Very rewarding for the viewer.If you want to see the movie, I high reccommend watching the series first.  As good as the film is ""stand alone"", the ""payoff"" of being that much more emotionally invested in all the characters is MUCH sweeter if you've watched the series first."	5.0	Amazing show - triply amazing movie.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FAVKLOT78UYF	"Cruzader ""cruzader"""	"There is one big premise that you have to swallow in order to like this show. If you can't cope with it, you won't like it, because it will smack you in the face in every episode.It is like the James Bond movies, if you don't accept, as a premise, that Bond, James Bond, can do everything, fly, drive, shoot, use *every* piece of machinery on the planet, that he can shoot better than all his advesaries (who all miss, all the time) and gets *all* the babes, if you don't accept this, you have to hate James Bond movies, because they are ridiculous. We talk about suspense of disbelief.The one thing you have to swallow, without thinking about it, is, that in this particular science fiction universe, the future looks like this:You have core planets, which are like one would imagine future worlds: Big, beautiful buildings, hight tech gadgets, spaceships and shuttles, modern weapons (some that don't kill by using some kind of sonic boom), flat displays, a modern, digital credit system instead of localised currency, a totally diverse people influenced by every imaginable culture, heavily influenced by the chinese society, the only remaining superpower besides the USA and so forth.But, and this is a capitalized BUT: There are also the outer rim planets. They don't have a developed infrastructure and such. Settlers are dumped on planets with next to nothing, exploited to recover raw materials, used as cheap labor, trying to survive. Still sounds reasonable, no? The catch is: all these outer rim worlds look like you have been thrown into a cheap spaghetti WESTERN movie.They trade cows, they use old revolvers, drive horses and dress in western-style garments. You have little, old, dirty small villages with a saloon and stuff. These outer rim planets, out of reach of the civilised Alliance, are a no-mans-land, with superstitious, uneducated fools, where the strong fist rules - if you have the most men and guns behind you, you are the law. The poor grunt is like the cowboy in a typical western movie.Hard to accept? Partially yes, of course. But there is logic in almost everything: there are future references everywhere! Real food (as opposed to synthesized proteins) is a rare commodity, the RICH guys have laser guns or state of the art display devices.And - they stay true to this premise throughout the show, which is a rare thing in today's entertainment.But apart from this (for some) hard to accept premise, this show is the most entertaining, clever, realistic(!), funny, imaginative, creative, thrilling piece of entertainment I had the pleasure of viewing (by downloading it from the internet) in years (don't get me wrong: I downloaded it because I live in Germany and the show was never aired here, and I asked my brother, who lives in the USA, to get me the DVD as a christmas present - and he did)As for realism: Why do they still use guns to kill people, why not lasers like in Star Trek (which i am avid fan of)? I say: guns kill people, bullets are cheap. Guns get the killing done. (And there are modern (bullet) guns and lasers in the show, they exist, they are simply not widespread and only available to the rich.No sound in space -  a little thing with big impact. Not only is it realistic, but it adds to the atmosphere. Instead of ridiculous sound effects the scenes in space are underlaid with vivid music, only emphasising the vastness and nothingness of space.The basics of the universe comply with our world. In the outer rim, where modern civilization hasn't gotten a foothold yet, things - which are to us - common, are valuable merchandise! Just imagine the third world... How much worth are medicine, guns, food there? There are (to us) barbaric customs in uncivilised areas of the world and all this is being portrayed in the show.The Plots are great, not like in Enterprise where you seem to have seen everything somewhere before, these plots are unique, thrilling and exciting. I have seen episodes where I thought ""ok, I get it"" and then *wham* the story turns into a totally different direction. Surprises at every corner.The show is so refreshingly politically incorrect, I don't want to give away plot details, but there are situations you know from your movie/series experience and think OMG there we go again (Hostage situations someone?) and then*boom* - the protagonist does EXACTLY what WE would wish to do but which every movie/series is afraid of doing because it is not PC.The characters are three dimensional and so well laid out. This ""family"" on board a little spaceship, a confined space(!), with all their motivations, quirks and problems, trying to get along and achieve their goals, are so believable and make for a hell of a ride.The creators of this show have, in the first 14 episodes, established plots, characters and atmosphere that other science fiction series have only managed to achieve - if ever - in the last seasons of their time on air.Such a pity that most American viewers couldn't see behing a bold, unique, hilarious - if difficult to accept at first glance - premise... and see the beautiful gem of a show behind it."	5.0	You will either love it, or hate it - read why...	2004-01-14	1	1	0

But this show is more science-fiction, action, drama, comedy, and actually everything you would want in good TV, then true Western.  I can't believe they aren't making more episodes- they should BRING IT BACK!!!!  I saw the whole series in 2 evenings because it was so good, I didn't want to stop watching.  It does end in a strange place- so many questions unanswered and relationships just begining to develop.  But now there's a movie, so we can find out more about River and hopefully some more characters hook-up(the movie hasn't come out here yet, so I don't know).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A27T70H1QXDZN9	C. Shamp	"Firefly has all the things that a great show needs; I am in fact very surprised it was canceled after only its first season. It has a GREAT theme song, good acting for the most part, and good stories usually. It has some VERY charming characters, and is really sort of like a space western which makes it really quite original I think. The original Star Trek was supposedly a Space Western, a ""Waggon Train To The Stars"" it was called, but it didnt have the Western FEEL that Firefly ALWAYS has at the same time as its a realistic human setting along with the expected Sci-Fi space ship/space stuff. It has really quite good Special FX, and is very nicely filmed. One thing I REALLY enjoy about it is how they fit in such nice unique ""western feeling"" music at different times during the show.Its about those characters who are near the bottom of society due to circumstance out of their control; and whom often times have to do things which are sometimes illegal to survive. And yet it shows these characters still are human and that even though they sometimes break the law and steal, that they still have ethics and strong beliefs and even the ability to like all humans, do the right thing often times when it isnt easy. I was really really enjoying this show for the first couple of episodes.However, the bad thing about it which was the turn off for me, is how they portray sex in the show. First off, in the show, prostitution as a good and normal thing. One of the main characters is a prostitute whom they call ""Companions"". Prostitution is even glorified at times as they try to make it sensual and sexy and sweet. You do often hear the Captain disagree with the ""Companions"" chosen career, but it just isnt enough considering the extent to which they carry the sexual stuff. This was something I could sort of tolerate until they brought in a lesbian scene. Now, this show aired on TV, so its only PG-13 Im guessing. . .however, its TOTALY unnessary regardless of your beliefs to have a lesbian scene in a Sci-Fi show. Even though you dont see anything but them petting and kissing. However, when they make it out to be just a normal thing for a bi sexual prostitute to be bringing her gay lovers onto this ship as part of the story, that gets to be too much. And then, in the last episode which I watched before I said this is enough and quit watching it, they had a totaly unnessary and really quite filthy sex scene. This was not one bit a romantic sex scene. It was just raunchy even though nothing was seen. . .and, it was with a character whom they try to portray as innocent and sweet until that point; which in my mind totaly discredited the character. (For the record, I REALLY enjoyed this episode a LOT until this happened) I was so very disapointed in these aspects of the show. Everything else about it is great, and the show had REAL potential. If they had not had they sexual attitude they portray in the show, I would have given it 5 stars. AND, Im SURE the movie will be VERY well done, charming and all the good things we look for in a sci-fi action adventure movie. They made the show what it is, and a part of the show is a VERY VERY laid back and wrong view of sex in my opinion. AND, sex in a Sci-Fi REALLY ISNT nessessary. There really is no way that the sexual attitude from the show cant carry into the movie as the same people who did the show are doing the movie, and its with the same cast, and it follows the series. So, no matter how much I enjoyed the show aside from the sexual stuff, I will not be watching anymore of the episodes OR the movie."	2.0	I REALLY REALLY enjoyed this show at first. . .	2005-10-09	106	18	88
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AH09CRGSG4GSQ	C. Sheriff	...and that my best friend bought it for me!  I saw the boxed set at a store while I was doing my Christmas shopping, and was just tickled to death.  I remembered watching the show (it came on after John Doe, remember that one?) and loving it, but then I'd tune in and it wouldn't be there, so after a few more attempts, I gave up.  Fox's fault, but shame on me, too.Anyway, I have never been a Buffy fan, never heard of Joss Whedon until Firefly, but I loved this show the few times I saw it, and after watching all the episodes, I love it even more.  The acting is just spot on, the stories are very involving, and the characterizations were just starting to get more involved...sort of like peeling an onion and getting down to the next layer.  I love the idea of life in the future  being a mixture of high tech and Old West...the barroom brawl where the guys are thrown through a window, but instead of the traditional glass breaking, it's just sort of a hologram-effect...really cool.  There is romance, and mystery and a feeling of family.  The captain is an intriguing fella - bitter, but innately noble.  You just know he's worth redeeming.  I would highly recommend this DVD set to just about anyone.  You won't be disappointed.  Well, except for the fact that you will want to know what happens next, and those mysteries certainly need explaining...I didn't know about the movie until I came here to write the review, so that just made my day.

But then, I can never understand why my country don't even air this cool sci-fi series at all.But buying this complete series was a risk. And this risk was worth it. The theme was unexpected (although done before in some other occasional forgettable movies) for a TV Series, quirky theme song and yet, it has win me over watching each episode. It has everything that is like in perfect order - story, humor, interesting crew, action and wit.With only 14 episodes (and I just realized by turning the back of the box that it mention 3 episodes were never air in U.S. and the 2nd episode was the opening episode of &quot;Firefly&quot;), I really wish Fox shouldn't cancel the series.But now finally its in my hands with all the episodes and the extras, I can watch it in my country that never even air it in the first place.If you love something different in science fiction genre, this is the one for you.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2OSERGXBYMPJ0	C. T. Mikesell	"It's a shame that the Fox network cancelled this series at what would have been the halfway point of its first season. Given that, however, it is wonderful that the production end of Fox Entertainment gave the show a second life on DVD. These 14 episodes are incredibly creative, and if they had been given a chance (both in scheduling and longevity) I think the Asian/Western Techno/Antiquarian fusion thing really would have caught on and we'd be eating Southwestern Eggrolls at Chili's (oh, wait...).The cast initially appears to be the standard stereotypical mix of characters (fighters, mechanics, doctor, etc.) and a typical PC mix of white and black characters. After viewing the show a few times you realize that these are *individuals* (the amazon warrior-woman is the geeky pilot's devoted wife; the psycho fighter has a penchant for unfortunate headgear choices; the doctor, far from playing God, has no personality at all; the man of God has a mysterious past (okay, the prostitute with a heart of gold is clich&eacute;, but she also has unexpected depth)); and ethnicity is never an issue - no one is ever referred to by race, nor is the mixed-race marriage ever mentioned - and everyone swears in Chinese.Like the characters, the stories are also complex. Rarely do they go the way you expect them to, and they frequently have two or three plot twists along the way. The dialogue is top notch with very little technospeak to complicate things - if the ship breaks down it's due to a carburetor or a compressor or something else where you have idea what it is. Sure, there are occasional plot holes, but for the most part things make sense from the perspective of the main characters. As disappointing as it is to not know what happens next to the crew of Serenity, there are a couple villains (Niska and Saffron) who reprised their roles during the abbreviated season/series who will also be missed. I said it before and I'll say it again: Shame on Fox for canceling this show (and for other networks not picking it up); hopefully sales of this DVD set and the upcoming feature film will rekindle interest.The DVDs themselves are nicely packaged in slimline cases and include a nice set of extras. The commentaries are good as are the documentaries (hearing Ron Glass belly-laugh was unexpected given the characters he played in this show and on Barney Miller). I was surprised by the swearing in the gag reel, mainly because I would have expected it to be in Chinese. Seeing the episodes in Whedon's intended order is also a plus (the original airdates are also noted so you can scratch your head and wonder ""What was Fox thinking?). The menus tend to lag on my stand-alone DVD player, but run much smoother on my computer.If you're a sci-fi fan you'll like this show. If you're a western fan you'll like this show.  If you want to learn to express yourself colorfully in Chinese you'll love this show. Take Firefly out for a test-drive; you ought to like it - if not, please don't tell the mechanic it's ""luh suh,"" she won't be happy."	5.0	Shiny	2004-01-18	8	7	1

I would tell all my friends to come over and watch it when it was on (not that it did us any good, it was still canceled in the end).This is character drama at its finest. By the end of the first episode, you will already love the characters. All the more amazing is that there are so many characters to know! But as the show goes on, you learn a little more about each of them. It's rare that you find a TV show that makes the people the center of the show, but this show pulls it off in spades.Did I mention that it's a show set in space, and sometimes they act a little bit like cowboys? Don't let that throw you off. For most movies or TV shows that are set in space, I'd say ""If you're not a fan of this genre, this show/movie/whatever won't change your mind."" Well, in this case, don't worry about the space or cowboy theme - this show WILL change your mind. You will grow fond of the people and the ship they travel in, come to appreciate the worlds they travel through and the characters they meet, and be shocked by the choices they make.I as much as any original browncoat was crushed to see the show get canceled: imagine all the stories they could have told! We could have found out more about the blue-handed men, or what Shephard Book's past was, or what was up with Inara's vial - but we really never will. Instead, we got some of the best TV you'll ever see in a very imaginative world.I should point out that every one of my friends that I showed the show to ended up loving it.

Whedon balances the sci-fi and western style with perfection, giving it a feel similar to A New Hope and Bonanza meeting in a food processor. The only complaint I could give is the initial irritation from the title song, but it grows on you.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A20K6DVJTIW82W	D. Adams	I am ashamed to admit I am one of the ones that did not lock-on to FIREFLY while it was being aired. But viewing this amazing series on DVD not only makes me wish I had been an original viewer, but that Fox had the vision to see what it had and gave it more time to find an audience. A tremendous cast all around, though with extra kudos to Nathan Fillion (Mal), Morena Baccarin (the Ambassador), and (yes) Adam Baldwin (Jayne, perhaps Adam's best role to date). This show is a reminder of how science fiction in its purest form is still about people and relationships (i.e. Startrek TOC) and when writers and producers focus on this, everyone benefits. If you're a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, give this DVD boxed set a try, and be sure to go see the original motion picture SERENITY, due later this year.	5.0	What other TV shows wish they were	2005-08-03	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AIVMMUKE9KXRZ	"daisysalter ""DaisySalter"""	I just watched the series and film again over the holidays.  If MASH (which ranked only 46th its first year) had the same network nabobs unwilling to allow that series to find its fan base, it, too, would have been canceled.  Staggering, yes.  That is what FOX did to this brilliant series that fans all over the world love and remain heartsick about to this day.  Not only is it developed by Josh Whedon for pete's sake, but also it has such talented actors and crew that the thing is about as perfect as a series could be. It is often laugh out loud hilarious, other times pulse pounding thrilling and sometimes heartbreaking--but always fascinating.  Check it on IMDB and [...] where it has nearly perfect ratings as here in Amazon; also take a look at the cast's filmographies. All of the brilliant actors have been busy since the show was canceled, all of them in series/movies right now, including Nathan Fillion's charming Castle. I am so happy for all of them, yet from everything I've read, they, too, wish they had been able to continue Firefly (Whedon planned it for 7 years) and are deeply touched by their fans' love of Firefly. Don't miss the film, Serenity, which Whedon did for his fans who worked so hard for the series--it is also excellent and helps tie a few ends, but it's not enough, no. Canceling Fiefly may very well be the worst blunder in television history.	5.0	Historical Gaffe on the Part of Fox destroys a brilliant series	2010-01-04	2	2	0

So I had no idea that ""Firefly"" existed until we saw the movie, ""Serenity.""  I loved the humor and the concept of a western set in outer space, and as soon as I realized that ""Firefly"" was offered on DVD, I had to buy it.We loved it.  Three of us watched all fourteen episodes in two days, back-to-back (and we never, ever watch TV). I personally loved the western outfits and different personalities of the characters.  I especially loved the companion character's outfits - gorgeous.There were lines from the series that still stand out, they were so funny.  We also found ourselves cheering for the characters and more than once saying ""I hope he kills that guy"" whenever a bad guy crossed our heroes.Many things about ""Firefly"" stood out, making this a unique experience in my mind.  I liked the Asian influence mixed in with the wild west setting.  I also thought the violence, while sometimes graphic, was gross and fun, like watching ""Kill Bill"" or ""Reservir Dogs.""  I liked how the characters seemed like a family and were each unique and interesting in their own way, though I think I liked Inora (the companion) the best because she had to love the Captain from a distance and, of course, she had the best fights with him.I think it's too bad the show was axed only after 14 episodes.  I would have loved to watch more episodes, but I am glad that at least they made the movie ""Serenity"" to tie up loose ends.I'm not a ""Star Trek"" or ""Buffy"" fan or whatever (didn't watch them), so I'm not biased that way.  I'm just somebody who watched the movie ""Serenity"" and ending up buying the TV series as a result.  All three of us loved ""Firefly"" (two adults and an 11-year old), if that means anything.  I highly recommend it."	5.0	Funny, Entertaining Space Cowboy Series	2006-01-02	5	5	0

Everyone involved with the show deserves a HUGE &quot;thanks!!!&quot; for a job well done.Now it is on DVD.  I picked it up the day it was released.  I was greatly saddened when I watched the shows again.  They never should have taken that show off the air!  The acting, directing, writing, sets, casting, props was the best I have ever seen in a Science Fiction show (and I love Farscape).  The DVD will forever remain my favorite DVD series of all time.  We were watching the show the other day and our daughter (19) and boyfriend (19) stopped over.  They both loved the show too and asked when the &quot;Movie&quot; was released to DVD because they missed it at the big screen.  She gasped when I told her it was from a show that was cancelled prior to the first season.  She wants to see all the episodes now.  The fact that she is not a scifi/fantasy fan makes that even more special.This is a very special story.  If they could only get the writers, actors/actresses, set crew together with that same spark.  Remove all TV execs who feel they 'understand' the viewers.

It has humor, action, suspense, great plots, well-developed interesting characters, and great special effects.  Unfortunately it is another in the long line of horrendous mistakes made by tv executives to Joss's shows, they cancelled it only after airing 11 episodes.  Some of the reviews on here say you'd be better off watching Farscape, Stargate, or Babylon Five, and well, these people have an utter lack of taste and intelligence.  All too often sci-fi shows give up plot and character developement for good special effects, but Firefly has an excellent balance of both.  I recomment buying to dvd to anyone who has a level of consciousness about that of bacteria.  Also, go support the movie, even if it's 1/2 as good as the show it will be awesome.	5.0	Tragedy	2004-09-04	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3IIBE4D1VECWC	D. Allen	"I've been hearing off and on over the years that Firefly is one of the best scifi shows ever. I'm always skeptical of the words ""the best"" but I figured I'll one day give it a shot. I saw Firefly on sale on Amazon for 20 bucks and decided I had nothing to lose, except for 20 some odd bucks for s&h.; I hurt myself for not getting this show sooner.Firefly consist of fourteen episodes, three of which were never aired on television. It's about Mal, and his crew of eight who takes on odd jobs. Each crew member is unique, however, and the show focuses on all nine characters at some point and time.Here are the fourteen episodes that you get to see, and my thoughts on them:Serenity Pilot - from my understanding, this was supposed to be the ""pilot"" episode of the series, but instead Tran Job got the pilot due to some management issues. Serenity is not to be confused with the movie, though. This is the only two hours episode you get in the whole Firefly series.The Train Job - the actual pilot that was shown to people back when the show was on television. The episode features some interesting things about Simon and River, two of the interesting characters in the series.Bushwhacked - I believe this is the first time you hear about Reavers which are really space pirates with a twist - they're insane, psychotic people who do some weird stuff to the people they capture.Shindig - a pretty funny episode. I think this episode really shows off the ""western"" feel of the series because it features swordplay and so fort which is interesting to watch.Safe - good episode depending on how you look at it. River and Simon got kidnapped by villagers and near the end, the village declares River as a witch and wants to burn her.Our Mrs Reynolds - features Saffron who is Mal's nemesis in a later episode. Mal gets married, which the crew find funny, but the woman isn't exactly who she say she is. Features a fairly funny moment with Jayne and him trying to trade his favorite weapon for a wife, which he thinks is a fair and honest trade.Jaynestown - there is a character named Jayne who is the crew's muscle. He's tough as nails, but he isn't exactly the brightest. Jayne comes to planet only to find that they think of him like some sort of urban legend. This episode I think highlights the series focus on multiple characters, and how detailed the creator makes each of them.Out Of Gas - Definitely want to watch this sometime after seeing Serenity. This episode features some interesting back stories to how Mal got his crew together.Ariel - another interesting Simon and River episode in that the crew attempts to ""cure"" River and her illness.War Stories - this is one of my favorites. To understand this episode fully, you'd probably want to watch Train Job first. Although the ending of this episode got sort of rushed, I think it went pretty well for the 43 minutes.Trash - You'd want to watch Our Mrs Reynolds first before watching this. I watched this episode before Our Mrs Reynolds and was a bit confused at first. However, you'll find this episode funnier if you watch the said episode first.The Message - this is a strange episode. It's hated by many fans of the show because of its semi-weak story, however, interestingly it also explains a bit of back story between Mal and Zoe when they fought in a war for Independence, the losing side.Heart Of Gold - throughout the series Mal and Inara have a sort of love-hate relationship. This episode sort of features a pretty cool link between the two.Objects In Space - the last of the episodes, but interesting in that it again features Simon and River as the main story.Those are all the episodes. That's it. It doesn't sound like much, but believe me, after watching all 14 episodes, you will probably fall in love with this show and probably want more. The first thought that came to mind was, ""How did they decide to cancel this awesome show?"" It's quite amazing and I'm quite baffled at how someone at a tv network could just drop this show.  After watching this, you'll no doubt want more. Well you don't have to worry. You'll find that there is a movie titled Serenity which is just as awesome as the show. On top of that there are comic books that explains the story before the movie Serenity.Overall, the series is much loved by many people. I think any scifi fan should have Firefly in his or her collection. The show is simply awesome. There are many devoted fan sites as well, and the funny thing is that many fans are willing to donate cash so that they can create more episodes. The funnier thing is that I would be willing to pay into this fund if it means that there will be more episodes, that's how seriously you will become a fan if you see this show."	5.0	An awesome show!	2009-02-14	0	0	0

However, it started off kinda lame, kinda slow and didn't solidly pick up until second season.  What sets Firefly ahead of B5 is that it starts off equal to the best that B5 ever did and kept the quality consistent, no &quot;TKO&quot;-type episodes in sight!Firefly has an absolutely fantastic cast that you can tell work superbly together, wonderful story telling, lots of long-term plots to keep you interested, and one of the most original story lines to be brought to TV.The only bad part was that FOX was paying the bills, which, coupled with the Timeslot Of Doom (8pm Friday nights) meant it wasn't going to stand a chance of being kept long term.  Luckily though a movie is being made by Universal for release during 2005, which will hopefully give it enough leverage to be picked up for another run at a TV show.5/5, possibly the best DVD I've ever bought, up there with the Lord Of The Rings Special Editions.	5.0	Best show I've ever seen	2004-03-25	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2II9TWDQO4NUN	Damon A. Schmidt	Firefly is sci-fi in the best sense.  It is a story about characters where the technology doesn't overwhelm the characterization.  In contrast to Gene Roddenberry's near utopian vision of the future, the people of Joss Whedon's 'verse still have some wrinkles to work out.The highest of tech is something only the core worlds can afford.  Out on the rim, people make do with whatever they can.  Sometimes this means that they farm and raise cattle and expend a lot more sweat and time doing it the old fashioned way.Serenity is a Firefly class transport ship commanded by Malcolm Reynolds, an officer on the losing side of the recent galactic civil war (Independents vs. Alliance); his first mate Zoe fought at his side during the war.  The other characters include the mercenary known as Jayne, the engineering miracle worker Kaylee, Zoe's husband, the pilot, Wash, and the (nod, wink) Ambassador, Inara.  Inara is a Companion, one of a guild of cultured, well trained, well... high class call girls.  She provides a little 'respectability' to the crew, allowing them to go places and get jobs they might otherwise be unable to.Mal takes jobs both legal and illegal, anything to keep Serenity flying, but he has a strong sense of right and wrong.  In the course of things, the crew picks up Simon Tam and his sister River, fugitives from the Alliance as well as a man named Book who claims to be a Shepherd.  Many secrets remain untold about these passengers, some of which are revealed over the course of the series.Firefly is wonderfully written, beautifully shot and acted and a joy in every way.  Its dramatic, scary, charming, adventurous, and laugh-out-loud funny.  I can hardly wait for the movie, Serenity, to continue the story of my favorite crew.  Serenity's still flying, and that's enough.	5.0	You Can't Take the Sky From Me	2004-07-10	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WYD4BYL631UO	Dana M. Richter	"This boxed set is the complete series of the acclaimed TV series Firefly.  Sadly, Fox screwed the series, and themselves consequently, over by running the episodes out of order and not showing the 2 hour pilot.  The Fox Network, the purveyor of the series, put the nails in Firefly's coffin because of their afore mentioned discretions, but the DVD set allows for a strong revival of the show with the show in its entirety, as well as cast and crew commentary on various episodes, a wicked, but very short, blooper reel, and the following around of the show's creator, Joss Whedon, on set.In my experience, I think the best parts of this DVD set are the blooper reel and the commentaries.  However, it's better to watch the episodes sans commentary before you watch the episodes with the commentary.  I also was very glad to see the show in its entirety and in order, as the Sci-Fi channel has been doing starting in the latter part of 2005.  This also opens the doors for the viewer to be better prepared for the concepts shown in Serenity.  The film came out in Oct. 2005.  The movie does fine as a stand alone, without seeing the show at all, but I really think that the series helps you get a better understanding of why people act the way that they do, and reveal the very deep and intense story lines that you would otherwise would not be aware of when just viewing the film by itself.  I've gotten away from ""Firefly,"" so I digress.""Firefly"" - The Complete Series is by far one of the greatest shows that appeared on television, in my opinion up there with ""Stargate: SG1' and ""Stargate: Atlantis"" and ""The X-Files.""  In comparison with Joss Whedon's other 2 hit series, he has again brought something new to the table that not only peaks one's interest and entertains with witty banter and action."	5.0	"Science Fiction Western = Sciwestern = ""Firefly"""	2005-10-25	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AIHIHH0JT98NT	Dan Cale	I have always been a big sci fi fan and I had heard of Firefly, but for some reason never really looked into it. When a couple coworkers were talking about it I decided to take a look. The first episode hooked me that I had to see the rest. By the end of the first season there were so many loose ends. It was well worth watching, but it left me wanting a season 2 and 3.  Good show too bad the networks didn't take a chance on it.	5.0	I only wish there was a season 2	2014-01-28	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17EUNE7M6D0EO	"Dan ""Daniel Boone"""	The camera and lighting crew must have come from the local temp employment agency.The people images are out of focus half the time and the lighting is right out of a soap opera, or worse. Did I say grainy!? Whoa!My advise: Keep your DVDs, if you have them? There is no improvement in repurchasing Blu-rays.Of course, if you really want to see the horrible camera and lighting up close and personal, by all means, buy the Blu-rays.Not really the Blu-ray's fault.

It is FANTASTIC!I don't watch TV a whole lot, and totally missed this show when it aired. I saw the movie Serenity which piqued my interest, and when I watched this series I was BLOWN AWAY. The casting is phenomenal, the writing is great and the acting is top notch! These characters & actors have endeared themselves to me in a way that no other series has. When I started watching, I couldn't stop until the series was done.Get this series for yourself, and get a few extras for a friend or family member.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2JJJYFMTGCCKJ	Daniel B. Polinsky	It's not that I don't love this show (I do) or found anything wrong with the ultra-slim design and delivery of this product, it's that I feel slightly cheated by the claims that this is a blu-ray disc.It's true, that this product does indeed play in a blu-ray player, and that the occasionally late-added cut scene, or graphic display, appears to be as crisp and stunning as my copy of Iron Man, but most of this series, for money-saving effect or just because it wasn't popular at the time, was not filmed in blu-ray, meaning most of this DVD is just the same show in the same format I would get if I bought the DVD.I didn't really need the discs, but when the deal came through my inbox AND it was blu-ray, I jumped on it. I'm not mad about my purchase, just slightly disappointed in the final outcome.	3.0	Not bad, but not special	2009-07-10	8	3	5
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1PXEG6GNI195N	Daniel C. Dalton	I never watched Firefly when it first aired back in late 2002 nor did I have any interest in watching the movie Serenity when it came out Sept. 2005.  I actually hated seeing the trailer for the movie because it previewed on every movie during the summer.  I happened to catch an episode (Our Mrs. Reynolds) one morning on the Sci-Fi channel and fell in love with it.  I can't believe how good this show was and how I had been passing it up all along.  I actually watched Serenity first and then the series (I know, backwards and kind of spoiled everything but it didn't matter).The series has a great balance of comedy, drama, action, western, and sci-fi to it.  Everything just blends right in with each other.  Some episodes are better than others but overall the series is great.  Truly a masterpiece.	5.0	Discovering a Firefly	2006-11-10	6	5	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1P52CM0G8A546	Daniel Delgado	This program is enjoyable enough, but I scoff at the notion that it may be the best Sci-Fi series of all time, as I have heard said on The Science Channel promos. This show has neither the duration to adequately explore character depth, nor an identifiable antagonist. Certainly, The Alliance serves as a looming threat and the Reavers are frightening to the characters. However, neither one has a face, someone or a group to despise. Star Trek had the Klingons and Romulans, TNG the Borg and Q, DS9 had the Cardassians and Dominion, and Voyager the Borg too. Babylon 5, DS9's competitor series, developed The Shadows. The point is, the enemies were apparent, and the strategies to battle them were developed, meeting with both failures and successes. In Firefly, the faces and ships were always different, always changing. The limited duration may have led to that, but it is a fundamental flaw in the production. There are other shortcomings as well, but this is my chief criticism.	3.0	Fun and unique, but not as great as advertised.	2014-01-29	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A14FSB9QNWMKP1	"Daniel Fazekas ""fds"""	Back in 2002, Firefly was the promising new sci-fi show on Fox cursed with such a horrible string of bad executive decisions, it's a miracle how it managed to gain a dedicated following. The network insisted on various changes to the show; they aired episodes in a different order than its creators intended; they even cropped the picture to a 4:3 aspect ratio for TV, although it was meant to be shown in widescreen. No wonder it eventually got canceled halfway through the season with three more episodes made but never aired.All this, I've only learned recently, as with 2005 came the release of Serenity, the motion picture, which has lead a whole new bunch of us to discover this interesting world. Having seen the movie, I was aching for more. As luck would have it, this time there actually was more: this very DVD set, Firefly - The Complete Series.I'm happy to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every way. On its own, the untimely cancellation of the show make Firefly hard to recommend without any reservations. Couple it with Serenity, however, and they make a thoroughly excellent package together. With Firefly, you get 675 more minutes of the same great cast of characters and many more of their interesting adventures, although each understandably somewhat less grandiose than that of the movie.Even the bonus features are impeccable. Of the 14 episodes, exactly half of them got a commentary track, each with a different set of people. Four of the cast are featured at least one once: Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Staite and Morena Baccarin. And of course, Joss Whedon, the brains behind the project, is along in three of them to share his thoughts. Beyond that, there's a gag reel, deleted scenes, behind the scenes features, and more.Really, the fact that this was released on 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, the same studio which so mistreated the show on TV, is no cause for concern. This DVD set does Firefly justice and treats it with the respect it always deserved.The bottom line is, you'll want to pick up both this and the Serenity DVD. That the two are unlikely to ever get officially bundled together is only because they were produced by different studios.	5.0	Great additional material for those of us who loved Serenity	2005-12-18	8	7	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3AAOZV70OQEXS	Daniel Florentin	During the course of it's television run, I probably was only able to watch three or four episodes, but yet, I still spent $40 on the DVD, and couldn't really explain. I found it as a unique and refreshing series, and I was drawn in buy the whole space-western atmosphere. I just wanted to know more about the characters as quickly as possible. I think its great to see a futuristic show that doesnt necessarily have to include aliens or the sterile effect of Star Trek, but instead shows the opposite qualities of man on the frontiers of space. The biggest attraction that keeps people watching is the creation of a different world. Its almost like one big inside joke, that fans can watch episodes and pick up on the little extras embedded in each scene. Also, viewers can appreciate the structure of each epidose, and how it shows short, middle, and long term story lines, which is rare in TV today.For first time viewers, if you can bear the initial, overwhelming experience of hearing chinese blurbs and new words (&quot;shiny&quot; and &quot;gorram&quot;), and can enjoy the western dialect and clever dialogue, then you can sit back and let the story do the rest. Everything, from the music, to the characters, and even the ship, make for an enjoyable experience.It's really not hard to enjoy Firefly once you can believe in the world.	5.0	Unique and refreshing appeal	2004-04-10	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZSUBG2HUUU9F	Daniel	"When I watch this series, I am always astonished at the amount of action, humor- be it good-natured and jovial, sardonic or dark- and good feelings packed into each 40 minute episode. It is truly incredible.Each character brings something truly special to the Serenity team- all nine of them, and you are amazed when you finally count them up, and realize that wow, there are NINE different, fleshed-out characters on this set, and you know and love all of them. And while they all have very distinct personalities, they all mesh together to form... with the risk of sounding clich&eacute;.. one big amazing family.Their fluid mix of Chinese (Mandarin) and English is truly impressive; expletives are muttered, yelled, screamed and whispered in Mandarin, but not so that you don't have a very good idea of what it is they're saying. This complements the English very well, and is a far superior tool than watered down words like ""darn!"" or, ""God forbid""- bleeps.Two mysteries remain by the end of the season, though; Book, the shepherd, and River, the little sister of Simon, the doctor. Of course, the captain, Mal, is a bit of a mystery himself, as is his touch-and-go relationship with Inara, the ""companion,"" but this is perhaps less of a dying curiosity than it is an interest, if that makes sense.Then there is Jayne, with his (yes, his) perpetual struggle with morals and greed. You come to love his crude, on-the-mark humor, and realize he is far more intelligent than he might first appear. You find yourself forgiving his short fallings, and rooting for him to do better by the crew and by himself (and I've never used the word ""rooting"" in any sentence, either spoken or written before in my life, so that should tell you something).You can really see the darkness is still very much a part of Mal- not an evil, but a darkness which has become part of his life ever since the war, ever since he watched thousands of his men die in battle, and of starvation, but this only shows when times are uneasy, unpleasant, uncertain.Perhaps the most lovable (and this is a very tough choice to make, believe you me, one's idea of who takes this crown will probably switch from episode to episode) is Kaylee, the adorable, always-cheerful, brilliant mechanic on board Serenity. She ""never fails to see the bright side of things,"" as Simon aptly puts it. Kaylee is a real marvel.However, you can't not fall in love with river, and feel her sorrow and pain when you see what has been done to her. She has some truly inspired lines, like, when talking to Jayne after Simon has just given him a lengthy diatribe: ""Also, I can destroy you with my brain."" She seems to have it out for Jayne, to be honest, though she probably doesn't always know what she's doing. As she rightly puts, ""Jayne is a girl's name.""You are immediately gripped, pulled into and riveted by the show as soon as you sit down and watch the beginning of the first episode."	5.0	Probably the best TV series I have ever seen, period.	2005-12-20	16	15	1

I got the movie 'Serenity' and I liked it after a couple of viewings. When I got the whole Season of Firefly for Christmas, I was excited. Since watching Episode ONE, I couldn't stop watching. I saw the whole series in 3 days while trying to expand the experience. I Fell in love with the Characters and I LOVE the music and the Theme Song blew me away. I LOVE THAT SONG, it's one of the best theme song I ever heard. It's too bad that it was short, I wanted more and more. I'm happy they made the Movie, as it does Rock and it makes more sense after watching the series. Don't see the movie first, watch the series first and then the movie. I LOVE this show, One of my favorite show ever.It's about a group of Law Breakers stealing and doing anything for money and Hopping through the Galaxy finding anything to make money.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2W34EYOFLHGOC	Dan Kemp	"I am a long-time fan of Joss Whedon's other TV projects (Buffy and Angel) but certainly no brain-washed sycophant. I bought this DVD on import as it is unavailable in the UK at the moment, and I don't get the cable channel it has been airing on. I was a little bit concerned that I might have wasted my money (not liking westerns, and jaded with Star Trek) -and as the first episode began I thought I really had -the dialogue seemed uninspired, the sets a bit ""stagey"", things in general seemed a bit drab and uninvolving.But, boy, is it a grower.By the end of this two hour pilot (""Serenity"") I was convinced that this was one of the most bold, engaging, emotionally satisfying pieces of science-fiction TV I had seen in a long time. The special effects in space are really nicely done, and I adored the atmospheric use of Ry Cooder/Paris Texas style guitars for the background music. I could not believe that there wasn't a single principal character that I didn't like or find interesting in some way, and I really appreciated the way that the humour is quite restrained/underplayed -which enables the dramatic tension to be sustained and lends a sense of authenticity to the relationships (as we don't all spend our days wittily quipping to each other).It beggars belief that Fox didn't air this pilot first  -it sets up all the characters beautifully, gets you emotionally invested in them, and creates interesting lines of tension between their various agendas.Obviously its not PERFECT, but first seasons never are (you have to give a show time to find its feet, establish its identity, build an audience......thanks, Fox) -as it stands, it has to represent one of the most cohesive, entertaining and promising starts I've seen in a long time.The show is also really something different. If you want Star Trek -go buy Star Trek. If you want Farscape, likewise. Firefly offers engaging characters, a uniquely moody atmosphere, wry and hard-bitten humour, and a willingness to break from formula and audience expectations. And, yes, its fun!Oh, and did I mention that it also features the most beautiful actress in the universe? (Morena Baccarin).Now stop reading and go buy!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2N52K6B9W9ATL	Dan Mcfarland	There were 10 stars on this great show, including Serenity herself.  FOX was foolish to air the episodes out of sequence; I didn't catch on to the quality and depth of this show until my wife made me watch the DVDs in the proper order.  I think that one short-sighted mistake probably cost Joss and his incredible cast their opportunity to keep dazzling us with more and more Firefly.Really, how can you argue in favor of cancel a show whose creator and cast can do episodes like &quot;The Message&quot;.  It's obvious the rapport that the cast and crew shared just in watching the episodes.  And what is truly amazing is that it seems like they built this rapport so quickly...much quicker than the short span of only 14 episodes.I hope Joss will be succesful in getting the Firefly movie back in the air, or even better, the series.  The only bad part of the DVD collection was knowing that there should have been more to come.  I'd love to know what happens next.Thanks Joss and the cast of Firefly!Boo FOX!!!	5.0	Why give it only 5 stars?	2004-02-06	8	8	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2C0SBDKIHUERM	Dan Mueller	This is my all time favorite Sci Fi series.. I didn't even know about Firefly  when it first came out because FOX bungled the release and played the episodes in the wrong order. I caught the first five episodes on my Tivo during a Sci-Fi channel marathon, and I was instantly hooked. I bought the Firefly Box Set and the movie, Serenity the same day. Firefly is part Sci-Fi, Part Western, and I just wish there was more than one season to love.	5.0	I wish Joss Whedon would make more episodes of Firefly...	2007-01-04	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A21TEP2EAYJIGD	Danny Beaulieu	I won't go all out and rant and rave about how this show was the best thing ever to hit the tube. But I will say that it was surely one of the most interesting shows in a while. Having followed Fox's genius idea of playing all the shows in a messed up order starting by the most suckiest, I really haven't seen em all. I most likely have seen about 3/4 of the episodes. And I must say that I was genuinely disapointed that this show wasn't given a fair chance.I do like some science fictions, but not much. And this show to me had the nice balance of not being a geekfest, but having a nice sci fi feel to it none the less. The idea of a western in the future was a clever idea. And it didn't go into the whole alien crap like star trek, so it was a plus.I'm also disapointed that we will not know what does happen to the crew of the serenity. The characters all had a lot of debt that could of been explored in the following seasons, and they were all interesting in there own way. What did happen to the doc's sister, how was there childhood, how did the preacher get all his fighting skills and knowledge? Stuff like that, could of been really elaborated. And the ideas for episodes countless. Maybe if the movie is sucessful it will actually be put back on the air, who knows.So to me, it's a good dvd collection to have and I'm sure I will not be disapointed when I do get it in a few days.	4.0	Too bad it was taken off the air	2003-12-08	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ASQF750N4MGQB	Dannyg282	This show is one of my all time favorites for so many reasons. The situations the crew get placed in aren't too novel for the most part, as many are spin-offs of old-school western motifs, but the combining of futuristic technology with rustic badassery makes it seem new and novel. What really makes the show though, is the writing and the characters. Captain Reynolds(Nathan Fillion) is to me, the single greatest television characters ever and the chemistry between him and the rest of the crew is great. The show maneuvers  between serious and comedic seamlessly and for a show that is not billed as a pure comedy, has some of the wittiest banter you'll find anywhere. The only downside to this television show is that when it is over, it leaves you with a feeling of sadness, as you realize all the loose plot threads that were left unanswered, will more than likely never BE answered, and you begin to think of what could have been had it not been for Fox's massacring of this amazing show.GO browncoats!	5.0	Great Show	2011-04-25	13	13	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WLQU8UE1D7PH	Dan Rollins	"Now, I have heard norhing but good reviews about this series; however, I have come to a different conclusion.As with the first part of Stargate SG1 and with the first season of Stargate Universe there is a strong line of ""SEX"" and both naked men and women throughout Firefly. With a young family I am dissapointed that I can not share this show with them. Another point of discouragement is the line of language in Mandarin Chinese whenever a character is upset.The main spine of this story is the captian with an old war buddy decide to go into business with the purchase of an old spaceship. A ""professional harlot"" rents out one of the two empty shuttles to expedite her business to foreign climes. Others whom are aleady on the crew is an egotistical hothead, a female mechanic with other things on her mind, a man of the cloth with a past, and a sister and brother. The brother is a doctor and a genius and the sister is more so, but was freed from the government.The spine of the story is almost non-existent. The captian and his female war-buddy story is given in short. The same is so later on with the different crew members. Otherwise, they are just floating in space as an illegal salvage team. The enemy is the republic which is set up more or less like Scotland Yard. Now, when the writer and director were bored decided to put this graphic sex scene here or there. Or the topic of sex was brought up in the crew's conversation on deck. A nude scene here to perpetuate reality. A nude scene there to express the realism as the writer and director thinks would make the story more real. And then there was the sceme where the harlot has intiment relations with another girl, and the captain upright and completely nude in front of all because in an earlier show a ""marriage"" had taken place and the gal was nude.Otherwise, the storyline has no true spine. As with the movie Supernova with Lou Diamond Phillips and with the first season of Stargate Universe with (once again) Lou Damon Phillips and Peter DeLuise released a show not for the public at large but for the adult audiences, and the same holds true with the television show Firefly created by Josh Whedon.In short, such shows could be surmised as a group of fish stuck in a can. Give them plenty of food and water and within five years there will be no water in the tank but plenty of offspring!Sorry, I give Firefly to the burning barrel."	1.0	Whore house in space	2011-07-30	144	14	130

When I got the dvds my plan was to watch a couple episodes a day for a week, but I simply couldn't turn the thing off. Finished the set in a day and a half. The character dynamics are wonderfully refreshing, and the dialog is witty. After getting over the no aliens and scifi-western genre mix, I've determined this is one of the best written and acted TV series that I've seen in a very long time.

The same folks who canceled Dark Angel pulled the plug on Firefly. The cast Christmas party became a final wrap party. However, the creator, writers and 9-member ensemble cast all went on the remarkable later success.The Firefly DVD, peppered with ""Copyright: FOX TV"" captions (as if Fox did anything but thwart and hinder the production), has sold >600,000 copies. Its eleven episodes are a must-see for any drama, action, adventure, sci-fi or space fantasy fan. With strong and compelling stories from the Mutant Enemy (Buffy; Angel; Serenity...) stable of writers, my household remains amazed that that the network wonderkids didn't grasp the point or potential of this excellent work.Compounding their error, they axed Firefly without allowing for a complete season. Adding to its foolishness to incompetency, Fox didn't even air two of the episodes it paid for, making this DVD the only way to see the incohate 11-episode work (the sets, cast and creator going on to make a smash motion picture from the left overs).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	Somehow I missed Firefly when it was aired on TV. When the movie Serenity came out I got a DVD copy and watched it. I must not have been reading the cover very carefully as I did not make a connection with the TV series Firefly.While browsing the Amazon web site for DVDs I noticed the Firefly set that contained all of the TV episodes. The review intrigued me so I decided to order it and the Collector's Edition DVD.One of the reviewers said it was best to watch the TV series before watching the movie so I decided to do just that. Although I had seen the movie in the past, it had been a fairly long time so I started the TV series; I didn't know what was in store for me.If one thinks about it, the premise is reasonable; the frontiers of space could have parallels with the frontiers of the old West. The farther you got away from civilization the more rugged life could become; especially after a major war which had divided civilization.To a substantial degree it helps to check your brain at the door and just relax and accept the story line. The characters are sufficiently developed to generate some feelings of concern for them as the stories progress. The stories themselves are in one way stereotypical, and yet in another way very original; I guess you would have to watch them to see what I mean.I'm pleased with them and look forward to seeing them again; a lot is going on and it's hard to absorb all of the action on a first viewing.If you're a sci-fi fan and have not seen the series and the movie, you should go ahead and treat yourself.	4.0	A Science Fiction Western?	2008-07-17	0	0	0

This series and the movie Serentity was about a crew of ex-patriots that had fought in a war with the alliance.  Well only two had really been part of the fight .. the others became part of the crew by different means.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AECVYXIL9791R	David C. Read	"I'm one of those who saw the movie ""Serenity,"" got curious about the Television show, then watched each of the 14 TV episodes.  This show was obviously genre-bending, combining sci-fi with a Western feel, which is probably why it was cancelled: it couldn't be pidgeon-holed by (or for) a network executive.  But it's uniqueness, you might even say its quirkiness, is part of its charm.Another thing that might have contributed to its demise was its inability to maintain a consistent tone.  Sometimes, the sensuality and violence are way down low at ""family hour"" levels, even unrealistically low, whereas other episodes were strictly adults-only fare. Ironically, however, the two most extreme episodes were after the show was already cancelled: the second to last show ""Hearts of Gold,"" about rescuing the whorehouse baby, was over-the-top in its sexuality; the last, never-aired episode, ""Objects in Space"", where the bounty hunter boards the ship, had a level of menace and violence absent in other episodes, even the episode where Mal and Wash are tortured.Unpredictability is always risky in a TV show, where people tune in every week to get same sort of entertainment.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1DAOL3NMHEPLS	David F. Nolan	"""Firefly"" was one of those rare TV shows that made people think as well as care. Its heroes are outlaws, living on the outskirts of an oppressive interstellar society. Joss Whedon's ""gut"" devotion to liberty shines through in this show, and its messsage is clear: freedom matters, it's worth fighting for, and when you can't fight, you escape the oppressor if you can. Some episodes are better than others - the ones scripted by Whedon tend to be the best - but the series overall is better than almost everything on TV today. Maybe if the movie (Serenity, opening next week as I write this) is a hit, the show will be given a new lease on life.

Cowboys in space? Dumb idea&quot;. I never got attached to it, becuase I had a feeling FOX would cancel it anyways from the start. Then I saw a couple more epsoides and it started to grow on me but it seemed disjointed from week to week. Then it was canceled. I had missed about half the episodes aired...Oh well.Then a friend sent me a VHS copy of &quot;War Stories&quot;. It was tight, tense, funny and the cast WORKED. I missed the show for the first time.Then the DVD came out. I got to see the episodes the way god- I mean Joss intended. Wow. Just wow.I got to see the whole arc, see the charicters grow and mesh, and relize the idiots at FOX playied the weakest episodes first and ignored the fantistic pilot epsiode for for the very last, the one that would have shut me up with all my questions, and make me want more.Great cast, great stories, SFX, sets, the whole universe is interesting and room for expansion ( tidbits of which are mentioned in Josses commentaries). Like Cisley, AK of Northern Exposure (when is THAT going to be on DVD BTW!?!?!), the good ship Serenity is a place you wish were real because it looks like so much fun ( if you dont mind the occational Reaver attacks, Alliance patrols and bad food).Thank goodness it looks like there will be Firefly movie!

Even though it is only 14 episodes, I can truly say that it was one of the greatest shows ever. The thing that makes it so good is it's rewatchabilty. I can watch these episodes over and over and not get tired of them. I have seen it 6 times so far and I find something new and fun everytime. Even if you know the story by heart, the characters just make you smile. Another thing is that I think this show can be enjoyed by alomst everyone. I showed a couple episodes to my grandpa and after seeing it he went out and bought his first DVD player so he could watch the show! I have 600 DVD's and this is my favorite.

That's a strange combination, but it works for me.  It's important to start at the beginning of the series because early episodes build a base to work from.  Serenity, the movie, is great also, but you need to see the Firefly series first to really enjoy it.  Firefly is one of the few DVDs that I can watch over and over and still enjoy it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AAIB898RMFK0I	David Lee Rater	I thought I'd add another five star review, because the amount of support for this show here thrills me.  As much as I like to trash Fox for bungling Firefly, in some ways I feel partly responsible for their mistake.  Because I felt the same way about the show early on: that it could never make it.  As a Buffy fan, I followed the story of the show a little.  I was amazed by Buffy's success, in itself.  I know that Joss originally pitched the show to Fox, amongst other networks I believe, before landing at the fledgling WB.  I was always glad Fox passed on the show, because even though it would've had greater production value, I don't think the show ever would've lasted long enough to become what it did.  I thought Firefly was doomed from the beginning, and so did Fox.  I also thought the show was too out there.  Sure, I'd give it a chance, but no one else would.  I didn't even catch that many episodes on TV, though.  I liked the show, but didn't love it, and then I'd miss it one week, and the next week it would be pre-empted for baseball, or something, so I caught less than half of the aired episodes.  I wasn't overly sad when the show was cancelled, because I thought it had been inevitable.  I ended up buying the DVD on a whim, and then I watched the pilot.  That was where Fox and I differed.  How could they not air this pilot?  It's probably the best episode in the series.  It's deliberate, yes, but that was required to introduce an ensemble cast of 9 characters, and there was still action and humor in it.  Watching the show through, I fell in love with it.  I couldn't believe I hadn't realized how great it was.  I had missed some of the best episodes, and watching them in order made others that I had seen better.  Joss's other shows started off somewhat slowly and awkwardly.  With Firefly, he had graduated college.  This show knew what it was from the first second, and it needed to, because it wouldn't have a second to waste getting comfortable.  Then, after being astonished by the show, I started reading some of the fan reviews here.  I read dozens, hundreds.  It was amazing.  I wasn't the only one who saw the brilliance here.  People connected with this show.  Lots of people.  I had never seen such a uniformity of 5-star reviews.  A lot of them weren't Buffy fans.  A lot of them had picked up the show without knowing a thing about it.  I couldn't believe it: the show hadn't been doomed from the start.  Amazingly, it could've had a chance.  It should've had a chance.  This show could have actually been a hit, as hard as that was to believe.  If Fox had put it on, I dunno, Wednesday night, and had promoted it, and given it a little time, amazing things could've happened.  Even as the story has went, it's still amazing.  The show HAS become a hit, even without being given time.  People have found it.  They're actually making a movie out of it with a $60 million budget.  I don't know how it happened.  It never seemed possible.  I thought Joss had to mess up sooner or later.  Not every show could be a hit.  But here he succeeded maybe more than ever before, even while failing.  Still, it depresses me.  Two hours on the big screen can never compare to even the half season we did get.  Why couldn't Fox have at least let them finish out the season.  Imagine what they could've accomplished in just one full season.  8 more episodes.  They could've done incredible things in those 8 episodes, because Joss knows how it works.  He knows characters.  He never casts vacant-eyed models, he goes for actors with an energy in them, and he writes characters the same.  There isn't a single character our of 9 that doesn't work on this show.  There isn't a single actor that's even a little bit wrong for the part.  As much as I like Buffy, this show had more of what it takes, in some ways, than Buffy did.  This show had a more fully realized universe that came together from the first episode.  And they hardly even got to explore it.	5.0	What was Inevitable.	2005-05-11	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2SU4TCAKIRN6H	"David Moffett ""Reinhart"""	I really have to hand it to Joss Whedon, this really is an awesome show. I hated Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Also by Joss.) But this... this is pure gold, and cancelled after less than a season? Shame on you Fox. But to make up for it, they gave us this: The boxed set of the entire first season, even the episodes they never aired.But what really makes this show? You might ask. Well, it's the characters. Mal, Kaylee, Jayne; all of them are absolute genius. In their own way they are each funny and interesting and the way they interact seems natural as well as well written. I have not seen characters I have loved so much in a long time, on the same level as characters from good literature.Another thing which makes this show is it's setting, there is an undeniable wild west flavor to the entire show from the firearms to the fiddles and twangs of the soundtrack, to their method of speech. (Which I find extremely charming.)Let us not forget the story! It isn't... outstanding, but it is interesting and keeps you guessing. I had the general flow of the story layed out for me by Serenity (The movie based off of the show.) and it's what got me interested to begin with. But the show still held a lot of surprises. And the setting is in the distant future, when man is colonizing space, the final frontier (I believe this to be the reason for the wild west theming.)I really can't suggest this highly enough if you even remotely like Sci-Fi, a Sci-Fi with no aliens and a somewhat believable vision of the Terran future of mankind.	5.0	One of the Best TV Shows Ever Made	2006-03-25	12	12	0

Why Fox canceled this I will never understand, but pick up this Blu Ray and that of Serenity as well, and you just won't be sorry.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKWNYT1KV5V2R	David Treese	The hero of sci-fi, the man they call Joss, wrote a great story but got screwed by Fox.My girlfriend bought me this DVD set for my birthday. I had forgotten just how much I liked the series until I sat down and watched the first six episodes without stopping. I lost way too much sleep last week, and I still haven't seen the special features. I'm just glad the girl knows me better than I know myself.You can hate science fiction, and you can hate westerns (both of which I love), but it's impossible to hate the characters Whedon has created for Firefly. Each and every character has such a well-developed back-story that you can't help but find them all incredibly interesting. Combined with the wicked sense of humor possessed by the writing team, this made for some great television.This has been discussed by other reviewers already, but I would like to address what happened with the programming of the show. As with other popular shows that have been ruined by programming execs (think Titus), it's hard to get a following when viewers don't know from one week to the next when the show will air. On top of that, showing the pilot halfway through (or what wound up being the end of) the season tells me that the execs were never really committed to the show. Whedon is an established writer who is great at long-term plot development, and they should have gone with his sequencing. Instead, the network Foxed up everything from the get-go. That's okay, though. Ain't no power in the Verse can stop us from likin' Mal Reynolds and his crew.	5.0	Once you've been to Serenity, you never leave.	2004-02-02	6	6	0

However, life gets complicated after they take on a handful of travelers that end up staying just a bit longer than expected and the crew has to deal with becoming reluctant heroes.There really isn't a show I can compare Firefly, and that is a good thing.  Any other shows that come after that are similar will have a high standard to be compared against.The characters are really well developed, the writing witty and humorous, and the plot holds together very well.  I would say the only thing fox did a service for this show was preventing it from ever getting bad (because just look at any good series - there is always that ""sucky"" season, or two, or three)Final note: unlike Firefly, not many shows get a movie after they have been canceled.  So after you finish watching Firefly (my first time was all in one setting) you now have the benefit of being able to find out how everything ends by watching Serenity. Just don't forget to read the graphic novel that takes place between Firefly and Serenity though! ;)"	5.0	Gof Foxed, so you know it is good.	2011-12-19	1	1	0

Logging onto Amazon from the MWR computer I noticed Firefly, and immediately purchased it and had it shipped OCONUS to my location.Immediately feel in love with the story, and have been sharing it with my other troops as well.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AFNNQF5DZZ9GN	David W. Wildeboer	I remember seeing the ads for this innovative program when it was first being aired and thinking it was something I wanted to watch. However, due to work committments, I missed the first couple episodes and never found it again. Then, I heard it was cancelled after a half season. Well, soon reports of a fan following of this program developed (similar to Star Trek) and when I saw the complete series on dvd, I decided to buy it. Boy, am I glad I did.Firefly unfortunately came out during the reality tv craze. It is a fine program with excellent characters and stories, a wonderful premise, superb acting and cast, fine effects, and a great production team. Watching the 2 hour pilot on dvd and the shows in order certainly built the characters and the plot. Apparently, Fox, when originally airing this, didn't air the episodes in the order that made sense losing a fair number of viewers along the way. This program is one of the best sci-fi series ever aired. Unfortunately, it died too soon. But, like the Phoenix, it is rising from the ashes and I am eagerly anticipating the feature movie Serenity in the fall.One thousand plus reviews can't be wrong: if you enjoy good stories, action, humor, and a little science fiction, delve into Firefly. You may be pleasantly surprised.	5.0	Quality show that died too soon.	2005-04-25	4	4	0

When it was on the air I tried like crazy to see the episodes but you know how Friday nights can be.  This show drew me in immediately.  Each character has a certain something that brought me close.  First class.  Unfortunately it could not stay on the air, there were no bumbling fathers, unruly children, no getto booty babes, no eating of larva, no black/white stereo types.  The writer would not let FOX insert a laugh track over fart jokes so the plug was pulled.

Excellent writing, witty dialogue, great characters that you really care about, humorous and dramatic storylines...and the list goes on!An intriguing and entertaining blend of western and sci-fi, but even if you're not particularly a fan of either of those genres, you're sure to enjoy it.Buy it now...you won't regret it! (Just look how many people have taken the trouble to submit reviews (this is the first time I've ever cared enough to submit one), we can't all be wrong!)And don't despair...a film is now on the way (Serenity), due out in September 2005. (Hopefully to be followed by sequels, and, in a perfect world, resumption of the TV series!)

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A13RLHEG7J6DYJ	DC	If you're reading this review, you already know that Firefly is a must-have Blu-ray.  It's already a cult classic and is possibly destined to become a true sci-fi classic many years down the road.  I won't get into the plot here, but focus on the Blu-ray specifics.  It comes down to this: if you're a fan, or you think you might become a fan, get this on Blu-ray.  You should really see it on a big screen in great quality.  I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much if it was DVD quality.  The video and audio are standard Blu-ray quality.  I'm not a fan of the menu, which is minimalist, but I'm really looking to nitpick here, since there's really nothing bad to say about the disc itself.I do recommend that you buy this somewhere other than Amazon, though.  I bought mine and while it was in the mail, the price dropped significantly.  Amazon is the only major retailer that I know of that doesn't offer a price guarantee.  Only buy it at Amazon if it's an unbeatable price, otherwise you'll be losing money without a doubt.  For those of you who are not familiar with price guarantee, it means that if you buy something (for example) for $60 and a couple weeks later it's on sale for $30, you get reimbursed for the difference.  It basically gives you the confidence to buy something right now without worrying that you'll get dinged by a sale the next day.  Price matching, on the other hand, means that a company will sell it to you for the same price that the competition is offering.  Amazon used to offer price guarantees, but no longer.  I won't be buying anything from them until either this changes or I see a price that is so low that I can't resist it.In conclusion, great Blu-ray, but buy it somewhere else!	5.0	Five stars for Firefly, 0 stars for Amazon	2010-10-03	4	2	2
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FF4SF8W4PKQV	D. C. Hunt	Firefly was a great Sci-Fi show, what else can I say.  In a time when Star Trek was getting too caught up in trying to stick to thinly stretched and P.C. ridden world it was good to see something fresh and new.  Firefly was a truly original series and Fox made a big mistake in pulling it off of the air.  For a while I was hopeful that maybe the Sci-Fi channel might pick up the rights and start to make new episodes but I guess the movie that is coming out will have to suffice.  I highly recommend the DVD's for anyone that enjoys good science fiction.	5.0	Great Show!  Need more like this one!	2005-09-30	5	5	0

I even already watch shows on FOX. In short, I am the target demographic for Firefly. The fact that I had never heard of this show until I started hearing my friends rave about the DVDs should be a clear indication that somebody at FOX was not doing their job.Firefly is some of the best science fiction ever made in any medium, and one of the best television shows ever. Period. Since I was introduced to it, I have watched it twice start to finish. I have shown the pilot episode to six different people, and every one of them has loved it. Its complex themes and in-depth characters resonate with me in a way nothing on television ever has before.Watching these DVDs is a bittersweet affair, because there are so many moments where you can see these tiny, beautiful seeds of the bigger picture being planted one by one, but of course FOX uprooted the show before they were able to bear fruit. Every time I reach the last episode, I feel a little twinge in my heart, because I so badly want to know what happens next. What is Book's story? What changes are going to come over Jayn as a result of his actions on Ariel? Who exactly are Blue Sun, and what is their agenda? These are things I care about, and you will care about them, too, after you watch the show.Buy this DVD set. Watch the movie when it comes out next summer. And maybe, if we're very very lucky, the movie will do well enough that somebody will realize what a treasure this show was, and they will pick the show back up, and we can continue the story.	5.0	absolutely fantastic	2004-09-11	9	9	0

I don't watch much TV and I was too young to watch Firefly when it was originally aired.  I have recently discovered it by watching the movie and then buying the boxed set. I think that this series is more interesting than the other shows currently on TV.  This show is not the perfect view of the future as in Star Trek where everybody gets along (for the most part).  It is about a group of people trying to live their lives how they want to.  The western part of it is interesting and reasonable if you know the background, the government gives settlers of new worlds the barest necessities to survive; so it is not a crude mix of sci-fi and western.  Even in our world today there are some technologically advanced societies as well as some developing nations.  Our technological  infrastructure is precarious and it does not take much imagination to conceive a world where it failed.- C.Daunt	5.0	Yes, it's another 5 star review	2007-07-18	2	2	0

Neither one of us watch TV much and both of us own a Tivo... how ironic.  Given my friend's positive review, I decided to give it a viewing myself by renting the DVDs.I'm a sci-fi fan, but I haven't been able to get into the  countless Stargate and Bablyon 5 clones... Firefly was different.  A western set in the future.  A group of people who are struggling to make it in the ""verse"", much like many of us do in 2005.  Each one having a unique perspective on what it is that they are trying to accomplish with their lives and within any given day.  Every character on the show is likeable and layered with degrees of complexity that you don't see in TV anymore.I really came to appreciate the Captain and his dedication to his crew.  Unlike many shows in space, there isn't a structured hierarchy with the characters.  Sure, the Captain is well, the captain of the ship, but people disagree and act like individuals.I watched each episode on the DVD wishing the show would never end.  Alas, I got to the last DVD and then the final episode and I was sad... so I watched all the special features and came to Amazon.com to buy the box set.  That is a testament to how great this show is.  I will spend money on it.  Do you hear that Fox!?!?I was one of the many people who didn't see Firefly when it was on television.  Perhaps the genius executives at Fox didn't know how to market the show.

I, like many others who reviewed this DVD set, did not catch ""Firefly"" on TV.  Nor did I catch ""Serenity"" in the theaters.  I rented ""Serenity"" after seeing it reviewed favorably over and over.  I stuck it on my Netflix list and forgot about it.  Then the movie arrived and I watched it.  I LOVED it and watched it again.  I just had to buy my own copy and also picked up the boxed set of the series.  What a sci-fi treasure this show was!  Who in their right mind at FOX let this one go? (Then again, these are the same folks who canceled ""Arrested Development."")  The shows will haunt you, as will the theme song.  I'm not a fan of network shows, generally speaking, but this one has gotten under my skin and I just love it.  It deserved a long run.

Then the movie came out and the critics really raved over it, so I thought I'd check it out. It was excellent. So I rented the DVD's with the actual episodes. Man, what great stories, interesting characters, funny, action, even alittle emotional at times, sexy, special effects, this show had it all. The only way I can explain it is, its like having an old friend come to stay with you. I've never reacted to a TV show like that before. Wierd, in a way. But great. I have one more DVD to watch, and when the last episode has run, I will genuinely miss it.I'm am grateful for the few episodes that were made, and can only wish that some kind of groundswell movement to make more will kick in (Re: The original Star Trek after it was cancelled).Thank you Firefly.

My strategy has been to trust the general consensus of those who present well-reasoned opinions and it was upheld with this gem of a series!I don't remember this premiering at all on Fox, but then again I don't follow an awful lot of television shows, period.  While I was a little dubious about the ""science fiction"" plus ""western"" combination, they really manage to pull it off.  The characters are interesting, the acting well-done, and the writing was very good (not to mention witty) for this short-lived series.  I was sincerely disappointed that there weren't more episodes and that the story line ended where it did--the possibilities were endless and the potential was huge.This series earned another fan and I recommend this DVD offering for all of those looking for an entertaining sci-fi ""light"" diversion.

I used Netflix to do so and couldn't get the next disc fast enough.  I was so excited about this show that I had never heard of before that I searched the internet for more info.  It was like when Bart and Milhouse decide to go to the world's fair and find a ghost town because it took place decades earlier.  I was 6 years too late to join in the fight to save the series!  There are so many fans and websites out there still going...I had no idea!This series, like so many other reviewers have said, is human.  It is well written with depth, covering humor, action, drama (great cast chemistry!) and even romance.  Each character has a past, but the crew comes together in a fight for daily survival (by practically any means).  Don't miss this gem...buy the set and support the show!  Who knows, maybe some network will see the light.  Also, don't miss the movie, Serenity, which can be bought here as well - it actually gets the chance to explain a few things and tie up a loose end or two...well, it actually makes a great starting point for another Firefly project (keep your fingers crossed).I did notice that the episodes may not be in the best order, but just what the two hour pilot first and The Message last...it's all good!Whatever you do, don't stand near a huge engine if you want to welch on a deal with Mal!  :)  Browncoats unit!!

I'm not a Fox fan, and rarely watch them, so it was easy to miss.  We heard the buzz about ""Serenity"" and went to see it when it opened.  I was blown away.  I am so tired of predictable sci-fi and we have been disappointed by most of the recent films.  Not with this one. After seeing ""Serenity"", I immediately bought the ""Firefly"" DVD set and have not stopped talking about them since.  I love this crew.  I love this universe.  My most frequent comment when watching the episodes was, ""I can't believe this was on network television"".  I can only hope this gets picked up again as a series, or that more movies follow.  Having seen  ""Serenity"" before ""Firefly"", some of the events of ""Serenity"" didn't have the impact on me that they would now.

Missed seeing the movie while it was playing so on a whim bought it at Walmart (sorry, Amazon.com).  I was hooked and ordered the series Firefly from Amazon.  Yes, the free market is alive and well.  Anyway, that being said, the theme song keeps running through my head and I have even been dreaming about the characters since watching all 14 episodes and the movie again in 2 days.  Even rewatched some of the episodes with the comments just to get a new perspective  Came to this site today to see if there were any other fans.  See lots of normal type folk who are as nuts as I am about this series. It's nice to know that I am not alone in the ""Gorram 'verse.""The thing that got me was the nuance of the dialogue then the music. The character development makes me want to hang with each one of them. I am sad that we did not get to learn about the Shephard Book character.  I wanna know about his early life. I have never been a fan of Buffy and have not bought any TV shows on DVD. So all I am trying to say is that I am very glad that I don't have to up the meds!  It is like an itch that should be scratched when one finds a gem like this series.  I will definitly be more attentive to Joss Wheadon's work.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A180VGZSXX4T4Q	Debra L. Sponable	"An intuitive spaceship mechanic with no training in engineering.  A world-class surgeon on the run.  A pastor whose mysterious past suggests he's been a spy, even an assassin.  A genius psychic schizophrenic.  And a captain who's been on the losing side of a never-ending battle, but never gives up.These, and four more brilliantly-crafted, flawed characters, travel the impoverished,ragged outer rim of the otherwise ""perfect"" futuristic universe as outlaws on Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship that's dark, rusty, full of surprises, and can pull through when other ships can't.  Each character has a story, and by rights, they shouldn't get along - and often don't.  But when the going gets rough (and it always does), they make impossible choices.  And become improbable heroes.This TV series was aired on Fox for just 9 episodes in the fall of 2002, and it was a bumpy ride.  Fox insisted on showing the episodes out of order --- which hopelessly confused the story line.  Pre-empted an episode.  Lost viewers before it ever had the chance to get started.  And this was a death knell for a brilliant series by Joss Whedon, the mind behind innovative offerings like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse.Firefly isn't a dumbed-down, easily packaged story that wraps up in an episode.  It's complex; it evolves.  The characters grow; the plot builds, interweaves.  To understand the premises requires watching a few episodes.  But many got hooked, and continue to do so every day --- and thus, the ever-expanding cult following.So fans demanded more.  They declared themselves Browncoats, a tribute to Captain Mal's fighting attire (the iconic leader of the band of misfits, played by Nathan Fillion.) Release to DVD --- yep.  More material --- they got a movie (Serenity, also available from Amazon.)  Joss Whedon, a social justice advocate, used his fan network to sponsor a fundraiser for women's equality.  Fans produce spinoff stories, create gear, host regional meet-ups, conventions, even musicals!If you want to know what all the fuss is about, take a chance.  Watch it.  And if you've got an inner outlaw or pirate anywhere inside just aching to get out, try to stop yourself from turning Browncoat.  I dare you."	5.0	A  terrific cult classic!	2010-01-23	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1MJQ6L85HEEU8	Debra M. Kraft	"I ""found"" Firefly by accident last fall.  Lost in the avalanche of mind-numbing new fall shows (98% of which weren't worth a first glance, let alone a second one) and poorly advertised, Fox had done nothing to build my interest in watching this particular series.  However, one Friday evening I turned on the television while finishing whatever it was I was doing around the house.  It didn't matter what channel was on, it was mostly just on for the noise.  But I took a first glance.  And then a second one.  And then I stopped whatever it was I was doing, and sat down, and started watching.  I couldn't stop.Firefly caught my interest as no new series has since Stargate SG-1.  Yet I had been anticipating Stargate SG-1, whereas Firefly came out of the blue ... or perhaps I should say ""out of the black"".  And Firefly is not at all comparable to Stargate SG-1.  In fact, I can't compare it with anything I've ever seen.  Firefly is new and innovative.  It is a series that gives you the unexpected - a true feat in this era in which every network simply wants to bombard us viewers with the latest hit craze.  Firefly makes you stop and think, yet doesn't overload your brain as some high-tech, hard-core Sci-Fi can.If you're not a Sci-Fi fan, you could still love Firefly.  It's not about intergalactic travel and aliens and laser guns.  It's not about special effects (though it does a fine job in that arena when necessary).  It's about people - `Real', three-dimensional people, with conflicting motivations and secrets and emotions we may or may not always understand, depending on what the story has revealed to us.  It's about relationships, both good and bad.  It's about trying to make a living, or simply trying to stay alive.  And sometimes, as the episode ""Jaynestown"" shows us, it's about the muddy reality that exists behind legends.Watch it.  You won't regret it.  And if you really want to know who these people are, these nine folks brought together by coincidence to form a misfit sort of family, watch ""Out of Gas"" - the best episode of the best series I have ever seen"	5.0	Firefly is new and innovative	2003-07-24	38	35	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APGFP8ITLII1F	"Decaf ""The professional amateur"""	Most programs by necessity or for greater profit cut corners constantly.  That's not an accusation but rather a reality of our times.  Firefly was an remarkable exception.  Costumes looked like clothes instead of fabric cut 10 minutes before shooting, actors looked rehearsed and ready, scenes were crisp and the writing was top notch.  Special effects looked dazzling, well thought out and new.Unfortunately those standards were also its downfall as Fox reviewed the costs of a show that didn't appear to have the immense following it would have later on.  The phrase 'before its time' is thrown around a lot but I'm going to use it again.  Many shows that put that kind of effort into quality production are gaining ground, but sadly they had to climb over the corpse of Firefly to do so.  We may never see Firefly's resurrection but I'm glad to know that those of us who have shown our love for this diamond have helped bring credibility to quality in television again.	5.0	A throwback to the age of standards	2008-07-01	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3EEMNZY5DHO3P	"D. E. Cooper ""D7ana"""	"I don't recall when I started watching Firefly on tv. But from the first episode that I saw, I fell in love with the crew and the ship and the story. On Buffy the Vampire Slayer and on Angel, I had favorite characters. And on the later Buffy seasons, I hated the Dawn character because I thought that she was a plot device to keep teenage boys hooked on the series. On Firefly, though, I enjoyed watching every crew member. Proud and loyal Captain Mal, trigger-tempered, opportunistic Jayne, quiet and fierce Zoe, playful and insecure Wash, warm and capable Kayley (sp?) as well as their passengers, Book, Inara, Simon and River all charmed me. I even liked seeing the ship, Serenity. When Buffy and Angel ended, I thought that there was a fitness about the shows' endings. The stories for each series had played out as far as I was concerned. But when Firefly was cancelled after only a few episodes, I felt cheated of the opportunity to learn more about the characters, the chance of seeing how the relationships would work out over the years.So, I received the DVD and I expected to be pleased as I was. Why would I recommend that someone buy the DVD though? There are the three episodes that were never aired in my area anyway. Then there is the commentary and bonus clips added. But mostly I bought the DVD because I wanted the advertisers to see that there remained a Firefly following so that maybe another network would pick up the show or that a second movie followed the one coming out this September. Or failing on those scores, I would have the shows to watch whenever I wanted: I could imagine the evolution of the characters. Because this show ended before it had a chance to play out its depth, it's more precious to me - and hey, I am ""just"" a viewer, not the creative Mr. Whedon or the talented actors or the unseen people who contributed to the delightful program, ""Firefly""."	4.0	Firefly DVD Review	2005-08-07	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17UDMQKST2KGF	Dennis S.	I really like Firefly and the follow-up movie, Serenity. Which is unexpected for me. I am a fan of the science fiction, don't get me wrong - but I remember when it debuted on TV and I tried to watch it, but was unable to follow it. Then the movie came out and I thought, &#34;why bother?&#34;I was wrong. The series was not aired in the proper order when it was originally broadcast, so anyone would have a hard time with viewing it. I found it online, presented in the order originally intended. I watched every episode and then the movie. I now do this very often because it really is/was a great show.Character development, cast's interaction with each other, story arc - all just great stuff. I highly recommend this series.	5.0	Shiny (No spoilers in this review)	2013-09-25	0	0	0

Then, I remembered how ridicuous Buffy sounded at first... so I gave it a chance. I was not disappointed. This show contains just the right mixture of comedy and drama to make an excellent series that was cancelled way before its time. Luckily, Universal saw the potential and picked it up.

Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, Morena Baccarin, heck...pretty much the whole cast...they're all faces you know and love now. They all shined in this show. And this isn't just some sci-fi cult following sort of show. I mentioned it to my 71 year-old mother who enjoys Nathan Fillion in ""Castle"" that he was in this show, too. She saw that it was coming on some channel as a marathon, and decided to watch one of them. She sat down at noon to watch the pilot and had to set her DVR to keep recording the end of the marathon at 1:30 the next morning because she couldn't stay awake any longer and couldn't stand the thought of missing any of them.

I dont think i'll be able to seriously ever understand why this seriously, superb and engaging show ever got cancelled.  There is so much going with it in the 14 episodes that were aired.  I'm pretty sure it had to do with TV ratings and such.  It was a mistake though.  I'm only glad that i was able to have the opportunity to check out and enjoy a show that kept me coming back.  With its great characters, engaging dialogue and some all around quality action.Having watched this whole series.  I can say without a doubt Firefly will go down as one of my top 10 favorite TV series for some time to come.  The collection is high quality and has a few extras packed in as well.  Its a decent price for a collection that is worth so much.  Give Firefly a try and when your done you will see what others like me already know.That sadly quality shows get cancelled well before their time, but this one will continue on for some time to come.	5.0	I only wish	2006-02-15	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A8LT66GHJAOQY	"destiny morna ""destiny21"""	"I am a big fan of Buffy/Angel- so my sister got me this DVD because the creator of Buffy (Joss Whedom) also came up with this series.  At first glance, it seems like a sci fi--which isn't really my type of tv show.  But i am glad that i got this DVD- this is not your typical space/sci-fi/futuristic show.Firefly is set in the future, but unlike other space shows, it has a different feel.  Space is actually quiet and soundless.  The future seems to be dominated by Chinese. There are high tech weapons (lasers and hovercrafts) but also guns, horses and a western feel to some of the episodes.  This is a view of the future that is quite different from most space shows- more grittier, more real, more of a struggle to survive.The strength of the show comes from the characters and their interactions with each other--they just happen to be on a space ship.  ( i should have known that any show by Joss Whedom would be one of relationships, diaglogue and struggle)Firefly tells the tale of a rag tag bunch of outcasts who are on a ship (Serenity).  They are lead by their Captain Malcolm and his first mate Zoe (both would be familiar to fans as Caleb from Buffy's last season and Darla's child from angel-i forget her name.)Joining them are Walsh (zoe's husband), a doctor and his sister, Kaylee (the mechanic) and Jayne (a kind of mercenary).  Also on board is a preacher and Inara ""a companion"" prostitute.Together this group flies around doing odd jobs- some legal, some not.  They are avoiding the alliance (a quasi govenment bad guy), some strange blue handed men and ""reavers"" ( sort of space pirates-murderers) as well as their own enemies.Like all of JW's shows, the human element and relationships are ones that any viewer will be drawn to- the struggle between Walsh and Zoe's marriage (walsh can't believe that he has married such a beatiful and strong woman when he is the opposite):  the deep respect and trust between Zoe and Malcolm:  the budding romance between Kaylee and the doctor:  Inara and Malcolm's tension and attraction:  and all of them has to intereact and deal with River- the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them.This DVD set contains 14 episodes as well as the usual DVD extras including the making of firefly, Joss Whedom's comments,a gag reel,  deleted scenes etc.  It is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled- but JW himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of Firefly (another series ??a film ??).**also there is a hidden easter egg--jayne singing the folk song about him, on the last disc**So if you are a fan of good drama, intriguing characters, and witty diaglogue..get this DVD.  I don't know how it got cancelled (bad timeslot? lack of advertising?) but it wasn't because the show wasn't compelling, fascinating and different."	5.0	How did i Miss this show???	2003-12-28	1	1	0

But it attracts more than just fans of Joss with shoot-em-up/blow-em-up action, rapier wit, lust & love, awesome fight choreography and a truly compelling plot. The characters are relatable while still being admirable and one instantly finds themselves attached to them and interested in their affairs.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2P8W7LC5I09VS	D. E. Voll	"Like millions of others, I missed the broadcast of Firefly back in 02. But then again, I'm not one spending much time with any of today's network or cable offerings. The ""push"" FOX gave the show obviously wasn't what it deserved for so many regular TV viewers to have missed it as well. Throw in the other deliberate blunders, and well, we know now what a precious moment of television entertainment slipped into the black.Mid December 2005: Looking through Amazon's top-selling dvds for gift ideas, Serenity jogs my memory... saw the preview at Batman Begins and thought it looked like something I'd like to see but never did. So, I check the reviews and Firefly gets mentioned in nearly every one. Back to the list and there's Firefly in the Top Ten with five stars and I'm baffled that I've never heard of it. Needless to say, after reading at least a dozen customer reviews I knew I had to have this duo of dvds - sight unseen, blind purchase - because the enthusiasm leapt from the screen; these weren't just viewers, they were genuine fans. And most of them, like me, were accidental, delightfully surprised fans. Somehow, the signal had caught their attention - it got mine. In spite of my wife's objections, I spent the money. And on Christmas day, we unwrapped the gift (to ""Dad & The Boys"") that the whole family, wife and daughter included, has come to cherish more dearly with each and every viewing -- time and time again.At 45, should I be ashamed to be so exited over a TV show and movie? Not at all! It's made me feel young again. I'm pleading with friends to get Firefly like I begged my Mom and Dad to go see Star Wars - the elation over Joss Whedon's characters, their stories and the patiently evolving plot seems just as fresh for TV now as Mr. Lucas' did for movies then. You'll be quoting lines, speculating on character's pasts, pondering future storylines, and wanting see episodes again just to take it all in. Then... you'll want to tell others. If fact, I'm hosting a ""Firefly Hospitality Night"" next week to show the intended pilot episode and the network's forced-pilot to a group of friends. I'm confident they'll be Browncoats themselves soon thereafter.If you're reading this and have not seen Firefly and especially Serenity, the blessing of dvd technology is allowing you and thousands of others to treasure something FOX grossly mistreated. You'll see episodes in their proper order and after finishing them you can watch the movie Serenity to bring a little closure to the unfinished TV series. And if you've seen Serenity, Firefly will take you deeper into the story like Star Wars: Episode III - only much, much more gratifying.I'm not one to tell folk how to spend their hard-earned cash (or to go further into debt), but... buy these two dvds!! You'll thank me or whoever told you to check out the reviews at Amazon for Firefly - or maybe a greater power in the verse led you here?Now, I'm hoping the execs in TV-land will find the beautiful gem they dropped, pick it up with a kiss of joy and place it back where it belongs... in our homes weekly."	5.0	Counting My Blessings for DVDs, Ready to Watch TV Again	2006-01-26	28	26	2

I never gave it a chance because the only thing I knew about it was that it was a show that replaced my favorite show ""Dark Angel"". And now it is my favorite show, thats pretty cool for a show to replace your favorite show and then I ends up being your new favorite show. Take my advice buy Firefly the series and the movie Serenity, but watch the series first and then the movie.  If you watch the movie first and then the series it will be too late.  I never got a chance to watch the movie this summer when it came on tv and I have to say I was glad I missed it because I would have never looked into Firefly. Believe me if you never saw Firefly or Serenity I was just like you.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1L8N60DIMVF8C	dfkap	First, I have extreme hatred for a certain network for dooming this series from its outset. Never given a chance, Firefly is THE BEST SF series I've ever watched. Its original network aired episodes out of order, put it on during Friday at 8pm (which kills EVERY show), and killed it with 2 episodes in the can to great criticism by the viewing public. Despite a vast grassroots movement, it was never rebroadcasted and when I saw this season of it packaged with 2 unaired episodes... there was no way I couldn't buy it.Basically, the show is a cross between Star Wars and Maverick. A space captain and his... diverse crew fly the not-so-friendly skies in dusters sporting pistols and rifles move stolen cargo under the nose of what basically amounts to an evil galactic empire. Nine characters round out a diverse crew, each of which is a puzzle. It's just a shame that... a certain network stole some of the pieces and put on some reality TV garbage in its place.Firefly is visually beautiful in a gritty Neal Stephenson way and boasts a well-balanced sense of drama with a wonderful sense of humor. Just remember that by the time you finish your fifth episode (less than half-way through the season), you'll be beside yourself with disgust at a reality-TV heavy entertainment industry.	5.0	Beautiful...	2005-02-12	14	12	2

Finally at the urging of my fiance, we sat down to watch it. More to be able to get it back to our friend that out of a desire to really watch it.Honestly, this show took most of the first disc to draw me into the series. I watched the first few episodes with a lot of unanswered questions, much of which were 'huh, wha, and how did...' all getting no answers. I needed backstory. It took a good way into the second disc to start making connections about what was really going on and how the whole series worked.However once, I finally got into the characters, I got into the entire storyline. I needed something from them to make be want to see what they were doing next. In some cases it was a story arc, in others a few quick and simple catchy lines did the trick finally.Now I wish I had about 13 more episodes to continue a lot of unanswered questions and stories that this series left hanging. I know the movie is out there, but I think a true finish to the season would be needed to give a solid ending, or better way to continue the story of this Verse.	5.0	Needed a hook to find the 'Verse.	2006-03-28	11	10	1

It is good how the equipment and scenes are aged and dirty as you would expect for anything that has been around a while in less than pristine conditions.

Firefly gives you a very livable and lived-in feeling -- from the characters to planets to the ship. The characters are very real, very flawed, and totally believable. Each has so many layers that reveal themselves as the series continues. Also, while the overall formula may not be new, the western spin is very fresh and makes sense in the context of the structure of their civilization. Further, so many TV series plots are so transparent that they hold few if any surprises -- not so with Firefly! I have found many total shocks and even belly laughs that remain dumbfounding and/or funny even on repeat viewing.

Unfortunately FOX canceled the series too soon so some plot lines have never been answered.  (For die hards you could read the comic book series).

They mentioned it but I didn't pay much attention really.  Then the movie came out and I still didn't make the connection, until I spoke to them again.  I went online and read the reviews.  I have NEVER seen this many 5 star reviews for anything.  I realized that I must be missing out on something great so I purchased both the series and the movie simultaneously.  I also started to record the series on TV and watched them too.  One episode is all it took.  Everything everyone is saying is true.  I am a rocket scientist and just the fact that there is no sound in space was enough for me.  Anyone that would have taken the time to think about something like that and the nerve to make a show without sound in space (like it is supposed to be) had my never ending respect.  I've seen all of the episodes (finished them last night) but haven't seen the movie.  Best money on a series I have ever spent.  When are they going to realize this show needs to be brough back?

It is too bad that during it's initial run that it was cancelled 1/2 way through it's 1st season.  Only the true Browncoat followers know how great this series is!  If only the network would have given the series a chance and put it in a much better viewing slot, the would have seen how great of a series this could have been to them!!  But they lost their chance.  This series is terrific!!!  I enjoy viewing it over and over and over again!  It's addictive, in a good way!  Get the series and give it a chance!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ALQ5KVFWPJ6BE	"digitalartist ""artist"""	when you have the perfect casting, they all have chemistry, like in Seinfield, Friends and X- Files you get a great show. I remember starting to watch this on tv back in 02 and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately as I got hooked, Fox moved it around and as I understand it showed in the wrong order and I do remember they did not show the first episode which explains Serenity's roots either at all or way into the show.SO... now I get it all in order and I LOVE it. I love Mal ( Captain Reynolds) played by the charming and gives good face, Nathan Fillion, he's a dark and battered character with a smidgen of a heart and soul left buring and when he lets that show, its a good day! He takes a good beating too. the action is great. story by Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel) his character development is amazing , the language used is unusual and makes the characters all the more people you want to meet, to get to know and hang out with. Capt'ns right hand woman is strong and smart, the mechanic is a gal with kindness and sexiness and Ron Glass plays a preacher with a past that I am dying to uncover. Everyone on board is special and adds to the crew and your experience as a viewer in their life.  It's a western set in space, they have space ships with the best pilot ever who's a leaf on the wind when he needs to be,but no tractor beams or laser gus, just guns with bullets. I recommend this dvd set to anyone curious. go to the official Serenity site and check it out. You'll not be dissapointed.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	I picked up all 14 episodes of Firefly after having seen Serenity in the cinema. Like the film, the tv series Firefly is a truly great piece of Sci Fi. Funny, wry, touching, poignant, frightening and scary are all adjectives that apply to Firefly.It is also an example of the genre making serious social comment, for example the struggles of the individuals who crew the Firefly class freighter - Serenity against the politically correct and interfering Alliance Government, an entity that appears to be colluding with, or even in hock to Mega Corporations.Now I wonder just where the parody could be there....Sadly this boldness probably contributed to the show's early demise though.Set 500 years in the future, amidst strong undertones of the Old West, Mankind has colonised planets and moons beyond the Earth. A recent war between the Separatists and the Alliance Government has ended with total victory for the latter.Despite being peaceful and benign on the outside, the Alliance is completely ruthless in going about its aims, and tends to step on anyone who gets in its way.Eking out an existence among the outer rim planets, is Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew of largely former Separatists. Nathan Fillion makes for a wry and sarcastic Mal Reynolds, even if the character does nod towards Han Solo at times. Among his crew are Simon, a young doctor and his sister River who is a volatile psychic. Both are being hunted by The Alliance. On board the Firefly class freighter - Serenity, this crew smuggle various cargo and take passengers on a 'no questions asked' basis.Like the film, the tv series casts the characters as real people and this makes them so identifiable and likeable. When they have their rough moments, the viewers tends to find themselves caring about them and their fate.Apart from The Alliance, the crew of the Serenity have to contend with hordes of Reavers. These are horribly mutated space cannibals who raid and pillage, with the intention of capturing people, so as to eat them alive......The main reason for cancelling the show so early into its initial run would be appear to be an attack of gutlessness at Fox, where a company which is normally very pro Government simply did not want a show that advanced the individual, and cast the government into the role of aggressor/villain.The series did not pull in significant viewing figures but other shows have run with less viewers for an entire season, and have then been allowed to build.... So why not this particular series?A suggestion for the poor figures is a boycott by enraged Buffy and Angel fans who were trying to make a point to Joss Whedon, for cancelling both of their favourite series at this time.Another suggestion for the poor figures though is just how much promotional effort did Fox actually put into the show?I still believe though that the decision to cancel by Fox was probably driven by internal politicking, combined with the already mentioned unhappiness with a tv series that portrayed government in the role of the villain. It is a shame because if Serenity had been allowed to build, then it could have gone on to be as big as either Buffy or Angel.This is a puzzle though because Fox has continually supported the Simpsons which has never been afraid of political satire.....Universal now own the rights to the big screen versions and apparently two more are planned after Serenity. I for one certainly look forward to seeing them. Maybe Fox would consider selling on the tv rights to someone else who would be prepared to make a go of it.Anyway  do see Firefly and Serenity for yourself, if you have yet to do so, and be entranced by the unique charm, character, and riveting plots that the tv series and film have to offer. I believe that you will seldom find a more rewarding viewing experience.	5.0	Has its place in the Pantheon of great Sci Fi shows	2006-06-06	15	12	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1OKMIT8B373YD	djhexane	I remember hearing about this show and seeing few advertisments when it was first broadcasted on Fox, I perked my interest but I missed the shows due to having to work and such.  And then It disappeared from existence never to be heard from again, until now.  A fellow cashier bought it and told me it was awesome and since I like some Science Fiction shows, I thought maybe I should...and I did.  This is one of the best scifi shows ever created.  What it is is a science fiction western in space.  There are no alien races or anything, it's just human who teraformed various planets to inhabit themselves and they colonized out there (ie: the wild west in space).It's really creative and has some very interesting characters.  Like the captain who has personal issues, his first woman who always follows orders, her husband who's a wimpy funny guy, and the very attractive &quot;space hooker.&quot;  There's others and things get really complicated when they pick up a doctor and his sister who are wanted by the Alliance (the typical corrupt gov't power).If you like science fiction, westerns, and some comedy...you need to get this.  Lets hope the movie (&quot;Serenity&quot;) does excellent and is able to revive this show.  Or maybe the sci fi channel will pick it up, after all, they made Stargate Sg-1 one of the most famous scifi shows ever...after FOX dropped the ball.  They do that a lot it seems...	5.0	Is FOX on Drugs?	2004-07-08	7	6	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30G4E3XP46D9D	"DJK ""Dave from Philly"""	This show is probably my favorite TV series ever. I discovered it years after it ran, but have watched the whole series plus the finale, Serenity, which was released as a full-length feature film, several times. I like to watch the series in order, from beginning to end, occasionally repeating my favorite episodes.This series has it all: action, adventure, excitement, and more than a little humor. The acting is outstanding; the cast is five-star and manages to create characters that draw you in and make you love them. I especially like the Tams, and watch scenes with Summer Glau again and again. (Too much snow on the roof can cause the ceiling to cave in. His brains are in grave danger!)If Firefly has a down side it is its brevity. One season plus a full-length feature do not do this cast justice, and, to paraphrase the show's preacher Shepard Book, there is a special corner in Hell reserved for the people who decided to cancel this series! I just finished watching the whole thing again (for at least the fourth time, which is not typical for me) and am depressed all over again at the loss. If this show failed to get rating then it is not the fault of the cast or the writers; blame the studio's marketing department. (As I mentioned, I never even heard of this show until years after it was canceled, and SciFi is my favorite genre! You can't blame that on Nathan Fillion and probably not on Joss Whedon either!)If you like Westerns, you'll like this series. If you like SciFi, you'll like this series. If you like Gina Torres (and how can't you?) then you'll like this series. Just give the first episode a try, and you'll be hooked.	5.0	Outstanding Romp through Space	2012-02-03	2	2	0

If this series would have continued I think it would have definitely given sg1 a run for its money as the best scifi series ever.  This is one of the most unique scifi shows I have ever seen.  The mix of western and science fiction was a great combination.  The show and cast were well beyond their time with this show.  If you haven't seen it and you love scifi, buy it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	"""...burns half as long.""  By that reasoning this show should not have lasted ten minutes.  Joss Whedon has created an incredibly believable world, a surprisingly effective mixture of the Old West with Science Fiction, with an ensemble of character actors at its heart that shine as brightly as the cutting-edge special effects surrounding them.  The writing in this show is exceptional.  The acting is superb all around, even all the guest actors that show up give good performances.  The only gripe I may have had with the creation of the show is all the hand-held cinematography.  But this show is a different animal.  They mix in the special effects shots with the same type of camera-work, as if some bystander is capturing all the effects as they happen, which makes for an immediate feel to the scene, special effects and all.  The idea is ingenious, and the fact that the visual effects are all top-notch and extremely expensive make this one of the most effective Science Fiction shows ever created.  If you love great Science Fiction with action, humor, excellent writing, solid acting and a collection of some of the finest visual effects creatively rendered then look no further than ""Firefly"" for a solid Sci-fi fix.  I will warn all newcomers, however, that this is all they made before the show was cancelled.  Believe me, with a show this well-made, the episodes burn up by like a brushfire on a windy day.

While Firefly was clearly a TV show, and thus wasn't able to draw the kind of funding that would have made it even shinier (unlike the movie, Serenity, coming out Sept. 30th), for what it was, it shone.

We think of them sort of as ""tv comfort food"" and return again and again for any number of reasons. Firefly is one of those shows - All these years later, the dialoge sticks in your head and you realize you sort of quote it and find certain phrases popping up in daily life. For example...""See this? This is the chain of command. It's the chain I take and beat you with"" or ""Aim to Misbehave"" and the always appropriate... ""Big Damn Heroes"". Firefly Fans did the impossible and forced the studios to give us a full length movie (Serenity) and there are discussion groups and forums based on Firefly all over the internet.

What I will tell you is that I recently purchased the Firefly series again (my first copy was given to a friend), so that I could introduce my husband to this show that I've been raving about since we met. (Plus, Jayne reminds me a little of my wonderful husband! LOL)After the 3rd episode, my husband turned to me and said ""They cancelled this show WHY?"" ... needless to say, he loves it as much as I do! The characters are so easy to feel for - you quickly become involved in their lives, and care about what happens to them. A prime example - my husband started asking after the 2nd episode, ""Does River ever get better?""One of the things I love most about Firefly is that, even though it's set 500 years in the future & on a space ship in another galaxy, you're not inundated with images of these futuristic people, with their blasters & rayguns everywhere. Yes, there is laser technology, but the common person uses weapons that we would see today - handguns, and the occasional sword.Personally, I think Joss Whedon did an amazing job in creating a future world for humanity, and I really enjoy the blending of Western & Asian cultures in Firefly. It's a believable scenario, and watching Firefly doesn't require that ""suspension of disbelief"" so common to most science-fiction programs.If you're considering buying the Firefly series, don't think about it - do it! You absolutely won't be disappointed - it's a wonderful, engaging program, and well worth your time. Oh! And Nathan Fillion is a Star Wars fan - if you watch some of the scenes closely, you can see (in the background) a miniature of Han Solo in carbonite in some of them.Yes, ""Shiny"" is now part of our regular vocabulary - and I even use some Mandarin slang - ""Fei Yu"", for instance!"	5.0	Shiny!	2011-02-14	4	4	0

This quickly canceled Sci-fi TV series from Fox made a big splash among fans of quality TV - Firefly was just too good for American TV!  That is especially true the usual ""light"" crap associated with FOX.Firefly is NOT the usual ""space-opera"" but has it all... action, humor, honor, sex, a ""wild-west"" feel, an unusual visual filming ""noir"" and extremely good character development.  The emphasis is NOT the current trend in Sci-fi with aliens and bizarre shock takes but with realistic human interaction and an appeal to comradry... Moreover, this is NOT your usual blah-blah drama either.  There is NO BEEPING out of expletives - they are in Mandarin!  The dialog is a facinating mix of future, slang, and multicultural multilingualism... a nice refreshing change and not the least difficult to handle.  Here there is real life love and confusion...The series was never given the chance to gain a large audience with weekly changes of air time and dates and thus failed the fox-test before the season ended.  The DVD collection, finishes most of the story lines but still leaves you wishing there was more (darn - do a movie).Firefly is a rare gem when it comes to actor compatibility and dedication to a series and it shows...

It varies from being hysterically funny to tragic to downright terrifying.  The writing is incredible; all the dialogue is fresh and smart.I've watched a lot of sci-fi shows, and this is by far the best--but beyond that, it's the best of ANY kind of show I've seen on television in terms of cast/acting, characters, writing, plot and pretty much anything else I can think of.  Usually with shows, I get focused on one particular character early on and don't care much about the rest, but Firefly has incredible character development.  Every single regular character is a delight to watch, and every single episode is superb.  That it just ends like that, so prematurely, is heartbreaking--there aren't any other shows of this caliber out there.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A31SJA6RUV406I	dottikins	"I hate being a sucker for the networks. They air a show with some originality, with snappy writing and good acting, and cancel it after I've fallen in love with it. It seems like the kiss of death every time I watch a new show. I've learned to skip the first season and catch the reruns during summer if it survives. I rarely put myself out for unknown TV series anymore--I've been hurt, y'know? But FIREFLY was different. Firstly, it was the brainchild of Joss Whedon, the genius behind BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Secondly, I can't resist the temptation of a good science fiction show. And thirdly, it was a SF/Western hybrid show airing on Friday night on FOX (i.e. the timeslot o' death)--there was little chance of survival even to the end of the season. I watched from the first episode on, knowing I was probably going to get burned and not caring, just wanting something interesting and entertaining from the brain of Joss Whedon. How was I to know I was going to fall in love? And fall harder and more painfully than I've fallen in a long time--with the bruises to show for it?FIREFLY's strengths are obvious: the writing, the cast and the concept.The writing is pure Jossian goodness. Joss Whedon is a funny, funny man, and the show never lacked for a sort of character-driven, quirky, graceful humor. Beyond that there is the subtlety of the character development (this is SF where the characters are the showpiece, and not the tech or ideas!) and the able use of emotional power. ""Out of Gas"" was one of the best hours of TV I've seen in years, and I include THE SOPRANOS and everything else on HBO. It was beautifully structured and emotionally powerful. The whole episode had a plangent ache to it, portraying death unlike most of TV. Death isn't about killing--it's random, it's cold and it's solitary. One of the characters says that everybody dies alone, and this episode doesn't just spout such philosophy, it proves the words with a punch to the gut.The cast was perfect. Adam Baldwin as Jayne, the mercenary with more firepower than brainpower, was my favorite. He was a simple, hulking, menacing idiot of a man, but he also was a human being with needs and instincts of a kind. Nathan Fillion as Mal, the cynical Independent captain, had these purely lovely line readings that made me adore him. How can a girl resist a man with cynical eyes, floppy brown hair and a voice made for sardonic irony? Who could take a character that comes from such a venerable archetype (think Humphrey Bogart as the rebel who professes not to care but actually does) and make it feel fresh and living? Sean Maher as Simon--a smallish role so far, but he played the doctor with a sad sort of hesitancy that felt unshowy and real. Morena Baccarin as Inara the space prostitute, had the hardest job. Not the most screen time but she made the role bearable by playing the honored and distinguished prostitute with an unruffled serenity (all in her eyes). Alan Tudyk as Wash, the pilot, got the funny lines and had the comedic chops to make them funny onscreen. And Gina Torres, as Zoe, the captain's formidable righthand woman, just plain rocked. Her face, her reticence, her little twitch of an eyebrow, told a person that she could kill you with her bare hands in ten seconds flat if there was cause to be any killing. She was lethal, sarcastic without words and utterly cool.The concept was the clincher for me. So much of science fiction relies on the crutches of aliens and unbelievably advanced technology, in fantastical invention, while the quiet and complicated human stories are left ignored. FIREFLY had a coherent vision of the messy future human beings have fashioned for themselves. The Alliance is the Big Brother-like central government controlling the high tech worlds. The fringe worlds are peopled by settlers, colonists as likely to use a horse as a hover train, scraping a living from the dirt. Tech use varies from planet to planet, as do cultural customs. All the dialogue is in English peppered with Mandarin phrases. Politics has created strange patterns of human settlement and resentment. This future is a result of people, ordinary and great, who lived and desired and created. Nothing is simple. There was a Civil War, with the Browncoats (Independents) fighting the encroachment of the Alliance, a centralized government seeking to unite all of humanity under one umbrella rule. The Alliance won, Mal and Zoe (Browncoat soldiers) lost, and now they have a ship, Serenity, Firefly class, doing odd jobs. The world-building had actual thought in it, much more like serious SF novel than a typical TV show.The saddest fact about the show's cancellation for me was the wasted promise. They aired twelve hours, and the DVD has three more episodes. There are a handful of great episodes (""Serenity,"" ""Out of Gas"" and ""Ariel"" are all amazing), and the rest are nothing less than entertaining. The show was just finding its feet. There were plot threads left dangling. There were stillborn romances barely out of the flirtation stages--and as any viewer of BtVS knows, Whedon is a master hand at breaking your heart. The world building was thorough but not complete. When the final decision came down to cancel the show, I was honestly too angry to be sad. It was an obscene waste, to stop this amazing story right in the middle.Thank God for this DVD set. Buy this, support Joss and the studio. It's stuffed with extras: a gagreel, EIGHT audio commentaries, deleted scenes, Joss singing the theme song. And thank God for the movie: a feature film on the big screen and the hope of resolution."	5.0	It Was Love at First Sight	2003-09-20	7	6	1

I'm 50 and I can't wait for summer every year where I get to watch Firefly in a decadent weekend culminating with Serenity. I don't write reviews. I never liked Joss Whedon or that Buffy Crap.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A6IXVQHAILS47	Douglas	So, I read all the reviews I could to see whether or not the Blu-Ray version was much better than the DVD's up-converted. The reviews seemed to be 50/50, half the reviews saying the Blu-Ray images blew the DVD out of the water, and the other half saying it didn't look any better. I took the plunge, sold the DVD's to relatives and bought the Blu-Ray discs. I have now watched the first four episodes on disc 1, and I can confidently say...  I'm not sure.I was not really blown away by the difference in quality between the Blu-Ray version and watching the DVD's up-converted on my Blu-Ray player. I believe there are places, certain scenes, (maybe the outer space shots) where the Blu-Ray shines a bit more, but I am not overwhelmed. I am now wondering if the movie (Serenity) will be different. That will be next on my agenda.I still give the review 5 stars because this is an amazing fun show.

During the movie I began to guess this had come from a TV series, but I didn't get to watch the episodes until some time later.After viewing this futuristic world, with characters that might be described as space cowboys, I was disappointed that someone had canceled this show too early. There is a good mix of action and comedy. The characters live on the fringes of space, separating themselves from the heavy arm of the government, while making a living dodging space-mad reavers. Their ship is a nomadic home among the few planets they can find, hopping between settlements full of other not-so-lawful folks trying to get some breathing space from the law.I would recommend this series to any sci-fi fan."	5.0	Was canceled too early	2009-03-08	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1BM4WNBJIK2JW	Douglas Vanderpool	I'll explain the title of this first I suppose. My girlfriend had never seen Star Wars, and it took me 4 years to convince her to watch it with me, and when she did she actually kind of liked it. She also liked the 2009 Star Trek, and other than that she basically loathes science fiction. I started watching this on my own, and she came in and sat with me to watch an episode or two about halfway through the season, and when I got back from work the next day she'd already caught up. We watched a couple more that night and then when I got back the next day she'd finished the season. Enough of the other reviews cover the basis of the show so I won't go over that, but if you like cowboys, if you like outer space, or if you like to laugh then I cannot recommend this show enough.	5.0	Sci-fi good enough for my girlfriend to watch it without me	2013-03-05	1	1	0

Firefly has a little bit of everything in it-Sci-Fi, Drama, Comedy, and basically anything else you can think of. The characters are all very unique and they all have a huge part in the show which makes it easier to connect to each one and understand their story. It is hard to find anything else that hasn't already been said about Firefly so I will end this review by just saying buy this series. I have the DVD set and it has every episode in order with some great extras. Overall Firefly is an amazing series and this set does it justice.	5.0	The Best Series Ever	2013-03-23	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ECY43LSOMD1O	D.

A book, a comic, anything would satisfy my curiosity, but to my amazement I discovered there was a whole tv series. Thanks to this country's ludicrous fascination with reality shows I had long given up on most of television, and so unfortunately I missed out on this when it aired on FOX. But after watching the movie, I did not hesitate on picking this up and was not disappointed. What makes Firefly so special are the characters, not only do they have great chemistry with each other, but you really genuinely find yourself caring for these people and the adventures they find themselves in. Of course it doesn't hurt when there's a hottie like Morena Baccarin on the show.If you liked the movie, pick this up.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHLWDWD37M0PN	"Dragashani ""Eclectic"""	Admittedly, I was one of those people who didn't give Firefly much of a chance when it first debuted.  Work among other things kept me from watching more than a handful of episodes before the abrupt cancelation, but what I did see had me intrigued.  At least, I'd figured I'd be able to catch up on enough reruns before the next season started to fully understand what was going on.  Obviously that was a bad plan on my part, so thank god someone wised up and decided to put this series out on DVD.The acting is stellar, which is surprising considering, with the exception of Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, and Alan Tudyk, I'd never heard of most of them.The slowly revealed plot of the series, as well as the individual episode storylines were all intriguing concepts as well.The down side?  Television wasn't ready for a serial science fiction show when this came out.  We'd spent too many years raised on crap like Star Trek, whose storyline ended after an episode or two.  The only ongoing plot there was the Star Trek franchise. Firefly was more for a thinking audience.It's too bad that Fox television chose to pull the plug so early on this show, leastwise without giving it much of a chance.  If the success of the DVD sales was enough to launch the movie Serenity, maybe the success of Serenity will spawn some sequels.	5.0	A Lost Goldmine	2006-01-01	0	0	0

At first I was skeptical about watching a 'space western', but Wedon and company have created an intriguing world with compelling characters.  The humor, compassion, and personal struggles of the main characters unfold as the series progresses and you slowly develop an appreciation and affinity for each character. It doesn't surprise me that the show was canceled after 14 episodes (only 13 aired), but Fox made a big mistake not giving this series another season to build it's already fanatical fan base. Buy this series, own it, and watch them repeatedly.  You will not regret it. The characters are fantastic.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ABJ7L9X2O5TJ4	D. Smith	"I have been a Joss Whedon fan ever since Buffy the Vampire Slayer (I own that entire series on DVD, too).  When I first saw the TV ads for Firefly, I wasn't sure I would like it (I don't really like westerns).  But Joss Whedon's name was enough to get me to watch, and I was hooked!  Other than some scenes on horses, and a wild west feel to the frontier, I wouldn't really classify this as a western at all.In Joss' shows, the dialogue is always excellent; okay, on Buffy sometimes it was corny.  But I have never seen a writer who could go from serious (well, as serious as a vampire show could be) to hilarious better than Joss.  Firefly is a believable concept (no aliens, just man expanding into the universe as he once expanded from continent to continent), well-executed, and lots of fun.  You care about these people, and you can believe that they care about each other (even Jane, somewhat, although he doesn't like to admit it).  The dialogue itself, and the timing of the delivery, is always right on target.  In comedy, they say timing is everything, and Joss has mastered that.This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, and of course I had to get ""Serenity"" when it came out, too.  Excellent wrap-up of the series, but why oh why did it have to wrap up at all?  Fox should have renewed this series!  Let's hope they learned from their mistake, and won't cancel The Sarah Connor Chronicles prematurely!In summary, this is a GREAT TV show, and I love it!"	5.0	WOW!

The characters are believable and unlike many other recent shows, you really come to care about them. It would be a shame if this story could not be told. I sincerely hope that Firefly makes a comeback.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17D77DFID0GZG	"dsrussell ""greyhater"""	"Over 3,000 reviews and counting. So here is my two cents (soon to be lost in a sea of thousands of other pennies).Like many, I never saw this short-lived series when it first aired. I never saw BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, nor ANGEL, nor have I watched the current DOLLHOUSE. Joss Whedon? Who is he? Then again, I don't watch any TV series on a regular basis because I don't make an effort to know what day or what time they are on. If a TV program comes on, I may watch it if it interests me, otherwise I move on to something else or pop in a movie (I also missed the entire 4-year run of BSG, but bought that series just recently). So how did I come to see this series?Well, it started when I rented the movie SERENITY on a lark, and the film surprising me. A western in space? Sure, why not? It makes perfect sense to me, and I liked the movie OUTLAND (which was HIGH NOON in space). And while I like good science fiction and a good western, I usually don't see both in one movie. Plus, the heroes (I use the word loosely) in this film are an odd mix of pirates, thieves, a man of God, and even a prostitute, but all have some sort of code of ethics ... well all except for the character, Jayne;).Did I feel SERENITY was a great movie? Nope, but it was sure a heck of a lot of fun and had some really witty writing (I ended up purchasing the dvd simply because I felt it was a movie I could enjoy repeat viewings). So what happened? My son mentioned FIREFLY and lent me the series. Turns out that is the worse thing that could have happened. Why? Because I slowly began to get very involved with the series and its characters (this wasn't immediate, it took me several episodes). Of course I bought the dvd set. That was a no-brainer. But I'm a bit bummed. Once I watched the entire series, I knew there would be no more episodes. No more FIREFLY. No more SERENITY. No more witty dialog popping up at the most unexpected times and places. At least I now know who Joss Whedon is.This series is now classified at cult status (like the original STAR TREK when it was cancelled after the third season). Perhaps its status came about because its life was cut so short (it didn't run for even one full season, and one can ""thank"" FOX for this blunder). There wasn't enough time to muck it up, but enough time to get one hooked. There were also many questions that need to be fleshed out (the River character especially, but also Shepherd Book, as well as the shadowy agency in the Alliance -- ""two by two hands of blue"").Is it really a 5-star series? No, probably not. The acting varies from being a bit stiff at times to very good, but the cast really grows on you as you watch. I mean, how can one not like the slow witted and out-for-yourself Jayne? Or the soldier woman Zoe? Or Mal? Or ... you get the idea. But let's face it, not every episode is a gem, but even the worst ones were entertaining. My favorite episode, and I have several, is ""Out of Gas"". I rarely have belly laughs when watching a western or science fiction (although the new STAR TREK movie was just as witty), so I'll just call FIREFLY refreshing with its wide variety of very different characters (some with mysterious or murky backgrounds) packed on a run down boat in space. So yes, FIREFLY is worth a 9 out of 10 (or a 5-star rating) in my book. And from the reviews I see here, I guess I'm not alone when I felt twinges of sadness and wanting to see more. And because it won't happen, I consider that realization a bummer."	5.0	Bummer.	2010-03-17	4	4	0

Good writing, good acting, an in depth plot-line with each character adding context and sub-plot in every episode, and a wonderful world created with a strong push on reality.  An all around wonderful series.The DVD Box set is a good size with a well made box.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A6LUXI8I8BU6P	"D Strick ""Entertainment D"""	What more can we say about Fox network execs and their stupidity? I have a theory that sometimes it is best for a show to burn out bright before it gets stale, as with Futurama, but Firefly was never even given the chance to hit its maximum illumination.  Running the second episode first instead of the awesome 2 hour premier?  Stupid.  Dropping the viewers right into the middle of the world without even knowing the characters?  STUPID!Recomendation:  Buy the set and watch all 14 excellent epidodes in the order intended.  This show takes Star Trek tech, smashed it with the used look of Star Wars (Original Trilogy) and throws in the wild west for good measure.  In the middle of all this we meet a band of charming and intricate characters that Joss was able to have us care about in the very first episode on the DVD.  The cast is 100% excellent all the way around.The wild west theme seems strange at first but grows on you very quickly.  It kind of makes sense too.  Sure we have space faring tech but we just terra-formed this planet to colonize and dumped people on it so yeah they live in shacks and ride horses and use what's available.  Sure it might be a desert, its probably hard to terra-form a dead planet to green Earth specs.  It would take time for a planet to be changed in that way.Technological aspects aside the show is just awesome.  The characters and dialog shine and you just end up loving them.  By the third epidose you're laughing along with their in-jokes and care about their lives.  Not many a show can pull this off.  Serenity has the best captain around.  You might say he's a bad/nice guy like others try to be in other shows but never have I seen it pulled off so well.  You just know that Malcom Reynolds will try everything he can for a peaceful resolution but if he has to kill you he won't mind.The concept of America and China forming the basis of the planetary Alliance is also original.  Its cool that when the characters get upset or curse the lapse into Chinese.  Think of the Alliance as the Federation from Star Trek and the browncoats or border planets as rebels who hate those tight pants bureaucrates meddling and you get the idea.I could go on forever and it seems just amazing that all this was presented in only 14 episodes.  Just watch them.  Then curse Fox in Chinese.	5.0	Fire Up the Firefly!	2006-02-28	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKLWIM6G1VYE7	Dude	"Obviously the series as such is fine.  All the indoor/outdoor scenes are in full HD, the space scenes were upscaled and it shows, but that's not a deal breaker considering the additional content of the blu-ray set.The problem is that the disks themselves were extremely poorly authored.  For example, clicking the ""disc menu"" button on the remote control does not actually return one to the disc menu, it simply doesn't work at all.  This isn't specific to a DVD player either, it happened on two different models tested (Samsung, PS3).  The disc menu navigation doesn't work right which results in one being dropped out of the disc menu altogether.Perhaps more importantly whoever mastered this DVD thought it would be a good idea to add anti-piracy notices to the end of EACH episode, in multiple languages nonetheless.  Here's a hint, a few seconds of anti-piracy text doesn't stop pirates, that really shouldn't be news.  Still, instead of making the anti-piracy stuff into one chapter they created 8 CHAPTERS out of it so that one has to hit the remote 8 times in order to advance to the next episode.  This totally breaks immersion.We own approximately 900 DVDs and Blu-Rays and not ONCE have we experienced such a poorly authored disk.  It's 2011, this shouldn't have happened in the first place and there's no way it should have made it through quality control/quality assurance.  Total fail.I bought this when it was on sale for $18 for the set and for that it's acceptable.  I would never pay anything close to full price for this set and advise that you don't either.The thing to do with this disk is to rip it and put it back together without all the authoring flaws, alas now that I have read the anti-piracy notice I am aware that I am not allowed to do that."	1.0	Extremely poorly authored blu-ray	2011-12-03	68	25	43

It was by Josh and he didn't do too bad with buffy and angel.  Silly at times, but pretty cool at others.So, here's my review:It was a little tough to get into at first.  I think the first four to six episodes the cast was a little fresh and starting to discover their characters and roles.  The stoy itself is also a little fantastic.  The thing is, around the fourth or fifth episode, you stop noticing that so much.  I began to accept this as a fun fantasy.As the story continued, the crew seemed to gel more.  The story lines are pretty interesting, and really... it's a show about having fun watching it.The fight scenes are a little silly, but i think that may have been by choice.  After all, this is a space cowboy movie... and the cowboy always stood there as bullets missed and he hit.  Well.. .actually they do end up hitting a bit.  I found it funny that when the captain was naked, there were no scars...The universe of this story has it's laws, and the show does a good job of sticking to the laws of the world it's created.It takes a few viewings to get into.  There's crew that needs to be met and introduced to you, and that takes a while.  But once that's done... it's a pretty damn cool show!  It doesn't take itself to serious, and it doesn't get too corny.Oh yeah... and if Kaylee  (Jewel) ever reads this... i'd seriously like to propose marriage to her character in this show!  Damn she's awesome!If you like sci fi... cowboy bebop... Josh's other works...  I think it's a safe bet that you'll end up loving this box set.Oh... be forwarned though... there are a few scenes that were a bit graphic and disturbing.  The took place on the third disc mostly.  I think Josh had a bit TOO much fun on the special effects there.Overall though... loved it.  I wasn't a fan, but I def am now.Again... Kaylee... let's meet!  :)  I just loved those cute freckles on her nose and her whimsical smile... *le sigh*  :)	5.0	I didn't watch it when it was on TV	2005-12-04	6	1	5

"Apparently the TV show was aired out of sequence, and I can see how the story arc may have been lost.Firefly is a thoroughally enjoyable show with interesting and likeable characters, solid acting, and exceptional writing, especially within the Sci-Fi genre. It's part frontier western, part high-seas(space) adventure, part starwars (but with better dialogue). The characters all have a believable and quirky nobility, that doesn't feel forced or contrived as many of the ""star trek"" type. Genuinely funny as well. Created by the guy who did ""Angel,"" and ""Buffy"" I believe, and often has a similar sense of humor, but within its well crafted world, it's somehow less absurd.I saw the movie first, and maybe wish I had seen it after watching the series, so it would have been in chronological order. But since the movie had a lot of necessary character intorduction, it might have seemed awkward if I already knew the characters."	5.0	Sorry I missed it on TV, but it's better on DVD anyway	2006-01-31	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1TH6ERBZ27N4H	"D. Wilch ""Fred&George rck"""	Like most other fans, I didn't get to see Firefly when it first aired, but later picked it up on DVD. I have been a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel for awhile, and  when I saw that Joss Whedon had created another show, I couldn't wait to see it. And I was completely hooked with this amazing show  only 10 minutes into the first episode. It's really that good. Now every night my family all sits down together and watches an epsiode. I also have been having my friends over to see this wonderful show. Because of that I have seen every episode many many times, but they never get boring. Firefly is easy to understand if you know that it takes place 500 years in the future, all the natural resources on Earth have been used up, and people have created planets with science (not magic) that can support life. It's also helpful if you know that the U.S. and China were the last two super powers on Earth, so everyone speaks both languages.  From romance to action and from drama to comedy, this show has eveything. You will especially enjoy Firefly if you're a fan of science fiction or westerns; but even if your not, this show is worth looking into. Firefly is truly TV at its best and I hope there will be more seasons of the show after the three Firefly movies Joss is planning to have.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1SJQMO0TODJ7G	"D. Wyche ""brewsterdog"""	I'll keep this short and sweet - Firefly rocks, Fox sucks.  I hope there is a very special level of hell reserved for Fox executives who dump brilliant shows such as Firefly in favor of the absolute white trash programming that plagues the network.  And when I hear that they didn't even let the creators air the episodes in the intended order I wanted to stab a Fox executive in the eye with a fork.  They have some seriously dumb people making decisions at that black hole of television programming called Fox.More importantly than my hate for Fox is my love for Firefly - I just picked up the DVD set on a whim, looking for some good sci-fi, and was blown away by how amazing this show was in it's FIRST 14 EPISODES ALONE.  This show would have been huge had it been given a chance.  The production values are top notch (a rarity for sci-fi considering the costs involved), the writing is across the board from hilarious to sincerely dramatic, and the cast was PERFECTLY chosen.  Awesome cast, they really seal the deal and make you care about the characters.Can't wait for the movie and even better, can't wait for Joss Whedon to bring Firefly back to it's true home - television.  I hope he does whatever it takes to pry the rights from Fox and goes somewhere a little more foward-thinking (HBO!).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	&#34;Firefly&#34; is exactly the kind of science-fiction series that you'd expect Joss Whedon to make -- a sort of reverse &#34;Star Trek&#34; with a wild, untidy cast of characters.And it's not hard to see why it developed such a fanatical fanbase, even though it lasted a measly fourteen episodes -- magnificent writing (&#34;... if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.&#34;), well-developed characters, and a somewhat more realistic approach to a sci-fi western. It's a shame that the series never got to unfold to its full potential.It takes place about five centuries from now, far from &#34;Earth that was.&#34; Many planets are ruled by the Alliance, an authoritative military/corporate government that forces various planets into a unified force, which some planets are not terribly crazy about. And in &#34;the black&#34; of interstellar space, there are cannibalistic savage Reavers.The story takes place on the spaceship Firefly, whose crew mostly make a living out of smuggling and/or carrying cargo. They're a motley bunch -- including the captain &#34;Mal&#34; and first mate Zoe, who are war veterans (Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres), courtesan-like &#34;Companion&#34; Inara (Morena Baccarin), goofy pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), a menacing mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin), mysterious priest Book (Ron Glass), fugitive doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his possibly-insane sister River (Summer Glau).This odd band of people roams through various worlds, which have a sort of Wild-West-by-way-of-space-opera atmosphere. They must deal with crimelords, the Reavers, duels, kidnappings, a devious woman who claims to be married to Mal, Jayne's folk legend status, and the Alliance itself -- who have a mysterious and sinister interest in the Tam siblings.As much as I love some Star Trek series (specifically the original and &#34;Deep Space Nine&#34;), they rarely show people who fall outside the Federation and its rather smug authoritarian approach. &#34;Firefly&#34; is the exact opposite -- their enemies are the domineering alliance of planets who think everyone should be like them, and the Firefly crew glory in living a life of freedom and unpredictable semi-criminality.In the &#34;Firefly&#34; universe, technology hasn't changed who and what people are; people still grapple with the same ethical, moral, religious and political issues that we have now, and always have had. Cruelty and kindness exist in the same measure, and people still ultimately look out for themselves -- and nobody is perfect. Even their enemies have a shade of moral greyness.And of course, Joss Whedon brings his usual flair to the story -- butt-kicking action scenes, grotesque horror, a hint of conspiracy, and bucketloads of quotable dialogue (&#34;Yeah, we should start dealing in those black-market beagles&#34;) that ranges from the rough'n'ready Wild West lingo to the hilarious (&#34;Baby geese. Goslings. They were juggled&#34;).The characters are a motley family of sorts -- they don't always agree or even necessarily like each other, but they are (mostly) unified. Their colorful different jobs (ritualized sex worker, ex-soldiers, merc, doctor, priest) allow them to have even more varied backstories. All the actors do excellent jobs -- Nathan Fillion, Morena Baccarin, Alan Tudyk and Sean Maher all give particularly good performances. The most exceptional is Glau's River, a damaged young woman who says mad things about cows and wears pretty floaty dresses.&#34;Firefly: The Complete Series&#34; is a slice of rich, witty sci-fi that sadly had only a brief moment in the sun. In a fairer world, this would have gone on for years while tedious reality shows crashed and burned.	5.0	"""Yeah... that went well."""	2014-06-06	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JIMH6G7I228K	E. Caspari	"When my 14 yr. old asked for the DVD ""Serenity"" for Christmas, I looked it up online. I discovered that the film he was requesting was a follow-up to Firefly, which was a sci-fi series I had never heard of. My first thought was that it must have been terrible, but as I scanned the reviews online I realized it had a cult following. Given that the price was so unbelievably low, I opted to buy it for him.Our entire family ended up watching this series and loving it. It turns out the writer's view of outer space is a ""final frontier"" that is more than a little like the old west. It made for some humorous storylines. There aren't that many shows any more that we can get two teens and two parents to agree on, but we watched Firefly and loved it. It is witty and captivating. In fact, every time one of us couldn't be there to watch the next episode, whoever was home would ""cheat"" and watch ahead...only to watch it happily again when we all got back together. It would have been worth it at twice the price."	5.0	Firefly: The best series I never heard of...	2007-01-21	5	5	0

I came to this show not as a Joss Whedon fan (have never watched either Buffy or Angel) but rather as one who will at least sample all genre offerings on the tube. I was sold on this show from the first episode, and watched all the others except one (darned VCR screwup) and was really upset to see it canceled.I have been a fan of SF for nearly forty years, all the classic authors and all serious attempts to bring it to the screen, large and small. I don't expect anyone to take my word for it, but I know good SF when I read it or see it, and this is the real deal folks. Perhaps it sounds a bit cheesy on the surface, but give it a chance and you will discover fantastic character development enacted by a perfect cast, with stories that will resonate in your mind for days afterwards, and that compell you to watch them again and again. I preordered the set and got it just a couple of days after its release. Since then I have watched each episode at least twelve times and they still seem as fresh as ever.I have no idea why there have been a few negative comments here about Firefly. There are many shows that I don't care for, but the last thing I would do is post a negative review of anything here. What you like is your business, and it is no concern of mine if you want to spend your money on something I wouldn't give a second glance to. It is also puzzling how anyone can not like this show, but then again that's what makes the world go round. If you still haven't seen Firefly, rent it if you can, borrow it from someone, but my bet is you will later end up back here to buy the set for yourself, and will become one of the growing number of fans that are waiting impatiently for the Big Damn Movie, &quot;Serenity.&quot;Joss, keep Serenity flying and I'll keep watching!	5.0	Absolutely the best!	2004-06-01	9	8	1

This series breaks a lot of Star Trek rules, and yet, at times, has a touch of Bonanza in it. I love the character history and development found inthis one season. Like many, I now lament that there will be no more.  I like the story behind the name ""Serenity"" and I like each and every crew member, and some I even love.  This was a thoughtfully done show that could be lighthearted one moment and yet deadly serious about the true nature of man the next.  Western fans would love this as would Sci-Fy fans. Even plain movie buffs would enjoy the drama and twists found in this show."	4.0	The starship with a real life head, flies right through the imagination.	2013-10-29	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1XCD8GZLWZ0YD	"Ed M. Nadler ""Hero of Canton"""	"When I first heard about Joss Whedon doing a new series I was very excited and looked forward to it.  I actually never got a chance to see it on FOX. (Which is fine cause Rupert Murdoch is a tool).  A couple months ago I noticed it was playing on Sci-Fi and this time I DVR'd it.  First episode I watched was the second part of the pilot.  I wasn't drawn in, I didn't know the characters, didn't know it was the pilot and thought it moved kinda slow.  A couple weeks later my g/f tells me how good the Firefly show is and how glad she was I recorded it.  I watched another episode with her ""Out of Gas"" and I joined the browncoats.  I have to say that going back and seeing the pilot now I can't believe I didn't like it.  For all the people who saw an episode and didn't get it, give it another shot.  Try seeing the ""Out of Gas"" episode that gives a ""how they met"" backstory to the characters.I know that this series will be resurrected and can't wait.  Very impressed with Joss Whedon and the cast and crew of this show and movie.  Serenity rocks!"	5.0	Gotta give it a second look	2005-10-21	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AWSRZ71TKGQ8Y	Eduardo Lino Costa	I was never able to catch firefly while it was on television, I look back at how horribly marketed the series was, while on its television run, and realise that i was never going to catch it. I was however intrigued when it got a dvd release two years ago, having been told that it was worth a check, i gambled it, and bought the set. It is possibly, my most treasured DVD now, and it sits within my top 5 must have DVDs.Once you put the first episode on, and watch it, you will be enticed to sit and watch through all four discs, as each character created for this series works so well , chemistry-wise, and make such a remarcable world, that thrown together with the best special effects , incredible writting and highest production value i have seen on an television sci-fi series culminates on the apex of television series.Some of the most quotable lines you will hear, laugh out loud moments, and incredible surprises, captain Mal's crew navigates firefights, sword duels, russian mobsters(in space), crazed space canibals, and many other surprises that will keep these characters on your memory for a long while after you watched this. I have also, since purchasing this set re-watched it three of four times, only proving the great re-watch value this set has.Great moments includes Richard Brook's bounty hunter who is menacing as well as has a hearing problem, captain Mal's sudden wife who puts the ship in danger, the sword duel between mal and lor atherton, and so many other great situations.I have forced many of my friends to buy this, and after watching it, they have always thanked me.	5.0	without a doubt TV's finest hour	2005-10-14	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ALU1ZDHHYQG34	Edward C. Morgan	This series had everything that the perfect show should have.  It had fine, taut writing.  The characters were well-crafted, diverse, and multidimensional.  The setting was a weird combination of the Old West, Far East, and outer space, and in spite of how that sounds, it worked unbelievably well.  The dialogue was typical Joss Whedon - snappy, at times dark, and at times funny.  This show should still be airing everywhere, but in typical Fox Network fashion, they killed it with no more regard for it than a teenager has for an infant she stuffs into a dumpster during her Senior Prom.  Harsh words, perhaps, but pretty accurate if you happened to watch this masterful production for the few weeks it aired, only to see it taken off the air and replaced with &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Oliver Beene&quot;, &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, and assorted other dreck and drivel that Fox now makes and airs by the boatload...Anyway, the DVDs have all the episodes that aired, plus three that were in the can but never aired.  Even better, the episodes were put on DVD in the sequence that should have been aired, not the botched-up hatchet-job sequence that the Fox Morons used.  The 28-minute &quot;Making Of...&quot; featurette had a bittersweet quality to it, as evidenced by overt feelings of love for their product that the cast and crew showed.  I didn't listen to the audio commentaries because I find that they divert attention from the actual episodes.Well, all I can say is this...  If you are checking out this page, then blow the lock off your wallet, and order this DVD set.  Hell, order two in case you damage one set.If you are a Reality TV show watcher, save your money, and go back to watching the glorified test paterns you have grown accustomed to.  If you like interesting TV shows with heart, fun, darkness, and the whole gamut of human emotions, then definitely buy this set.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3M0N66TGYDDM1	Edward J. Moore	This is a great show with a great cast, interesting and varied sub-plots, a great blend of chivalry, action and comedy and most importantly, it doesn't insult your intelligence. Sci-Fi meets the old West, spaceships and six-shooters. Sounds strange but it works.I missed Firefly when it originally aired. I caught a couple of episodes on the Sci-Fi channel recently and I really started getting into the show. I just bought the DVD boxed set and have been watching all the episodes with my family.They just got everything right,(well almost everything, did they really need a resident prostitute? I have to keep my hand ready on the remote to skip some of the racier scenes for my kids' sake) from the opening theme to the interesting cast members. Just about every crewmember aboard Firefly has some kind of mysterious past and they are all thrown together on one small ship sharing adventure. I've only seen about half of the episodes so far and I'm hooked. If you like space opera with great cast chemistry (think ST:TOS, early Stargate:SG1, even season 2 Stargate:Atlantis) you owe it to yourself to check this show out.I was saddened to learn that it was canceled before its first season ended. It would be great if Sci-Fi picked it up. I hope the movie does well.I look forward to seeing Serenity in the theatre.	5.0	They got everything right. Figures it got canceled.	2005-09-29	7	6	1

Which prompted me to say ""That just ain't right"". Firefly was Joss Whedon's best production to date, rich in characterisation and witty comebacks. Mal is like Han Solo with more angst. Laid-back angst and Issues.(The only thing I have issues with is the Chinese. Subtitles please, for this Mandarin speaker can't quite catch what they're saying without the help of fansites.)And the plot. Did I mention the plot? It was fascinating and unless there's a second season I'll never find out where the story was going with, oh, *all* the characters and their interesting back-stories and possible future plots.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FG3A3V5IAEG9	"E. Frampton ""Parandot"""	Whedon has always been a high-concept man, summing up the gist of his shows in one sentence is staggeringly easy.  Buffy is the valley girl as world savior.  Firefly is the Wild West in Space.  Others have done this Wild West in space thing before but never this explicitly.  I am still on the fence about the soundtrack which still clashes no matter how much I see it.  Whedon's most daring dramatic exploit as well as his trademark is to combine extreme emotional situations with sarcastic skewering comedy, shown most ingeniously with the fake death in the Pilot episode.  His filmmaking pedigree has always been surprisingly avant-garde for television.  His directing on all of his series is singular.  Here he is incorporating jump cuts, fractured scene structures, and overall a more somber mood.  The hand-held CGI was jacked by Battlestar Galactica.  (A good show in its own right, but far more serious and heavy-handed)  All said, Whedon's guidance is impressive, and just adds to the anticipation for the Firefly movie where he has hopefully the budget and power to do what he wishes to do.  I still don't get why Firefly was cancelled, this is the network that lets lowbrow base entertainment like Joe Millionaire co-exist with intelligent well-written dramas and comedies like 24 and Arrested Development.  Firefly definitely had cult show written all over it, but so did X-Files and that lasted for 9 years and made Fox untold millions.  But they had to have some regrets otherwise they wouldn't have greenlit the movie.  Maybe the movies will be a better medium for this story, probably not, but I'll hope.	4.0	When its over	2005-08-07	7	6	1

I loved hearing the tiny little nuances that I noticed were deliberate... Or that the cast really did love it and CHERISHED the time they had on the set because that does come thru on the show.... Or that the ship was built in its entirety so that you could literally walk thru it as if it was real... or that the lighting and set designers were just as immersed in the unique vision of Joss Whedon... and all the funny little asides that happen on set.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WI7W8ZVQSK2C	El Cutachero	First let me state that I am a fan of the works of Whedon, this one included. Contrasted to Buffy and Angel, it comes from a concept seldom tried, that of mixed genres.The series, unlike Buffy ans Anngel which, not quite as gruesome as the various CSI shows, is a series that will not give children the heebie-jeebies. All the gruesome stuff is left to the imagination, even encounters with the Reivers, who practice, torture, murder, and sustenance cannibalism, as compared to ritual cannibalism, found in many cultures. Residrnts of New Guinea in the twentieth cnetury, and Fiji in the nineteenth, were notorious for practicing sustenace cannibalism. Here, the Reivers are never shown, letting your imagination run wild. Boo!Due to the explcitly sexual activities of the principal character of paid companion played by Morena Baccarat, the series should be at least PG. There is no soap opera type grappling, or NYPD Blue type nudity. At least, if there had been it was certainly unmemorable; so though the action is never shown, this is PG. Reminds me of Laurette Spang's role of Cassiopia in the pilot of the original Battlestar Glactica. In the first (third aired) episode her role was changed to that of a fully clothed nurse so the series could run in family time at eight pm.Compare this with the plenitude of half-dresed space hookers featured in the Buck Rogers series, starring Pamela Hwnsley as the wicked Priness Ardala, and Erin Gray in her skin tight silver cat suit as Col. Deering. And the plenitude of others including party girls, the most memorable of whom was Pamela Susan Shoop wearing a sideless, backless dress made of what appeared to be horizontal sections of window blinds.So in this series, most of the women dress in mechnic's clothes, pionner days long dresses and getups reminiscent of Stewart Granger in King Solomon's Mines or all the jungle set advenures and SW Pacific-set pot-boilers of the thirties and forties. Breeches and high lace boos et al.  Every else wears clothing of American cowboy movies, except for the Alliance soldiers and the upper-class exploiters. So although both men and women are equally clothed, the absurdity of dress comes from the anachronistic appearance.The next most absurd thing is that though there of plenty of whar appear to be snti-gravity shuttle craft and larger space ships, there is no mechanized ground transport, except for very small ATVs and standard railways. But where are the coal-burners? Everyone rides horses to get aroundt as well go all the way. ;0) Number two!And, since it is cheap to film in the desrt, all the worlds are arid. No ice planets or heavy forests and jungles as in Star Wars. So absurdiy number three is all planets are arid!Next is the personal weaons carried by the cast. In Star Treks they all carry phasers or some sort of disintrator like the Klingons do. Though the Discovery Channel seres Mythbusters disproved that a single hole in an air liner fuselage will not vause explosive decompreesion, it seems that Star Trek has the right idea that impackt weapons are not desirable when fighting insode a space ship. Babylon Five made this point explicitly that firearms are no longer used. Yet not only are firearms carried, they appear to be vap and ball revolbers like those used in the Amercan Civil War, Where are the tommy guns, or the modern HK MP5, M16s, or any kind of crew served weapons for close in ship defense. I only saw Jayne use an automatic weapon once. And no one appears with a semi-automatic pistol or a MAC10 so popular with drug smugglers on TV. Another absurdity.I enjoyed this series, have bought the film on DVD, and recommend it highly. Though I recognize the reality of the clothing I did enjoy looking at the space babes on my VHS tapes of Buck Rogers.The characters are all interesting, some are even sympathetic, most are a bundle of contradictiond as are real folk. No captain Picard here! It is just I think that a series, no matter when it is set, should be of one time and setting and be internally consistentnot mixed up as this one is.	4.0	Astronomicla Absurdites Abound Along With Some Truths	2006-05-05	21	2	19

To my surprise, the character development was superb and story lines were very well written.  To me, I just couldn't conceive a reason for the show being cancelled.  It was that good.  My wife, whom I credit with forcing me to actually purchase the discs, told me that the studio failed to air them in order.  You have to watch them in order to make sense of the story.  I'm glad that I had not seen nor heard of them back then, because the confusion would have doomed the series for me.  This was an unfortunate screw up that can be pointed straight at Fox Studio Execs.  Their loss, big time!  They missed out on tons of revenue from this wonderful series.  Maybe, they'll get an ounce of sanity and pick up the series sometime after the new 'Firefly' movie goes into production this summer.  As far as these discs go, the special effects are spectacular and filmed with techniques not normally seen on a TV Sci-fi show. The soundtrack music is a wonderful blend of modern and western flair.  Though not in dolby 5.1, it does fill the room nicely.  For something different, pick these discs up, you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Extremely Surprised	2004-03-06	7	7	0

This sparked my interest so I bought it and watched the whole thing in one weekend.Firefly stars an ensemble cast of actors that compliment eachother so well that the audience can't help but be drawn into their world.  The scripts are well-written and involve moments that can be touching to downright hilarious.  The sets and costumes are done so well that the Firefly 'verse is completely believable despite the show's sci-fi genre.I highly recommend these dvds to anyone.  At best this show will leave a lasting impression that will have people waiting with baited breath for the movie to come out (September 30, 2005), at worst, its a show with no commercials.	5.0	Love this show!	2005-04-29	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A21IKML7GCCISP	Eliza Hayes	I just got the DVD box set for Christmas.What I like most about the series is it turns stereotypes on its head.  One episode in particular made me start wincing and laughing.  Mal was being tortured after several horrible scenes he somehow got loose.  At the same time Serenity's crew was coming in for an impressive rescue.  By the time Zoe and two others came in the torture chamber Mal was fighting with one of his torturers.  Jayne was getting ready to shoot the person punching Mal when Zoe said this is something Mal should handle by himself.  Mal hearing this puts Zoe straight by a simple &quot;No, it isn't.&quot;I love the way the show was serious and funny at the same time.  As well as showing the more positive attributes of family and friendship.  Since watching the show back to back for several hours I notice great many episodes show them at the table eating and enjoying one another's company (like family).	5.0	Firefly	2003-12-27	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3F18SDKBDF2WR	El Loro del Fuego	A few years ago I was browsing the family selection when I came upon this boxed set that one of my family members apparently had acquired. I had never heard of firefly so I wasn't too interested in a tv series that I had never heard of before.After not finding anything else I reluctantly put the first disc into the player and, i have to tell you, I couldnt stop watching it.  Everything about this show is expertly done.  The stories, the characters, the acting, everything.  Even the humor adds to the show which is something I find to be rare in shows like this.After watching every single episode I wanted more.  Even after watching the fantastic serenity movie I wanted more.  Im frustrated how this great of a show was cancelled while others that are, quite frankly, crap run rampant on several channels.  Im just sad that I couldn't have supported this show when it still mattered.Anyway, I recommend this show to anyone.  Buy it! Especially now that it's at a discounted price.  It's a show that you'll have to watch all the way through multiple times during your lifetime.Im glad to see that this series has been rated so well and abundantly on amazon.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3Q5E9H3OT674A	Emily	If you're buying this, you are probably already aware that this less than 1 season show has a cult following.It's exactly the type of sci-fi I enjoy.  The type Robert Heinlein might write about.  It's a space cowboy thing.  There is space travel and advanced technologies, mostly, but many planets can't afford that stuff and live bare-bones in an old-west style way.I love all of these main actors, most of which I first saw in this show.  Enough that anything else any of them stars in, I find worth a watch.  The acting styles compliment each other with amazing chemistry.I would recommend this to anyone really.  I think anyone could enjoy it.  But any low-level nerd will probably LOVE it.  I do.When you finish it, and are disappointed by the lack of closure because the show was cancelled... Check out the movie made to appease us cult people.  &#34;Serenity&#34;.  There are also comics written you can look for to learn more about other characters, like the background of Shepherd Book.	5.0	Amazing show	2012-12-19	0	0	0

This series also has so many great funny moments that you never get tired of watching any of the shows. (Wash and his dinosaurs!) It's also the only show I've watched in which I like ALL of the main characters. Each person brings an element to the show that would be missed terribly if they weren't there.

Years after its cancellation references are still being made to it by other popular TV shows because of its pure awesomeness. The only thing thing is that you'll probably kill yourself after the 14th episode because Firefly will leave a void in your soul that no other show can fill, so there is that...	5.0	A Cult Following That YOU Need To Join!	2011-12-06	1	1	0

Great background music, good filming, great interaction between characters.  The show was cancelled after one year by the network, unfairly.There's a really nice thread of humor running through the entire show, though for the most part it's done seriously.  Every crewman on the space ship has a character study done on them for at least an episode, you really get to know them well.  The Hospital episode is the best!Joss Whedon did the film movie sequentially with the story off the TV series, so it continues the plot for the characters, but with or without the movie, I highly recommend this show for anyone into SF, anyone who liked Babylon 5, anyone who likes Stargate.	5.0	Firefly the TV series	2007-01-18	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	I was excited to see Firefly given the overwhelmingly positive reviews about the show. 14 episodes later, I can say I enjoyed the show, but don't quite buy into the hype.Firefly is unabashedly a Western in space, which is both a weakness and a strength. On the positive side, this gives Serenity a hard edge with a nuanced sense of morality. The characters live in a moral grey zone and the show never forces use to draw sharp black or white lines around the crew. Each individual makes his or her own decisions and none are perfect. Some of their actions might shock modern viewers, but the show also does remind viewers that life in the fringes is hard. This is a recipe for rich character development.However, Firefly carries the Western motif a bit too far. It's not just a mix between Western and sci-fi genres, but actually a Western that takes place in space. The show reeks of being a Western, from the 19th century-style firearms, clothes, frequent shootouts, and even banjo theme music. If not for the spaceship, viewers could be forgiven for forgetting that the show takes place in 2517, not 1817. At times the heavy-handedness undermined the show's attempts at world-building, making the entire show less believable and less engrossing.Overall, Firefly is definitely worth a try for sci-fi fans - IF the idea of a Space Western sounds appealing. However, it certainly doesn't reach the greatness of Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica for world-building and interesting plots.	4.0	Western sci-fi	2012-12-06	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1LNXN6E8HCTMT	Eric Campbell	I remember very clearly watching the previews for this show when it came out. My constant reaction when I saw them? &quot;This is going to be crap&quot;.What was one of the first things they show? The pilot of the ship playing with the dinosaurs and sounding like an idiot. In the episode, and when you know the character a bit, it made perfect sense in the episode. Standing alone in a preview of a show that hasn't been released yet? It made it look like an unbelievably cheesy piece of &quot;thrown together Sci-Fi&quot; junk.Unfortunately, I never watched a single episode when it aired because the previews made it look so stupid. Nothing could be farther from the truth though. This show is absolutely amazing. I've loved every episode and am dying to know the stories behind the shepherd, what was actually done (and why) to River, and the list goes on. I LOVED this DVD set.It is a true crime that due to the worst possible representation of a new show with a terrible preview, not to mention not airing the intended pilot, this show was doomed to be cut from the network.My only hope is that with the increasing sales, word of mouth, and 5 star average after 750+ reviews, that someone will pick this show back up.	5.0	TV previews killed a great show	2004-04-05	7	7	0

Now that I have it on Blu-ray, I wish I had bought the set a long while ago. The main menus on the discs is a beautiful nicety, and the 'play all' feature is definitely worth it.What is really impressing is the minute details I couldn't have seen in the DVDs. Every scene that looked questionable on DVD is infused with a breath of clarity. It might seem minor to some, but the attention to detail is what I watch sci-fi for - all the pretty tech toys. And the 5.1 sound finally almost reaches what I'd like to hear - I'd love to hear this through a 7.1 program though.I will admit, I was hoping there would be a bit more special features. There is a nice sit-down with some of the cast that was previously unavailable. But it'd been nice to see the 'Done the Impossible' DVD included, to have all the features in one box set. Maybe the ""Those Left Behind"" mini graphic novel.I would probably never bought this Blu-ray at the list price, but the Amazon offer is currently an amazing deal. I dare say the details and value are more than worth the price of admission. It's time to upgrade."	5.0	A bright light in the dark of space	2011-07-01	5	3	2

If you're this far in the reviews, you need to stop, and click, &#34;Add to Cart.&#34;  Firefly is a wonderful show that was cancelled far ahead of its time.

Once you begin to deal with the distances involved it is only natural that there will be some reversion to the rugged individualism of the frontier - no matter if it is in a starship or in a covered wagon. Humans are humans and no amount of technology will change our tendencies.  Kudos to Firefly for giving us a look at a version of humanity without the rose colored glasses or &#34;view from the top&#34; taken by so much other sci-fi.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IQIGTS9USMOK	Erik Carlstrom	There is definitely an improvement in the picture quality in this version.  The new special features are also cool and definitely nice to have new items.  The sound quality is better, but DTS HD Master Audio can sometimes have strange emphasis.  It can affect the voice tracks sometimes.  There's also a strange error that can occur after watching a couple special features.  On my player the screen would turn Green while I would hear the main menu soundtrack.  My IC's whent caput about a month after I watched this, so it's possible it was a TV issue and not an issue with the disks.  I have a Samsung BP-5000 with latest firmware, so I'm not thinking it was the player.UPDATE: Still could be the player.

Many others will have illustrated the finer points of my review, already.In my estimation, here are the best Sci-Fi shows ever (in chronological order):Dr. WhoThe original Star TrekBabylon 5FarscapeFireflyWhy, are they the best? They have captured the elusive ""cool factor"" which most television shows and movies have not.Now, just what exactly is it that makes a show cool in this way? Funny enough, it's the scriptwriting, the imagination of the writers, the actor's characterizations, and how each of these will resonate with the audience. Not a small task by any means. Indeed, it is the most difficult of all things to achieve successfully in film and television. This is why Hollywood regularly has gigantic flops on their hands despite the wads of cash which may have been sunk into their projects. As a matter of fact, I tend to mistrust any big budget film unless it has some writing/directing/acting credentials I know I can trust to give me a relatively believable show. This is not to say that Sci-fi/fantasy is necessarily believable. There must be a truth of our common experience or ""inner life"" in a production if it's going to reach an audience. The two aforementioned genres of SciFi/Fantasy are terrific vehicles for this experience as they take us outside of ourselves, and can portray effective metaphor of the Human condition without our prejudices interfering with the message. Nobody wants to be preached to about their political support of X, Y, or Z, but show a similar situation set in a far off mystical land, or on another planet with ficticious characters and history, and it's much easier to examine without taking offense. I know I'm digressing here, but cool factor isn't just ""wicked awsome"" for the lowbrow crowd. There's much to be absorbed from a well played fantasy.If you have that solid a core to your show, then you may already have a success on your hands. Look at Dr. Who, and Star Trek as teriffic examples of low budget/high quality. But when you can combine terrific special effects production values with it the way Joss Whedon has in Firefly, then you have a rare combination, indeed.On the surface, an Old Western Frontier setting with spaceships and vestiges of Mandarin interspersed with English as indicator of the historical/political landscape may be jarring and unusual at first. But watch a few episodes and you won't look back. You'll appreciate it's brilliance and wonder why more shows don't think outside the box the way Firefly does.'Nuff said"	5.0	"Firefly captures the ""Cool Factor"" in spades..."	2005-08-10	5	4	1

I have been a fan of Sci Fi for a long time now, but sometimes I thought the genre tended to get a little too unapproachable.This series,with its stellar cast (especially Nathan Fillion) grabs the essence of a swashbuckling space hero on the wrong side of the law and takes you on such a ride that you will, like me, be screaming at the ""powers that be"" - ""how dare you take this off the air so soon""!

I finished it in a day and a half...I couldn't stop!!  I was kind of skeptical at first because this same person recommended Smallville (BARF!!)to me (Sorry, I'm a Superman purist).Firefly felt entertaining and fresh from the start.  I'll admit the idea of treating a sci-fi fantasy with a heavy injection of the Old West sounded as ignorant as Lex Luthor living in Smallville as a friend of Clark Kent's at first but Mr. Whedon pulled it off remarkably.  I was never remotely interested in watching Buffy or Angel (and I'm still not & don't regret it) but having watched the entire Firefly series I can safely say that Joss Whedon is not only ambitious but he is also a very gifted story-teller.The characters are perfectly cast and come across as both tangible and believable.  Each of the actors fills out their role with captivating personality and draw you into their struggles.  The dilemma of their desire to make money by any means necessary and remain honorable at the same time brings heart to any show.  Combine that with intense action sequences, well developed characters and a decent plot and you have a recipe for great television.  Too bad nearsighted television execs don't have a clue as to what constitutes a great show.  I mean, Fox fought to keep Paris Hilton & Nicole Richie on the air but passed on this gem of a show...'nuff said!Sorry if I'm catching the train late but, hey...better late than never!  If you haven't checked out this show get it and, trust me, Serenity (the motion picture follow-up) is a ""must-have""!

I didn't see Firefly when it was on the air. I was given the DVD by a friend who knows I love good sci-fi shows. This show either made me laugh out loud, yell and scream at the tv or cry my heart out. Not once or twice, every episode. The writing is in your gut real, the actors fit together in a way that steals your heart from the first episode on. It's love at first site ladies and gentlemen. It's a drama, a love story, action adventure, realistically dark and explosively funny. The only problem is it was only fourteen episodes long. I want more!!! Way to go FOX.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ASSE8LIWW15L6	E. Yarbrough	"Firefly is the most entertaining Sci Fi series to come along since the original Star Trek. The characters are endearing and well thought out, the stories are exciting with no traces of cheese or insipid plots and the dialogue is full of heart and reality. The setting is 500 years in the future, but alien life has not been discovered yet, so it's the story of human beings trying to make it out there in the great big 'verse together where the struggle is still between each person and their own demons. There are many western settings which, until I saw this series, I hadn't realized I missed in a tv series.There are only 14 episodes, however. It was cut down early to make way for more mediocre fare and I found myself with tears in my eyes as the credits for the final episode ""Objects In Space"" came up on the screen. Didn't think I'd react so emotionally to a tv show, but this one is a real shining beacon in the murk of trite network television.I highly recommend this series!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3MHEUR4WCYMB0	"Fabian White ""'Kaze"""	Everyone else has given the 20 second history of Firefly, so I'll skip that.  What I will say is that Firefly is a fantastic series - in 14 episodes, it stands apart from all other Sci-Fi shows.  Where other shows have larger-than-life heroes and villans, Firefly has real people (and the occassional evil guys).  It's about life, in space, but life nonetheless.Give Firefly a try - the series itself, prior to the DVD set, is amazing - it tugs at the heartstrings and gives the viewer the full range of emotions.  Add in the DVD special features - commentary from the directors, series creator, cast and crew which is often jovial and informative, plus the special features and you have a class-act DVD.  It's great for anyone in your life who loves Sci-Fi, Westerns, or just an amazing series.Keep on flying, Firefly.	5.0	Keep flying, Serenity...	2004-01-08	7	6	1

To anyone purchasing, or thinking of purchasing this boxed-set sight-unseen, I caution you to watch the ""Here's How it Was..."" documentary, and hopefully it will help you to understand that in the midst the Reality Series craze, there were some trying to make a show they actually cared about on a network that was once known for being the banner carrier against network madness (remember Faux in the beginning? When we all cheered as it gained ground against the behemoths ABC, CBS and NBC? With it's unseemingly popular ""Married With Children"", ""The Simpsons"" and the first few years of ""The X-Files""? Wither Thou, Rupert Murdock??). Throughout recent years, it seems the only way to get a ""science fiction"" tv show on air is to take scripts from the biggest soap operas, re-write them on a space ship, toss in an alien or two, make sure to highlight a tense sexual triangle, and call it ""science fiction"". 'Firefly' was something more - and the only consolation in the series being cancelled is that without the outcry, the surge in dvd sales and overwhelming internet word-of-mouth, there would be no movie. With the rough-cut previews in select cities during the month of May selling out in mere hours, it is a little vindication for a series full of characters we genuinely cared about, in a ""den of theives"".

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1M8MDVOUQ11KJ	"Ferdinand Turla ""Rommel63"""	"This was a soap opera that happened to be based in space with a western country atmosphere. The ensemble cast reflected various viewpoints as to motivation and theme. Most of Joss Whedon's projects try to reflect a multipe viewpoint perspective. Every character is more apt to be developed rather quickly and evenly among the other cast members. Even the non-recurring characters are developed and explained more than many successful or continuing series develop their main stars. Unfortunately, in regards to the time the programming networks were willing to test market the series. They deemed review of insufficient audience market share by the sixth or seventh episode. Therefore they killed the show.The sad truth of the matter is Mr. whedon's style of writing requires a long development cycle. The initial release of the show already foreshadowed its demise. I could see it coming. Joss was successful in his other projects because in the Buffy series, a market was built in.The movie was out and comics and industry talk was about. The Angel series was an offshoot of Buffy and therefore characters and plot were also known and no initial building of an audience had to be grown.All the characters were highly interesting and could be developed in so many ways. Themes in morality, moral or amoral, degrees of right and wrong, the depths of psychology as to class structure and what needs and wants determine what is ultimately the necessary way to do things. If you notice I didn't say the Correct way,Proper way, or Morally right way. If you are starving, what counts is getting food. If the future is unclear then you go where the wind blows. As Nathan says ""I got no rudder, Wind Blows North, Then I go North.I enjoyed this series for its understanding of lives interconnecting with various motivations and goals unique to each character. Also I regard his filming, editing, continuity, and single camera angles and techniques superb and above par in comparison to most other shows and movies.In summary - This was a successful but very short lived show. The possiblilities were endless.Sincerely,  Ferdinand Turla"	4.0	Wester Space Opera Cancelled Before Its Time	2007-01-16	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AC1O334NBSN71	Fighting Midget	Firefly is THE most underrated television series of all-time.  During a time when reality TV is slowly but surely destroying the minds of America, along came a series that was intelligent yet entertaining at the same time.  Have you ever thought television executives were just throwing darts against a wall choosing which television series to cancel and renew?  Well, not far from the truth.  Firefly being pulled from the airways by one of the networks was the single worst crime committed by Hollywood against the American public.I wholeheartedly endorse purchasing this complete series and tuning in for yourself.  It is one of the greatest television programs ever created.  The writing is brilliant, and the acting of the series stars is top-notch.  It is a fantastic example of seeing how an entire production crew (from the producer, director, actors, etc.) all LOVE and truly BELIEVE in what they are doing.Buy it.  Buy it today.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38JAX9XYO4VWK	"""fig_ments_sorrow"""	I was mad that Fox cancelled this series and was thrilled by the release of the DVDs. As always, Josh is not afraid of strong characters and taking chances.Basically, we used up all the resources of old Earth and hopped out into space to find more. Some people thought all the planets should be under a single controlling force (Alliance) and some didn't (independents) and, after a civil war, the Alliance wins. We pick up after the war, with the crew of the firefly class spaceship &quot;Serenity&quot; (some of the crew had been independents) and their travels. Basically they are smugglers and are tring to survie out from under the Allience rule. My description may sound dull, however this series is anything but dull.There are no aliens in this series and if it had been allowed to continue, I doubt there ever would have been. Firefly about us dealing with things, about living. It is not done with any moral preaching, but with humor and elegance.The shows are displayed as originally made them, which caused a slight sense of &quot;I remember this differently&quot; but gave more power to the episodes. The extras alone are worth picking up the DVD especially if you liked the series.	5.0	Thank heavens!	2004-01-01	1	1	0

That said, this show just didn't do it for me.  It was fun to watch but I can't say it amounted to much.  There is some comedy and some action and even a little drama, but this show cannot compare to some of Joss Whedon's other shows (cough-->Buffy).  I also get the feeling that the show didn't quite know where it was going.  It's hard for me to say what exactly is wrong with this series.  It's regularly witty and entertaining, and it possesses a sort of charisma.  The thing is I didn't really connect emotionally with the show; after watching the last episode I wasn't really pining for more.  Still, the show is fun and if you want a more polished product check out the movie, which in my opinion is pretty darn good.	3.0	Overrated.	2007-12-29	16	2	14

All I want to do now is show the series to everyone I know would appreciate it and let them fall in love with the cast and the story line which I think is so original that it shouldn't have been cancelled so early without being able to get to more people.  I feel upset and frustrated that the series didn't continue and I wish that there was something that could be done about it.	5.0	Firefly Bug	2007-03-03	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FIFEQKDROR54	FireflyFan	I bought this dvd collection (and the movie Serenity) because this is the first tv series I want to watch over and over again. The characters, storylines, dialogue, the overall look...everything is so creative.  The actors are completely believable in their roles and really do have great chemistry together.  Dramatic and funny too.  Although you can watch Serenity as a stand alone movie, I would recommend watching the Firefly series first to get the full background/storylines.There's so much more to explore in the Firefly/Serenity universe, I hope Joss and crew have that opportunity.	5.0	Entertaining...Enthralling...More Firefly/Serenity Please!	2006-05-29	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3E2H992S6G0ID	firefly flown	In my opinion, the Firefly/Serenity series is one of the best sci-fi series to date. It has a 'soap opera' feel, where you are anxious to see the next episode.  It is a great travesty that this series was canceled after only one season.  The action and situations keep you entertained the entire time. The blue ray menus on the product are excellent and they include a lot of special features. A great product that I fully recommend and wish there were more of.	5.0	Firefly - the one and only (unfortunately)	2010-12-31	1	1	0

After watching the first episode we devote the next hours of our lives to watching over half of the episodes! This is so well written and cast that I can't see why it only survived one season!!!!

I am a guy who rewatches movies but rarely watches the extras outside the gag real.I have watched every episode with the comments on multiple times.  Have watched everything I can get associated with this series. Have watched the series without dialog so I can catch anything in the background I may have missed (not that having dialog means anything to me because I can quote every line).  Watched the episodes with chinese translations handy so I can catch all the sayings.  Simply put I am a fanatic for this show.  I have never fell in love with a show and characters as quickly as I fell in love with the characters in this show.  Buy this.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JFGQTVMBVG5N	flafond	Somewhat uncharacteristically for sci-fi shows, Firefly is not about space ships and ray guns (well, at least not principally). For me, it came down to the beautifully developed characters. One can only guess how much richer they would have become if the show had not been cancelled so quickly. Each character is complex, each with positive and negative characteristics, each a bit unpredictable even within their norm.I didn't start out a big fan of the plots (hence 4 stars rather than 5). The sci-fi/cowboy angle is certainly refreshing, but that in itself is not enough to carry the day. However, each one is better than the last.  This is certainly a show that was ascending, and rapidly at that. Even if the first few shows don't speak to you, keep watching - you will be rewarded.It would be remiss if I didn't mention that Inara is one of the most beautiful and graceful characters to ever grace the screen. She really could take my breath away!With all this praise, I have to say I'm a little baffled by the ultra-cult status this show has attained. Excellent, yes. The best series of all time? Not for me. Oh, and a word of warning. The movie Serenity might be OK taken on its own, but as an opportunity to bring some closure to the series and answer some questions, I found it a dismal failure.

And now that I've watched the entire series (including Serentity, the movie) I agree 100%!! In my opinion, Firefly is very nearly the perfect TV series. It's only real flaw is that it ends after 14 episodes. The show is a wonderful blend of dialog, action, humor, mystery, setting, character, science, soundtrack, and visual appeal. Put all together, it's a show to watch again and again. For me, that fact uniquely makes the purchase of this collection the best bargain of all.	5.0	5 Stars!!!

I was shocked when this show wasn't renewed after one season, since it is heads and shoulders above all other sci-fi series. Actually, it is probably above all other tv shows regardless of genre.It has very good stories, but what really drives the show is the characters, which are all excellently portrayed. Thankfully the creator, Joss Whedon, was able to finance a movie of the show called Serenity, which is also excellent. I would be happy if there were a few more movies, or at least a continuation of the tv show, even after all these years.Greg	5.0	Greatness	2013-04-19	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3EA51R6ROLN1C	Fletcherfan	I am a late convert to the Firefly fandom. I had a friend who let me borrow the set. After watching the first disc, I bought my own copy. It is a terrible shame that Fox sucks when it comes to knowing what the public will like. This show was not given half a chance. Fox did not even air the pilot until much later.The story is of a Capt. Mal Reynolds and his crew (all of which endear themselves to you). Mal just wants to keep flying. Of course the story takes place in space. But there are no hokey aliens. The bad guys are the government ( I love it already). Of course there are reavers and other no goods trying to get the captain and his crew.I love Firefly because I love the crew and I love the ship. Everyone has their faults, but they all work together and have become family. Some of my favorite scenes are when the crew is eating together or playing ball. I feel that Joss Whedon has done a superb job of characterization with each member. You only git more in more hooked as ya watch!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A338C04RKP4PVK	flyboy	"This is hands down the best science-fiction series ever -- and that's coming from a Star Trek fan from WAY back (I'm old enough to remember seeing the show when it first aired). I'm also a long time reader of science fiction books and suffer from a lifelong frustration over the fact that so few movies, and fewer TV series, seem to get sci-fi right.Here's a show that does,and its a shame so few people heard about it -- I never did when it was on the air in fact. But I saw the Serenity movie in a theater and was intrigued, so I got the series DVDs, and was blown away.This is unlike any other Sci-Fi series ever made, and a lot of it is more in what's NOT there than what is. No space aliens. No ridged foreheads. No epic space battles. No SOUND in space (a realistic touch few sci-fi shows have the guts to employ.)  No sensors, no shields -- the starring ship ""Serenety"" doesn't have any weapons at all (except the ones the crew packs in their holsters).What the show does have is interesting characters and interesting stories. The crew of Serenety, a ""Firefly class"" freelance cargo hauler, is a motley bunch, and the interplay between these very different people is well-written, well-acted and great fun to watch, as they travel from the inner ""civilized"" planets to the outer ""frontier"" ones, smuggling a little, doing an illegal salvage here and there, brawling frequently in dusty saloons and generally behaving more or less as one would imagine space pirates doing. Its a clever mix of sci-fi and western, and although one might not think of the two as compatible, the show does a good job of making it feel natural that the people, places and events that take place on the frontier planets would look a lot like, well, the frontier.What's most amazing is that these people managed to hit their stride right from the first frame. Remember the Star Trek spinoffs, each of which seemed to take a half season or more for the actors to loosen up and settle into their roles? By comparison, the cast of ""Firefly"" feel like they've been working in these roles for years. Which is somewhat ironic since they were allowed less than a season in which to show their stuff. I can only hope that that FOX or some other network with more sense will see fit to pick this show up again and give it a chance to become what it deserves to be."	5.0	Best sci-fi series ever	2005-12-21	15	14	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2EFEVXNLGVKEM	Formal Treehouse	"...because it's right on the money.  This tragically short-lived show burned so brightly before being abruptly snuffed out.  As you've probably gathered, it's a sci-fi character study, with generous amounts of action and drama.  The story-telling is compelling.  For example, one episode begins in media res (in the middle), and the scenes fromn the past are effectively blended into the same shots as the scenes from the present.The characters are mostly good people, but there's not a lot of high-handed moral pontificating.  Ethical questions are raised, rather than knee-jerk fingerpointing.  My favorite character, the mercenary Jayne Cobb, is basically amoral, though on the same crew as the ""good guys.""  He's unintelligent, though cunning, and cleverly used by the show's writers.  His relationship with Captain Reynolds is like a pit-bull on a short tether.I could go on about the special effects, the blending of the sci-fi and western genres, the subtle-yet-belly-laugh-inducing humor, but I'm not going to.  I, like thousands prior, give this one five stars.  Wish I'd known about it while it was still running."	5.0	Listen to the buzz...	2009-03-22	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AFTDNZABRQQJF	Fraelen	But then I guess it's so important that we get three more trashy reality shows about useless idiots. Anyway, This show is excellent and the dvd's are well done. I watched it when it was on, but I have to say that the dvd's were more enjoyable for me because the episodes were in order, which they were not when they were aired. Unsurprisingly, they make more sense in order and there were quite a few subtleties that I missed the first time that were very clear once the story lines were unbroken. Add to that the cow smuggling scenes are now contiguous - much better.The cast is incredible. I don't really think there's a lot that can be said otherwise, but the acting was excellent. Fans of Joss' other work can catch several guest actors that also appeared on Buffy and Angel. Speaking of which, the writing, as one comes to expect from Joss Whedon's projects, was vastly entertaining with that extra bit of flair and surprise that he does so well. He balances humor and drama like no one else.As to the dvd's themselves, the extras are great including the gag real that was cut for the cast Christmas party that ended up being the wrap party (oh, the unfairness!) and a taped audition by Alan Tudyk (Wash). The comentary is hilarious and interesting (not commentary for the blind viewers), and there is a lot of it. Joss himself provides commentary for several episodes, as do many of the actors. Aside from great behind the scenes stories and clever banter, you really get a sense of what it was like to make this show and that for the cast and crew it was a real labor of love. I was sad to see that Ron Glass (Shepherd Book) did not provide any commentary, but you can't have everything.The show was experimental in many ways, including some cutting edge effects stuff, for instance computer generated scenes made to look as though they were shot through a hand held camera. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates innovation and a good story line. I do have to say though that if I don't find out what was really going on there with all the mulitple meta-plots and teasing hints, I will never forgive Joss &amp; co. There is supposed to be a movie in the works, and it had better get made.	5.0	This should never have been cancelled.	2004-03-22	4	4	0

The behind the scenes footage is really good, though I wish that they could have included more auditions from the rest of the cast, and not just Alan Tudyke. The load time seems to take a lot longer than other Blu-Rays that I own (I don't understand why because the title screen content isn't all that elaborate).

The idea is outrageous enough to work on its own merits, but the execution is another matter. While the acting is excellent, the plots are too heavy handed and simplistic.

This makes the series probably more a drama than anything else, only in a just so much more creative setting.Really even if you don't like SF at all, there is a very good chance that you'll get hooked only halveway trough the pilot.The DVD set itself is very complete, 50% of all the episodes have commentaries (wich are very nice), and there are quite a few other intresting extra's (just Joss Whedon singing the (by the way briliant) theme song, and Adam Baldwin's verson of &quot;the Hero of Canton&quot; make this DVD set worth the purcase).And although there are only 14 episodes this set will over you ages of viewing pleasure, every episode deserves to be watch dozens of time, you'll be amazed at how many detals you keep discovering.Thereare only two bad thing about this series:1 - It's way to short, this 'verse' coulda gone on for ever, and by the time you'll seen all the episodes, it leaves you very sad and angry that there aren't anymore (so you'll just continu to watch them over and over agian)2 - It will make (almost) every other television series look cheap, uninventive and boring.Now you could go on and read all the other 700+ reviews, of wich 99.9% are positive or you could just order this set, and enjoy it, untill the movie is released (yup,for those of you who don't know yet, there'll be a movie about this series in 2005 called Serenity)	5.0	Best Series ever..	2004-03-21	5	4	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1Z9T969ND5H89	Frederick	I was not part of the cult when my daughter recommended it years ago. I saw it then and was struck with its originality, immediacy, and timeless relevance. The writing, directing, and acting are the stuff of enduring art. Each cast member is a virtuoso, and what they pull off together is nothing short of astounding. After years of not seeing it, I wanted to introduce my significant other to it, to enjoy her reaction. I had lent my copy to someone on the West coast, so it was easier and cost-effective to buy another. This time, I was blown away by it, and so was she. Firefly is compelling and timeless, and not by accident. The actors' affection for their ensemble craft leaps off the screen, and the writing sparkles.	5.0	How did corporate FOX manage to let this property go?	2013-07-25	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1OZFMJ2AD2R41	Furiae	When I heard Firefly was a space western, I made a face.  I'm not much of a fan of either sci-fi or westerns.  But since it was Joss Whedon's work, I knew I had to give it a chance.  He proved me wrong about Buffy, and I was hoping he'd do the same with Firefly.As it turns out, Firefly surpassed all my hopes and expectations.  It's quality television at its best.  The characters are fleshed out, the story's well thought out, and everything comes together wonderfully.  The characters start off as strangers but warm up to you, and each proves to be individual, yet endearing in their own way, and you begin to sympathize and care for the crew of Firefly.Whedon takes his time to flesh out his characters at a pace that's neither too rushed nor too laxed- it's just right, perfectly comfortable.  The character of River, for instance, starts off a complete looney, simpering, and frail, and by the end, you just love her to bits, and you start realizing she's not the most vulnerable one on the crew.  Perhaps she's even the strongest!Each actor plays his/her part as if they were born to play it, especially the Nathan Fillion (Mal), Morena Baccarin (Inara), and Summer Glau (River).Whedon's genius is his ability to make anything about the characters and keep it human.  Too many shows get carried away by their own genre.  Too many people make sci-fi shows just for the sake of having a sci-fi show.  For example, how many times have you seen a show with ho-hum characters and storylines, but boasted an interesting concept?  The characters seem like just vehicles to carry out the story of their environment.  Then there are the dramas that are about nothing except characters and their relationships, and you wish more external circumstances (reality) could be taken into consideration.  Joss Whedon strikes the perfect balance between the two, and Firefly boasts a fascinating, intelligent concept, while maintaining characters that are fleshed out, lively, personable, charismatic, and *live* the story rather than just play it out.If you saw it on TV and it confused you, it's probably because Fox showed the episodes out of order.  A few people have said that they loved Firefly after watching the DVDs, since Whedon arranged the episodes to show in the order it was intended to be aired in.This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while, by far.  Give it a try!	5.0	pure, utter genius; an absolute shame what fox did to it	2004-02-13	14	14	0

This series could easily be a replacement for Babylon 5, and if the movie is done as well as the tv series in regards to writing, character development, special effects et cetera, it will be a box office smash.  I love this series, and fervently wish someone would pick it up and bring it back.  With just a little bit of advertising, (Which Fox notoriously didn't do) it could attract a following as big as bab-5.  If you like sci fi series, buy this one, you will love it.

I reluctantly agreed to give this series a try and I must say I was PLEASANTLY surprised!!  My husband was in the midst of getting absolutely hooked - and I sooned joined in, too!  This show is funny, intelligent -- the characters are fascinating, the action scenes are exciting.  Firefly had me hanging on the edge of my seat - wanting to watch the next episode - just like I am with the Lost series.  You don't have to be a SciFi fan to like this show / DVD set.

Firefly maybe short, but it surely is sweet. I love the combination of western mixed with science fiction. The characters in this series are very likeable, each different in many ways. The episodes, while some have been done before on other Sci-fi series, are exciting and still fun to watch. And the ship ""Serenity"" herself is quite a ship.The thing that impresses most about this series is how realistic the show seems. It's set 500 years and the future, and instead of phasers like on Trek, they are still using basic guns like we have now. Another thing that is realistic is how the scenes in space are quiet since no sound is in outer space. Overall, this is a great series. I'm a Trekkie and I love this series.

I'd never seen a single episode, but read the super positive reviews on Amazon and figured I couldn't not like it.  While it took a few episodes to kick in, Firefly proved to be a very unique, original and wonderful series!Typical of any Joss Whedon show (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel), Firefly is filled with humorous and witty dialogue, well thought-out and deep characters, and a plethora of secrets within the episodic plot.  Underlying the entire show is a very original and interesting mix of a futuristic world with the familiar elements of the ""wild west"".  There's one scene with a gang of henchmen riding through the desert on horseback  while the rich man rides on a slick hovercraft!The only drawback of this show is the fact that it's incomplete due to the fact that it was cancelled mid-season!  Such a shame, because there's so much potential for it to blossom into a REALLY GOOD SHOW!  So much was left unanswered.  Why is River wanted so badly by the authorities?  What's gonna happen between Malcolm and Inara?  What's gonna happen with Simon and Kaylee?  What is Shepherd Book all about?Hopefully, some of those questions will be answered in the upcoming film version of the show, called Serenity.  But if you're a sci-fi fan, Buffy fan, Joss fan, or just a fan of great TV shows, I highly recommend you check out Firefly.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NXCSH2906N3C	Garrett N. Banse	I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon's work. Loved Buffy and found Angel to be good as well, with a miss here and there.That said, I believe that had Firefly been allowed to continue, it would have eclipsed both of those shows, in terms of both quality and fandom. And that's saying quite a bit.The writing was top notch, the actors were perfectly cast and in 13 episodes of an all too short season many people came to care about and take an interest in these characters. They had texture and depth. In othere words, they had a real-ness too them that is seldom seen in fictional TV.For those that have watched this DVD and listened to the episode commentaries, I thnk you'll agree with me when I say that I hope this set sells very, very well and leads to a series resurrection. Then Joss can push that big red button.Meanwhile, I think I'll be in muh bunk. ;-)	5.0	Outstanding television	2003-12-23	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2E33BQT24RCCE	Garrett Omoto	"I bought the DVD set of Firefly 2 years ago because it was an Amazon Goldbox Offer.  A friend of mine had recommended the series but I thought, ""surely this show can't be great..."".  I mean, I saw previews of Serenity when it came out in theaters and it didn't look all that interesting.  When I stumbled on the Amazon Deal, I checked the reviews and was shocked to see so many 5 star ratings compared to so very little negatives.  And although still skeptical, I figured that $17 for the entire series worth of episodes was worth a shot.The DVD set sat on my video collection shelf for another 6 months and finally I had absolutely nothing to do so I popped in the first episode.  The production value seemed a bit low and it started out in some kind of flashback which reminded me a little of Starship Troopers and I initially thought that I had made a mistake in purchasing the set.Then something amazing happened.  I don't know at what point in the pilot episode my opinion turned but by the time I finished watching it, I was hooked.  I watched an episode a night and had to pause when I came to the last episode because by that time, I knew that this amazing series was concluding (or at least there would be no more episodes or stories, save the feature, Serenity).Since then, I've been like Mel Gibson's character in Conspiracy Theory and whenever Firefly comes out in an Amazon Goldbox, I feel compelled to buy it.  I have two DVD sets and the BluRay edition.  I've loaned out my DVD sets and guarantee to those borrowing it that they will love it.

Star Trek and Star Wars both pale in comparison.  John Updike said that Firefly is both the best science fiction and best western television show ever broadcast, and he is right. Set far in the future when humanity has occupied multiple planets formed into an ""alliance"", Firefly is a transport spaceship that operates at the outer edge of the Alliance where the settlements are fairly new and still developing, much like the Old West in America.  The characters have depth of personality, the stories are actually interesting, and the music is fantastic.  Watch Firefly and you'll be hooked, even if you aren't a big science fiction buff; the stories are that interesting and the acting is that well done.

Firefly was a casualty of short-sighted decisions by FOX execs and programmers.Firefly is a tongue-in-cheek, wonderfully-crafted romp of a sci-fi western. After each episode concluded, I would sit there, wowed. When the series was over all too soon, I sincerely hoped that some studio exec would hunt Joss Whedon down, give him a budget worthy of the storyline, and let him finish it up, right.Update, 2006-7-19: Well, Look at that! While I don't imagine the execs read this review, Whedon got a chance to finish the tale. Firefly was reborn as the feature film, Serenity, released in the fall of 2005.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2WNXZWDWLAI9R	G. Dorje	I was skeptical of this show. It isn't gritty and poignant like the modern Battlestar Galactica-what I thought was my standard for great Sci Fi/space shows. Firefly is, though, very entertaining and I thought that it was growing toward what it could be and possibly could have met the standard of Battlestar. I thought that this was exemplified by the last episode. However, what it is, is a fun romp, exciting and with fun story telling (if you have seen Cowboy Bebop it is similar to this). I was afraid that the caricature of the prostitute and the surly but underneath it all teddy bear captain (as well as the mercenary character) would be too simple. They even have a Chandler Bing character in the show. But, the directors and writers made it all work by having nuanced characters and interesting situations that they play out their lives. They also lose sometimes, most of time, which is also good too.Overall graded for what it was-it was a great watch. I am sad it never got beyond the 1st season.	5.0	Liked it a great deal	2014-03-20	0	0	0

The series sets up the entire baseline for the movie ""Serenity"", and includes the original cast.  The futuristic sci-fi series has well-developed characters, and has a witty humor that is very entertaining.  Although I had a slight problem with the wild west ""cowboy"" accent, (there is an attempt to explain this) I feel it would have faired well enough without it.  I think that had FOX not aired the series out of sequence, and allowed a fan base to be established, this series would have been very successful.  There still is a following for Firefly including a line of merchandise.  I think I join those who hope that it will resurface and let the story continue."	5.0	Firefly - The Complete Series	2009-07-14	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AK7D1BHZOSOL1	General Pete	I watched most of the series at my Uncle's house this weekend.This is so unfair, I remember watched this series when it first came out and not being able to understand it because I came into what I thought was the middle of the season.  It was not in fact the middle of the series that was where it really started with episode 2 that was why I was so confused.  Firefly has gained another fan I will be one till I die.Basic plot is standard-two different factions fight a war one side The Alliance had more guns and ships than the other side the disorganized and poorly armed Independents.  They do not lack for courage but the Independents are forced to give way in the face of superior fire power.Six years later those Independents who have the guts have hightailed it to the end of space finding an uneasy niche amongst the smugglers, pirates and other unsavory types that run the different systems.The series follows the adventures of one of these crews.I don't understand why this show was canned especially when you play the episodes in the order they were meant to be viewed so the plot makes some type of sense.  The people in charge of Fox are idiots, but I guess they had to make room for Joe Millionaire 25Trust me any of you that had a problem with this series when it was aired because the episodes were being aired out of sequence are not alone.  I urge you to buy the DVD and may your experience with this fresh, original and unjustifiably canceled show be as positive as mine wasOverall-I hope the Firefly will be the Star Trek of the 21st century, but it probably will not be because there is no justice in the world.Remember guys &quot;You can't take the Sky from me&quot;(been dying to say that)	5.0	Fox has no soul	2004-07-11	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3MEAG472GXMHY	Genoka Thomassy	"Firefly has a small legion of insanely dedicated fans and there's a reason.  The reason why it's a *small* legion is that Fox stupidly cancelled the show mid-first season, not even showing all the filmed episodes.  They messed with creator Joss Whedon's vision by not allowing the original series opener which introduced the characters to be shown until the end.  And they were wrong as evidenced by the fact that when I was looking up info on another Fox show a few months ago, one of the ""you might be interested in"" searches that popped up was ""most popular shows on this network"" showing Firefly, a show cancelled midseason EIGHT years ago, as the #4 most popular show on Fox.Every character in this series is fully rounded, intriguing and fascinating.  Most you will fall in love with--even some of the villians.  The created world is astounding.  In the Firefly ""verse,"" the two superpowers (US & China) and our lack of self-control have left their mark with humanity having left a destroyed ""Earth that was"" hundreds of years ago to spread across the 'verse.  The prevailing culture is a combo of American and Chinese with almost everyone speaking (and often cursing creatively) in Mandarin as well as English and clothing and decor mixing the cultures.  And while the central planets are excessively civilized and run by the corporate like Alliance, ""the black"" is a frontier of settlers getting by on almost nothing and needing everything including the medicines, food and cattle that our hero smugglers evade the Alliance to provide in exchange for a (dis)honest wage.  Earning an honest living is radiant Registered Companion (think geisha) Inara who travels with Serenity (the ship) and is accorded extreme respect wherever she goes.  Then you have Captain Mal and his first mate Zoe, Browncoat (resistance) veterans of the revolution, Zoe's husband and Firefly's talented pilot but less handy in a fist/gun fight Wash, adorable mechanical genius/boycrazy Kaylee in the engine room and mercenary (and very funny) Jayne Cobb who despite the first name is all boy.  Add passengers Simon & River Tam (Alliance fugitives) and intriguingly good with guns pastor Shepherd Booke and you have a unfailingly interesting group of people to explore space with.This show is insanely well written, the characters of the sort that you feel live in the real world alonside you, the performances are such that honestly I suspect the actors would still 8 years on automatically answer to their character names they so embodied them.  The ship is a fascinating character in herself--built on two soundstages (one for the lower deck and one for the upper) with corridors and catwalks that actually take you to the next part of the ship, Serenity also comes alive.  The special effects are astounding in how they take you into a ""real"" world--there are no engine noises in space and Serenity flies in the daylight.Fan devotion managed to lead to a superb but again not widely enough seen to be appreciated feature film called Serenity and to annual fan created and organized events called Can't Stop The Serenity where local ""Browncoat"" groups arrange theatrical showings of the film--often these days accompanied by Joss Whedon's superb web musical Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog--to benefit charities particularly Equality Now to the tune of over half a MILLION dollars in five years.Not bad for a show you may never have heard of, huh?  Or a mid-first season cancellation?I cannot recommend this show more highly.  I have spoken with too many people who were forced to watch it by a loved one and who don't consider themselves scifi fans who fell in love with this series.  I think it had a broad appeal which would would have appealed to a wider audience had Fox given the show the time and Joss the freedom to find that audience.  I've never met anyone who watched it and didn't like it.If you haven't seen it, at least rent it from Netflix and see what you're missing!"	5.0	Incredible but little seen tv series	2011-02-01	5	5	0

The cast and crew did an excellent job on this production, and though some of the special effects were a bit cheesy, they are on par with those produced on other shows.

Loyal followers of the show, &#34;Browncoats&#34;, fought to get it back and got the movie, instead. Make no mistake- this show is quirky. Take a western, throw in space, some cyberpunk, and Oceans Eleven, and you get Firefly. But it's an original take on the future, and one that deserved far more time than it got to play out. Fillion is now one of the leads in &#34;Castle&#34;, and the rest of the cast has gone on to do other things as well- but this gem will keep you entertained.	5.0	Gone too soon.	2014-01-26	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3LFIA97BUU5IE	Get Reel	"What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode. I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.' The movie 'Serenity' extends the story and fills in some of the past.The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se; it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (""Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first."").At the end of the day, that's what made this series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be ""fun."" I have every episode on my Ipod (as well as Serenity) and I watch them every time I travel for business (which is fairly often).I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff. I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride. Don't miss this one!"	5.0	The best sci-fi series ever...	2006-05-24	9	9	0

My beautiful wife really dislikes science fiction, and I would rather spend time with her than watch anything on TV. However, I am a big science fiction fan, so when my sweetheart  is otherwise occupied, I enjoy watching reasonably good sci-fi if it is available. But I would have never bothered with this series had it not been for an essay by one of my favorite authors (Orson Scott Card) praising the movie ""Serenity"" and by connection, the series ""Firefly"".I first bought the movie and rather liked it, but wasn't getting something about it. Then recently while on a vacation I bought the complete ""Firefly"" series on DVD and just loved it! ""Firefly"" is exactly what you want in a sci-fi drama. Wonderfully acted, incredibly believable visually, and a very good story.Again it is a shame that the FOX network more than any other gets it right when choosing series, and then gets it so, so wrong when it comes to cancelling series. And in some cases about marketing DVD's, but I digress.If you enjoy sci-fi even a little bit, you should find ""Firefly"" a worthy investment of your time and money.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1Q2ST6IHFGLKM	Gilly H	You heard it all already. I am not going to repeat all what has already been said about Firefly. It is a top series and one of the most addicting ever. I finished Season 1 over a weekend, and you'll immediately crave for more. Unfortunately, there is only Serenity besides Firefly. After all of the success from DVD/Blu-Ray sales, is it not now time for Firefly Season 2? Come on!!! The series is well-known and has attracted enough publicity that many potential eager fans are awaiting. Bring it FOX!!!!	5.0	Is it now time for Firefly Season 2?	2011-01-11	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3QZOGHZCE9MRT	Gina Darron	"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is my favorite show ever made. Despite that, I never watched Firefly when it was on TV. I just didn't want to get into another bunch of characters. Now that I'm finally ""over"" Buffy, I rented Serenity after hearing such good things about it. I absolutely loved it, so then I bought this set so I could see what the show was all about.I have to say the series itself isn't all that great. Some of the stories are very weak, and a lot of it is downright embarrassing to watch with other people around. That said, I love the characters, and the movie Serenity showed the kind of potential this show had. The idea of a western sci-fi is pretty silly, but Joss pulled it off in the best fashion possible and somehow made it easy to suspend belief enough to enjoy the concept.I know that if Joss had the time he needed to really develop the characters and come up with some more interesting storylines, the show could've been up there with Buffy in terms of quality. Buffy was often silly and trivial during its first season; it wasn't until season 2 that it really became interesting.Even though it's not great, I'm happy I bought this set and would recommend it to anyone who liked Serenity and is interested in seeing where these characters came from. I know that I hardly got what any of the characters were about just from the movie - Kaylee meant nothing to me, I had no idea Zoe and Wash were married, Shephard was just a random guy on a planet that they cared about, Inara was a random woman on another planet, and River was the star.It's interesting that most of the characters are of completely opposite importance in the show - River barely has a chance to do anything but babble crazily for a couple brief scenes every episode. I can imagine what Joss had in mind for her if he'd had more chance for the series; instead of having her suddenly start kicking butt for two hours, her powers would've been revealed more subtlely. Ah, well.It's a shame this show didn't get more time to mature. But I'd love to see a Serenity 2."	3.0	Not great, but had potential	2006-02-24	19	4	15

Joseph Evans	After finally being able to see all the episodes in the order they were meant to be seen, I am really, really  PO'd at Fox for messing up another brilliant series (remember The Tick, Freaky Links & The Family Guy?). Fox only wants dumb reality shows these days. They cost nothing to produce. They don't have to pay any talented actors, writers or effects shops any money. So until America tunes OUT the reality shows (don't watch them!), amazing shows like this will never have a chance. When you are finished watching this series (I was hooked by episode 2), you will feel the same way. These episodes are not enough. This series should have had a long, long run, just as Whedon's BTVS and Angel. Joss Whedon wants to release a feature film of this series in the next year or two. Let's keep our fingers crossed that this gets done and the person(s) that gave this show the axe will eat crow.	5.0	Warning....You Will Want More If you Buy This	2004-01-19	1	1	0

The pilot is interesting and it's easy to see there's a lot of potential with this show. I found there were some things I didn't really like, such as the opening theme song, the western nature, lack of sound in space (which is how it should be, but Hollywood has me trained otherwise), etc. After watching a few episodes I was hooked and began to love those things I originally didn't like. The acting is great, the characters are fantastic, the stories are entertaining. By the time you finish the show and realize it's over, you get instantly sad and realize it was short lived.

But given a tip from a friend (and an Amazon gold box deal) I picked up Firefly on Blu-Ray, and I'm really glad I did - it was the best show I've seen in a long time.  Of course, that means it had to be canceled after one season, which is tremendously annoying because this was a story that had SO many places to go!But I guess that's why I generally dislike TV so much!  Nice to see something worthwhile come on occasion, sorry that it didn't last!  Looking forward to checking out the movies as well.	5.0	Great show!  Even for those who don't like TV	2012-02-12	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1AZL7ZPQDVHU7	"G. McDonell ""sydneyguy"""	I'm a Joss Whedon fan, and pre-ordered this long before its release.  I didn't think I could go wrong with Joss, despite it being cancelled in the US (and never having seen the screened episodes, being from Australia), and I was right. From the beginning, the production values and acting talent are of the highest quality.  However I almost dropped the rating back to 4 stars, because of a few relatively &quot;slow&quot; episodes where characters were being established, or too much time was spent on &quot;guns and horses&quot;, or where an episode's plot seemed too derivative of other old tv and movie cliches.  But then I realised I was being unduly harsh, judging Firefly against the impossibly high standards of Buffy.  Firefly fails to be as &quot;funny&quot; as Buffy often was, but gains ground for some of its audience by being more adult and much more morally ambiguous. On any objective measure, this show is easily in the top 10% and therefore a worthy &quot;5 stars&quot;.  I suspect the critics of this show didn't bother to see past a few of those cliches to perceive the strength of early character development and overall story arcs being established.  The seeds of several such arcs are clear and bulging with potential and it is frustrating to think that we may never see the fuller realisation of those ideas.  Although I understand a film is rumoured, and if the DVD release is successful then who knows.	5.0	Just getting started	2004-01-21	7	5	2

All this for a reasonable price, can't ask for anything more.On the opposite end, have you seen the horrendous packaging for Star Trek Voyager?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJXP2ONZ1AB9D	Grant Reed	As I understand it the original name of Star Trek was Wagon Train to the Stars. It was envisioned, and even pitched, as a western set in space. Joss Whedon's Firefly does a better job of that.It is the future, Humanity has expanded to the stars as we exhausted the resources of our own planet. There is a central government for the various planets, but not all planets benefit equally from this. The Central planets are very well policed and run, as well as rich. The outer planets are not as fortunate. In most ways they resemble a dificult place to live, and normally have strong thematic elements based around the western United States during its colonization phase.Enter Captain Malcom Reynolds and his ship the Serenity, a firefly class cargo vessel. His crew consists of Zoe, his first mate, her husband, Wash, the pilot, Kaylee his engineer, and of course Jayne, his well enforcer. As the series begin they take on passengers, some which become crew, and others that are passengers for the long haul.Nathan Fillion gains first billing, but Firefly is truly an ensemble cast. Each character, though fitting into a western stereotype, is given a chance to develop. Some of the cast are mysterious, some are almost predictable, but overall the chemistry was truly remarkable.This is a series that can be enjoyed in a number of ways; by following the characters, or following the developments, or just by sitting back and allowing yourself a chance to drift into a different world. It is not a flashy Sci-Fi series with lots of effects. This is Science Fiction, a great tale about people that just happens to occur against the backdrop of our future, a future with both progress and failure. One other thing, there is not the plethora of races in this world, only humans.This is one of the most enjoyable series I have ever watched. I recommend it to everyone, but especially to those who like good Science Fiction, or those that miss westerns.I would have preferred to give it 4 1/2 stars, as there are a number of questions that remain unanswered, but as we cannot rate on half points, I am more than happy to round this series, a true gem, up to a five.	5.0	Excellent Science Fiction series.	2004-06-17	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IB6XV5BZTSVU	Greg	What can I say about this show.  It is unbelievable.  I tend to be drawn to realistic dialogue and believable characters, and this show has them in abundance.The setting is 500 years in the future and 200 years in the past.  Sure there are times when there is a little cheese in this show, but it adds to the enjoyment.  That being said, if you are someone who must nit-pick at every technical detail and think that every television show should be derived from an anthropology textbook, then you might have trouble with the setting.What is believable are the people.  Unlike most Sci-fi shows, this one has characters, who didn't finish at the top of their class, or do impossible things.  They are real people trying to make their way in the world and not always succeeding, and it makes for far more interesting television.Technically it is brilliant, using old style camera techniques, to give it a &quot;retro&quot; feel, the lighting is some of the best put onto the small screen in a long while.  I has Emmy award winning special effects, are blended perfectly and by imitating camera zooms, rapid pans and even camera shudder the cg guys make you believe that real cameras are filming real ships.If you are looking for the &quot;perfect future&quot; of Star Trek with it's sterile ships, steady cams shots and phasers, well you will be disappointed with this show. If you think that a show that combines Bladerunner, with a little bit of the Duke and a bit of the famous Joss Whedon wit, sounds interesting, this show won't disappoint.	5.0	Just Good TV	2003-12-10	2	2	0

Each of the characters has a defined personality which they hold true to throughout the series. It is a mix of humor and action, all based upon the individual characters' traits. The special effects are top notch, especially for a television show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2ZL8ZEKNMVJ43	"Gregory E. Carroll ""athosgec2"""	I was an original Star Trek fan...Too young to really appreciate it at the time, but in love with it anyway, even the silly fifth season. I drove my parents nuts watching it, often out of order, in syndication....wherever I could watch it.....and burned out. However, fans never gave up, Gene Rodenburry kept pushing, and low and behold, a theatrical package was made up. By the time it hit the movies, it was being eclipsed by Star Wars and other films. Still, it led to a series of successful films, then returned to T.V. in the Next Generation, was wildly popular and spawned several several new spin offs. That is a TV producer's Dream.Firefly can easily eclipse that. First of all, most trekkies were not onboard as fans of the original, much like firefly. The fanbase grew as the legend of the show did, the successful novelizations added literary interest, the Fan based stories allowed fans to interact, and the syndication exposed many people who had never seen the original airing.Firefly has done that in a much shorter time. It went to theaters much quicker and does have the potential to reprise with the original cast in a new series.  In addition it has the internet to drive it in a way that Star Trek never did, web sites, internet sales, etc. All it takes is for Joss to reevaluate, consider what a unique and truly worthwhile project Firefly was, get Universal onboard and shop some new scripts, with DVD sales figuresfor both Firefly and Serenity to Various networks, cable would be best....Sci Fi, HBO or Showtime would be best. The avoid getting preachy, and syndication....and voila....a decade of quality Television,,,at least for an hour a week.  One negative is that two of the more interestinfg characters, Shepherd Book and Wash were killed off in the the movie as well as another promising new one in Mr. Universe. Continue the series as if serenity was never written and it could be great.	5.0	Star Trek Took  Decade- Then Spawned an Empire	2007-09-12	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1X2UJ20N3DHLF	Gregory	I was a huge fan of buffy and knew Whedon was a gifted genre writer, but everything I heard about Firefly turned me off. Mostly that Joss would not be guiding Buffy anymore.How wrong I was.Buffy was amazing, Firefly is divine. The best genre show since X-files and ST:TNG. In half a season Whedon created the most compelling universe and engaging characters to be seen on TV sense the first years of the X-files and the mid seasons of ST:TNG. Nine colorful characters, witty dialogue, and the ingenius mixing of the old west and far off future, Firefly defied all the trends of sci-fi and actually came up with something totally orginal. The show had teeth, heart and humor. The actors were infectious, each while appearing to fill a sterotype, became obvious with a short number of episodes were anything but. (If you have seen Whedons other shows, he is notorious for building up a sterotype and then completely turning it on its end, its one of his gifts.) The writing was classic Whedon, yet far more mature. His gift for deep, balanced characters that have weaknesses was well as strengths, broadreaching motivations, was evident from the get go. Each of the nine was unique, not overstepping the other. The premise is the most orginal thing I have seen in the genre in decades. The only mistake Whedon made was going with FOX, who by this time had moved beyond its days of letting shows actually find their audiences *cough* X-files *cough* Why did he not go with a smaller network or syndication.For the first time ever I am actually going to buy a DVD set. Its just that good.	5.0	best and most original sci-fi since the X-files	2005-09-20	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A96TJJN01XPLH	Gregory Stangel	"The phrase, ""Once in a lifetime,"" is used a bit too liberally for my taste.  One statement should never be so...absolute, but if given as a genuine acknowledgement of a life changing moment or event, it carries the most emotional weight of any label in the English language.Firefly/Serenity encapsulates the essence of a ""once in a lifetime"" experience.  I am not exaggerating my praise, or using hyperbole to ""hype"" a defunct show.  My adoration of this tale supersedes any and all that have come before it (take that Mr. Lucas).Were I capable of describing the narrative perfection of this tale...I still wouldn't.  Firefly must be witnessed first hand, and your own emotions and conclusions must be formed and made.Whatever brought you to this place and made you read this footnote of a fan, let it guide you.  You don't need to be a flag waving science fiction fan or a ""chew spittin"" Western fan to enjoy this series...you need only be a person waiting to be entertained.If you are such a person, board the Firefly freighter Serenity and love her crew...at least once this lifetime."	5.0	Lady, You're My Kind of Crazy.	2006-01-03	13	12	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2E7KC0EI7QT8	"Greg Pauletti ""gdpetti"""	The film, after watching this entire series, was excellent as a compact version of the entire story the creator of the series wanted to present. You really get a feel for that larger storyline when watching this series. Too bad it didn't continue for another season or two. The best storylines are usually best presented to the public when limited in duration, instead of having no end in sight, as the 'excess' or dross gets cut rather immediately as an impediment to the movement of the storytelling.If you liked the film, you will like the series, and if you like the series, you will love the film, as it completes the story, one that repeats in our world, one civilization after the next. The hidden truth doesn't get revealed until the 'fat lady' begins to sing her song and the lyrics are always those of lament. History, when finally revealed is never pretty, but it is accurate and the creator of this series had a good idea with this storyline. Too bad he didn't find an audience fast enough, but then I don't know that part of the production story.	5.0	Firefly, the Series	2012-12-30	0	0	0

I can't say enough good things about this series. Well done to Joss Whedon and his amazing cast and crew! I'm recommending it to my 70 year old mother who is an avid Star Trek/anything sci-fi and Western fan. She's going to be giddy. There's no *bad* language as they don't swear in english or present day terms. It can be violent but not too much so, and there's very little sex. We looked forward to each episode with glee and rubbed hands as each started. It's so nice to see something that is as near to perfect (for us) as we've seen in a very long time.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AUM1ICXFKY7EE	Guinea	I cannot imagine the reasoning behind this series having been cancelled. Everyone I have ever known who watched it, loved it. The characters are so real to you, with such interesting byplay. There is the tension of unresolved romance, the grit of a soldier, the genius of someone who is off her rocker, the integrity of a natural leader. All of this is set way off in the future, with the crew running salvage, transport, and a little illegal stuff on the side in their spaceship for whom the show is named. The crew of the firefly ship are all rebels, having lost the war for freedom, but who quietly buck the system and skirt the law. With the setting including any number of planets, some of whom live in abject poverty, scenes may be anything from future tech to wild west complete with horses and cowboys. It's got everything...humor, sorrow, frustration, the good guys striving for freedom, romance, and novel situations. Really the best TV show I have ever seen, period.	5.0	TOP NOTCH entertainment!	2013-04-05	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKT0Y6J9AK469	"GumbyTheCat ""Gumby"""	"The Fox Network, it seems, has a history of being quick on the draw when it comes to pronouncing judgment on their offerings. Sometimes that is a good thing; Fox has canceled many a ludicrous and mind-numbingly inane series. However, sometimes they have canceled series with much promise.Never has Fox messed up so badly as when they canceled ""Firefly"". They took a cursory look at the ratings (98th in the Nielsen ratings, with about 4.7 million viewers per episode), and tossed this wonderful series in the trash can. They never even gave it much of a chance, having only aired 11 of the 14 of the finished episodes - and aired them out of order, with the pilot ""Serenity"" being aired later than other episodes. In short, Fox just seemed totally uninterested in supporting this series from the start.I am not a big fan of television anymore; as a matter of fact I canceled my cable service months ago because programming is just so bad these days. However, I do have Netflix, which allows me to stream quality shows I want to see. I had never even heard of the series, but after seeing gushing praise for Firefly on the Pharyngula blog, I dialed it up on Netflix. And oh, boy, did I ever get a treat.I've been a fan of written and visual science fiction for 4 decades, and as such have experienced it from many angles, both good and not-so-good. With Firefly, I saw sci-fi in a way I had never seen it before. I had of course heard of the term ""space western"", and have seen elements of that concept in shows like Star Trek and in movies like Star Wars and Avatar. However, until now I had never seen the ""space western"" theme realized in such a literal way. The juxtaposition between spaceships and horses, and space stations and frontier towns, is a delight to watch. The storylines are sometimes straight out of westerns, such as the train heist in ""The Train Job"". Josh Whedon, however, flawlessly interweaves the two seemingly at-odds thematic elements, and the result is 14 phenomenal episodes (and a great followup theatrical release, ""Serenity""). There is an equal mix of drama, humor and action in this series, and just when you think you know what direction an episode is going to take, Whedon takes it in a totally different direction. Rarely is television so well-scripted, especially these days.Interesting concept aside, no television show is worth much if the characters are not believable or interesting. Firefly has great character development. All the main characters are (through both scripting and acting) fully fleshed-out human beings who we grow to deeply care about as we progress through the series. You can tell that the actors really cared about their roles, because their performances effortlessly exude the characters as they were conceived by Whedon. Through these portrayals come the series' great strength - a tale of desperate people of disparate backgrounds who find themselves linked in a particular place and time. We see the love and anger, the humor and sadness, and we identify with them. We want to be with them on Serenity, living the lives that they lead.All in all, I think that the Fox network executive who made the decision to dump this series should be hog-tied and deposited on the deck of a ship full of starving, amorous Reavers. Television is almost never this good, and if Firefly had been allowed to run its originally-planned 7 full seasons, I believe it would be referred to by the general TV-viewing public as one of the all-time great series.Even if you're not a fan of sci-fi, get this anyway. This series, first and foremost, is about people, not spaceships."	5.0	A Brilliant Series, Tragically Short-Lived	2011-04-24	10	9	1

So soon that Joss was so freakin' upset he went on a rampage and was unstoppable until Serenity was made. As a Buffy/Angel fan I should have known this would be just as good.I just saw this a month ago, so I'm late to the show and sorry I didn't become a Browncoat years ago when the series was on the air. Nevertheless, I came to LOVE this show and feel such regret that we only got one season--and not even 22 episodes.  Such a treasure and so ripped out from under us. If you think it looks grungy, confusing and bleak (which I did originally) just try the first episode and you'll fall in love with the oh so wonderful and engaging characters. Don't let the sci-fi/western surface fool you into turning away, you have to give this a chance and  you'll be a fan before you can get the second disc in your DVD player.	5.0	Joss is a Genius; Firefly is Outstanding and Unforgettable!	2006-11-04	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3HK4YKWAU21OR	Guy Knights	I missed out on this when it first came out, mainly because it was never shown on TV here in Australia, but also because I had just finished working my way through 7 seasons of Buffy (which I loved) and was starting to watch Angel and not really getting into it. I was aware that Joss Whedon had another show out, but my lacklustre response to Angel (I do hear it gets better as the series progresses) put me off investing more time in another extended series.I knew next to nothing about Firefly except something about spaceships, but I had copies of the series from my friend lying around at my place for months and months before I saw the trailer for serenity fairly recently. It was intriguing enough for me to check out the series, and I'm so glad I did. All the fun, exciting, humorous aspects I enjoyed in Buffy exist in Firefly (in spades), even if the dynamics of the characters in many ways mirrors Buffy. However, the characters are unique in their own ways and the realisation of their universe is wonderfully done, even if the concept is not necessarily unique in sci-fi.After watching about 3/4 of the series, I'm seriously frustrated by the fact that I know there aren't going to be any more episodes produced for television. Sure, the movie will tide me over, but I just doubt that there'll get the same degree of characterisation in a 2 hour movie as there is in a 14-part series. But hey, anything is better than nothing right?If you like shows that really make you care about the characters at the same time as just giving you a really entertaining hour or so, do check this out. Hopefully you'll get suckered in and start telling all your friends about it like I have. Maybe we might even get a new series! (well, probably not but it would be nice wouldn't it?).So, yeah, buy it. It's just a pity that Fox will get a cut of the DVD profits when they royally ****** it over.	5.0	A great show that deserved much, much better	2005-08-29	6	5	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3S7Y3EPA8WS31	Gwen C	*WARNING: MINOR SPOILER*Every person I have introduced to this show (approx. 6 people) has fallen in love with it. It has everything; action, adventure, suspense, mystery, scifi, romance, humor, social commentary, drama, crime drama, ... there's more but I don't have the right words to define it.I knew I'd like this show when Captain Malcolm kicked the antagonist into the engine at the end of the first aired episode. I knew I'd love this show when I could distinguish each of the nine characters and cared about each characters individual storyline. That was about the third episode.	5.0	Good fun with intricate details that hold attention over repeat viewings	2005-06-30	8	6	2
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3EYQQ1IJ5QPAG	Gwen	I discovered Firefly after it had been canceled. After hearing that a DVD had been released, I decided to look it up on Amazon and saw that people with all kind of tastes were writing rave reviews. It was a while though before I felt willing to hand over my cash. Although I'm a Buffy and Angel fan, I've never been keen on westerns or sci-fi, not to mention the two together! It took a couple of episodes to get into it and initially I was thinking that it was just okay. Then suddenly I was hooked and the theme song was resounding in my head continuously. A fully-formed world like Firefly takes its time in establishing its characters, their development, and it makes you work a little bit to figure out its universe. But it's so worth it! By the time I'd finished the last episode, Objects in Space, I felt bereft and was already missing this odd assortment of characters. Thankfully though, a movie is coming out so the Firefly world lives on. (I've since lent the DVD to a couple of friends who had the same reaction, ie. it took them a few episodes before they were sucked in).	5.0	Try it and you'll be hooked!	2005-05-09	7	7	0

The digital remastering was top-notch though there are certain things I would quibble with the digital decision makers.I like the fact both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions included a couple episodes that never aired. I look forward to the day when Whedon can continue lensing a full season's worth of episodes, preferably with the same actors maybe set ten years down the road. Either that or digital technology gets to the point where digital actors could be generated to create a virtual domain of new episodes. Don't know if I said that right.	5.0	Outstanding Sci-Fi As It Was Meant To Be	2012-12-16	0	0	0

The blu-ray format is amazing.  My teenage children also wish there were more episodes because they got into the story line and wanted to know more about the characters.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2W4KG86PMKZOD	Harbinger	Before watching the movie Serenity, a type of final hurrah for this unfinished series, I had never even heard of Firefly. I enjoyed the movie and, even though it's technically standalone, I got the sense that there had to be something before it because of the relationships between the characters. After googling the movie I discovered that it was based on a tv series that aired on FOX back in 2003.Firefly is a sort of space western with an entertaining storyline and enjoyable characters. The show was cancelled after about 14 episodes (I.e. season one) but it had such a zealous following by its fans that it prompted the creation of the film to provide a proper send off. In many people's view Firefly is a series that ended too soon (apparently due in large part to FOX's ineptitude).In my honest opinion, however, the series was great but not excellent. The first five or six episodes felt a little disjointed from one another and some could probably stand on their own. It wasn't until the seventh or eight episode that it seemed like they started taking into account the events of the precious episodes and weaving them into the story. I suppose the easiest way of explaining this would be to use Game of Thrones as an example. You get a more definite sense of continuity with a series like game of thrones, where each episodes' events shape the events of the next.Overall, this is a highly enjoyable series and I recommend it. I gave it four stars because of the enjoyable story and the nicely developed characters. The disjointed nature of the episodes in beginning as well as its premature ending kept me from giving it 5/5. If you enjoy the series you will most likely have to watch the movie Serenity to get some closure.	4.0	Firefly Lost	2013-06-23	0	0	0

Fox is quickly becoming the graveyard of terrific shows cut down before they've had a chance at building an audience --what a tragedy!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A338RSQZINFCK	"Harmon ""Harmon_7"""	"What happened to the original thinkers in TV ? What happened to ""Must see TV"" ?  This series and subsequent movie are absolute proof that the creativity we have lost in Network TV is still out there, but is being quashed by Network Execs that are undeniably out of touch with its viewers. If the networks do find a series people want to watch they run it for a few months then kill production to run another series all together like its impossible to have two good shows at the same time on the same network or they find ONE good idea and run two more identical shows with only slightly diffrent names. Even Hollywood seems more than happy to churn out remake after remake of 50 year old movies. Don't get me wrong I enjoy watching giant apes swat airplanes, orange Dodge Chargers flying thru the air and the science it takes to lift a print from a glass as much as the next guy, but if they make it common practice to cancel shows with this much promise because they can't compete with a sports franchise or a show in its fifth year, 50 years from now they will STILL be remaking Giant Apes, orange Dodge Chargers and showing for the 10 millionth time that they can get dna with a cotton swab.I had not heard of the Firefly series until I heard about Serenity. I watched the series first then the movie and was glad I did. Since this is on dvd I highly suggest watching both the series and the movie.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1H8JUI9GNQKNR	Harold Harefoot	"I've noticed that most of the recent reviews have been from people who've just found, and fallen in love with, Firefly.  All I can tell them is, just wait until you've watched it a few more times.  Then you'll REALLY love it.  I've had my dvd set for over a year now and have watched it at least a dozen times.  After that many viewings of most other shows, I would be getting very bored.  However, Firefly is so detailed, so nuanced and complex that every time I watch it is more enjoyable than the previous viewing.  Even after viewing it so many times, I'm still finding details and connections (between characters and between episodes) that I hadn't noticed before.  Because of that, this show is the ideal dvd purchase.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but get to appreciate and love it even more each time you watch.  How rare is that?  Also, don't worry about the abrupt ending.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZWVOY2XMZH5Z	"Hazel ""britchick_hd"""	&quot;Firefly&quot; is a great story - full of interesting characters, good plotlines,  and subtle humor.  I saw the series when it was aired in the UK, and I was really disappointed that it was cancelled.I bought the DVDs from the US and had them shipped to my home in the UK,  and I have foundmyself watching them several times... and I find it impossible to restrict myself to just one episode at a time.There is a really good balance between stories, characterization and sci fi.  It's not your traditional sci fi tale.  Yes, it takes place 500 years in the future, on other planets and on spaceships....  but that is about it.  There's no alien species,  no beaming,  no magic warp drive.I've also seen it refered to as &quot;Western&quot;.  Ye-es, on some planets they ride horses,  and in one episode there is a kind of westernish plot...  but other than that it didn't really come across that way to me.And despite being created by Joss Whedon,  it's not like Angel or Buffy,  except in the subtle humor department.I seem to have spent most of this review telling you what it isn't, so I'll now try to tell you what it is.  It's so damn original it defies classification.It's...fantastic.  Interesting. COmpulsive. Gripping. Laugh out loud funny.  I-can't-look-scary.  Addictive.Even without the great special features, it's an absolute bargain.C'mon. Its only 35 bucks. Having watched all the episodes, and the special features I'd have to say I'd pay twice that.My husband - who wasn't interested when it was on TV - has similarly become addicted,  which surprised me as he isn't really a Joss Whedon fan.	5.0	The best 35 bucks you'll spend this week!	2004-02-19	8	8	0

Joss delivered with the same key elements that made Buffy and Angel so much fun to watch.  The characters all seemed to breathe and resonate, the stories were interesting, the f/x were believable...I grew to care for Mal, Jayne and the rest of the Serenity crew.  Then came the cancellation and thus a whole lotta woebegone looks on my face.  Then, thank the idiot box gods, the dvd came out.  And now I'm frothing at the mouth to see the cinematic version.  Hopefully, ""Serenity"" will spawn another Firefly t.v. series and will go on to ""live long and prosper.""By the way, a shoutout to Spike and Faith.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3N0P5AAMP6XD2	H B	While far from being the best, it's still a nice series, that keeps you busy in the rainy days, when you got nothing else to watch!The sceneries are few, mainly of the space ship, and few remote planet locations, the plot is generally simple, not too much SciFi bull, but more built around the relationship between the actors on stage (the captain, a fugitive doctor and his sister, a priest, a prostitute, mercenary and mechanic, traveling all on the same ship, sticking their heads out for one another).The character that I found most intriguing, would be the escorte/prostitute.Not because of her mothering, but because of her etiquette response to almost everything, slow to judge, quick to try to please!The character I found most repelling is the weird girl. She plays bad roles in most of her movies. I just don't like her on stage, and seeing her naked was like not something I'd love to see again (though was more preferable than seeing the male captain naked).There are very few sex scenes, and no private parts are really shown.This is a cancelled series, incomplete; and though I'd not call this a budget series, it definitely not call it a bank breaker!They managed to get everything quite simple on stage and in the movies. Even the CGI was very basic.Nevertheless, still enjoyable!	4.0	An enjoyable series!	2012-12-07	0	0	0

I must have been out of my freakin mind because this was one of the best television shows ever made.This revelation only recently occurred when I rented ""Serenity"" and immediately fell in love with the Firefly universe.  The next day, ""Serenity"" AND ""Firefly"" joined my DVD library and I devoured the entire series in about a day and a half (then promptly re-watched Serenity for the inevitable re-appreciation of the movie).Great characters, hilarious dialogue, and a realistic & well thought-out ""future"" are just some of the elements that make this show really work.Buy it, buy the movie, and spread the word!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30FVB5F3LRAXS	"H. Deveaux ""HistoryLover"""	Firefly remains one of my favourite tv shows of all time. The characters are vibrant, quirky and real, their dialogue sparkles; the story lines are well developed, highly entertaining, and just great fun to watch. Joss Whedon has conceived of a future world that is believable, interesting, and well worth watching. Even the theme song is beautifully well-written. I find myself humming it all the time.I still cannot believe the stupidity of FOX execs for first, totally screwing up the launch of the show, then messing around with the scheduling constantly, and finally cancelling it because folks were slow to figure out when it would be on! With the tremendous volumes of mindless and pointless programming on in recent years, I suppose I should not have been shocked to see one of the most intelligent and entertaining programs taken off the air to make room for more inexpensive, &quot;reality&quot; drivel. I have since cancelled my cable subscrption in disgust.  But at least I have this DVD, and look forward with great anticipation to the launch of the movie &quot;Serenity&quot; next spring. &quot;You can't take the sky from me!&quot;The DVD is worth every penny.	5.0	Brilliant - Buy this DVD!	2004-08-24	3	3	0

I had watched it since day 1, and thought it the best television show out there, and still do today. This is Joss at his best. The plot was a recreation of the &quot;Wild West&quot; and cowboy themes, yet with an original twist. I still wonder what the Alliance was doing, after it has been cancel for more than a year. For anyone who watched it during its short lifetime, loves its creators other show's (that's how i got hooked), or is just looking for a unique series, Firefly is that.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3OXYXM50RN25I	"Heather R. Kikkert ""HKikkert"""	Unfortunately, I didn't get to see a whole episode of Firefly while it was on Fox, but kept running across people mentioning it after it's demise while trying to help petition getting Wonderfalls back on the air. Everyone was talking about how great it was, so I had to get the set and see for myself. Boy was I impressed! I was totally blown away! I can't wait for the movie 'Serenity' to hit the theaters this coming September (knock on wood they don't change the date AGAIN--it was originally going to come out in April, but they didn't want Serenity to get lost in the shadow of the new Star Wars movie, which is totally understandable considering how few people have heard about this awesome show)!!I moved to WA state 9 years ago after living in Tucson, AZ for 25 years. Every time I watch one of the Firefly episodes, I feel like I'm there again, and don't want the show to end. It's not only because I miss living there so much, but because the characters are so believable, and the show itself is extremely ingenious, incorporating the old west into a sci-fi environment. I like Star Trek, the X-Files, Dark Angel, and Tru Calling (can't forget Wonderfalls, either!), but Firefly actually tops my list for science fiction favorite, by being so innovative. I just can't find the words to tell everyone how most excellent I think it is. I also can't believe that Fox doesn't know a good thing when it has it in the palm of it's hand.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A28MM46KI4EQB2	HeavyMetalSushi	I never saw this show when it was actually on TV, but from what I understand from a friend when we started watching it on Netflix, he said it was good that I was getting to see it that way because apparently Fox screwed up the order of the show when they aired it.  Supposedly they had decided after they'd signed on with the show for the 1st season that they didn't think it would be very popular and therefor were going to cancel it after the first season...and then for whatever reason, they decided to just show it in any random order.  It did, in fact, become pretty popular despite this so Fox made a big mistake in doing this...there are so many people out there who would have loved to see this show continue.  But of course, Fox is notorious for fouling things up...makes me sick.  At least Joss was able to tie it off in the movie Serenity.Anyway, it's not often I buy TV on DVD/Blu-Ray...normally I'll just rewatch shows on Netflix or something.  However, I did really love this show, and I had Serenity on Blu-Ray, so I finally just decided to pick this up on Blu-Ray to go with it.  Totally worth while show...it's an interesting blending of Sci-Fi and Western.  The characters are all cool in their own ways...I think my favorite is probably Ms. Kaylee Frey!  She's like my Hollywood dream girl...she's so lovable and funny.  The whole cast adds some great character to the whole show all around though.While it's sad that the show was cut so short, the little bit there is of it is memorable and entertaining, and worth watching more than once...which is why it was worth it to me to buy the set and the follow up movie, Serenity.  If you're a fan of sci-fi and have never seen this before, then I highly recommend checking it out friends.	5.0	LOVE FIREFLY!	2012-08-23	1	1	0

His first deployment, we had a friend that was KIA. His wife was pregnant and our friend died before he could name his child. I told my husband I did not want that to happen and that if he did not name her before he left that I would name her River Wild, just joking. A few days later he called from the plane, getting read to head to Afghanistan. He told me he really liked the name River, I did not question him on it and almost 3 months later, I gave birth to a beautiful little River. It wasn't until he returned that I learned that she was named after River, from FireFly.

Buy this series on DVD.  You will absolutely fall in love with it and DVD sales may help raise the likeliness of future projects.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3IVIS1OPYUU0X	Henry Perkins	"The DVD collection of ""Firefly - The Complete Series"" was clearly a labor of love for those who made the series.  It includes the eleven episodes originally aired on the Fox television network plus three unaired shows, commentary on fully half the episodes, and a large assortment of extras.  As a courtesy to the TV fans of ""Firefly"" this review contains NO SPOILERS.""Firefly"" was often described as a ""space western"".  Set 500 years in the future, when a large number of planets and moons have been terraformed, many frontier planets are subsisting with little more than basic 19th-century tools: horses, wagons, cattle, lever-action rifles, and the like.  But this is the future when America and China were the clear winners of the race for cultural dominance so every backwater yokel can curse in Chinese as well as twangy American idiom, and newspapers have moving text.Malcolm Reynolds (played by Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Warren (Gina Torres) are survivors (on the losing side) of the war to unite all the planets.  To gain some freedom from the encroaching forces of the victorious Alliance, they purchase an old transport ship of the Firefly class.  Named ""Serenity"" for the battle of Serenity Valley, where they lost the war, the ship's crew was fleshed out with pilot Wash Warren (Zoe's husband, played by Alan Tudyk), mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and muscle Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin).  They later pick up some passengers: companion (futuristic geisha) Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his troubled genius sister River (Summer Glau), and Shepherd (preacher) Book (Ron Glass).I'll leave the show summary there (NO SPOILERS, remember) but just point out that one of the hallmarks of Joss Whedon shows is how people who aren't related become family.  In its short run ""Firefly"" was a shiny example of family-building.  Now on to the DVD collection.The DVD set consists of 4 discs, each in individual plastic holders, and an outer cardboard sleeve.  The only difference in the packaging is a different cast member portrait for each plastic box; each disc is pressed with the same image of the ""Firefly"" title.  There are no extra materials in the packaging.  Here's a breakdown of the contents of each disc.DISC ONE: (picture of Nathan Fillion, ""Malcolm Reynolds"")1. ""Serenity"" (original pilot, a double-length episode)Commentary by executive producer Joss Whedon & actor Nathan Fillion2. ""The Train Job""Commentary by executive producers Joss Whedon & Tim Minear3. ""Bushwhacked""DISC TWO: (picture of Ron Glass, ""Shepherd Book"")4.

""Heart of Gold""14. ""Objects in Space""Commentary by executive producer Joss WhedonSpecial Features:- Here's How It Was: The Making of Firefly- Deleted Scenes- Serenity: The 10th Character- Alan Tudyk's Audition- Gag Reel- Joss Tours the Ship- Joss Sings the Firefly ThemeThe episodes originally aired on the Fox television network starting with #2, ""The Train Job"", and continued in order through episode #9, ""War Stories"".  Then came #14, ""Objects in Space"", and (after the series had been cancelled) finally the pilot.  Fox has a long history of starting science fiction shows (usually on Friday evenings) but giving them only a short run before yanking them off the air.  Skipping the pilot of ""Firefly"" didn't help the show gain a following.  (Remember ""Werewolf"", ""Alien Nation"", ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."", ""M.A.N.T.I.S."", ""VR.5"", ""Strange Luck"", ""Space: Above and Beyond"", ""Kindred: The Embraced"", ""Brimstone"", ""Harsh Realm"", ""Freaky Links"", ""Dark Angel"", or ""The Lone Gunmen""?  All of these were Fox shows; most of them were cancelled shortly after their debut.)  The DVD collection restores the shows to their proper order.For a short-lived series, ""Firefly"" had a respectable assortment of guest stars.  Recurring villains include Mark A. Sheppard as ""Badger"", Michael Fairman as ""Niska"", and Christina Hendricks as ""Saffron""/""Bridget""/""Yolanda""/whoever.  More notable one-shot guests include Edward Atterton, Richard Brooks, Richard Burgi, Melinda Clarke, William Converse-Roberts, Larry Drake, Gregg Henry, Isabella Hofmann, and Carlos Jacott.  Viewers of Joss Whedon's other shows will spot several familiar faces.""Firefly - The Complete Series"" is a 5-star entertainment package, with plenty of additonal material for fans of the series.  The actual production of the 4-DVD set is disappointing in several ways, though.  Pioneer Disc Manufacturing Corporation (PDMC) did their usual annoying job of arranging the DVD menus using a number of phantom ""titles"" that cause slow, repeated disc seeks for each menu selection.  They've also buried the many disc commentary selections three levels deep under ""Language Selection"".  On the positive side all the chapter stops are placed properly, and the video and audio transfer are both good.""Here's How It Was: The Making of Firefly"" includes commentary by all nine of the cast.  Gina Torres appears in costume, speaking of her character in the present tense; all the others came back after cancellation to add their remembrances of the show.  Also in this retrospective are Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, Jane Espenson, producer Gareth Davies, Chris Buchanan (President of Mutant Enemy), Chinese translator Jenny Lynn, Kelly Wheeler (assistant to the producer), camera operator Allen Easton, visual effects supervisor Loni Peristere, associate producer Lisa Lassek, and composer Greg Edmonson.The fact that they could get nine different people to come back to provide audio commentary for the DVD collection, and as many more for the retrospective of the series, is a strong indication of the commitment these people have for ""Firefly"".

I only watched the first disk as the second disk of the show was missing (seems I received a package with two disk 3s and was too late to return the set). If the show gets better, I apologise. But I felt I watched enough that I should have gotten hooked.Basically, what you've got here is a western. And, despite not liking westerns, I actually liked many westerns more than this show.Just one guy's opinion.UPDATE: Watched the rest of the series.

I'd recommend this to people of all types, not just sci-fi, the comedy and relationships between the crew are pretty universal.	4.0	Lot's of fun	2013-12-02	0	0	0

Some weeks before christmas I found the DVDs in the amazon.com charts. What amazed me were all these 5 star comments. I got some hot coffee and began reading more than 130 comments about that show.I could not understand how someone would put together space ships, horses, antique guns und a crew of nine people. But 130 comments about a not yet released DVD set could not be that wrong. So I bought the DVD set and began watching.I love Babylon 5 and Farscape and I tought there won't be anything matching these two but Firefly certainly does.There is the real kickin CGI of the ships, the stations and even of the landscape. I havn't seen something like this before. There is zooming, sharpening and shaking in the CGI parts. That gives you the feeling it is real.But more important are the characters. Star Trek needs two seasons to get you familiar with the characters. Farscape and Babylon did this in one season, but Firefly kicks them all. It took me the pilot and the first four episodes to got to know the crew. Well, and to love them - especially Kaylee ;-) Each episode the tension between certain characters rises. Some characters you hate and like as well - like Jayne. Joss Whedon did a great job creating this set of different characters matching so fine.The stories are also something new and special. Never thought about robbing a train with a spaceship. In almost every episode crime is done but somehow in a just way. I really like ""Out of Gas"" because of its movie-like cutting, fantastic sound and dark mood. And ""War Stories"" is also great. The torture is really hard and I don't think they would show it in Germany. But it makes it real. And at the end of ""The Message"" there is this over the top good bye scene with fantasic sound that wants to make you cry out loud.But my most favorite episode is ""Jaynestown"". The biggest thing Firefly does can be best seen in Jaynestown. It entertains and it makes you LAUGH OUT LOUD. Really, image sitting in front of your TV at 11 pm and can't stop laughing. It just gets better and better.All in all, this show is great and I hope the movie is coming soon.You can't take the skies from me!"	5.0	What a great trip	2004-01-09	7	7	0

I tend to be extremely critical of actors and actresses I see on TV because I am an aspiring actress.  Everyone in the show acts as naturally as people who are being recorded without knowing! There is a perfect mixture of future, past, and present in the story to show the differences between rich, poor, and everything in between, based mainly on the different worlds people live in.  I absolutely love the different personalities of  every single crew member working in Serenity (the name of the ship for anyone who doesn't know).  The only problem is the lack of confession between Mal and Enora!  Those two are like nervous high school kids sometimes, which can make the show more comical, but come on!

My wife and I watched a dvd per day and blew through all of them in no time, and even had to turn to the dreaded bonus features just to get one last taste of firefly! We immediately bought a set of dvds for ourselves so we can watch it over and over again...I'm really glad they are making a movie to follow on, but a movie is only like 2 episodes and the stories you can develop in a movie are just not up to those that can be told in a good tv series. I'm going out of my mind knowing that it was cancelled with all the other garbage out on tv sticking around for multiple seasons. I really wish it could be resurrected, but lets face facts people, I've never heard of a show being brought back after cancellation years in the past.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJTKU0XJ7QTME	Holly	"Really, if you have any doubts about Firefly, just drop them and give this wonderful show a chance.  It took me 6 years to try it out, and I did so solely for Joss Whedon.  If you are a fan of any of his previous works you know what to expect; witty dialogue, lovable characters and amazing stories.  If you're new to the 'verse, well...that's what you should expect.  This is the only show that I cannot choose a character I dislike nor an episode I dislike (perhaps the only very small positive that can be taken from the cancellation is that Firefly never had a poor episode).The acting is incredible.  They all really do become the characters and you can definitely see how much they all care for each other.  The writing and direction of each episode is top-notch.  The special effects are great too.The special features on the DVD are nice.  The commentaries are all really fun and give a lot of great insight into the show (especially Objects in Space).  There are only a handful of deleted scenes and then the usual ""making of"" features.  Plus Adam Baldwin singing!Oh and one last amazing part is that Firefly is one of the few space shows that actually makes space soundless and it really, really makes all the space scenes very effective.Sorry for the slightly rambling review but I really just believe that everyone should experience one of the greatest TV shows of all time."	5.0	Perfect	2009-07-17	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AI0VDVHZALM06	Hotaru Miang	"To be honest, watching ""Firefly"" is both a painful and highly enjoyable experience. Highly enjoyable because Joss Whedon's short-lived sci-fi masterpiece is an unique, creative, in-depth, and fun show. And then painful because the FOX network was apparently so hopelessly clueless as to what a gem they had on their hands. Tragically mis-marketed, complete with episodes shown out of order, the network pulled the plug on ""Firefly"" before it had a chance to show the world what an amazing show it was going to be for the long-haul. It's plain to see all the potential that was there while watching this DVD set.Thankfully, it was released on DVD, and due to its success and great word of mouth, ""Serenity"", the new ""Firefly"" movie just finished filming and is set to be released next spring. As a side plug, I highly encourage everyone to give it a try.What we have for now are 14 excellent episodes complete with drama, comedy, strong character development, and action scenes. As one reviewer already put it, there truly is something for everyone on this set.Joss Whedon did the impossible in my mind and took a cast of nine characters and in only 16 episodes, already managed to make each one of them seem real, interesting, and full of their own quirks and characteristics. The viewer truly feels as if they are getting to know these people while they on the show are getting to know each other. The sense of ""family"" on the show is strong and impacting, it's wonderful to watch how the characters find themselves relating to one another. The dynamics and interactions are amazingly well-written.Though ""Firefly"" has been called everything from sci-fi to Western to an action show, it really is - at its heart - the story of nine people trying to make a living and find a place for themselves in the universe. Like all of Whedon's shows, he manages to take extraordinary surroundings and situations and make them so honest and real as comparisons to what we experience in our daily lives.If you enjoy humor of the more quirky, offbeat type you'll appreciate ""Firefly""'s wit, also. Episodes such as ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" and ""Jaynestown"" are truly hilarious.Also episodes of note are the simple heartfelt and moving stories told in ""Out of Gas"" and ""The Message"", while ""Objects in Space"" is Whedon's ode to existential thought and is honestly thought-provoking and stunningly filmed.The acting, writing, and production are superb on the show. It's obvious that Fox started out investing a lot in the show and must've simply given up on it. It's a shame because this show had a heart and a vision rarely ever found on television. I have known several people, including myself, who were skeptical about the show at first. It seemed too odd, too off-kilter. But once I started watching it I realized I didn't know what to expect, and that was part of the great thrill of discovering this little gem."	5.0	Expect the unexpected.	2004-09-09	9	9	0

Ross ""biblemonkey"""	"Let's be honest; for a long time after the show was canceled ""Firefly"" fans could be some of the most obnoxious and pushy fans out there. Constantly flooding every discussion site with ""Firefly"" based arguments and discussions regardless of how out of place they were. This was the main reason that some (like me) avoided the show for a VERY long time.I wasn't a Joss Whedon fan until earlier this year. I hated ""Buffy"" and all the spin-offs and so didn't care about him as a director and creator. Then I saw ""The Avengers"" and received a great intro to what he could do with the right material. Some friends begged me to Watch ""Firefly"" that weekend and I relented and watched the pilot...then I went out the next day and bought the whole series and the movie ""Serenity""!Oh my goodness! The acting! The attention to detail! The writing! I genuinely cared what was going to happen next! I hadn't felt that excited about a show in a long time. The actors are all wonderful in their roles and sometimes you forget that they are acting. They just seem so right. The show took clich&eacute;s of right and wrong and ""heroes"" and turned them on their heads. The stories were both compelling on their own and yet fit into a longer story arc. Whatever was going through the heads of the executives that doomed this show, I will never know. I know that Whedon's constant fear of being canceled led him to focus on making every episode as concise and appealing as possible while being true to his original vision and that very well may have led to better episodes than we would have gotten otherwise, but there is not one bad or out of place episode in the series.If you like good sci-fi with quality everything, this is the show for you."	5.0	Late Comer and now a True Fan	2012-11-29	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1VE7UAKRR9KHQ	"H. Stonehouse ""Yemanya"""	One of the biggest travesties in television history was when in their infinite wisdom, the Fox network decided to cancel 'Firefly'.  I, as I am sure is the case with many fans of original, interesting programmes (especially sci-fi) have a list a mile long of shows, that I grew to love, only to find them axed, far too soon, by TV execs who seem to think their viewing public wish it so. Clearly this is not the case however, otherwise there would not be so many reviews complaining about such decisions.  Out of all these shows, nothing disappointed me more than to see 'Firefly' cancelled, and I'll tell you why. Because it had so much potential, yet it never stood a chance.  I could go on to rant about how it was badly scheduled over in America but I'm sure everyone who is reading this write up knows about that so I'll start with the positives,that is to say, what do I love about 'Firefly'?Firstly, its an unlikely mixture: Cowboys, in space, that lapse into mandarin (especially when swearing, those censors never knew what hit 'em) but it works!  That's because of the very excellent Joss Whedon. His scripts brought warmth and depth to the characters as well as the subtle blend of action and humour,  which we have grown to know and love, see also 'Buffy' and 'Angel' for further reference to his writing abilities.  What Whedon does best is flesh out his leading protagonists so that they are actual people, with quirks and habits, not all of them good, but all of them things that we can relate to as human beings, so that they are more real.  It doesn't matter whether they are in a firefly class cargo vessel, or fighting vampires at some high school, Joss's people are simply that, people. They have heartaches and times in between the adventures that are just like you or I, where they sit and talk and laugh and cry.In the case of 'Firefly' its things like, rivalry in the crew, romantic entanglements (and sometimes the lack there of) and basically trying to survive out there in 'the black' far from what is considered to be civilisation.  They are little people living big lives on the edge, despite the inevitable interferance of the alliance (a vast governmental agency that often gets in the way, as governments have a tendency of doing).Another reason to watch, personally speaking is the rather lovely, Mr Nathan Fillion.  I have been a fan of his work for some time and he does wear those unbelievably, tight trousers (what can I say I'm only human), hence Kaylee's nickname of 'Cpt'n Tight Pants' (see Shindig).  Before I lose all credibility can I just say, he is also a talented actor who helps gel the cast together as indeed the crew in his capacity as Cpt. Malcolm Reynolds.  And what a crew, every character has their own specific traits that make them appealing, even Jayne (well maybe appealing isn't quite the right word in his particular case).  It's also worth mentioning that there is an actual married couple on board. They have arguements at times as couples often do but basically they are completely devoted to one another. If anything was set to sway me on the marriage vote it would be Wash and Zoe. They are solid and look set to remain so, barring any unforseen circumstances. I've seen 'Serenity' so I refuse to say more on that subject...sigh.Finally onto the feature film.  I was so glad to see that after such relentless campaigning, loyal 'browncoats' were able to get 'Serenity' another outing, hopefully not for the last time.  Though another series of 'Firefly' seems like nothing but a beautiful dream, lets hope movie execs will have seen the awesome response to the dvd release both in America and over here in England, and also the impact of the movie and give a much loved little show more time on the big screen.  Here's hoping.  In the mean time as the lyrics say so clearly 'You can't take the sky from me.'	5.0	Fox can't take the sky from me! (though it tried)!	2007-01-18	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVX6JQNGELWJP	"Ian Littlewood ""IanL"""	This show, cast and crew deserved so much better than FOX. What really struck me about this show was that it had no growing pains. Most shows take a while for the actors to find and grow into their characters but the cast of this show immediately fell into their roles. That only happens rarely and only when the casting and stories are of the highest calibre.It always amazes me that FOX comes up with absolute gems of shows and then throws them away to churn out yet another boring, unimaginative reality TV show. Whoever is responsible for picking the shows at FOX needs to be fired because they clearly don't understand what has lasting power. No one will buy a DVD set of any of the rubbish reality shows they create (over... and over... and over again) but this DVD box set has already shot into 12th place on the first day.Then again, perhaps I give FOX too much credit... they've made these kinds of idiotic decisions in the past (anyone remember SAAB?).BUY THIS DVD SET - you'll be treating yourself to a show unlike any other - it's got everything in one box; sci-fi, western, drama, humour.	5.0	One of the best shows ever made	2003-12-09	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3CAKMLAXEPJQM	"Ian McKinney ""just this guy, you know?"""	Firefly was one of the best shows on TV.I think what I liked best about the show is that it took pieces of the world and smashed them together in a new way, but without feeling like it needed to be too specific about the events in the intervening time, so it retained the sort of mythic feel that Whedon does so well.  E.g., as mentioned elsewhere, people speak Mandarin as a matter of course.  We aren't told why, because we don't need to know - it adds flavor, and it suggests plotlines in which we might find out more because THEN we'd need to know.Whedon is also great at starting with what you think is a  stereotype and then turning it on its ear ... and creating his own stereotypes and turning them inside out.  A great example can be seen at the end of the first-aired episode, The Train (and in fact, this instance of SF TV stereotype burning completely sold me on the show).Bring on the movie!	5.0	Brilliant show	2003-09-23	9	8	1

Now that I've actually seen it (at the request of a coworker), I'm amazed.  This is the best show I've seen in years.  It's Brisco County Junior....in space, with a little Ocean's Eleven thrown in for flavor.A terrific ensemble cast with amazing chemistry, great western style and music, superb dialogue, and tremendous variety from episode to episode.  It is truly a loss to the airwaves that this show is no longer on the air.  I truly hope the upcoming movie manages to capture even a tiny bit of the greatness in these episodes.Two thumbs up and then some!  :)  These DVDs are worth your money!	5.0	Wow.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2RSIDJY4LKBQM	"""ibelieve73"""	I never saw this series on the air. Several friends urged me to purchase the box set, however, and I did so on a whim. I have rarely been as impressed with any television series as I am with Firefly.I echo the sentiments of so many other reviewers- while the space-western fusion is fascinating, and the plots intriguing, characterization, characterization, characterization is what makes this series truly great. The dialogue is just fabulous, and reverberates with a sharpness and humor that really surprised me.We grow to care about each one of these people within an amazingly short period of time. There is not a single superficial character (my particular favorites are Wash, the goofy-but-skilled pilot, and Shepherd Book, the preacher-with-a-mysterious past), and the interpersonal dynamics are highly textured and fascinating. Everyone rings true, and nobody is static. We see growth in every character. Even Jayne (the token hard-nosed mercenary) develops (or reveals) unsuspected depths before the end.As a Christian, I'm fascinated with the portrayal of faith on the fringes. I was also intrigued by the post-civil war aspect of the series. In a world in which everything under the sun has been done before, defeated Confederate soldiers in space was a new one on me.I'm thrilled that a movie may be on the horizon. Every DVD set sold increases the chances of that coming to pass, so buy one. You won't regret it.	5.0	Remarkable Storytelling	2004-01-05	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JXEIPSNYHHPC	Ibhuk	In my opinion, this is Joss Whedon's best television series.  The cast has fantastic chemistry and the writing is terrific.  Joss has created an entire sci-fi universe which is easily on par with Star Trek and Star Wars.  It's one of the most beloved science fiction television shows of all time.

The series is very good.  Almost everyone that watches even one or two episodes becomes a strong fan of the series.  Look at the bright side--with only 14 episodes, it's easy to watch the entire series.  There's a movie coming out at the end of Sept. 2005 (in the U.S. -- release dates for other locations around the globe vary)  This movie would probably have never happened were it not for the very high sales of the DVDs.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3MZW0TIJ63TTO	IdrilCelebrindal	I'm mostly adding my review to this just to further express to anyone who will read through these how absolutely worth it this series is.  I was one of those converted by the movie; long-time fan of Joss Whedon, but was stubborn and refused to give Firefly a try.  Saw Serenity and fell in love.  I watched the entire series in a weekend--bought the box set for myself halfway through, knowing there was no way I was going to be happy *not* owning it for myself.Now, I've seen every episode at least half a dozen times, and consider the series to be among my all-time favorites, despite the fact that it's only 14 episodes long.  I have never seen a tv show that developed characters and plotlines so strongly in such a short amount of time.  I've never loved an ensemble cast more--and seen one where I wasn't bothered by at least one of the characters.  The series not only set up background and promises of plotlines (ask any fan of the series about Blue Sun and they'll know what you're talking about, despite the fact that the phrase was never once uttered in the entire run) but brought back characters introduced in early episodes, and continued plots, and threads of plots from one episode to another.  I've been fan of many a sci-fi series (all the Star Treks, both Stargates, Battlestar Galactica, X-Files) and I am not exaggerating when I say that Firefly is better than all the others.Now I curse the name of Fox and pray to any compassionate deity (or television executive) that will aid in the revival of this series.  As others have already stated, if 1900 reviews--95% of them positive--won't convince you, what will?	5.0	One more review	2005-12-08	20	19	1

Firefly - The Complete Series will be in the 16:9 format (1.78:1).According to Chris Buchanan, the show was shot on 35mm film in an aspect ration of 1.78:1 with a 1.33:1 (or 4x3) box to enable delivery of both the standard TV version and a widescreen TV version to Fox Broadcasting.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PCHUMANVRS34	improbable	"This is one of the many reasons I try to avoid Fox: they get great shows (like this and Family Guy) and absolutely screw them up. Instead of the great two-hour premiere that introduced all nine characters and the setting very well, they showed a one-hour, ""more action-packed"" episode to try to hook the audience. It didn't work.Enough about Fox's screwup, though. This series is absolutely brilliant, for many reasons:1. The setting. Combining science fiction technology (spaceships, lasers) with a Wild West setting ends up working better than you might think, especially because the writers take care to emphasize both points quite a bit.2. The characters. Nine of them, all representing different viewpoints, from the preacher to the fugitive doctor to the comic-relief pilot to the ""companion"" (i.e. prostitute). What's really great, though, is how they react differently to each other when different people are present. For example, the preacher is much more open to the companion than to the rest of the crew for some reason.3. The filming. Firefly isn't filmed cleanly, like a lot of science fiction. Zooms, pans, and lens flares are used a lot to give it a ""you are there"" feeling. The special effects are also incredible for a TV series.Personally, ""Firefly"" was the best $40 I ever spent on a DVD, and I can't wait for the movie to come out."	5.0	The Best Science Fiction on TV	2005-02-05	10	9	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30U60O2ZYSTQ5	Ina R. Hark	Ever since &quot;Space, the final frontier&quot; it's been a truism that many themes and plots from westerns can easily be adapted to the science ficiton genre, but no melding of the two has been more daring or more satisfying than Joss Whedon's Firefly about disaffected &quot;Independent&quot; Mal Reynolds, a man on the losing side of an interplanetary civil war 500 years in the future. With his one surviving platoon member, he buys a transport ship, puts together an odd assortment of crew and passengers, and scrapes together a meager living as a trader, smuggler, or whatever else comes along. It's a 'verse inhabited only by humans, colonists from &quot;Earth that was,&quot; a culture in which American and Chinese language and customs predominate equally. All the characters are vibrant and complex, there is a perfect mixture of danger and humor, and there are big plot arcs a'brewin' concerning the powerful megacorporation Blue Sun.FOX network had no idea how to market this intriguing hybrid, and they cancelled it after showing 11 episodes, including the two-hour pilot, which was only broadcast at the end of the series. The DVD puts the episodes in the right order and includes three others that were filmed but never shown. There are also commentaries from cast and crew and a poignant &quot;making of&quot; documentary.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1YRV8ICHSL41F	"Inchoatus.com ""Inchoatus.com"""	Firefly is a very unique offering because it has two conflicting poles of orientation one of which is done very, very well and the other which is haphazard at best. Or, if you will, the Force of Firefly is divided in to the regular Force and the Dark Side of the Force.The Dark Side of the show and the dirty little secret of the series is that the plot itself--and even the setting--was not very compelling. The episodes were very, very pedestrian if you boiled them down and stripped away the actors. A fugitive running from The Law stowing away on a ship? Who hasn't seen this before. A robbery (set on a train)? Seen it. Defend a house (of ill-repute) from villains? Saw it every week on The A-Team when I was a kid. A duel with an effete snob of a villain who desperately overmatches the hero in swordplay? Saw that in Rob Roy of all places... not to mention others. The gunfights are not particularly compelling nor are the fistfights. They occur, they're done moderately well, but they're hardly the groundbreaking action we learned from stalwarts like The Terminator and The Matrix. This is probably what the network suits saw (unlikely they bothered to watch the series). And they weren't wrong about this.But mother of all the gods did they miss the boat on what was so good about the show.On the Good Side of the Force is the characterization. The show is 100% driven by character. No one is watching these shows for the plot. No one is moved by events--rather, it is the characters in the events. People are watching to learn and understand more about Mal and Jayne and the Shepherd and most certainly River. Not to mention the others. The acting, in almost all cases, was superb and well-timed. They are all genuinely interesting. They live with you in ways that are important to all great works of art... they come to embody ideas and feelings that we all share. Like the series' title song, they get under your skin (in the words of one of the actors) and live with you. This is an exceptional compliment to Joss Whedon and the other writers not to mention the actors. Beyond doubt, the superb actors had the requisite sincerity to sell the audience on the work, which is desperately essential in any series like this. We watched the series because of the people. We don't remember the episodes, only what the characters said and did in the episodes.In fact, Firefly shares the most similarities with The Highlander television series. Like Firefly, Highlander seldom had anything interesting going in the way of plot. Every episode ended the same: swordfight with the bad guy, head cut off. Every episode!! It was the most stunning example of pleasantly enjoying the expected (this line from an elegy regarding Johnny Carson--don't remember who said it and would appreciate it if someone could tell us) the world has ever known. Yet Highlander was successful because the audience didn't care about the swordfights. They cared about Duncan. They cared about the Watchers. They cared about the motivations of these people and the things that they were doing.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	4.0	A very Good and Unusual Show	2005-02-10	16	13	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GFSI64DIXNLY	itstherobotdevil	First, regarding the format, the blu-ray quality is excellent.  It's definitely a big step up from the DVD version.  I have yet to watch the special features or watch episodes with the included commentary.As to the show itself, it's hard to describe it fully.  There's a reason this show has developed a cult following after its untimely demise.  Like so many great shows, it was a victim of poor timing and bad handling by the network.  I know I was only vaguely aware of it when it was on, and only came to know (and love it) long after it had been canceled.The show has a great balance of action, drama and humor.  The character development is top-notch.  I'm not sure I can think of any other show in which I was so actively engaged in so many characters' stories.  Each episode gives you more of a look into these interesting and unusual character's histories and lives, though generally small enough that it keeps you wanting to know more.  Sadly, the show ended before it was able to explain many of the questions that it introduced.The dialog is snappy and well written, and the plots of each episode are always fun and exciting.  The show does an excellent job of weaving in series-level elements (plot points which span the entire season) with individual episodic stories.  Some shows do little to tie episodes together, and some spend so much on making everything on a season level that each episode has little value in itself.  Firefly is definitely not one of those shows.All in all, this is a great show.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi (or maybe even westerns, with its unique western-sci-fi combination, which works surprisingly well).  This blu-ray is a great way to enjoy the show, and it often goes on sale for around $35.	5.0	Great release of an amazing show	2011-06-14	3	2	1

I decided years ago that I did not want to be forced to watch anymore commercials. With the launching of Netflix I am now able to catch up on many of the series I missed when they were first being aired minus those stupid commercials.I was hesitant at first to watch this series and almost skipped over it however I did watch it and I can tell you by the end of the first episode I was hooked. Everything about this series was right, cast members, character developement, story line, even the space ship design struck up a good feeling reminding me of how I use to catch fireflies on a warm summer evening in Ohio.This show was a winner. It had the markings of becoming so huge the other networks would be scrammbling to come up with some type of copycat programming.Yes, I do believe the decision makers at FOX are idiots.	5.0	Are idiots making the decisions at FOX?	2011-04-16	5	4	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JEEHM4ACXJZA	"Jack Bratincevic ""Aspiring Conductor"""	I really don't like TV, but I would strongly urge you to buy this set.  I am a pianist and a classical music buff, so television shows have always struck me as a waste of time.  Firefly, however, is another matter entirely.  I can add little to what the other reviewers have said, stating only that this TV show has given me slight hope for the dying soul of American entertainment.  It's a direct descendant of 50's westerns, coupled with a generous helping of Star Wars and just a pinch of Cowboy Bebop (the only example of Japanese television I can stand).I am, in fact, taking the time to buy the DVD set of Firefly not just to own it (I already have burned copies) but to contribute in some meager way to the production of more episodes and films.This is the first review I have ever written.  I intend to write my second and only other review as soon as I am done with this one--a review of the film Serenity.	5.0	They'd best revive this show.	2006-01-02	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2U5TOHRO4AVF9	Jack	Ah, yes, Firefly.  I read many of the critiques before buying this series and was pleased to see so many had rated it with 5 stars, so I bought the entire series. The story moved quickly and there were certainly no &#8220;draggy&#8221; parts at all; it was an entertaining, swashbuckling tale not unlike Robin Hood-style pirates in deep space and the actors did a fair to good job.  As far as the story line, I would rate Firefly with 4.5 stars.HOWEVER&#8230;.As to how they had the characters all outfitted and the soundtrack, I would rate Firefly with  star only.  The Director, Joss Whedon was quoted saying, about the collector's edition of Serenity, on his thoughts of Firefly&#8230;called Firefly &#34;one of the best shows I've ever seen, by a country mile&#8221;.It was? Why? I didn&#8217;t see that. Trust me, dear reader,  there are so very many that are far, far better movies than this one! Sorry, but I certainly have to disagree with Mr. Whedon.  Of course, his comments seem likely, as he IS trying to get us to buy the more expensive collector&#8217;s edition of Firefly which I would not even think of doing.The story line was okay, and the ship &#8220;Serenity&#8221; was okay, but it ends there. The clothing, soundtrack, form of dress, mannerisms and weapons used in the story were CRAPPY and completely unbelievable, to put it mildly. The setting of the story line is supposed to be 500 years into the future from what I read in the synopsis. If this is the case, then what in the world were the writers thinking when they had all the actors armed with antique weapons and mimicking old 1960&#8217;s westerns? &#8230; Zoe, for example, was armed with what appears to be Steve McQueen&#8217;s old weapon, the cut down old .30-30 Winchester from &#8220;Wanted Dead or Alive&#8221;.  Good grief! Other characters were armed with old revolvers, AK-47&#8217;s and old lever-action .30-30 Winchesters! Really! This would be very much like a crew today of a cargo ship on the high seas moving cargo from port to port, wearing the armor of the conquistadors and armed with old black powder matchlock archebuses or crossbows of the 13th century. The weapons used by the characters were those that one might find in a museum in the year 2512. Further, the characters had handguns strapped down low, like the old Hollywood gunfighters, and it looked downright silly.  This, along with the knee-high boots, slickers from &#8220;Once Upon a Time in The West&#8221; and a music soundtrack right out of &#8220;Deliverance&#8221; ruined the entire show turning it into a fantasy an eighth grader writing this for an unwanted English assignment.Come on, people! Sorry to say, we are no longer in the seventh grade and starved for anything at all to watch.  At least hire someone in the costume department who has an IQ higher than the number of his/her fingers and toes who has an idea what the hell they are doing.	1.0	A Space spaghetti western	2013-03-06	97	14	83

Halfway through the first episode, I found myself immediately loving and caring about all of them. By a couple episodes in, they seem like old friends.On a more abstract level, Firefly captures the fascinating conflict of American ideals/values/desires. Freedom, the veneration of the individual, security, justice. From the lawless anarchic libertarian extreme on one end of the universe to the structured totalitarian centralized extreme on the other, the show plays quite brilliantly with the balance of power, security, and freedom in the mankind's ultimate &#34;wild west&#34;: the infinity of space.	5.0	easily my favorite TV show ever	2014-04-15	0	0	0

Every single person that I introduce it to falls in love with it.  Saw an episode on primetime once but it was cancelled so quick i never saw it on FOX again.  Picked it up by chance soon after seeing Serenity and was surprised by the show.  Another example of FOX destroying a show that could have made it.  The movie mad a lot more sense, too.  I think it might be Joss Whedon's best work, though he did a pretty good job on the avengers.  Better than angel, buffy, or dollhouse (I was never a big fan of buffy).  I have watch this series repeatedly and it is one of the few things that i just don't get bored of.  Too bad it got cancelled so quickly.  The shows I like are not usually the ones that make it (a few exceptions).  I am hoping it might get rebooted one day, but FOX owns the title and no one will ever play Mal the way Fillion does. He owns that character, as far as I am concerned.	5.0	Best and most underated cancelled show of all time.  If you even find sci fi just tolerable give this show a look.	2014-05-29	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	At first it looks and sounds light and even amateurish, and then you understand it is fully positioned on another level. It is a mixture of several genres within the frame of a science-fiction film entirely contained in , and around, a special spaceship called Serenity, a spaceship that is a firefly, a bug, a burning insect. The first genre is the functional and psychological happenings within a team of nine people who are together for both the best and the worst, in order to transform the worst into the best, or at least the better by being together. The team is limited to nine people, a perfect diabolic and satanic number, and no manipulation like Serenity is the tenth character will take that dimension away. Nine is perfect because you always have at least one who is totally set apart from the regrouping of people into couples or pairs. And in the end you wonder who is the one who is really apart, who is totally odd, alone because of the various and subtle compositions with only one couple that is really defined as such and all the others being transient, multiple, varied, changing, shifting at various levels of possible realization. In a way it is Star Trek revisited but without all the hullaballoo that goes along with the soldiers, the mechanics, the petty personnel of a flagship. The second genre is of course, recurrent and varied too, the western but in many realizations too. Of course we have the very traditional space western or space cowboy film, like in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, seen from the point of view of the driver marooned on the side of the road after having been forced to lend his car. But there is more. We can think of other models: Dead or Alive, Bonanza (even), Mad Max, a vague allusion to Star wars with the Alliance, a lot of Jules Verne, William Gibson and a few others, even at times, though they might not  know it, Ron Hubbard, and the bordello in the desert is so close to some Indian bordello in some Bollywood classic. We do not have John Wayne and the Indians, but we can afford not to have that genocidal side of the western. The next genre is more trendy and modern with some kind of loose and yet very emotional sensual, erotic even, life or imagination. Many allusions, visual or linguistic, and even here and there an allusion to gay people, slack, as they come up like in one episode, though this side of personal life is warded off nicely, and the allusion to crazy, insane and yet envisaged incest was purely rejected from the series and is a supplementary scene, meaning, a censored one, even if self-censored. We could go on for ever with that game. But what is important is that the film or the series is highly original in the end. It is deeply human and humane, deeply attached to justice and fairness, even with someone who trips into treachery for a slight moment, or one episode. At the same time it is ruthless and even maybe cruel by indifference like when bringing the millionaire to the easy lady he had made pregnant and whose child he had tried to steal knowing that he was going to be shot blank on the spot  by the mother, or also when they get rid of the bounty-hunter by just pushing him into space where he is going to die slowly, except of course if he shortens his life himself and commits suicide. The series is also highly imaginative and each episode really has a knack and appeal of its or their own. We enter the episode and we will be released only when the  case is concluded. Each episode is perfectly self-contained, even when what is announced in one episode does not take place in the next one because the announcement is the punch line of the concerned episode and it would unbalance the next episodes if it were made true. So they whirl around with a pirouette, when they bother, or they just forget, or they think of it and discard it to the supplementary scenes. Self-containment is the best quality of each of these episodes. In other words quite a successful series that, it is true, found its magic achievement in that final symbolic metaphoric blending of Serenity and River, of the escaping spaceship and the mentally disarrayed girl. Then the team is one and the odd shot of that team becomes the heart and soul of it in this final blending. The route has been run from the beginning to the end and the final harbor has been reached beyond all the deserts and dangers possible. They can  live happily ever after. There is a certain fairy tale dimension in this series, and it is one of its stronger assets.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines	5.0	So brilliantly creative and warmhearted	2008-10-06	3	2	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZO9D554VQO9F	Jadecat	I was originally told I should watch the Buffy series, and I got hooked on that and watched them all.  The same people suggested Firefly, and because it was from Whedon, I thought okay, perhaps.  I rented disk 1 and it sat around for days, but then I saw that Nathan Fillion was in it, and he was a fine sight to look at in the last episodes of Buffy, so I figured I should watch Firefly.  Thats  all it took.  Now there are no more episodes to watch and I can only dare to hope there will be more.  Being over 40 and long ago having posters of Captain Kirk on my wall, these shows are a great improvement over Star Trek and Star Wars.  It is mind boggling that a show like this got cancelled so early while other shows less worthy go on and on.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FAEHP6J71RNV	"Jake ""The Snake"""	"I recently received the series ""Firefly"" as a gift.  I was wanting to watch it before I watched ""Serenity"" since they go hand in hand.  I don't what they were thinking cancelling the show.The cast of Firefly is so well put together and there is so much character base you can't really do anything besides watch.  The interaction between the cast and the character development is very impressive.  Most of the actors have had small roles in motion pictures or been a recurring character on a tv series, so they've all gotthe experience.  In Firefly though it seems that the characters were made to play those roles.As far as the stories and episodes go, well they are pretty put together.  Its not necessarily a series that you would be completely lost in if you came in half way through but it is good to have seen it from the beginning.  The story is alittle deeper than most TV series out there right now.  Seeing the way the characters act makes more sense because some background is provided on just about all of the characters.  Also the irony in what they do to survive is great.  All anti-heros whether they like it or not.In closing I just have to say that this series deserves alot more than what it was given.  Regardless, if you're a sci-fi fan or not, this is something you would enjoy.  If you like shows where you get to know your characters and want to have a good time watching this is the way to go."	5.0	Wasn't given a chance	2006-01-07	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AZBME7LBPMF7W	"Jakob Ambrose ""Jake"""	Firefly has the same problem that all of Whedon's shows have. It is unfocused and meanders for far too long. You can throw away about eight episodes a season because he does not know where he wants to go with them. He spends too much time fumbling around in the dark looking for a purpose or a plotline to follow and that is what happened with Firefly. The only difference is that he spends more time world building in this one instead of creating a purpose for the season.After seeing all of the episodes, well it does not live up to the hype. The characters are generic Whedon archetypes. It spends too much time with its being cutesy poo dialog, which is not witty or clever. It spends way too much time explaining insignificant details of the universe that will never pay off. I would probably have enjoyed the show, but the diehard Firefly fans ruined any enjoyment I might get out of it. They built this show up to be one of the greatest shows ever made, proclaimed every episode is golden and chided a network for acting like a business.And nd no, I'm not some lone warrior looking to start a fight. I'm just speaking to the truth that a lot of you are in denial about. Firefly failed not because of some correct order nonsense. If the producer had an idea where he was going, the show would have lasted longer. The general science fiction fanbase saw a badly made show that was confusing to follow. They saw a show whose producer did not have the decency to give them a reason to tune in the following week.Before you spout your correct order nonsense, the science fiction audience had an opportunity to see it in the correct order when SciFi aired for the 13 weeks leading up to the Serenity movie premiere. They did not watch it then, nor did they watch when it was on 13 hour marathons. It was the lowest rated show on SciFi. Ridicule it all you want, but this was from back in the day when SciFi still showed quality science fiction, like Galactica and Farscape. If it did poorly back then, what should that tell you about the show.I am sorry if you Whedonites do not like hearing this, but that is reality. If the show was good, then it did not matter the order it was aired. If the show was good, it would be in its 8th or 9th season. If the show was good, it would not need your wishful thinking and vitriolic responses to keep it alive. If the show was good, it would have expanded beyond the Whedonite audience. Sorry, but the show was not good and you are doing a disservice by hyping the hell out of it.	1.0	Does not live up to any of the hyperbole the fans heap upon it.	2012-03-10	98	17	81

You all know that it's a criminal shame that the show only lasted 13 episodes. A peculair combination of the Western and Sci-Fi genres that really works. Some of the best writing Joss and his crew have ever done, some great acting and characters. Top show.As a UK resident for some reason we don't have Firefly on blu-ray so I took the plunge and ordered it from the US. I was a little concerned as the blu-ray is in NTSC while we watch stuff in PAL over here. However I don't really think it made any difference to picture quality. It looks great, the extras are nice - the cast lunch is entertaining. Basically it's the same great show but in a nicer format and taking up less space on your shelf.It also took a ridiculously short time to come over to the UK and I somehow avoided paying UK customs duty on it (it was just under the value bracket miraculously!)Any yes the blu rays do play on the UK players.	5.0	Firefly - best short tv show ever!

So get one to lend. In truth, if it were possible to buy just the first disc, I'd say get that to lend out. After watching the first disc, most of your friends will be ordering their own copies.I should also warn you that Star Trek and other sci-fi shows may seem a little cheesy to you after you watch Firefly. That's just how it goes. Oh, I should also warn you that you may find yourself doing things you thought you would never be geeky enough to do, like buying tee-shirts and coffee mugs with the Blue Sun logo, and reviewing the DVDs on Amazon . . .Ooops.	5.0	Just Buy Two	2005-05-17	30	27	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKK68YLVB5Y40	james	If you like Sci-Fi and you are looking for something to fill the gaping hole left when the last disk of BSG spun to a halt in your DVD player, you might like this.  I loved it.  It has very little in common with the aforementioned, in terms of character personalities and plot, but is a great series and hits on some interesting ideas.  BSG is of course, very militaristic and stark.  Firefly is a bit warmer and fuzzier.  Sadly it is only one season and I am already bummed even though I'm only half-way through!  Joss Whedon is the writer and director.  He is best know to me for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is not the least bit interesting to me, but I did watch a couple of episodes and admittedly it is pretty smart and funny.  This has no vampires or demonic themes, just space ships and social commentary, as good Sci-Fi should.	5.0	smart space western	2013-02-10	0	0	0

And I mean ever, with apologies to GR. Fox TV has to be chastised for trying to kill it right out of the gate.

I am surprised I did not see this TV series when it was on the air, but then again I rarely watch TV.  However, Firefly is a show worth planning on being in front of the TV for.  The cast and writers have done an excellent job of character development.  In just a pilot and first two episodes, the characters are well defined and likeable.I have always thought of science fiction and space travel in terms of Star Trek (happy people in space!)  Firefly takes a slightly more dim view of humanity's future and the government (a.k.a. The Alliance).  And, I never thought I would see someone ride up to a space ship on horseback or a space ship flying over the top of a train. But, the series works, the characters are great, and the special effects/sets are realistic and convincing.Fox took a show with great potential and really screwed it up.

In general, I am more of a movie person due to the more intricate plot and the uninterupted action, but this show breaks all of my expectations and preconceptions.Firefly has more plot depth and character interaction in every 45 minute episode than and full-length movie I have ever seen.  In addition, every episode in this, while short, show is meaningful and entertaining.  There are no ""filler episodes"" but rather just quality television that I find myself coming back to over and over again.  In addition, the music of Firefly is among my favorite of all time, TV or otherwise.  The theme song will stick in your head forever, and unlike other 'song viruses,' you won't care!The only drawback is that there aren't more episodes.  You will reach the end of the fourteenth episode and just sort of stare at the screen blankly, thinking ""now what???""

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APLC1VT8N6G2X	James S Hinsey	"And that is exactly what Joss Whedon gave us in this adventurous series called ""Firefly"".  You can call it a crossing of western and sci-fi motifs, but the show is really about the characters that live aboard the fine ship 'Serenity'.  When I first saw this show on TV I saw something that was unique in its crossing of genres and the humor and twists in plot that are typical of Joss Whedon's genius.  Nothing else on television is like it.  Some try to compare it to Star Trek, which gives us ""alien-of-the-week"" type stories and is very sterile.  Firefly is dirty, suspenseful, sexy, adventurous, and funny and watching it makes me really care about the people in it.

The copy of the Blu-ray Firefly: The Complete Series that I received from Amazon had no Episode Guide in the case. Went to Fox Home Entertainment website, and asked them to send me a replacement copy of the missing Episode Guide. Absolute no response from Fox Home Entertainment. Contacted Amazon about the problem and was sent a replacement copy in 2 days, opened the replacement copy, guess what no Episode Guide again. Contacted both Fox Home Entertainment and Amazon customer service again, received a call right away from Amazon who was very sorry that Firefly: The Complete Series had been problematic, absolutely no response from Fox Home Entertainment.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1A1DZLPXO169W	James Wright	I don't know where to begin.Firefly is by far the best television show ever in my mind.The jokes aren't the funniest, nor are they &quot;stupid humor&quot; that is always easy to get.  Often jokes even happen in the background away from the main action creating a more &quot;realistic&quot; atmosphere.The storylines aren't even the most origional, but they help bring out a bit of nostalgia and help you remember the campy western AND scifi shows of era's gone.The acting, now the acting is superb, especially on the part of Nathan Fillion (Malcom Reynolds).  Nathan Fillion was unknown to me prior to watching Firefly.  It was even mentioned by a friend of mine that he wasn't the &quot;right casting&quot; for the part of the Captain...however, by the end of the series the same friend said the part was perfectly cast.  Nathan Fillion has the ability to play any emotion he is asked to.  He is perfect as the &quot;gruff/loving/friendly/hardened soldier&quot; type that is his character.  That may seem like a confused character, however it is played EXCELLENTLY by Nathan Fillion.I honestly can't figure out what is so redeeming about this show, but I love every minute of it.  After having watched the entire series 5 times through I STILL get urgest to watch it and feel strong emotions when I see specific quotes from the series.If you are at all a fan of Science Fiction OR Westerns, I urge you to give this show a chance.	5.0	Get her flying again.	2004-05-12	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1SNJ02JVR7AKM	Jamie White	"A few months a ago, I had hardly even heard of ""Firefly"". I dimly recalled it being on Fox a few years ago and having been canceled. I even more dimly recalled from reading SF news sources online that there was a movie (Serenity) on the way and a series of comics in the works. But, I'm usually home on Fridays, and what the heck, SciFi channel was showing the series right before Stargate: SG1, one of the few TV shows I watch regularly anymore. So I tuned in.Within 9 weeks, I was completely addicted. Within nine weeks, I had spent half of one of my paychecks on Firefly/Serentity merchendise and dragged my parents to a showing of the film (which we all ended up enjoying immensely). Within 10 weeks and after having gotten a copy of the box set and seeing the original 2-part pilot episode (which I had previously missed), I had decided to buy even more stuff and make my Christmas list - both of the soundtracks, books on it, name it - filled out mostly by Firefly/Serenity stuff. And today I decided to buy more copies of the box set that I already own just so that I can share this rare gem of a show. I've never gotten so addicted to or so obsessed with a show this quickly. Never.It's just THAT good.I can't think of anybody who wouldn't enjoy this show on at least some level.Hardcore SF fans will love it for the attention to detail - there's no sound in space, the vast human culture that went out into the universe speaks quite a bit of Chinese, and all sorts of other nifty, subtle touchs. Engineers would probably love the ships, including the homely-in-a-beatiful-sort-of-way Serenity herself, the Firefly class ship whose design is geniusly practical (and her rear lights up something gorgeous, too). Film students or film junkies will love it for the unusual, wonderful camera work, brilliant acting, great special effects, and fantastic use of both beautiful, earthy music and poignant moments of dead silence. Fans of westerns will love the feel of the show and theme of the show, which is that of a western in space (some planets our heroes go to even have horses and saloons, and the crew of Serenity's robbed trains before). Horror fans will fall in love with the damn scary Reavers, cannibalistic madmen who terrorize even the toughest of men just by their name being overheard. Fans of Joss Whedon's work (such as Buffy or Angel) will recognize the fantastically snappy dialogue and wonderful, unpredictable combination of drama, action and comedy.Everybody else will love it for any and all of the above reasons, and because it's just a really great show. The cast is wonderful, the action is thrilling, the comedic parts wonderfully funny, the music and effects work is great, and the dialogue is... well, just fantastic, there's no other way to describe it. I have no idea how Fox could bring themselves to end this show before its run was complete; they had the perfect SF show fall right into their laps, and they just... abandoned it. Thank goodness for DVD and for Universal for picking the series up for at very least one very good film.If you liked Serenity, you'll love Firefly. Heck, if you love anything from good horror to good science fiction to great writing to... well, trust me when I say, in all liklihood, if you enjoy breathing, you're going to enjoy this show.To boot, the DVDs also have some great extras; I haven't checked out the final disc, where most of the extras like Alan Tudyk (Wash)'s audition tape or the deleted scenes or gag reel are, but over half the series (eight episodes, counting the two-part series pilot) has audio commentaries on it, and having just finished watching the first one (for the pilot episode, also called ""Serenity"") with Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion (Mal Reynolds), I can verify that that one is both informative and incredibly fun. It pointed out a lot of the little details that I missed, and Joss and Nathan are both just flat-out funny to begin with. Joss has two other commentaries on here, and Nathan one other commentary, so that's four (the commentary for the ""Serenity"" episodes is all one commentary) episode commentaries that are automatically good ... though having watched the commentary that Jane Espensen, one of the writers, did for an episode on the season 3 Buffy box set, I'm sure that the commentary she has on here is equally interesting and entertaining, too. And that there is most of the commentaries on here, though most of the others have actors on them and actors on average tend to be fun and interesting on commentaries in my experience, so I look forward to those as well.All in all, this set is a great buy, and I doubt anyone will regret it.Stay shiny, folks!"	5.0	Best Science Fiction Show That I've Ever Watched	2005-10-28	20	17	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A13DZQ0NPX855S	jancola	"I, like many other Buffy fans, tried to watch Firefly when it was on TV and failed miserably.  This was due to many things, mostly the fact that is was on Friday night, and because it was not shown in order and therefore made a minimum of sense.Much better on the DVD, you get to watch everything in order, on demand, and without commercials.  I bought this at the Fox studio store for $20 and it was the best $20 I ever spent.  Like Joss Whedon's other shows, Firefly blends the best of the dramatic (""Out of Gas"") with the humorous (""Jaynetown"") for some truly excellent television.The DVDs are nicely packaged in individual slim cases so the discs aren't constantly falling out and getting scratched like the Buffy/Angel sets.  There are some neat extras too, notably Joss Whedon singing the theme song (his version is actually better than the one they used) and an awesome 5.1 audio track that makes it better than it ever could have been on TV.Buy this DVD set, and see the movie Serenity next year!"	5.0	Do you like Sci-Fi?

When I'd finished the series I actually felt sad that it was over and then decided to start at the beginning again!  They were so idiotic to cancel this series.  If it would have been marketed properly I believe a lot more sci-fi fans would have joined the ranks and gotten behind it.  It's a great show that I believe should still be on the air.

Unfortunately it is entirely too fresh, and just plain to0 good for mainstream TV to appreciate.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A274KYR1DZBU0O	jape55	After seeing the thousands of great reviews I had to check this out. What I saw was a decent concept and the potential for strong stories and characters that, honestly could easily have been more than they were. One thing that bothered me were the many completely clich&eacute;d bad guys- evil corporate types and of course (welcome back to the '70s), anybody that promotes traditional values.  Also, the basic story lines of each show were extremely predicatable, things you've seen before in many other shows. Several of the main characters were either over the top or felt like they'd been drug out of the old TV Land toy chest, dressed up with new clothes and presented as something new.I know, it's TV, what do you expect? If this would have come out in the 80's it would probably have been a huge hit. But there a few shows out there from it's time and now that make it look pretty cheesy. Battlestar Galactica is a good example.Having said that, the much more realistic view of humanity a few hundred years from now was very refreshing and relatable compared to the utopian fantasy that shows like Star Trek portray. Yes it would be nice if nobody needed money and people were so loving that we all just sought to better our minds. But thousands of years of human history prove that isn't going to happen in another thousand years, much less in 300-500.Even though I complained a lot, this series was good enough for me to want to watch the whole box set. Now it'll make a good gift at the next office Christmas party.	3.0	"""Ok"" series. Worn out plots."	2010-04-08	9	4	5

This unique show has both.My wife and I purchased this over the holidays. We made it a marathon weekend and watched all the episodes. After watching the entire first season, I found that I had missed out on something pretty incredible. When it originally aired, it was shown out of order and several episodes weren't shown at all making things very confusing. It is shame how a great show can be mishandled the way this one was. There is a mix of the old fashioned Western and classic Science fiction. I found that Joss Whedon made the mix not only believable but loveable at the same time. Each episode made me yearn for another(thus the marathon viewing). If you love campy humor (of the likes of the old Buck Rogers Tv Shows), deep background stories and hints of more..this series will be for you.

Though the story isn't that far fetched it has been met with some criticism from the ""its a sci-fi/western combo"" crowd. This does have western elements but the overall theme is very sci-fi and instead of focusing entirely on the gadgets and gizmos, they decided to focus more on the people and how they cope with hardships in the future. Think of this more like the developed world today versus the 3rd world. If anyone has ever been to a 3rd world country, the scenario in this show isn't all that far fetched, in fact, it's very very plausible except for some minor details. If you've ever seen a donkey pulling a half gutted automobile while the rider, wearing rags, talks on a cellular phone and has a rifle strapped to his arm, this show will bring you back to those life changing experiences.Basically, the characters are on the edge of their civilized galaxy where very little technology is present, but that which is is quite a deal more advanced than ours. The tech in this show is very subtle in its display and often has to be called out for you to even notice such as holographic pool balls.Point is, it is a really good show, and after watching it all for free online, I just ordered the box set. I hope this somehow finds a second chance. Most of the key characters are really multi-dimensional and those who aren't are still very likable if not in form then function."	5.0	Excellent Take on Sci-Fi	2008-03-17	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3ER32CA64D96P	"Jason Jackson ""Jason Jackson"""	I started watching this show when it came out on Fox a couple of years ago, and loved it.  The characters and stories were all well thought out.  Being a space western, the feel of the show was unique and the special effects were better than anything seen on TV. However, something always seemed a little weird, like the episodes were out of order.  As it turns out, my gut feelings were right.  What can only be called horribly management and scheduling by Fox, episodes were played out of order.  The 2 hour series premiere was not shown first.  Instead another episode started the series on TV, jumping right into the middle of a plot line and characters that the audience didn't know.  Eleven episodes later Fox had done such a poor job promoting this critically acclaimed show that it was cancelled with another 3 episodes left unaired.  These episodes are included, fully produced, on the DVD set.So many Firefly DVD sets have now been sold that Universal Studios has series creator Joss Whedon (Buffy and Angel fame) already filming a Firefly big screen movie called &quot;Serenity&quot; (serenitymovie.com).  I would encourage anyone to by the series.  You will be left wanting more, which will be coming next spring!	5.0	Great Show! Not just for sci fi junkies!	2004-07-10	2	2	0

This is truly an entertaining show. The characters are so well thought out and the actors do such a wonderful job of portraying them...it is too bad the show wasn't on longer because I really love it. The set comes in a nice box/sleeve with nice artistic scenes from the show. Each disc jacket has one of the characters pictured on it.

After the first episode, I was addicted. I then watched the show for a good 5 hours before finally deciding to go to sleep. This and 24 go on my list as the most addictive shows I have ever seen. The DVD boxset is superb. It is a pure tragedy that Fox cancelled this show. They dropped the ball on this one. So anyways, buy it.

It was great. As avid Sci Fi lover this show has more balls than Star Trek does because there is no Prime Directive...and even if there was...to hell with the Prime Directive when you're trying to survive. Babylon 5 has nothing on this...

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3NVD5XFTX4RPF	Jason Robicheau	This is a good series.  If I had to describe it I would call it a American Western Sci-Fi show.  Some have suggested it is better then Stargate series.  I don't agree; I found Stargate much more enjoyable!  Some problems existed with Firefly that could have made the show a little more interesting.  First the guns look like old six shooters and make a cheep sound and effect when fired, so much for 500 years in the future!  Second, why are all the Alaince troops wearing Starship Trooper armour???  Did I miss something; is it a spin off in the same universe or something?  Not many of the people writing Firefly reviews have adressed that?  In general I found most of the costume and props cheep looking?  I would have given it 3.5 stars but you can't.

However, I bought an HD-DVD player and purchased the movie ""Serenity"" which was based off of this series.  After seeing the characters in the feature film, I couldn't wait to see the show that spawned it.  I have to say this series is absolutly wonderful.  The characters and stories are refreshing, yet familiar.  The storytelling and development are top notch.  I wish I could have been a fan earlier and tried to help keep it on the air.  Only downside... it was cancelled and you are left wanting so much more at the end of the final DVD disk..."	5.0	A great series, and a brand new fan!	2007-03-08	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2RNU49OEH8L9W	"Jason S. Taylor ""Marco's Realto"""	"Like many I loved Firefly. The setting has long been praised and it is done well enough: though there are better(esp the Traveller RPG verse) there are worse. The absense of FTL can give a feeling of hopelessness though. You know that sooner or later they will take the sky from Mal and his crew. It is the characters that are best though.The disadvantages should be given first. There is considerable inappropriateness including nudity and sexual references. There is a lot of casual violence too but at least it is appropriate to the setting. The advantages of the show far outweigh such things. Fortunately unlike in some shows, such things tend to be concentrated in a few parts so the more straitlaced like this reviewer can filter it fairly easily with a fast-forward without disturbing the plot.The crew of the Serenity are what might be called Space Cossacks. They are people gone into the wild to escape the confines of a large empire like the original Cossacks. They live by smuggling, trade and banditry out on the borders of ""the Alliance"" They go there for various reasons from resentment, like Mal to survival, like the Tams(the Tams are a classic example of noble fugitives, like many a courtier in history who has run afoul of high-class intrigue). Much of the show is a heroic portrayal of Scotch-Irish morality with a strong emphasis on loyalty to the in group. It is also reminder of the need for checks on centralized authority. In a way the show is kind of a reverse of Star Trek being from the perspective of the crew of a lowly tramp ship  instead of members of a large naval bureaucracy.Mal rules like a clan chieftain. He is violent and unafraid to kill(his sin really is wrath) but he treats his crew like men and has a strong protective instinct. Zoe is his sidekick. She unfortunately has a little developed personality but Wash the pilot and her husband likes her a lot. Inara I never took to and thought her rather embarrassing. She is sweet, sensitive and considerate but I would agree with Mal that a professional is a professional even if she gives herself a fancy name. But she is plausible and there have been folk like her in history. Book is an interesting character because not many sci-fis allow religion to come naturally. Jayne I quite disliked. He has many fans but his fans really seem to love him because he is so hyperbolically despicable and repulsive that he seems to many to be lovable. But somehow I find it hard to like someone who was a bully, a traitor, a coward(yes he is despite his display), a blowhard and insults a disturbed girl in front of her and her brother. That is kind of the point though. As for other characters, well who could forget dear little Kaylee, the sweet little Ms fix-it?. She is cheerful, cute, and has a crush on the good Dr Simon who is prim, awkward and most unfortunately very busy, making returning such  things difficult for him and thus leaving the viewer in suspense.My favorite all the characters was River Tam and her brother Dr. Simon Tam. Simon was the best and most complex of all of them. He has an appealing combination of warmth and rationality. He is softspoken, polite(except when being impolite is appropriate)and rather dandyish. But in a way he was the bravest of the crew. He was willing to accept loss of status, exile, and peril because his sister was wronged and there was no one else to right it. He is usually gentle and not a skilled fighter, but he is at times as dangerous and as awe-inspiring as you would expect from someone who has nothing left to lose but honor and a loved one he sacrificed everything for. In times of stress he can remain remarkably calm and he is possessed of a tremendous determination. He can be a self-control freak sometimes and one suspects him of being haunted by irrational guilt. At times his devotion to River approaches sainthood but he has hidden a latent fanaticism which we catch an occasional glimpse of and which seems quite human(the higher one tries to climb the farther to fall). He is most of the time a doting big-brother and cares for her with such skills his profession allows him(an out-of-specialty case but at least he knows HOW to learn on the job). As well as the affection that perhaps she needs even more. But when his sister is threatened he is as fierce as a wolf defending a cub. He comes out as a very noble yet still human character and manages to be good while still being likable.River is a great and sympathetic portrayal of a disturbed person. Mental affliction is a misfortune that one can fear looking at closely. But River humanizes it. She was rendered insane by government experiments and the Alliance thinks her a ""precious commodity"". At times she is a normal girl. And at other times she is very not normal. It is Simon's mission to protect her-and incidently protect others from her. A job bigger then most young men face, even those in the top three percent of med school.The relationship between Simon and River is beautiful and well presented. It lifts the show up into the epic level. The two are inseparable and feel themselves alone in a hostile world. They sometimes provide moments of tears and sometimes provide moments of awe but do so in a homey way that looks believable(River: ""I didn't think you would come for me."" Simon:""Well you're a dummy""). It is more believable still when one realizes that even ""mere"" human love can at times be as spectacular and still look very much like that. Here one can as is sometimes the case learn the beauty of real flowers by seeing fairy flowers.One essay once compared Simon and Mal and this seems at first glance a odd contrast, Simon's city-slicker perfectionism and Mal's ruffianly nature seem an odd fit. They start off as rivals because the interests of those they respectively protect seem to clash. But they slowly learn to respect each other and are alike in their protective instincts, and in their determination.Firefly is a great production. It has been widely praised by people of all kinds and has something for everyone. One can hope that more sci-fis will come that will be as good as Firefly. But there can never be another Firefly."	5.0	Space Cossacks	2009-07-15	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3LL3VIS23LJ7I	Jason Stewart	Somehow, I started watching the show, it was great.  I know that space opera is passe, especially with audiences that Fox goes after...  Watching Fox reality shows is not high on my list of things to do.  If I want reality, I'll watch the news.It had blasters, babes, and bad guys.  What more do you want....  It wasn't Kurasawa but it was better than any other weekly broadcast.Tivo was recording my fix, and then the bottom fell out.  I plug into the net and discovered Fox blew another one...sigh.  It figures, I'm just leaving the important Fox demographics.  I'm not a teenager, not uneducated, not urban....	5.0	Great Show...Great DVD	2003-11-25	12	11	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AG2MUJDHQL4QM	"Jason T. Reimche ""jtr7"""	It's not flawless, but it gets so much right, I don't care!  Like Tim Minear said at the 10th Anniversary Firefly Reunion, the creators were right, they had the right ideas, the right crew, performers, writers, directors, everything, except Fox's executives, who must be thanked for throwing money at what they never understood long enough for Joss Whedon, et al, to get these made, and of course, Serenity, the unprecedented film made after a cancelled and single short-seasoned show.	5.0	Love it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2K5JFFLG260LC	Jason Williamson	It's rather unfortunate that a TV series that has a better concept, scripts, and actors than 90% of the tripe that people pay $10 for at the theater was cancelled, but at least we can own it on DVD. Suffering from poor marketing and a poor timeslot, Fox decided to cancel Firefly after only 11 episodes, but this is one series that you shouldn't miss. I have shown the pilot to several friends who were unaware that this jewel existed, and each of them has rushed out to purchase the set. Hopefully this series is revitalized again by Fox or another network who is less enamored with schlock reality-TV and we can experience the continuation of this series!	5.0	Easily the Best Sci-Fi series to ever air on TV	2004-01-25	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PUA6GJJJQKTD	Jay Chen	"Firefly is definitely a little different than the run of the mill sci-fi series. What makes it different is the cowboy flair they give to it. You wouldn't think that mixing a cowboy style with sci-fi would work, but in this case it does.My favorite character is the lead, Malcom. He's more or less a retired cavalry officer who has taken up a new line of work captaining a ship called Firefly. The character has a ton of charisma. He's not at all one of those wimpy sci-fi characters that's always worried about intergalactic peace or the prime directive. He tends to shoot first an ask questions later.The other characters are interesting too. Malcolm's almost love interest is a high end call girl, who takes occasional jobs as they stop off at various places along the way. And then there is the rather quirky pilot who provides some good moments of comic relief. Toss in a couple of others, and the occasional visitor and it's a pretty interesting crew.The technical name for this type of genre is a ""space opera"". What that means is that the episodes often showcase different aspects of the various characters lives to the backdrop of some kind of drama. Series like Star Trek, Farscape, etc., fall into that same category and if you liked them, you'll likely enjoy Firefly.A great many people wonder why the series ended. And considering what the did with the two season's, tend to agree. Some episodes towards the end did loose their edge, but I didn't think they were out of gas. If the series had any weakness it was probably that they didn't develop aliens that were terribly interesting. The ultra villains, the Reavers, were kind of a joke. However, my guess is that Joss just got bored with it and moved on to some other project.Short as it was, I'd recommend it. It's solid as Sci-fi series go."	4.0	Definitely worth watching	2012-06-17	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1VF5BB17L59QS	Jay	I stumbled upon this show by watching the great movie that goes along with it first. I originally watched it because I like Nathan Fillion, and I know he tends to make quirky movies. When I told my co-workers about it, they let me know about the show, Firefly. I had to check it out, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a mix of an old western set in the future with lazers and space ships. I absolutely hate that it was canceled after only one season. Very disapointed they wouldn't continue with such an amazing story.	5.0	Want more!	2014-01-14	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FEF45IX6XYNU	Jay	I watched Firefly when it first aired on Fox nearly a year ago.  As a matter of fact my son was born on the first night Firefly crossed our airwaves.  My wife must have seen how much I loved the show and recently gave me the DVD set as a Christmas gift.  I was extremely happy to own a copy of the series and watched all 14 episodes immediately.  My fondness for the Firefly universe (verse) is so intense that I would equate it to clich&eacute; 'Love at first sight'.It is so easy to believe in each of the 9 characters.  It is as if they leap out of the TV screen.  As I get older and wiser I understand how important character development is and without great characters and their interactions with one another, you really have nothing but empty space and special effects.  After watching the last episode I Found myself wanting to watch it again and again, but this time trying to understand why I love it so much more than anything I have seen before.  I generally don't put much effort in a 'cause', but I feel the need to express my passion for this amazing story.  I pray that Universal (or some movie outfit) will pick up the movie rights as soon as humanly possible.  I need to see more....I feel as though I have lost someone very close to me and I guess that is why 'it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.Go Browncoats!!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A7D2EHOUICHVM	"Jayne's Girl ""Jayne's Girl"""	Firefly is the type of show that appeals to everyone, no matter what their interests.  It has enough elements of a western to satisfy lovers of that genre, enough of scifi (it is space,after all) for it to be considered scifi.  It is a romance, a drama, an adventure, and thanks to Joss Whedon's terrific writing and the great timing of the actors, it is most definitely a comedy also.  I have, quite literally, not met anyone who has seen the show and not liked it.  I'm not just talking about people I know directly, who might then be supposed to have similar interests or tastes to mine.  No, any time I've been in a group of people (be it party, chat, forum or business meeting), if Firefly comes up there are two groups in the room:  those who love it, and those who haven't seen it (yet).  The Fox exec responsible for cancelling this show should be drummed out of town for being unable to pick a winning show.  Thank you to Universal for making the first movie --Serenity (Collector's Edition).  We're still waiting for our other two.	5.0	The best show ever to be on tv	2007-10-10	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A9E2Z16F4ZJM2	"J. Bell ""bailey1ak"""	We saw some of the hype about the show during Christmas, but I do not like Sci-Fi so we rented it from Netflix.  It was such a good series that we are going to purchase the series tonight and thought we would add our 2 cents.I thought that the series reminded me of Han Solo, which I know will probably upset many Sci-Fi fans, but I have a limited number of Sci-Fi shows to draw from.  I felt that it is similar to what I would expect if they had done a series on Han Solo before he met the Skywalkers.  Mal, the captain, is a smuggler of sorts, he thinks he is a bad guy, but his big heart gets in the way all of the time.  There are many scrapes in the series that he has to get himself and his crew out of and the dialog is humerous and the characters are developed quite well.  By the end of the series you find yourself almost day dreaming about the show and the characters and you just wish that there was something you could do to make the series come back on the air.  I hope that they do bring it back, but the realistic side of you says that the actors were all really good and the likelyhood that they have not moved on in their careers is highly unlikely.	5.0	Great, Great Show.	2006-02-06	13	12	1

This was the best series I have ever seen, sci-fi or not.  The character development and acting are absolutely superb.  With the DVD, you can watch the episodes in marathon style or relax and take your time.  So many people love this show, you'd think that somebody would have picked it up after the FOX blunder in canceling it.  I hope the movie, Serenity, does well enough to get it back on TV.  Movies are good, but are a different animal.  With a series, you get time to develop characters and Joss is a genius.  There are SO many unanswered mysteries in Firefly and many many subtle things there that you can watch the episodes many times and take something new from them each time.If there were 10 stars, I'd give it 10.

I guess I would have to say heart. I can't believe a show like this gets only 14 episodes while other series don't end soon enough. Now I have to watch a mere 14 episodes over and over again. Everything about this boxed set is awesome just because of the show itself. I can't believe I haven't seen this show sooner.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1CXKFAQ4NC3ES	J. Carncross	This series had to be one of the best sci-fi shows in ages.  I come from the psuedo-nerd class who prefers Next Generation to Original and also like watching Babylon 5 for the epic battle scenes.  What I liked about this series, besides its phenomonal writing and character development, is that it actually pays attention to the laws of physics.  One of the most ignored rules of space, long dismissed in television sci-fi, is that there is no sound in space!  None.  If the Death Star crashed into a Borg Cube which then set off the Superlaser which shot at Deep Space Nine causing it to actually move which caused it to bunp the Intrepid into the Executor and then all of these things simulteanously exploded, you wouldn't hear a thing.  Not one thing.  Firefly actually grasps  this concept which speaks volumes of its respect for what it is doing.  Its was a great series, which is obviously why it was cancelled after one short season.	5.0	No sound in space!  Since When?	2003-09-04	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2905TCTG4I5UJ	"Jc Beuford-willis ""Christian Willis"""	I watched this series as it exploded onto the Scifi Channel in the UK and was blown away by the whole thing. Acting, special effects, story lines, script and concept were all completely topclass. Joss Whedon's very uniquely quirky perspective really comes through in the dialogue and I loved it as soon as the first notes of the title song hit my ears.Then much to my despair I find that some hair-brained individual with the about as much vision in his entire soul as a Mole at Fox studios has taken it upon himself to cancel it, no doubt in favour of reality TV, a curse which pervades UK TV as much as it pervades US.It seems to me that the TV companies are determined to make programmes where all our thinking is done for us. By dumbing down television, infesting it with mindless reality programmes that are supposed to give us an insight into ourselves, they are merely hoping to make cheaper programmes that will keep us all occupied and thus make them more profits. I am in the same boat as many, my preference is rapidly leading me to pick up a book more often than I watch the constant diet of excrement that inspires not one single original thought or creative impulse on Television.I have started to hear that a movie is being made, which I look forward to seeing. It is my sincere hope that this will kickstart the series again, because there is no doubt in my mind that it would be well deserved.Good Luck with it Joss.	5.0	More voting than Reviewing	2004-05-10	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FFRPZNTYQ15U	J. Champion	"It has skullduggery.  It has daring do. It has romance. It has humor. It has danger. It has the archetypal folk hero, an outlaw smuggler and thief, Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds as the space western ""Cisco Kid"" (O'Henry's famous Robin Hood of the Old West).  It is a Space SciFi Western Robin Hood with dusty trails, gunslingers, and warp drives. Mal's ""Merry Men"" include Zoe Washburne is his Little John and second-in-command. Inara Serra is Mal's strong willed, beautiful, exotic, and sensual Maid Marian. Shepherd Book is Mal's Friar Tuck with hidden fight and semi-spiritual guidance. Kaylee Frye is Mal's Alan-a-Dale with a taste for the fancy that is just out of her reach.  Jayne Cobb is Mal's Much the Miller's Son and equally violent and strong enough to behead a monk's page. Dr. Simon Tam is Mal's Will Scarlett and like Will, dressed with almost foppish daintiness and has the law out to arrest and execute him. River Tam is Will Scarlett's sister Cecily.  In the movie version of Firefly, Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays ""The Operative"" or Sheriff of Nottingham enforcing a corrupt law.  As a senior citizen, I generally don't watch SciFi, but this series turned me, my husband, our sons, my in-laws into fans. Yes, we did  see Serenity on the first day of release, and the next day. Firefly the series could have surpassed ""Star Trek"" and ""Gunsmoke"" combined with fans. Hopefully there will be more films and novels.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A6MBJNDVCWXRT	J. C. Little	Where to begin. You will not find a single fault with this series. Not one. The stories are not &#34;been there done that.&#34; They are told with the love of a true creator. They are carefully woven into eachother to form a vibrant future-esque world where a group of odd compatriots work together to survive and stay safe from a malovelent and oppressive government and the assorted thugs of the galaxy.This Blu-Ray does what apparently the network execs never thought to. It presents the series in the correct story sequence. How Odd that Joss W. wanted his audience to understand why Mal and his first mate hold such contempt for the core planets and their government. You find out how the Tam's come to be on Serenity, any why the Companion puts up with her host. Watching it in full in its intended broadcasting order makes me sad for the director having to put up with moronic studio execs who shattered thes steady build in drama and revelation Joss W. had crafted.I was introduced to firefly through the movie Serenity, and I am now even more amazed at how the arc for the story in that movie had its roots in the opening episode of this series. It is obvious the creators loved their world and took time to craft scenery and dialogue to flesh out these characters and make you forget you are watching a show.The menues for these discs are beautiful and easy to navigate. The picture and sound are top teir and the extras are aplenty. This series is selling for much cheaper than it is worth, and you owe it to yourself to buy this if you are a fan of unique sci-fi that is focused more on character development than neat wiz-bang technology.This is solidly re-watchable entertainment that is a steal for the price.	5.0	How I Never Knew About This is Beyond Me	2013-05-25	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3RAT5GIH32UNM	J. Colon	"The cancellation of Firefly is one of the great crimes against television committed in the last 5 years.  You may be wondering why you would want to consider watching a television show that didn't even last a full season.  The answer is simple.  You don't want to miss out.  This show is smart, funny, exciting, and even thought provoking.  Why didn't it make it then?  Because people didn't give it a fair chance.  Fox put it on Fridays, and that was just a hugely unfair thing for both the television watching public and the show.  Despite this obstacle, Firefly instantly created a hugely fanatic following that worked hard to get the show put back on television.  In 2005 they got their reward with the release of the movie ""Serenity"", and it was one of the best reviewed movies of that year.

Firefly is that good.  The characters are three-dimensional, the acting is strong and the special effects are amazing.The only downside to the series is that it was cancelled before we got to see how many of the story lines would play out (i.e. what did the Blue Sun corporation do to River and what did Shepherd Book do before he joined the Church).  With &quot;Serenity&quot; set to hit theaters next year, we may get answers to a few of these questions, and who knows?  A strong showing at the box office may lead to a revival of the series on a better network than Fox.I would strongly urge those of you hesitant to watch a &quot;space western&quot; to give Firefly a chance.  You'll be glad you did, and you just might join the growing population of Firefly fanatics.	5.0	See what all the fuss is about	2004-05-05	8	8	0

The characters are well fleshed out and after a few episodes it is easy to find yourself caring about the truobles they get into.The show provides an interesting look at what the future of the human race in space might be like, and its very different from the Star Trek styled future.I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes, westerns, sci fi, or just plain comedy. If you are a fan of the brittish show Red Dwarf, there is almost no reason not to buy this series too, especially as you get a lot more episodes in this disk set than you get one the RD DVD season disks, and for about the same price.	5.0	Canceled before its time.	2007-03-11	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WIZ78S4T2AP2	J.D.	My roomate recommended this series highly, and one boring Sunday afternoon we had nothing to do and he says, &quot;JD, we're watching 'Firefly.'&quot; I was a bit excited about it at first, since my roomate knew I liked history and science fiction. I knew it was Joss Whedon, who wrote the script for &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (which I liked) but I never got to liking &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Buffy.&quot; So I'd figure it was worth a shot, and boy, was I surprised. We watched the first disc and some of the second disc straight through. I laughed, I sighed, I screamed, I enjoyed. I had never seen anything like this before. When we finished the series, and later watched the special features, I knew I had to buy it.You can read the Amazon review for the plot. It won't take much to adapt to the &quot;Whedonese&quot; or the chinese cursing. What really will get your attention is that there aren't any aliens at all through the run, and the characters are flat out amazing. As a writer myself, the characters that Whedon creates are some of the best that I've ever watched on TV or film. Incredible writing and special effects augment this series, along with the plain reality of it all. So it's 500 years in the future. Who says we've got warp speed? Who says violence has ended? Whedon sticks it plain when the crew of the Serenity are looking for jobs to keep them afloat rather than make first contact with an alien race.There are plenty of little things that you will enjoy from this collection. The camera and special effects take advantage of the zoom lens (which you'll learn in the features section that mostly everyone not with the &quot;Firefly&quot; team thought was cheesy). The music is incredible. For example, since space is a vacuum, we don't hear anything in the CGI scenes except for wonderful violins and guitars. You see the cast is really a family when the camera stops, and when you watch the &quot;making of&quot; featurette, you'll see how heartbreaking it was for this cast to all of a sudden wrap up and end production.The cast! Whedon strings together a cast of actors that most people don't know. Nathan Fillion (TV's &quot;Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Shop&quot;) and Adam Baldwin (various movies and appearances) are the biggest names you might know. But, either way, the actors stick their characters without any flaws. Apparently 10 million viewers weren't enough for Fox, who pretty much killed this series. Props to Universal for producing the 2005 movie, which may just be the first in a trilogy. Either way, expect Fox to be brooding for a long time.	5.0	What A Surprise	2004-05-21	11	10	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1GVWQYSQHHOWB	Jeff	I saw a few random episodes of Firefly on the Sci-Fi channel, after the series was cancelled, and was impressed.  I thought the series was pretty good.  I watched it without really having any sense of the universe or the characters, and wasn't all that in to it.  Then I saw the movie, Serenity, and loved it.  Without a doubt, the best sci-fi movie since the original Star Wars.  So I went out and bought the Firefly DVDs, and found that watching them in order is a whole different experience.The characters in this series are outstanding.  They are deep, funny, and REAL in ways that almost no TV series can match.  The dialogue is witty, to the point of making me do a double-take, because that sarcastic quip didn't register right away.. it was delivered so naturally and in-character that you'd miss it if you weren't paying attention.  But if you DO pay attention, you're laughing a full 30 seconds later.  And maybe rewinding to catch it again.The serious parts are equally compelling.  The action is fast, furious, and, since you care about the characters, intense.  The special-effects never give you pause--they pull you in like everything else in the series.  Dramatic scenes are somber and poignant, and carry real weight.  The fact that the seriousness is occasionally broken by humor only gives the story more momentum.  Each episode leaves me wanting more.. and that is not a common occurance.	5.0	Outstanding sci-fi series, cancelled before its prime.	2006-01-16	11	10	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AYSOTHWQMF6A9	Jeffrey D. Peterson	"I'm not surprised by the number of five-star reviews here, since the show has its die-hard fans, but I don't wonder at some of the one-stars either. Some people won't get it, or won't be able to get past its quirkiness. But I tell you now, suspend your disbelief for a few moments and you will enjoy.I'd almost forgotten about this show after being enraptured with it during the initial Fox run. But then I saw it back on the SciFi network, saw the trailers for the new movie, and wondered--was the show as good as I remembered, or has my taste matured beyond the point where I could enjoy it? I say without reservation that Firefly is better than I remember--a pleasure to watch and hear, a feast in the barren wasteland of today's shows. The writing is tremendously sharp, the actors are entirely believable--to the point where, for example, one of the characters, having gotten all the information he can out of a prisoner with a minimum of effort (not even using his large knife), complains that he was ""hoping to get myself an ear,"" you feel a little sorry for him.It is a western in space. And not really even in the figurative sense: Whedon takes the six-gun and cattle into space and plops them down on scrub worlds, and peppers the dialog with Chinese swearing just for fun. I don't know whether the show would have supported a run of many years, but it stands remarkably well. Breathe deep."	5.0	Caviar is not to everyone's taste, either	2005-08-13	10	10	0

After seeing ""Serenity"" (the movie made after the canceled show was off the air, I had to get as much of this show as possible.  It has the right mix of sci-fi, action, humor and even several love stories, all happening at once.  If you have any interest in this genre, you will get your money's worth; I have watched each episode several times.  The only negative is that there are only 14 episodes to watch.

It was well written, superbly acted and wonderfully filmed.  There was none of the character awkwardness that virtually all first year shows must struggle through (go back and see season one of STNG and see for yourself).It was interesting, entertaining, visually stunning and was the paragon of everything a television program could and should be.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1Q4M7TN3SYSX3	Jeffrey L. Watson	I love this show. Joss Whedon hit a major home run and Fox was too blind to see that they had a hit in the making... at least with fans of science fiction and maybe, had they been a little patient, even more.That said, the lack of the fifth star in my rating is due to cheap packaging. I had previously bought the DVD set as I didn't know if there would be a blu-ray version (still waiting for Torchwood season 2 on blu-ray) and it is quite nice. It's a box set. Each disc has it's own sleeve with a different character on its cover and the all of these are in a box. However the blu-ray is cheap by comparison. A single standard plastic case with all of the discs sandwiched into it.It appears to me that Fox responded to the demand for a blu-ray version of this but only gave as much as it absolutely had to. I do hope the one reviewer is wrong and that the picture quality is better than the DVD set.	4.0	Great show - Cheap packaging	2008-11-12	7	2	5

Not so much.A lot of people have been saying this is the best science fiction ever seen on TV... and I won't argue with that.But to those of you who have been brought in by the high customer ratings, let me emphaize something: FIREFLY is one of the best dramas ever to make it to network TV.  One of the best humor/action-adventure shows.  And without doubt, it contains some of the finest, most intriguing, most heart-rending characters on video -- even by Joss Whedon (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL) standards.It's almost impossible to oversell this series -- I've handed this to the most blase acquaintances, saying it's the best thing on TV in the last 5 years.

All of these reviews are raves. There's a good reason for that. The fact is: this program is the best thing American Television has ever produced. As science fiction it is more intelligent and its science is more real than any we've seen on the screen (big or small), as drama the characters are deeper, more complex, mysterious and interesting than any we've experienced before. Throw in several splashes of comedy, the best ensemble cast of actors ever brought together, and a theme song that now that I've reached the end of the DVD set puts a lump in my throat every time I hear it, and you have a masterpiece. And that is what this DVD set is: a masterpiece. Television as a work of art. And, it deserves your patronage.	5.0	Firefly DVD set - the best money I've ever spent.	2004-02-12	8	8	0

It's rare to have that much depth in a series that was so quickly cancelled. The special effects are outstanding even for today's market.Here's where Firefly failed:The whole ""western"" theme never really makes sense and it gets old. Hearing old west slang mixed with futuristic terms just doesn't work. Add to that irritation is the addition of Chinese phrases and curses which is ""downright"" annoying.I know I'm in the minority but the Kaylee and River characters are by far the weakest. It's not just the characters it's the actresses themselves....just not very good.If you love Science Fiction and missed out on Firefly, give it a shot. It's far better than most the junk television networks spew.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2W3JMA1P62IXL	"Jeff Travis ""Stormfury"""	"I remember when Firefly first came out and was so highly publicized by FOX.  The funny thing was that I was desperate for a good sci-fi and FOX's brilliant decision to air the 2nd episode instead of the Pilot cost them at least one viewer.  Not that the 2nd episode was bad, but just a little hard to follow without any background.  After all the opening scene has 3 cowboy looking crew mates getting into a brawl in a tavern only to be saved by their spaceship at cliffs edge.  Immediately I turned it off and thought nothing of it.  I remember thinking: ""Cowboys in space""Years later a friend invited me to see the movie Serenity and I loved it.  It was later that another friend informed me that it had been the original Firefly series.  With a lot more knowledge of the characters from the movie, I watched an episode on Sci-Fi and immediately fell in love with it.For xmas, my wife and I purchased the DVD set and watch the whole series in one day.  From start to finish the entire series is exceptional!  Way better than most of the shows that manage to survive on the television and I can only shudder to think that it's because of a bonehead executive deciding they didn't want to give this highly touted (by them) show 2 hours to introduce itself.  I loved the pilot!While it's true that there is a certain wild west feel to the show, Firefox has so many elements that make it good.  There is tension, compassion and lots of humor, some of which can be campy.  It's a definite sci-fi show but on the edge of the frontier, something I wish Star Trek might have explored.I'd highly recommend this show to you, especially if you are into sci-fi or even westerns! Great series that I'll re-watch over and over. If only we could convince Sci-fi to make some new episodes..."	5.0	A brilliant star lost in the dregs of executive TV!	2006-05-24	11	10	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	"Firefly is a sad, sad story of a progressive, well written, well produced show that got booted way before it's time.  Fox television's decision to give the show the worst 'Real Estate' in prime time (Fridays at 8 PM), it's pre-empting by other shows and sports events, not playing the episodes in order and their refusal to promote the show beyond a few commercials surely contributed to it's low ratings.  It was hard to find and confusing to watch.  Never the less, critics praised it, and anyone who watches it (at least everyone I know, including my wife, who is not a Sci-Fi fan) loves it.  This show is a Greek Tragedy.  You could easily say this was the Star Trek for the next Millennium, a sci-fi 'western' that mirrored Gene Rodenberry's idea of 'Wagon Train in space'.  Not to say that the creator, Joss Whedon, was inspired by Star Trek, not at all.  Firefly is more liberal, and more relatable to the real world.  What shines is the cast and the writing.  The ingredients and settings are only slightly out of the ordinary, and in the hands of any average TV creator, would end up being bland and boring.  But the characters in Firefly are so well cast and the episodes so well written, that they stand out as real and tangible people who are cast together on this small ship for a purpose.The story takes place 500 years in the future, where a civil war has just ended and Capt Malcolm Reynolds has gathered together an eclectic crew to take on jobs in an old freighter ship called Serenity, Firefly class.  The ship is one of those So-Ugly-But-Cool, Hang-In-There-Old-Girl, She'll-hold-together, Rely-On-In-A-Pinch Flying buckets that everyone is so glad to see come over the horizon, that it's no wonder Whedon considers it the tenth character on the show.  Always low on fuel, its like the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars, it's destined to become a lovable freighter, and not a high tech ship of exploration.  The difference in characters of the human class is staggering.  You have a Two soldiers, the Captain and his second hand man...err woman, Zoe.  Zoe's husband Wash, who is the pilot.  A mercenary, Jayne, which is a great contrast when played by the muscle bound, 6'2"" Adam Baldwin.  A registered companion, Inara.  Kaylee, the spunky young mechanic who loves her ship, but is obviously too young to know better.  A Doctor and his Sister, Simon and River, who are being pursued by the Alliance due to River's extreme mental intelligence.  And to add wisdom, there's Book, a holy man of the time who seems to be searching for himself.  The dynamics of the characters add to instructing personality studies and contrasts.  They find themselves with nothing in common and sometimes, everything in common when they need each other most.  The possibilities of this show are endless and Fox foolishly dropped it without giving it a fair chance.  The DVD contains all episodes including three that never aired.  The sound and picture quality are superb and the bonus features are great.  Everyone should give this show a chance, to see it for more than just the Sci-Fi aspect, more than just the space adventure, but as a study in character interaction as well.  If it gains popularity like the original Star Trek, maybe we'll be lucky and there will be a 'Next Generation' version in twenty years."	5.0	Maybe in 20 years they will make a Next Generation...	2003-12-29	1	1	0

Firefly was created by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame, and this is a fabulous series.Fox decided that they didn't want Joss et al to air the show in the order that it was written, thus people didn't get a true representation of how great it really it.  16 episodes were made (and are on the DVD) but they only aired (I think) 11...Don't let Fox's idiocy keep you from missing out on something truly great!Oh, and don't let the idea of a space western scare you off either - the character development is fabulous, and you will find yourself watching these episodes over & over & over... and wishing for more!and when you wish for more, get Serenity!	5.0	The Best TV Series EVER!!!	2008-01-24	1	1	0

But at my husband's urging, I watched it. And within 10 minutes, I fell in love (okay, just the theme music got me).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2HCPRHWCMOJX4	Jennifer Joeyen-Waldorf	In terms of technical details, this Bluray release looks better than ever.  Sound and picture quality are sharp.  I've read some reviews complaining about not having an extremely dynamic range of sound, but everything I watch doesn't have to shake my teeth loose and blow up the surround sound subwoofer.The bonus features are a little disappointing.  Everything from the DVD release is included plus a new roundtable discussion with Joss Whedon and various cast members, but I was hoping for a little more.  It's still a five star rating for me due to the fact that the show itself is more exciting and engaging than many others that are still on the air and have had the luxury to 'jump the shark.'  There's plenty of action, suspense, romance, humor, and everything else that makes good TV worth watching.  If the idea of a science fiction show that draws a large amount of inspiration from classic westerns appeals to you in any way, you'll most certainly enjoy everything about this show.	5.0	Looks better than ever	2013-03-16	0	0	0

It was kicked off half way through the season, but it is important to keep in mind that FOX did not air it in the right order, so it was hard to understand. Originally, this was just a thing that I was going to watch, but my whole family has become hooked. This series all have great plots that keep you hooked beginning to end, I would call it one of the best sci-fi shows of all time.	5.0	Firefly-The Complete Series	2006-11-05	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GG8ZL1ZP8QUU	Jennifer Stolzer	If you haven't seen the show already, Firefly is a fantastic genre blending ScifiWestern.  The writing is beyond witty, each episode full of humor, suspense, adventure and drama.  This DVD set contains all the original episodes (including three not aired by FOX)in the intended wide-screen format, allowing the viewer to experience the full impact of Firefly's artistic cinematography.  It also features extras such as behind the scenes specials, interviews with the cast and crew, a gag reel and commentaries.The show is a must see, but not recommended for kids under 13, because there are some sexual themes (no frontal nudity) along with mild cursing and some violence in the form of gunfights and fisticuffs.  For anyone else, Firefly is a genius show that was cancelled before its time!Look out for Serenity appearing in theaters this fall... and to all my fellow Browncoats... Keep Flying!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2991U90VMKGOR	Jen R.	The Blu-ray itself plays well, and we have had no issues with it.  As for the series, we love it.  It's a quirky space western that combines the best parts of sci-fi with some great elements of old westerns.  The story is engaging, funny, and exciting.  I would recommend Firefly to people who like sci-fi standards like Star Trek.  This series will keep you interested and laughing with the banter that occurs between characters.  The banter is somewhat reminiscent of the the Whedon classic Buffy.  Overall, a really fun series to watch.	5.0	A Favorite	2012-12-01	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25ONOJ0R01RRP	Jen V	Science fiction fans seem to love hard core science facts along with their fiction.  Trekkies will debate tiny errors in starship specifications (even Futurama fans argue over such details as the speed at which the line between light and darkness on the moon travels), while allowing the most glaring errors in human psychology and relationships to pass.Firefly's remarkable universe filled with a cast of characters that actually act like adults engaged in realistic social relationships has to be the most refreshing science fiction in three decades (Babylon 5 included).Firefly lacks the sterility of the cold trekkien society with its single class and ridiculous utopian ideals, but neither does it fall prey to the unilateral &quot;wackiness&quot; of many character based science fiction shows.  I enjoyed the concept of a group of society's outsiders eeking a living at the edges of the known universe.Although fans have debated the technological make-up of the reality, I thought the concept that worlds with advanced technology would exist at the same time as frontier-like territories was quite realistic.  I could easilty envision the socio-economic fabric of our current world developing into such a society.Basically, Firefly wasn't like anything I had seen before.  It satisfied that part of me that enjoys watching people who act like adults handle complicated situations and complex moral dilemmas. It satisfied that part of me that loves science fiction, and as a scientist I'm pretty hard to satsify.  And finally, it satsified that part of me that likes gunfights and heroes outwitting adversaries and clever plans that go awry and space battles and a awesome looking space ships.	5.0	The best character driven science fiction series ever filmed	2004-02-19	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A11423AYVMMC4K	"Jeremy G. Snyder ""Darkstalker"""	"I went and saw the movie after it came out on video and had to see all the episodes of the show itself.  After seeing the final one, I can say that this show was absolute perfection.  It's like Star Wars told from the perspective of Han Solo, rather than Luke Skywalker, with the gunslinging smuggler and his crew being the main focus in the war against some Galactic Empire, rather than some mystical Jedi Knight.  Also, the war's over.  The Rebels lost and all is under the dominion of the Galactic Empire/Alliance which is mysterious while being deceptively kind and ""civilized"" as all governments are.In fact, I almost wonder if Joss Whedon is a libertarian.  There are some subtle anti-government elements in the show, such as in the vein of ""1984"".  Is is just me, or is anti-statism a major theme in most sci-fi?This show has the best of all the elements.  Great actors and actresses playing great characters with great dialogue, great plots, plot twists, music (whom hasn't memorized the lyrics to the theme song by the end?).  It's mostly a sci-fi Western with some elements of horror (who was freaked out by the blue-gloved men and their antics in the ""Aerial"" episode) and really great casual humor as well (who wasn't roaring in laughter during the episode where Jayne was mistaken by a town as some kind of Robin Hood-esque hero?).If you don't think that this show will go down as legendary, then name one other show that got cancelled after only eleven aired episodes (fourteen total) and yet had such a huge cult following of fans built around it that they made a movie out of it?In short, this series is absolute bliss and well worth your purchase."	5.0	Will be legendary, despite Fox's cancellation	2006-02-07	13	12	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A195LSLZ7YFY4S	Jeremy	How can I express in a mere review the effect this show had on me in such a short timeframe?I was living in Australia when this aired and thus only managed to catch the dribs and drabs, but it was enough to turn me into a Firefly fanatic. After getting the dvds and watching them a number of times, I was left with a feeling of anger towards Fox and its narrowminded decision based on the attitudes of fickle Nielsen families.This show is clever. It is funny. It is suspenseful, intriguing and laden with hooks to keep your interest piqued at all times. You will learn to love Mal, the seemingly harsh yet patriachal captain; Zoe, the dangerously gorgeous pardner; Wash, the wacky pilot; Jayne, the most self-centered &quot;public relations&quot; officer with a sure shot; Kaylee, the perkiest little mechanic in the 'verse; Inara, the most alluring &quot;Ambassador&quot;; and the siblings Tam - fugitives with a shady past. And somehow, a preacher, Shepherd Book - played beautifully by Ron Glass.The Firefly phenomenon continues to grow. Make sure you buy this dvd set, as it is only the beginning. There will be a Firefly movie, and it will be great.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2M8ZYBW57OQTP	Jeremy Lydell Haugen	"This short-lived but well written television series comes to DVD just months after being cancelled by the shortsighted FOX network. If FOX had not bungled the marketing campaign for this show so terribly, many more people might have come to the conclusion that this was the best show on television for a while there. Only a half-season was made, including a second pilot episode (FOX didn't like the first, despite the fact that it was excellent), but there isn't a bad episode in the bunch, including the three unaired episodes (not to mention the gag reel) that have found popularity on the internet. The show garnered an Emmy nom for Outstanding Visual Effects. Word has it that a feature film may be in the works, so there may be life for Firefly after network television. As for the details regarding this yet unreleased DVD set, here's the skinny from series creator Joss Whedon:Oh my god. They couldn't be specialer. We've got three unaired episodes, commentary by every cast member, big interviews with everybody, gag reel &#65533; all kinds of stuff. It's just bells and whistles, and they'll be in the right order. And widescreen. So it really couldn't be better DVD package... a wicked one, at that. They really went to town on it. I was like, ""I don't know if they'll release them on DVD, because it was cancelled,"" and they're not only releasing it, they're doing everything.

I had never seen a single episode btu because I had heard so many great things about the show and because I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon's other two shows, Angel and Buffy.At first I thought there was no way this show could live up to the hype. Well, it did. It was the best fourteen hour movie I'd ever seen. Serenity was a tremendous pilot and the characters were fantasically written.Even though this is a Joss Whedon show, I think the one thing that stood with me was the acting. At times on Buffy and Angel, the acting can get overdramtic and wordy. On this show Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, and Adam Baldwin lead a cast that makes me wonder what the hell FOX was thinking. They can air four seasons of American Idol yet only fourteen episodes of Firefly. What a crock. Anyway for fans of Joss Whedon this is a must and for others, this is what TV should be about.	5.0	firefly rocks	2005-01-04	6	6	0

Like others I bought this pack because of all the 5 star reviews making it out to be the best show ever made. Personally I think people are like that because it was cancelled early and they needed something to fill their voided nerd lives. (I'm a geek, so I understand) This was not a horrible show, some of the acting was good, but overall I found it boring and dragged out. Don't buy it unless you have seen some episodes already.  I first watched the movie ""Serenity"" and would give it a solid 4/5 review, but it was the highlight of this story and the show was not nearly as good. It would have been better to make a trilogy movie with a complete close to this story, there was no way this could have been kept interesting as a multi-year show. Sorry people, but that's the truth. Check out Babylon 5 or Star Trek The Next Generation for a good long series. ;-)"	2.0	Not surprised it was cancelled after the first season	2012-01-04	23	6	17

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AONPH5OJ07EMP	Jet	"I'm always at a bit of a loss as to how to describe my favorite TV series to others for the first time.  I usually settle for something along the lines of ""It's a sci-fi space Western action comedy drama that was cancelled halfway through it's first season on TV.""  When I see the look of confused shock on their faces it's time to elaborate a bit more.Seriously, Firefly has everything one could ask for in entertainment.  The writing is original and witty.  The humor is wickedly funny, especially as delivered by the incredibly talented and likable cast.  There are moments for every person and every mood.  This is the only show I have ever watched that can both make me laugh out loud and move me to tears, without being cheesy or overdramatic for a second. Everyone I have shown Firefly to has loved it...young or old, male or female.The show is set 500 years in the future, but this is not the sterile future so often portrayed....it has a very human and realistic feel that makes you think this is really what it might be like down the line.  Technological advances and political changes have taken place, but human society is very much the same.  It takes place partly in outer space and on multiple planets, but there are no aliens.The music on the show is unusual and grounds it as an almost down-to-earth story rather than your typical sci-fi fare. I always fast-forward the title credits and theme song on TV shows, but with Firefly I listen to the song and watch the beautifully done credits every time.There are 9 main characters in the show, and by the time you are halfway through the series they will become your second family.  The cast has such incredible chemistry and the writing is so good that it's impossible not to care about them deeply.Look at it this way; for a TV show that was cancelled in the middle of it's first season to not only be amazon's #3 best seller but to have gotten a major motion picture released based on it, it must be something pretty incredible.  It is."	5.0	Best. TV show.  Ever.	2005-10-09	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A26BL5Q37LXO61	J. E. Vylasek	"Beautifully written characters and a very fresh and creative setting.  I just squirmed a bit when my young sons asked me several times what a whore is (which the beautiful actress is oft referred to as by the otherwise very likable Captain), necessitating me to screen the episodes for content before I let them watch them.  We don't watch TV much and I was really surprised this was allowed on prime time TV.  But for this one fault, I would bet that this series would have lived on as a solidly written show for the whole family!Sorry but that needed to be said.  I think they figured this out because the wildly popular movie Serenity still featured the ""companion"" character but GREATLY diminished the presence of her profession.Having that out of the way, I will say that as an adult viewer I love this series and am bummed that this show got cancelled.  There is a real chemistry between the characters and the writing is solid.  The acting, noticably good!  I sincerely hope that SciFi or some other network picks this up and continues the series.  The writing, character interaction and development is the best I've seen on TV since NYPD Blue.I recommend you buy it and enjoy it.  Just be careful about letting the kiddies see unscreened episodes!  And FYI: Out of all episodes, only 3 or 4 are not for the kids.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30KD8R7AT51GF	J. Ferguson	I had never heard of Firefly until recently (September 2011).  Sorry I missed it.In the year 2517, after humans arrive in a new star system, the renegrade crew of Serenity (a Firefly-class spacecraft) struggle to survive, making a living on the outskirts of the star system.  Some fought on the losing side of the unification war.  The characters, especially the main character, seem a little cavalier at first, but they are diverse and interesting and grow on you.  Firefly has action and humor, so you get some plot contrivances, but on the whole it is good.  Episode plots vary and get better as the season progresses: the last episode is actually the best (based on DVD set).Firefly is a project of Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  If you like Firefly, try the movie Serenity, a followup to the Firefly series.	4.0	FIREFLY	2011-09-25	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3S01DAHSBDG7F	J. Flynn	While the stories and characters are engaging enough, all the extra sex scenes and nudity (which are many!) are not needed to enhance the series. On the contrary they hinder it. It is soft porn and I wish others would point this out! When I see a Sfi-fi series, I just want to see a good Sci-Fi story, not sex. Sure people will have sex in the future, but this usually happens behind CLOSED doors. There is alot of cussing also, and you would think in the future, we could think of more intelligent words to replace swear words. Everyone does not talk like this, or like to watch the sex scenes. Why didn't anyone else mention this before I went out to buy this? We are NOT going to keep this for this reason alone. If there were not so much of this, we would keep it and watch it again. I will say that if you watch this, you will really take a liking to some of the characters and despise others. It is kinda a sad story, yet one of hope. It is scary too. I mean, I dread a future where prostitutes are glorified as respectable Career workers as this series portrays.	3.0	Way too much sex and nudity	2006-01-06	65	6	59

I enjoy movies, I enjoy movie theatres, but I don't watch ""TV"". It wasn't always like this. I used to swear by Sliders, dream of the X-Files,  I even watched Seaquest with devotion.The sad thing was that I grew up. Most ""TV"" is hollow and consists of low-risk, high-reward reuse of the same tired concepts again and again (ex., Reality Shows).Enter Firefly. When was the last time you could watch characters on a TV show that you actually cared about. When was the last time you could watch a show and not care if it revealed one of the ""mysteries"" that seem to be the lone driving force behind all dramas today. I watched Firefly just because I loved the world, I loved the people in the world, and I wanted to be a part of it everyday (not literally of course).It was cancelled.If you didn't watch the show when it was on TV, buy it now and see what TV could and should be.

Usually in the top 5. tv.com has given it the No.1 spot on their list and that spot was not undeserved. Every show will have its naysayers and Firefly is no exception. When it comes to sci-fi I feel that Firefly is easily one of, if not the best, show I have ever watched. Some of my favorite shows include Stargate SG-1, Atlantis, Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise, Lost, Supernatural, X-Files, and The 4400 so I do appreciate quality. For those that hype Joss Whedon as having failed on Firefly by contrasting the show to Buffy and Angel I say ""C'mon!"". Buffy and Angel were crap unless you were a pre-pubescent teen. It was kiddy crap then and would be today. And simply because it had a successful run means nothing. The U.S. is a nation of shallow inarticulate boobs. We live in a country where ""American Idol"" and ""Americas Next Top Model"" are top rated shows which says a lot for our culture. If you like sci-fi I recommend ""Firefly"". The only negative thing about purchasing this box set is that when you complete it there is no season two to continue onto. You are left with desires for more and the only thing there is to suffice those desires is Serenity. This show cancellation was a loss to television and the sci-fi community.

I thought at the time the network didn't give it much of a chance -- did they try airing it on a different day/time?  What a shame! Now that I've seen the entire series, it's maddening because so many tales never had the chance to be told, so many mysteries left unresolved.  This is one of the best written series ever!

(and Mr. Murdoch has a reserved seat in h*** for canceling it!) Depending on the individual episodes, some of the conversion to blu-ray was ok. However some sections are grainy at best. Given the age of this series and the fact that it was made for TV and not the big screen, it's to be expected. If you can catch this set on sale, get it.

I already had Serenity and really enjoyed it, so I was expecting the best. I was not disappointed as it let me in on the lives of each of the characters. That was fun. BUT, if you have kids and were hoping this one would be fun to watch with them, you better go back to Bonanza. They pushed the envelope with the sexual stuff on a few of the episodes - and it was really not necessary except to try and be explicit as possible to get ratings. If it were not for these, I would have given it five stars. The people who said that the actors did a poor job must have missed that they were trying to be stiff, awkward folks when it comes to relating to others. That was part of the fun.	4.0	wanted to give it five stars but...	2009-03-18	5	4	1

I don't know were Joss Whedon came up with some of the lines but they are hilarious and very rememorable.Great show and worth 5 stars no doubt.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2TJXNJOUTG8AU	Jill V.	I did not realize how much I would enjoy Firefly!  The writing is terrific, just when you think you have one of the characters figured out, they do something unexpected. Bitter Captain Reynolds does what needs to be done to survive  but will occasionaly choose to do what's right at the expense of a possible job.  His second in command and combat buddy Zoe is the toughest woman on television.  The blending of the rest of the cast makes for interesting storylines above the plot.  You will however have to watch the movie Serenity to see what River Tamm can do!  Too bad the series was cancelled.	5.0	Loved It!	2006-01-31	0	0	0

During the first episode I was intrigued, by the second I was laughing, and at the third I was hooked. If this show had continued it might have given my favorite ST:TNG a run for it. I can't believe this show as cancelled!As you can tell, I'm a fan of SciFi, but I don't go much for westerns. However, the blend of the two in this series just works. Combine that with believeable characters who are intriguing in their depth of history and portrayal and add the true cohesion between the cast and you have a recipe for greatness. This show is downright fun.In fact, the only bad thing I can find to say about the DVDs has to do with the code behind the actual disks and not the show itself; namely that the menus are just the pokiest I've ever seen on a DVD.Approach this with an open mind and get ready for a really enjoyable experience.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	I never watched firefly because to me it just looked like they were on the ship all the time with hardly any action. I guess I always chose the wrong time to switch in though. Because now that I saw the whole series on dvd I see what I missed out on. This show is great fun and you never know what's going to happen next to the crew of Serenity. What helps is that the crew is unpredictable and you never know when they'll do something heroic or steal from other ships. The acting and characters are top-notch as well. There's nothing bad I can say about this series. I can't say I saw one bad episode. Even the episodes that didn't make it on tv blew me away. Those 3 are 3 of the most entertaining episodes too.In one of those you have Mal (Nathon Fillion) bumping into that foxy red head again who likes scam  men into thinking they're married to her. She has a heist planned that she wants Serenity to help her with. Which leads to one of the funniest endings. The 2nd one has Mal and Zoe open a package and find an old war buddy in it dead. However when an autopsy is about to be done, he appears to be very much alive. In the 3rd never viewed one. Serenity helps prostitutes battle a low life cowboy who wants to his baby from one of the women he got pregnant. He'll kill everyone of them until he gets it.Some of the characters remind me a little of Buffy characters. The pilot Wash has the sort of wise cracking lines that we were used to hearing from Xander Harris. While the adorable Kaylee, the engine repair girl reminds me of  Willow when she was innocent and sweet. Hell a lot of Mal's speeches or wisecracks sound like something Buffy would say too. It's fun though seeing Whedon put some of Buffy characters in each Firefly character. The cast had a strong chemestry too with just fantasic scripts to work with on each episode. Each one just got better and better. I'm just clueless to why this show was canceled. It's better than most shows that are on the air now. After getting into the series it made me behind Whedon all the way in bringing it to the big screen. Plus after seeing Serenity I hope there's more as well.	4.0	A great show that would've only got better	2005-10-03	8	8	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3G087DFBB8NI8	jimsjournal	I suppose Firefly does not need yet another rave review, but I cannot resist adding my comments.  (And this is the first time I have posted a review on Amazon.) My wife and I have been watching these episodes on DVD and are frantic because there are only two left to view. Our college-age daughter told us about this show.  I went to see Serenity in the theatre with her and her friends and loved it.  My wife and I got hooked on Firefly with the very first episode on DVD. This series is so good it could have been on HBO. I plan on buying the Serenity DVD and I would gladly purchase any feature-length sequel or any set of additional TV-style episodes.  I fear that the television and motion picture industry is so devoted to producing least common denominator crap that they will not revive Firefly, but if they did, I would buy it.	5.0	Make more episodes and I will buy them!	2005-11-26	3	3	0

I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi, but I also prefer that what I choose for my entertainment convey a good interesting or thought provoking story. Firefly fit the bill almost perfectly.  Without taking itself to seriously (which Star Trek almost did) Firefly still came across with cool and interesting messages.This was a very cool show. Too bad Fox didn't give it a good air time and then killed it before they realized people enjoyed it so much.Friends that have seen this have all gotten hooked (so to speak).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ATETIID3PA1DF	J. Laflen	When Fire-Fly was on FOX I recorded most of the episodes (which was hard to do given the erratic schedule).  When I watched this set, I enjoyed seeing the shows in order including the never aired episodes; seeing the shows in order allowed me to enjoy more of the arch that Whedon was building for the show's first season.The combination of western/futuristic scenery and clothing was new for me because it was done so blatantly, but it was a creative combination and fitting for a future where humanity is expanding similar to settlers in the old west.  What really drew me to this series was the depth that the characters displayed, especially the captain Malcolm Reynolds; in my opinion, the characters show much more depth than the ones on Buffy or Angel.	4.0	Quirky sci-fi that is more than just special effects	2005-08-10	3	2	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A18QCA8P532V3L	J. Lamb	"Every now and then a show comes along that enthralls viewers in such a way that it creates a cultish phenomenon (Similar to Farscape). Joss Wheedon is a master at creating such works (Buffy, Angel). I watched all of the episodes within about 2 days (Stayed up to 3 AM the last day). Every single episode is truly unique, fun, and humorous. The characters are completely individual with their own motivations, and one of them turns on the crew occasionally. Some of the villians are shown just the right amount of times to create the ""book-like"" effect of letting your mind create the horrifying image of them instead of the show feeding it to you (I'm thinking about the reevers). Joss is also a master at prolonged suspense, and every episode will have you on the edge of your seat at one point...or for the entire thing. One thing is for certain: When you buy this set you will hate FOX forever for making a blatantly moronic decision in promoting the show wrong, airing episodes out of order, and cutting the show because they didn't put it in appropriate time slots. You will love this show so much that after the last episode you might nearly break down because you know there isn't any more to watch.

The themes can be traced back to the most basic human conflicts while at the same time delivering an environment which has never been seen on television or film.  ""It's just another space western"" is the first instinct but at closer review the audience will realize that the characters spring into life as a fully developed family dealing with social and personal conflicts in each episode.  The writing creates a universe where it is a daily chore to fly through space and dock with exotic planets.  While the captain must deal with marauding ""space raiders"" and a powerful and controlling central government he must also balance the needs of his crew while they deal with love and jealousy abord ship.

I only just now started watching it when a friend lent me one of the DVDs. I am a big fan of Deep Space 9 and it has taken a long time to find a new show that has drawn me in as much as DS9 did.This show is a refreshing change to SciFi TV. Everytime I anticipate a Star Trek ending, I don't receive one- which is good. It makes the show harder to predict.Reasons I like the show so much:1. It has great character development, the actors seem to really synch well with each other, and their backstory is actually interesting.2. I have always enjoyed video games from the space privateer genre. This show depicts that just right. I wish more modern video games like Freelancer had more of this feel.3. I like the off-world sets.

I was so riveted I watched every single episode.  I am stunned this show only lasted one season-a real shame.  There is an amazing bond between all the characters that makes this show believable and irresistible; you just want to watch and learn more about them and their relationships.  The basic plot of this futuristic show is that humans have moved to a new solar system after burning out the earth.  It starts when the Alliance has defeated the independents and taken control of the solar system under one rule/law.  The captain of the ship Firefly was an independent fighter and sought refuge and a form of freedom in a smuggling ship he bought.  Each character is likable and endearing despite their faults and I can't stress how well they all work together-a rare and unique chemistry.

In fact, I saw a preview of it that FOX managed (rarely) to air, and was completely turned off. And then sometime about a year or so after it went off air, I heard about how GOOD Firefly was and a friend told me that if I liked Farscape (I LOVED Farscape!) that I would love Firefly. And he was right.It has everything I love: scifi action, world-building, unique and interesting characters (especially River and Mal), relationships that intrique (Mal and Inara! and Kaylee and Simon), and adventure, enough to keep me reeling for weeks.I fell for the series just about from Serenity. I knew not to watch from the order of the way FOX aired the episodes, and in my estimation, that asinine decision is a major contribution to the reason the series failed. It's not that it sucked. In fact, it's the exact opposite.FOX has rarely been able to properly market a scifi show. X-Files is the only exception and even then, it was more a fluke than anything else. FOX didn't market that show very well at first. Like Firefly, it caught on by word of mouth.Firefly is an amazing cult hit and spawned a fan-successful movie, Serenity. I already own the DVDs for Firefly, but I'll be purchasing the blu-ray edition, not only for the better video and audio, but also for those extras that weren't on the DVD set.	5.0	Underrated, understated, and underpromoted	2011-12-03	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AG3QC8XRXVBET	Jmac0802	This show is on a level that is rarely seen in today's pop culture. Exceptional writing by Joss Whedon and Tim Minear, this show is the complete opposite of every other Scifi show ever done. No aliens, no socialist eutopian concepts that have answered all of man's problems. Same problems, same political, religous and social differences. We continue on as we are now in the future in this brilliant series. Just like old becomes new today, the frontier becomes realized in a new terra formed galaxy. Horses and spaceships, lasers and bullets are all part of the same story line. If you have not seen this show, it is a must see.	5.0	The best Scifi series I have ever seen.	2012-08-05	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVC6PCA39NMDI	J. McDonald	The show itself is one of the best sci-fi series I've seen in a long time.  The stories are engaging, the character development is great, and the actors appear to have really 'clicked' together.  I heartily recommend it.Now the bad news... the blu-ray version is sub-par.  I own the series on both DVD and blu-ray, and was expecting the blu-ray to be a noticeable improvement.  It was not.  In fact, when I go back and compare the two, on some of the scenes the blu-ray actually looks worse than the DVD.The biggest problems appear to be the darkly-lit character scenes.  On the DVD, they simply lack detail; on the Blu-ray version, they look grainy.On the whole, I would recommend the DVD version over the blu-ray unless your goal is to own only blu-ray format.  The DVD version gets 5 stars from me; the blu-ray version, only 3.	3.0	Show is fantastic, but blu-ray looks grainier than DVD version	2009-02-08	5	1	4

He told me it was based on the Firefly series.  I can't figure out how I missed it.  I love SciFi and watch Fox shows often.  (Marketing missed the boat.)  I liked Serenity so much that I got all 4 Firefly discs from Netflix.  Wow!  How could they think of cancelling this series?  It's intelligent, rich in characters and locations, laugh-out-loud clever and I'm sooo hooked.  I am buying the collection today.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1X6AUWKRFH00A	J. McLeod	Admittedly, when this series first aired, I never really got into it. Either because it was sharing a timeslot with other shows that were already established, or because frankly at the time I just didn't understand it. Now however, with the imminent release of the feature length movie in theaters soon and the reairing in its entirety (in the order it was meant to be seen) on the Sci Fi channel, I must concede that this is quite probably one of the most intelligent and entertaining shows ever produced for television. The multi-talented ensemble really enjoyed their work and it shows as there are no half-acted, muddled-through scenes in any of the original 11 episodes. Not since Farscape have I been this completely enveloped by the magic of the writing, directing, and acting teams. A true masterpiece which should be admired and enjoyed by all.	5.0	Fox's Best Kept Secret	2005-09-15	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AUR1SMCFAR42X	"J. McNeff ""Like movies"""	I asked my wife to give me this DVD set for Christmas. I missed the series completely when it aired, but I read an interview with Joss Whedon in which he said this was one of the best things he ever did and, knowing the quality of his work, I wanted to give it a try. I sat down on Sunday after Christmas and started watching the two-part pilot. My wife, who is not a big sci-fi fan, started watching about half way in. After it was over, she said, &quot;Let's watch another one.&quot; We watched two more. That night we started watching again about 9 and watched 'til 1:30 am. I can't think of any movie or TV series we have enjoyed more. There is a real sense of loss, however, when we think we may not get to follow these characters further into the future. If you love great characters, great stories, real humor and fabulous settings you cannot go wrong with Firefly.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1U9Q7K14AG96F	JM Haces	"Ok, I realize there's hardly anything I can say about this show that hasn't been pointed out by one or more of the more than two thousand reviews. It's REALLY that good.I'd orginally only watched the ""Shindig"" episode on TV and I thought it was very entertaining, so it seemed odd to me when the show got the axe.Or course, when the ""Serenity"" movie came out on DVD I rented it, and eventually bought it since I liked it so much (it wasn't screened on my town). That prompted me to get the Complete Season Set and I have to say that the only dissapointment in it is that it ends after only 14 episodes.I just don't get it. This show was great and they killed it just like that.I guess the show wasn't going the direction the FOX brass liked it to go. Maybe if instead of reavers they had vampires, and Mal and his crew were high-school age kids it would've gone on for season after season! Or maybe the show could've been centered on Simon and his adventures in a Core World Hospital! Yeah, ""Osiris E.R.""! Then it could've gone on for ten seasons!Don't get me wrong, I liked Joss Whedon's previous shows, but they were dumb kiddie fare. Very well written and entertaining dumb kiddie fare, I admit, but ultimately shallow. Or maybe I just never identified with the teen-angst angle.On the other hand, Firefly was about regular people with regular worries. No demon fighting, world saving, fantasy-gimmicky-who'll-take-me-to-prom thingy.The characters are not only very diverse personality-wise, they actually include all age groups like real life, from teenaged River to gray-haired but still tough Shepherd Book, with most of the characters being apparently somewhere in their thirties. Not just a ""scooby gang"" and a father figure. This show was way better and deserved a couple of full seasons.So I guess that the heads of FOX must be the dumbest people ever. This great show gets the axe, whereas elsewhere on TV crap like ""Charmed"", ""Mutant X"" and even ""Highlander: The Series"" went on and on and on and on.I guess the problem was that ""Firefly"" had something most TV shows don't. A plot. And an interesting one at that. And like all interesting plots, it was complicated and involved characters who weren't clear-cut, black-and-white, standard hero-villian stuff. So I suppose that would've made it hard to cash in on the mechandise, uh? I gather few parents would want to buy their little girl an Inara Serra Lunchbox, or a ""How to fluently curse in Mandarin"" handbook for their kid.I guess the network thought the show was geared to the same audience as Buffy and Angel had been. It obviously wasn't.Perhaps it'll pull a ""Family Guy"". I hope it does."	5.0	This got cancelled but tons of crappy shows seem to go on forever. Does that seem right to you?	2006-07-06	9	9	0

You will like the programs even if you don't think you like sci fi or westerns.I can't add much to the 2,500 reviews already posted, except to note that so many of us came to love and appreciate the series after it was off the air and without any prior connection to the series creator, Joss Whedon.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ABSHD5PC5YEH6	"J. M Quiggins ""Sole_Fish"""	I bought this DVD collection on a whimsy. I could not find anything else i wanted. And i couldn't stomach Punky Brewster. I had never even seen this series. So, i looked at the packaging. Nice. I read the excerpts. Interesting. I dropped the thirty five bucks. Then, i watched it. Episode one left me feeling 'bleh'. By the end of episode 2 i began to realise i was watching one of the most enthralling television series i had ever watched. Never had i been so glued to any television program since 'V' the miniseries, or Stephen Kings' 'The Stand'. And, that is exactly what this plays out like. A powerfully orchestrated high budget mini-series. The continuing story-line is compelling. Even downright memorable. I had honest and loud physical and verbal reactions while watching this. That is how PERFECTLY they fleshed out these characters. I feel i now know them. And i am not happy they are gone. Shame on you FOX. You should've tried harder. Don't you realize that this has a true future? Dump the reality shows ,you idiots, and get this back on the air. A mix of western, a little star trek, even romance and spelunking. What an incredible ride it has been watching this set. I only wish there could be a second one.

This DVD set is worth every dollar that you will spend on it and as you watch each episode of this amazing series you will say two things over and over again:1.  This is AMAZING!2.  HOW could FOX have cancelled this?!Where to start?  The first thing that's really impressive about this series is that I haven't been able to find a person that doesn't like it yet.  I'm a NASA engineer and a science fiction geek, so it's no surprise that I like it.  But, my psychologist wife, my artist sister-in-law, my teenage history-buff brother-in-law - everyone loves it.  The second thing I'll mention is the consistent quality of Firefly's episodes.  There are NO &quot;bad episodes&quot; in this series.  Even my favorite Sci Fi series, Babylon 5, had at least a couple of lousy episodes each season.There are so many other things I could mention about this series - it's visual effects are on par with the biggest hollywood science fiction movies, the costumes and sets are gorgeous, and the actors all believable and fun to watch.

Other reviewers have gone into the details, so I won't repeat anything here, suffice to say it's a great series. I would have liked to have seen more special features for the BD release, but you can't hope for much with a defunct series 10 years after the fact. The one thing that was missing, and it's a small thing, is just an episode list somewhere. One thing I liked about the DVD release was they had the episodes listed in series order and also the dates they were aired (totally out of order). That way you could clearly see how poorly handled this series was from FOX. It also let you know which episodes were on which disc. As it is with the BD release, know where does it say on any of the packaging or disc labels, which episodes are on which disc.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AK6E7Z6IIK5FC	Joe	I bought the Firefly DVD in hopes that it would be good. I had never seen it before, but I was trusting that if Joss could do amazing in 2 shows, then he could produce a 3rd that was even half up to par of Buffy and Angel. Trust me, if it was even half as good as Buffy or Angel I would have loved it. That's how much I adore those two shows.Immidiately, I was blown away. Thank god I threw away 40 bucks to buy it without ever seeing it. The cast is all amazing, the CGI looks incredibly real, besides the obvious space CGI stuff, I heard in a commentary that there was a shot with a bunch of cows, and the cows looked so real I had no idea.The DVD is a must-see for fans. It even has 3 unaired episodes (which are all special and wonderful. Trash and The Message are especially amazing, in every way possible.) Joss and Tim really spread their wings with making this show, and it's a shame that Fox ... yet again cancelled an amazing show, (Dark Angel, Family Guy) and plagues the TV with crap reality TV shows. They did not do the show justice.Still, I was enthrawled. Everything about the show was amazing. It easily matches up to the standards, if not exceeds the standards of Buffy and Angel. Firefly did in 15 episodes what it took a good couple of seasons of Buffy to do, and that was to have every episode be awesome even if the plot was shotty, the witty dialouge and the acting could hold it through.I can't wait to see what the movie does, and maybe Fox will come around and decide to put the show on air again. I can't even imagine what Joss could have done with this amazing show. I can't even imagine.Plus it has all these little extra goodies which I love, including a nice little easter egg of Adam Baldwin singing &quot;The Hero of Canton,&quot; which is downright hilarious.Easily worth 40 bucks.	5.0	Joss is God	2004-01-07	9	8	1

From the first episode, (The Train Job) I adored this show...and no, I'm not just a very loyal Joss fan (though you guys rock). I've never watched Buffy or Angel, I just read about Firefly in an upcoming shows article and thought it sounded interesting. I was wrong...it was 10X more than just &quot;interesting&quot;. The characters were flawless, the musical was gorgeous, the CGI and other effects amazing and, most of all, the dialogue was pure genius. I cried when they took this show off the air. And I proceeded to cry again when I watched the never aired episodes on this DVD. This will go right next to Pride and Prejudice and LOTR as the greatest DVDs in my collection...maybe even above since, at least with P&amp;P and LOTR, I had closure.

If they (FOX) would have left it alone it would have grown and been tweaked like most shows get after the first season.  This show had a much better set of characters then ""Enterprise"" and it was alot more fun to watch.  I agree that the western part was a bit overdone but if you were paying attention, the story was starting to get into the space aspect alot more, and the story was developing into something to keep people hooked until the next episode came on.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AYB4ELCS5AM8P	"John B.

Also, they must have spent quite a bit of money for some of the scenes with the loads of extras in them.- Excellent casting. All the characters are just right and their chemistry is great. Just very believable.- Some of the writing is very good, profound even. And some of the comedic bits were great.Somehow, it just all works well together, kudos to the writers and the cast. It's a real pity that FOX did not believe in it and basically killed it with their slotting.If you like sci-fi shows that are character driven, you will love this show.	5.0	Excellent!	2014-03-21	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AK7P5KJ13PZYJ	John Bowler	Amazon's sound mix caused me to stop watching 10 minutes in.  Netflix have tried to fix the mix, but even on Netflix I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes.  Listening on a PC with good quality headphones the weirdness is immediately obvious - on the opening scene the vocals are almost incomprehensible and there is unpredictable left-right shift and drop outs.  This may be because of Windows, but I think not because on a very good quality stereo system with the bass filtered out to a sub-woofer the vocals are still almost incomprehensible.If you want to see it go to Netflix, not Amazon - Netflix have tried to clean it up, but there is still excessive bass on the male roles (gee, I know it's a cowboy movie, but not everyone is Johnny Cash.)Lossage, drop it.	1.0	Unwatchable because of the sound quality	2014-05-30	6	0	6

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2NZJZ1K8IVLN4	John Campbell Rees	"I was instantly hooked on the gritty down at heal vision of the future that ""Firefly"" presents.  Mankind has finally made it to the stars, but has done so out of necessity and in doing so, has made a pigs ear of it.  This is not the bland and antiseptic view of the future presented by the ""Star Trek"" franchise, this is a believable future.  In the universe of ""Firefly"" things are getting worse before they have a chance to get any better.  The Anglo-Sino Alliance of Settled Worlds rules the Galaxy, a deeply repressive government that controls everything from the centre and resulting in the worlds on the rim being dirt poor.Aboard the 03 Firefly class cargo vessel Serenity is Whedon's usual band of misfits trying to get by in life.  The ship is owned by Malcolm Reynolds, a veteran of the recent civil war, in which he was on the losing side, fighting for the right of planets to maintain their independence.  His second in command is Zoe Warren, who fought with him in the War.  `Wash' Warren, pilot and Zoe's husband, Kaylee Frye, the genius mechanic who keeps Serenity in the sky and Jayne Cobb, the hired muscle.  There is Also Inara Serra, a Companion or high class courtesan, who rents one of Serenity's shuttles, Shepherd Book a wandering Monk and Simon and River Tamm, a surgeon and his damaged sister, who are fugitives from the Alliance.This series only ran for eleven episodes on the FOX Network in the US.  Three of the episodes on this four DVD set have only ever broadcast outside its origin. This DVD set contains all the episodes in 16:9 widescreen, as they were originally filmed with Dolby Digital 6.1 Surround sound.  You cannot help but be impressed by the love that went into this series.  Everything on this show works, from the quality of the writing and acting, through special effects to the background music. And the love that went into the production of this series has been duplicated in this DVD set, with numerous special features and audio commentaries that add greatly to the enjoyment of each episode.  Shows this good happen once in a blue moon, and it is criminal the way that the FOX Network treated it when it was originally broadcast.  There are plans for a movie based on the series, and hopefully that and the success of this DVD set will show the FOX Network the error of its ways."	5.0	Just Shiny	2003-12-23	20	19	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1Y2Z5ZBU1T10D	"John Carlson ""John"""	I was never the type of person that would sitdown and watch a 'series'.  There are tons of TV shows, but very few interest me enough to sit and watch.  One day a friend of mine introduced me to the Firefly DVD set, and after some nagging I finally watched the first episode.  I was suprised, the quality was incredible compared to the quick glances I've seen of other shows.  The characters also seemed to have a depth and a reality that really interested me.After my initial viewing of episode one, I actually asked my friend if I could come over and watch the next episode!  Something I've never done!  Right now it's been a weekly ritual.  Every week we get together and watch a new episode, and we're currently on disk 3.  Every episode just interests me in the characters more and more.  There's something about the crew of the Serenity that just makes you feel like cheering for them.  Even though they're such a mismatched bunch of folks, they somehow fit together.  I know there's only one disk left after this, but I ask myself how TV stations can dump this show?!  It's one of the best TV series I've seen period.  I found out more information about Firefly's creator, and was suprised to find out that he also made Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I never really cared for that show personally, but Firefly is something different.  It 's really something special, and I'm glad to hear a movie is coming out.  I'm certainly going to watch it.	5.0	Brilliant!	2005-03-04	15	12	3

As you may have noticed, fox aired the episodes out of order, which was the primary reason for the hard time the show received from critics.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AU13MSEHYXXQA	"John Craddock ""WaldenProf"""	This is one of those rare series that has kept me awake until 3AM nightly viewing it.  Rarely in decades, have I seen such a warm, thoughtful and expertly cast series as that which Josh Whedon has assembled in Firefly. It is true, that once you have seen the first several segments, you're hooked.The interviews that accompany the 4th DVD can easily lead someone to become wet-eyed, when it is learned that the network (who should not remain unnamed but will), tried in classic Hollywood fashion, to change something totally developed and functional into just another piece of viewing wasteland.  Fortunately, Whedon did not give in, but the loss of the series is a genuine tragedy.The cast is incredible as an ensemble, and reflects the genuine care and friendship that they have for one another as disclosed in the accompanying interviews on the 4th DVD. It has a lot of the same feel as &quot;West Wing&quot; in this area. This DVD set is a prized addition to my film and television library.There are few series that I would pay to see resurrected, but this is one of those.  It would be a perfect fit for the Sci-Fi Channel.  Mr. Whedon, are you listening?	5.0	Classic Network Ignorance	2004-04-02	9	9	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3335LTANZCX78	John Cunningham	"As a huge fan of Joss Whedon's most famous television works, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"", I just had to check out his shortlived ""Firefly"" sci-fi series. Despite a dedicated fanbase, the show was canceled after 11 episodes due to poor treatment from the FOX Network, which aired episodes out of order and constantly changed the timeslot (they released the pilot episode after all the others).With this DVD set, you will get all 11 television episodes, along with the 3 that never aired. The show has a much different feel to it than Whedon's other two shows, though his trademark humor and character development are still present. Combining a western feel to a Star Wars-like setting, Whedon creates a world unlike any seen before. The characters are all extremely likeable, and the actors to a terrific job portraying them, particularly Nathon Fillion as the lead of Captain Malcom Reynolds.The show's greatest weakness is perhaps it's criminally short length, though this is of no fault of the show itself or it's creator. As a result, many plotlines in the show are left unresolved by the final episode. However, the feature film ""Serenity"" continues where the series left off, and wraps up everything the series didn't, so I highly recommend picking up the movie as well."	5.0	Awesome	2008-02-28	0	0	0

I didn't really care at all.  It was kind of outdated and sort of corny in a way.  Then maybe a month ago I decided to give it another shot.  After the first two episodes I was hooked.I ran straight through all the episodes with no hesitation.  Despite the production faults the show itself is written beautifully.  The characters are real, the acting makes them more real.  You WILL become attached to them.  You WILL miss them after you're finished.Actually, don't watch this show.

Like other reviewers, I came to this DVD set on a friend's recommendation and have not indulged in Buffy or Angel.  Also, I do not generally buy DVDs, especially those of TV shows (except the Simpsons, of course... I mean, come on...)Anyway, after renting from Netflix, I'm buying this one.I was blown away.The dialogue is fantastic, never cliched.  The writing credits your intelligence and attention span.Malcolm Reynolds is what Han Solo should have been, and Nathan Fillion handles his subtleties with aplomb.  In fact, I don't see a weak character or weak actor in the bunch.  (Summer Glau's River Tam character does take time to develop... give her that time, and you'll be rewarded.)Note to newbies: the two-hour pilot episode takes a while to get going.  Your interest will be piqued enough to watch the second episode, and after that, you'll be hooked.Fox had a hit on their hands and BLEW IT.Can't wait for the movie.

Those with money and power get all the cool tech, and those who have nothing get to keep nothing. Fortunately for those who have little or nothing, the crew of Serenity, led by Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), will do the right thing.Some of the strange (interesting) things are how little medicine has progressed, how pistols and rifles still shoot bullets, and how unlike in &#34;Star Trek,&#34; there are no transporters or food replicators, although there is space travel and all the technology that goes with it. Being a &#34;companion&#34; is now both legal and a respected profession, and having one associated with a pirate ship like Serenity brings legitimacy and respect to an otherwise bad reputation. Science still insists that the Bible is illogical yet there are still missionaries who try to spread the gospel, and one just happened to board Serenity as a tourist.I find this a quirky yet addictive program.	5.0	Quirky but Addictive	2013-11-13	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1GG7X1CRTQXLN	John Isenhour	"If you are more than just a passing fan of Sci-Fi, you should watch every episode of this show. You will then love every episode of the show, and you will be brokenhearted when you reach the end of the single season that was Firefly. You will then realize, as I have, that this show was bound to fail on network TV.On paper, the premise is pretty silly. After using up all of its natural resources, the human race leaves Earth. Without warp drive, somehow humans make it to another solar system with a bunch of planets that they then terraform. The series is completely set-up as a post-civil-war, frontier narrative, complete with hookers with a heart of gold, hard on the outside/soft on the inside outlaws, gunmen (presumably) turned preachers, and even savages.  The characters talk like characters from an old black and white western. They shoot bullets. They ride on horses and in spaceships shaped like horses. There is no framework for this show to work on a scale large enough to sustain it on a huge network like Fox. I try to tell people why they should watch the show, but I end up saying ""Screw it; just watch. You'll get into it."" Like Serenity herself, this show should not work. But it does, and we love it.There are plot elements that are great. For example, the mix of American and Chinese culture is very well done because it is so understated. I love the idea of a space epic with no warp drive, where space travel is difficult and where people are just trying to scrap out a living. Also, all of the mismatched space and western elements just work. I watched every episode, one right after the other, and continue (as many of the rest of you do) to feel a loss that there weren't more. Where's our last dance at Vic's Las Vegas Lounge?The glue that holds this mismatch together is the excellent ensemble cast. The interactions between the characters seem genuine, even touching at times. Even though the characters themselves are generally stock, much of their interactions and story lines challenge their stock elements, making for an interesting approach to character development. Think Jayne being confronted by his misunderstood heroism in ""Jaynestown"" or Inara's doppelganger, Nandi, in ""Heart of Gold."" Of course, we all want to know what happens to River, and we all want to see more development of Saffron and Jubal.It's the connection to the characters that make me feel the loss, and it's what will instantly addict you to this show should you choose to watch it."	4.0	Excellent Execution of a Difficult Premise	2013-03-05	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"Series creator Joss Whedon had the superb idea of literally taking the ""Wagon Train to the Stars"" concept space opera - best exemplified by the original ""Star Trek"" - by creating this mesmerizing ""Western"" science fiction television series, ""Firefly"", which had too short a season. Meddlesome network television executives - FOX in this case - forced Whedon to air the series episodes not in the order they should have been aired, with the result that the final episode ever shown on the FOX network was the two hour pilot ""Serenity"". ""Firefly"" is the saga of the crew of the Firefly-class starship Serenity trying to keep themselves one light jump ahead of the totalitarian Alliance of Planets, willing to do any job - legal or otherwise - to keep themselves alive. Whedon created an intriguing cast of characters as the Serenity's crew and passengers; thankfully they may now find themselves a new cinematic lease on life in ""Serenity"", the forthcoming film adaptation of this series. Judging from the handful of episodes I saw, ""Firefly"" had the potential of becoming as fine a classic example of  televised space opera science fiction as ""Babylon 5""."	5.0	Potentially the best Space Opera since Babylon 5	2005-08-08	5	5	0

This was the sifi tv show that got me into the sifi genera! Well to be honest I started backwards with Serenity then firefly later on. Firefly is much better *(both are great though). To bad they didn't continue with this serries it was just a bad time for it to be released with all the other space shows running at the time.

Read other reviews for more in depth info on the actual series or the quality of the image and sound. Image is a tad soft compared with some ""reference"" Blu-rays but the sound is great. My only complaint is with the packaging. They got lazy! You get three discs but nowhere on the discs or on the shell is a listing of the episodes. No way to tell which is on which disc! Once in the menu for a disc, the way it repeats and wraps around there is no way to tell which episode is first or last. This is NOT for first time viewers but is OK for hard-core fans who know the episode sequence. Despite being a fan since day one, I had to go to the internet, print off an episode listing, then mark which episode was on which disc. Fox was lazy when they aired the show and they were lazy in putting out the Blu-rays. Despite this... buy the darn thing.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1VXWZU8LPF1BQ	John Marshall Furlong	"Firefly is amazing entertainment.  It takes the sci-fi genre and gives it a good, swift kick in the rump.  It's a show that relies on character development instead of technobabble and plot rather than special effects (although the special effects are pretty good for a TV show).  It's a little unconventional with the western/sci-fi mix, but it also adds unmeasurable charm and believability.  The characters seem pretty generic at first, but by the end of the 2-hour premier, their personalities come out.  By the end of the third episode, Mal and the gang feel like old friends.  There are no aliens, no transporters, no laser pistols.  But there is witty and clever dialog, suspense, laughs, and great writing.Like most people, I never heard of Firefly until it was off the air.  There is no way this show would have ""failed"" if it had been properly promoted by FOX.  Look at all the 5-star reviews!

Funny, ironic, very much Joss and we loved it and couldn't wait for the movie to come out to see it.  Somehow we missed this series when it was on television and are truly sorry we were not able to add our votes for keeping it on the air.  Now, with so much more apcrae on t.v. in the form of the reality shows and such, with a zillion commercials, we find it very difficult to watch much network television.

The fusion of gritty froniter and slick technology is a refreshing approach to beloved albiet innundated genre. The characters are easy to identify with and keep you guessing as they draw you into their world. The visual fabric woven through set design, special effects, CGI and wardrobe are at a level many films fail to achieve, let alone television series. Details like the gun holstered at Mal's side looks sleek and futuristic while paying homage to an old Colt 44 made famous by Clint Eastwood in many a western. It's details such as these that lend there weight to a stellar team of craftsman, giving Firefly, ""heavyweight"" status in an already crowded ring."	5.0	JWs made a fan out of me!	2004-08-13	5	5	0

I have to say that I am VERY impressed.  This show was excellent!  Great character development, a setting rife with adventure, great effects, and one hell of a story arch (that was sadly cut down before it even hit its peak).Fox should be ashamed.  This proves to me that network executives are clueless as to what a good show is (just look at the statistics for this last season--something like 1 out of 18 new shows succeeded).Here's to hoping the movie goes into production soon!  If I recall correctly, everyone has signed (happily) to be in a big screen version--but scheduling issues have pushed the release date back to 2005...	5.0	One of the BEST Sci-Fi shows ever made	2004-02-20	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ACD3ZOI5WTEL6	John Petrie	Firefly is the most realistic and therefore compelling science-fiction show that has ever been made, with the most realistic problems, conflicts, relationships, cultures, and settings. The heroes of the show are a motley bunch of colorful characters who have chosen a life in the sky and in the half-civilized world of the outer planets of humanity's new solar system, taking mostly illegal and semi-legal transport, salvaging, and smuggling jobs just to keep fuel in the engine and food in the pantry. They are not the government or the military; in fact, the main source of the plot lines of their lives is their desire to live out from under the heel of the Alliance and avoid its sterile, dehumanizing, militaristic oppression. They all have their own stories of how they ended up on the Firefly-class transport ship Serenity and why they would choose that life over a more comfortable but less free life on one of the central planets, although we only have time to gain any meaningful insight into the inner motivation of a few of the characters.As with any good fiction, what makes Firefly really great is the characters. All nine main characters are unique and interesting, such that it is difficult to choose one or even a couple of favorites. It is such a shame that we were prevented from learning everything there is to know about them--where they come from, where they would go, who they truly are. Given how much you come to love each and every one of them during 14 episodes and a movie, it pains me to think how much more we could have loved them after seven seasons (which was Joss's original plan).I haven't met anyone who has anything less than glowing praise for Firefly. I have converted a few people into Browncoats by inviting them over to watch it, and they all got hooked immediately, thanked me for introducing them to it, and asked how it possibly could have gotten canceled. Based on the Amazon user ratings, apparently there are people out there who don't love and who even dislike Firefly, but I am incapable of understanding how. They might respond that it's a matter of taste and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. That's fine. Their opinion is incorrect and stupid. Do yourself a favor and buy or borrow the DVD's or Blu-rays, and then buy or borrow the movie, Serenity. Chances are you know someone who owns it, and they would be more than happy to convert another fan. Luckily but tragically, it won't take you very long to watch all of it.One note about the Blu-ray version: it looks fantastic and is well worth $30 or $40. I highly recommend it over the DVD's.	5.0	Watch a few episodes and you'll be a Browncoat for life	2011-08-28	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A257A2KGWRX1HL	John Ponzio	"I didn't see Firefly when it first ran on TV, but after I saw the movie Serenity, I had to have more, and ""discovered"" the Firefly series on DVD.While the characters and the overall concept of the movie and the series are the same, they aren't really related.  One is not a continuation of the other.  Rather, they are better described as parallel efforts to tell a similar story.  Both are excellent, and both stand on their own.Forget transporter rooms and warp speeds.  To me, space travel as envisioned by Joss Whedon in this series is more realistic.  His view of desperate individuals in cobbled together spacecraft, making a living as best they can, seems a more likely future than the blue-water Navy goes to space concepts seen elsewhere.However, in the Firefly series, it's really the characters that stand out and make the show what it is.  The entire cast does an excellent job.  After a few episodes, I realized that they had become part of my family, and after the last episode, I felt a real sense of loss that they were gone.When you watch the series for the first time, watch ""Serenity - Part 1 & 2"" first, and ""The Message"" last."	5.0	Exellent series!

But this one is really enjoyable.The combination of Western/SciFi appeals to me on a level beyond logic. Actually, this combination is not so far fetched when you consider the primitive homes of some poor folks around the world...who nevertheless have TV sets. Besides which there is the Robert Heinlein argument that 'horses can make more horses and that's one trick machinery will never master', or words to that effect, which makes it almost sensible that frontier planets WOULD opt for primitive technology in some areas. As for the cowboy-style clothes: have you ever seen women in kimonos, chattin' on their cell-phones in the middle of high-tech Tokyo? Some technology/clothing combinations are so wild they just WORK. Firefly is so well-done, it ALL works.The thing that makes it all work is the writing and the acting. They are both top-quality in an understated way. I have only watched three episodes and already I care about the characters. What more needs to be said?Oh, just one more thing: each character seems to have some little something that is appropriate to their role and which just kind of grabs you. Have you ever met somebody who might not have been the most beautiful or the most well-educated, but there was something that just...stood out? And made you like him? All the characters here seem to have that.I can't wait to watch the rest of the episodes and I do hope there will be a movie.Fun, quirky, involving, you'll probably like it.

My initial impression was that it was very well done, but the setting held it back.Even though I was not overjoyed by the series, I decided to get the DVDs to see the missing episodes. My impression of the series changed after I had a chance to see what Whedon intended for the series.Whedon had some really brilliant ideas. Fox screwed them up. The setting would have worked much better with the original character concepts, the original order of the episodes, etc ... The only weak episode is the episode that Fox forced Whedon to write in a weekend (the 'pilot' that was shown first).If you thought the show was ok when it was on TV, you'll be far more impressed with the DVDs. And, as an added bonus, if you buy the DVDs, you're helpping increase the chances that the show will turn into a feature film ... and the feature film will turn back into a series.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AT4757QZT5TMG	Jombie	The acting was all top notch, except maybe the bounty hunter in the last episode. I am not entirely sure if his quirky dialogue and acting was on purpose or not, either way, it was a little distracting. This is a good take on westerns mixed with sci-fi. Instead of aliens and exploration, this focuses more on people finding their way in the Universe. It starts out strong but getting people together by chance, because they all happen to be going to the same place. They, mostly, have not real reason to stay together but end up needing each other to survive. The character interactions are well thought out and everyone stays in their character. The characters grow and expand as they go through their &#34;adventures&#34;. The only complaint I have is they did not have time to answer all the loose ends because it got canceled after one season. At least the movie, Serenity, answers most of the big ones.	4.0	Good but short	2013-08-26	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1N0JTJK3CV50N	"Jonah L. Walker ""Video Editor, Compositing Ar..."	I missed Joss Whedon's FIREFLY on it's initial run on FOX, as it seems did most people, but I picked up the DVD after hearing some good things about the show, and was completely blown away. This has quickly become my all time favorite Sci-Fi series, with great writing, acting, SFX. This show is amazing. When so much of Sci-Fi (Think Star Wars or Star Trek) seems to have forgotten that it is all about great characters, this show has great characters in spades. Watch this DVD and you will see what fools FOX was to not give this show it's proper chance!At least it sounds like Universal has picked this show up to do a feature in 2004. It isn't 100%, but hopefully it will happen, and maybe that will do well, and they can try and bring the show back!I can't recommend this DVD any higher! Check it out!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17SLUOC7LWPBA	Jonathan C. Gettys	This series continues to pop up on various SCI-FI lists with other respected series' like BSG and STNG, so I watched a couple on SCI-Fi and was hooked. Like the new BSG, this series provides most of its entertainment through the interaction of its widely varied characters, not special effects.  I am in that long list of fans willing to pay Joss Whedon now for more internet/DVD releases later ;-)	5.0	Family hooked two years later	2005-12-29	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2YCYGMPFRIMJQ	Jonathan D.	If you are a fan of Joss Whedon's work, or maybe just a Sci-Fi enthusiast, I highly recommend watching Firefly.  A fascinating blend of humor, action, character development and moral dilemmas make each episode a joy to watch.  While its initial run only lasted a single season, the cult following of it gave Joss enough backing to get a movie produced which will be coming out in a few months (called Serenity, look for it!).  If it is reasonably successful in the box office, we may see Firefly return to the small screen again as well.	5.0	Another excellent show from Joss Whedon	2005-07-22	2	2	0

He said yes, but said that it had been cancelled.  On a whim I purchased it, and what a great purchase it has turned out to be.  Fantastic charachters and stories have made for a purchase that I have now, less than two weeks since I purchased it, watched all the way through three times.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3KZ7OH4VRL048	Jonathan	Okay, I have to get this out of the way. First off, the series is incomplete. The show was scheduled to run for 7 seasons and only made it through one (run out of order and only partly aired by Fox) before the network shut it down. After the DVD ends, you will still have a lot of questions about some of plot and the characters, particularly River and Shepard Book. Also, although originally billed as an action show, Firefly combines that with a drama - it's as if you bought a video game expecting Mortal Kombat and got Final Fantasy: the action, although not constant, is there, but so is a lot of intricate plot, which depending on your tastes can be good or bad.With that said, Firefly gets off to a fairly slow start, but when it finds its groove (depending on who you talk to, 2-4 episodes in) it really takes off. The ensemble works extremely well together, and the characters, while somewhat archetypal, are endearing and easily related to. The effects are pretty good, and the plots are believable and well-thought out. I especially like the creative camera use, which did many shots off-center or with flare. The commentaries and special features are nice touches, but the real gem of the DVD is the show itself.Sometimes really good shows don't make it. This is an example of one, and for all its unfulfilled questions, it is one of the greatest sci-fi series ever.	5.0	Once you realize what you're getting into, a good show	2009-01-15	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVTYH0424VONH	Jonathan Hoopingarner	I have to admit that I never watched this show when it was on Fox. The concept just seemed too hokey to me at the time. But a friend recently convinced me to watch a couple episodes from this DVD collection one evening. I went the next day and bought it for myself, I was so impressed.Granted, like most shows, it takes a bit of time finding it's feet, but the actors are all extremely good, the visuals are of a quality rivalling those of Babylon 5, and the realization of a truely polyglot society (not unlike most frontier societies in American &amp; other histories) borders on genius.  Overall, the storys are good, with an interest quotient not seen in the Franchise that Shall Remain Nameless in far too long. If it had been given time, and not to put too fine a point on it, Firefly might well have been spoken of in the same breath as Babylon 5 &amp; the original (OK, I'll say it) Star Trek. As it is, Firefly stands as a prime example of the difference between entertainment &amp; marketing.I hope most fervently that the movie version gets made, and has many, MANY sequels.	4.0	Great potential, cruelly cast aside	2003-12-16	1	1	0

But I was bored one night and went to rent a movie.  I ended up renting Serenity and the movie was a lot of fun.  A lot better than I thought it would be.  So I was curious and ended up buying the series and I don't regret my impulse buy one bit.  This series had everything a cool sci-fi should have action, comedy and more action.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GKRKK6XYYHMY	Jonathan Shier	Firefly is a fantastic series. This review is not about that. This review is about the absolutely terrible experience you will have with these Blurays. Not only are they slow to load but they don't remember your progress through episodes or allow you to access the disc menu while you are watching an episode. Seriously, there is no way to return to the menu without stopping playback. On a PS3 this forces you out of Bluray playback entirely and you must reload the disc, which is quite slow, to get back to the menu. Absurd. That there is no additional commentary and only a single 20 minute retrospective added to the Bluray beyond what came on the DVD set just adds insult to injury.	4.0	Great Series, Bad Blurays	2013-01-09	1	1	0

Keeling	I am probably one of the few people who can say that they actually saw an advertisement for Firefly back when it was still on.  All it did, however, was make me dismiss Firefly as another sci-fi show a la Star Trek.  Oh how wrong I was...It was actually the massive amount of 5 star reviews here on Amazon that made me revisit the idea of giving the show a chance.  On a whim, I bought the DVD, and I never looked back.  This show is quality, no doubt about it, and its demise is further proof of the sad state that TV is in.From the storylines of the episodes, to the CGI effects (which I was not expecting to be so good!), to the wonderful characters, each with a unique personality and set of values, this show tops anything else that is currently on Fox.The 880 other reviews on this site (mine included) can not do this show justice.

Like many people, I caught up with the show about a year after its cancellation. Joining its fandom was a bittersweet experience, since I knew that I had probably seen about all the Firefly I would ever see.This Blu Ray set gives the show the attention it deserves. The scene commentaries are fantastic, making us feel that the cast and crew were and continue to be friends of the show, too. In addition, the video quality is surprisingly good, the show and especially its special effects looking better than they did in the original broadcast. This is a highly recommended series and version.	5.0	A nice presentation of a tragically truncated series	2013-11-02	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25RU2PDR9LNBC	Joni Graybill	I don't usually write reviews since I figure there are more than enough people sharing their opinions to render mine repeative no matter what I say. However, in the case of Firefly, the more people who voice their love for the show, the greater the hope of making some Fox Suit somewhere realize their horrible mistake in killing this incredible show before it got the chance to really fly. I just recently finished watching this DVD set that I bought on a whim and I'm absolutely blown away. It's an amazing show, with witty scripts, a fantastic score (I *love* the theme song. It's the only show where I watch the credits every single time and I admit with no shame that I often sing along) and beautiful special effects. However, the best thing is the incredible cast. As others have said, they created a family that the viewer loves dearly in just 14 episodes and it nearly breaks your heart to have to say goodbye to them after such a short time. Everything about it is absolutely outstanding.I believe this show easily would have become Joss Whedon's masterpiece (and that's saying a lot since I'm a loyal &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; fan) if it had been given half a chance and not deliberately sabotaged by Fox. It is nothing short of brilliant and so refreshingly new. I eagerly anticipate the upcoming movie and I continue to hope that maybe this show will get a second chance if the fanbase becomes large enough and loud enough. Mal said it, &quot;Doing the impossible makes us mighty.&quot;Check out this show! I cannot recommend it highly enough. In edition to the amazing show itself, there are quite a few great extra features on this DVD Set, including entertaining commentaries and a very well done documentary.	5.0	You Can't Take the Sky From Me.	2004-01-08	9	8	1

I remember seeing some episodes and wondering what was going on (especially when they finally aired the pilot later) It was confusing- now I find out it was presented all out of order! I thought the show had potential, but was just ok. Then I saw the boxed set in the store and said to myself, &quot;What the hell, i'm in a good mood today,&quot; (I don't like to spend money on a whim, but i plunked down the dough anyway and brought it home. After watching about half the episodes, I can honestly say this was a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of Joss Wheadon, I never once saw Buffy or Angel, but this show attracted me. The episode he wrote so far seems to have the most clever dialogue. Hey, it's the guy from &quot;Two Guys and a Girl!&quot; Anyway I will go see the movie when it comes out.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3VD6QWB9EOQ0C	Jordan Johnson	"I am a huge fan of the Stargate, Bablyon 5, and Battlestar Galactica Franchises/Series.Needless to say, many of my friends enjoy these shows too, and in our discussions a lot of them often threw in: ""If you like those shows, you're bound to LOVE Firefly as well!"" I took their advice and bought the first season on DVD. That was an awful mistake. (I re-gifted it! haha! shhh!)This show is terrible, and that's putting it nicely! The characters are neither believable nor relate-able, the actors cannot act to save their lives, the plot is boring and predictable, and the whole western-in-space theme falls flat on its face.I rarely, if ever, write reviews on here, but this one positively compelled me to write this. If I can, I'd like to prevent others from buying this series on the word of mouth tradition that so often helps spread Sci-Fi shows. I highly recommend you first watch the pilot online somewhere and get a taste for the show. If you like the pilot, then by all means go ahead and purchase the complete series.However, if I may, I would first recommend you to other, far superior Sci-Fi:1. Stargate: There is a reason the original ran for 10 seasons (SG-1), produced 4 movies (Stargate, The Ark of Truth, Continuum, 4th in the works!), spawned a 5 season spin off (Atlantis), AND is spawning yet ANOTHER spin off (Universe, debuting in Fall 2009): ITS AMAZING! This franchise is a tour de force that you simply cannot miss. It's set in the here-and-now of earth, the characters are fantastic, the plot never tires, and the comedy in it is splendidly refreshing. You simply cannot miss this series. There is simply no way I can stress how good this show is.2. Bablyon 5: The whole first season may seem like garbage, but its absolutely necessary in order to set up the Sci-Fi brilliance of seasons 2, 3, and 4. Season 5 is a bit of a let down, but its still okay. Nevertheless, this franchise has two of the most memorable characters in Sci-Fi history without a doubt (Londo Mollari and G'Kar). The plot is wonderful and the development of many of the shows characters over the course of the show is simply astounding. Next to Stargate, this is hands down a Sci-Fi must have.3. Battlestar Galactica: I'm sure you already know enough about this series to know that it's pretty darn good. It's gritty, sexual, and action-packed. Sometimes though, at least for me, it's too much. You can call shenanigans on me for saying that, but I like my Sci-Fi to remember that it's Sci-Fi, not a soap opera. Don't get me wrong, this is a good show, but it just doesn't have that special ""magic"" the likes of which make Stargate and Babylon 5 so good.I hope this was at least somewhat helpful to any of you considering Firefly. If you are trying to amass the perfect Sci-Fi DVD collection (as I am), stick with the likes of Stargate, Babylon 5, Battlestar, ST:TNG, and ST:DS9 - you simply cannot go wrong with any of them!"	1.0	There are much better shows out there...	2009-01-26	329	35	294

The words coming out of the characters' mouths seem utterly real.  Another reviewer mentioned that any episode of Firefly could easily be expanded into a feature-length movie, and with that I agree. And therefore I'm not as excited about the upcoming ""Serenity"" movie as many others are (though *of course* I will see it, probably multiple times), because it means we'll get, in essense, only one more episode.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A20H2PD09LHAMS	Joseph E. Klauser	So I have come late the the party and just discovered Firefly.I am not into this type of TV usually. Don't like buffy, or Babalyon 5 or shows of that nature. That said I have to admit that in my 31 years I have NEVER found a story, a setting , and a cast that has touched me as this one did. I love both SI-FI and westerns and so this was a dream come true. Like the typical guy I signed on for the action, the gun fights and the girls,(I guess I'm most like Jayne then)but as I watched the show I found myself most enjoying the scenes of simple interaction between the characters. It has the best writing and diologe on TV, hands down. Having just found the series I was crushed when I learned of the shows history and ultimatly it's premature demise. I wish I could say that I was a part of the fan movment to save the show but I was not. I can tell you that even now years later I plan to start sending letters and emails anyway even in the blind hope of a resurection. This show is simpley that good. Thanks to Joss and the cast.	5.0	The good always die young	2008-09-22	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APF02V5CHUDD3	Joseph	"As a proviso: I'm a died in the wool Browncoat. Having said that, anyone familiar with this series will know ahead of time where this review is going.So I'm not going to explore at length why this sci-fi series was one of the best, most engaging, plot driven, character evolved, intriguing, cross genre, series of its type of all time.  Browncoats will already know this and newbies interested enough to take the bait will discover it on their own to their delight as well as consternation that it was prematurely cancelled.  At least a follow up movie, ""Serenity"", was made to tie up the loose ends.Regarding the quality of the new format, Blu-ray, I couldn't be more pleased.  Whedon purposely shot the original in 35mm film and widescreen instead of the usual 4:3 format as demanded by his short sighted overseers at Fox.  Although it was originally broadcast in 4:3 with crucial scenes composed to one side of the screen or the other, Whedon framed scenes in such a way that they could eventually be broadcast in HD.Also, Whedon shot scenes in available light thus lending a certain grittiness to the scene in keeping with the story line.  Therefore, scenes are sometimes dark and ""atmospheric"" by design.  This overall effect isn't lost in HD but enhanced somehow, which sounds contradictory.  The colors are vibrant, details are rich, sound is beyond belief, without distracting from the cinema verite, film noir story itself.I own 5 boxed sets of the Firefly series which I lend out on a regular basis to friends who've never heard of it.  At any given time, they're all lent out at once.  I will not be lending my Blu-ray version out.  It will be our ""master copy"" which we will continually go back to for viewing whenever there's nothing on TV or when we're waiting for our next Netflix movie to arrive.  Firefly and its followup movie ""Serenity"" will be our default ""movies"" for the duration or until a movie studio realizes the potential profits to be made from reviving it.If enough Browncoats weigh in, then maybe we'll get more.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A22T45HIAZH27R	Joseph L. Louthan	"If you cannot appreciate great writing, great stories or great character development, get it for the mere fact that this show does not ignore the laws of physics.  In the episode ""Serenity"", the crew breaks into a cargo hold by removing the lock.  Since they were in space, you did not hear a sound.  How long did it take television and movies to get this right?  Ye gods.  In ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"", the crew has to shoot down a trap in space but with a normal rifle.  Because the slug is still propelled with fire, you need oxygen.  Solution: shoot the rifle from inside a spacesuit.My wife loathes SciFi and she always takes the time to make fun of my interests and yet, she loves Firefly.If you even thinking or not thinking about getting this DVD set, do not dismiss the 450+ positive reviews.  Just save the money, get the set and keep the Kleenex handy because you will cry when you realize that this great show is no more.I am thinking if I get The Family Guy (owned), Firefly (owned), Sports Night (owned), The Shield (want) and The Wire (want) do I really need to watch television ever again?Edit: I notice that some people reference Dark Angel, Buffy and Angel as shows that lead them to Firefly.  I am the complete opposite: I know that Buffy and Angel sucked and I couldnot get over the horrid writing of Dark Angel.

Much to my surprise I enjoyed the movie and later purchased Firefly to watch during my nightly workouts. I will watch just about anything to pass the time on the treadmill.I started the program and found it to be much better than the movie. I started to look forward to the hour on the treadmill, which should tell you just how good the series is.I found the plots and acting to be superb, which in my view is extraordinary for the usual scifi stuff. Morover there was a complete realization of the artistic vision of Joss Whedon andhis co-creators. If you watch the extras, something that I never do, you will see that Mr Whedon knew exactly what he wanted to do and went out and did it.I have never even seen Buffy or heard of Angel but if they are anything like this program I may just have to break down and purchase them---Maybe I will become HIP---let's not rush this.Anyway, go and buy this series, and then tell Fox and or Universal, or whoever owns the rights to put it back on the air.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GRN6J64F2C3X	Joseph P. Menta, Jr.	I'll only say this quickly since it's already been said over and over again in these reviews:  this series has great characters and crackling-good stories and for those reasons alone are worth your time and money.  But I also want to emphasize the fact that these shows have some of the most amazing and ambitious action scenes in recent memory, and that includes comparisons to stuff you pay to see in the movies.  Joss Whedon doesn't settle for clean space battles with a few laser effects.  No, we get dramatic and extended chase scenes in the atmosphere of planets, with the terrain and clouds flying by; characters climbing around on the outside of the ship (again, while the ship is in the atmosphere with the wind whipping our heroes about), and all manner of cityscapes, spaceports, and landing pads.  Details, action, and effects certainly aren't the most important elements of a good science fiction show (great characters and great stories are), but one should be aware that this show delivers the important things AND isn't stingy with the thrills, effects, and &quot;wow&quot; factor.  Buy this now.	5.0	Ready to watch these shows again, and I just finished them.	2004-01-30	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AM8K619L97JWR	Joseph Rodriguez	Firefly is not your typical sci-fi series. Firstly, there are no aliens. It envisions a future where there may in fact be nonhuman life, but we haven't found it yet. Secondly, the world is considerably seamier than the airbrushed idyllic utopias so often seen in science fiction shows. All of the main characters are outcasts of some sort or other - they live on the edge and they're proud of the independence it gives them. Thirdly, it comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, the man behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. As you might expect, that means moral dilemmas, witty snarky dialogue, and a show that's never afraid to get emotionally heavy (as long as, y'know, it's okay to be witty and snarky about it).The titular Firefly is a ship, Serenity, owned by survivor of the war of independence - the losing side - Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). Along with his former subordinate and current first mate Zoe (Gina Torres), he skulks through space trying to avoid the everpresent Alliance. Along the way, he's picked up quite a few fellow misfits: Wash (Alan Tudyk), Zoe's husband and the pilot of Serenity; Jayne (Adam Baldwin), a not-too-bright mercenary with an eye for the main chance; Kaylee (Jewel Staite), the ship's perky mechanic; Book (Ron Glass), a preacher who seems to know an awful lot about guns and the Alliance; and Inara (Morena Baccarin), high-class prostitute and the only vestige of respectability Serenity has.The story begins when two more runaways find their way onboard Serenity: Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau). They're both on the run from the Alliance, who performed nefarious experiments on River that left her insane, but with certain mysterious skills that soon become apparent. With their arrival - and the discovery that there's very little the Alliance won't do to get River back - the story is thrown into motion.The show is top-notch in just about every aspect - character, dialogue, acting, music, special effects - and quite likely should have done well. However, it was broadcast by Fox, which is infamous for boneheaded programming decisions. In Firefly's case, they started with the second episode and ended with the first episode; showed almost every episode in between out of order; constantly pre-empted it and rescheduled it; and were all too ready to can it. Firefly was dead, with a run of 13 glorious episodes...or was it?Sales of this very DVD boxed set showed that there was indeed an audience for Firefly. And as of this writing, Universal Studios has released a feature film continuation called Serenity, written and directed by Whedon, and it has reached #2 at the box office. This may lead to a sequel, or sequels - I certainly hope so - or it may not. But either way, we've had hours of quality writing and acting thanks to Joss Whedon, and I thank him for that.I highly recommend this DVD boxed set to anyone, period.	5.0	A show dead before its time	2005-10-07	14	13	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	I remember when Firefly originally aired on FOX and I remember thinking the idea of a space western sounded stupid and not very interesting. When it was later canceled I was not surprised. When Firefly was later released on DVD I heard nothing but praise for this show and how great it was. I admit my curiosity was peaked but I still was not ready to give it a try. Then I heard rumblings that there was a movie in the works based on the show. That along with many of my friends telling me to buy this was enough for me to give it shot. I watched this whole boxest over the period of two days. I was shocked at how good this show was. And I was also angry with myself for never giving this show a chance back when it originally aired on television. But then I realized that I wasn't the only one and now there are thousands of us who have just now discovered this great show on DVD. This show is unlike anything I have ever seen on television and it works. Also it was one of the first sci-fi programs I had ever seen that remembered that in space there is no sound. So during the battles in space you hear nothing and I love that. I really enjoyed all of the characters and looked forward to each episode and what would happen to them next. Also after the first few episodes I found myself singing along with the theme song and still do every once and awhile. But all good things must come to an end and I was disappointed when I had finished the set knowing that there would be no more episodes. But as I mentioned, there is a film that will be released later this year and I cannot wait. I think anyone who is on the fence about this show should take a chance, as I did, and buy this set. And if you don't want to buy it, rent it or borrow it from a friend and I am sure you will end up buying a copy of your own before long. This show is that good and Joss Whedon has proven he is one of the best.	5.0	Another great show from the mind of Joss Whedon that ended too soon.	2005-09-07	15	13	2

What I can do is comment on Fox's stupidity.Take a series from an accomplished story teller like Joss Whedon (Yes, he did Buffy, but dont forget he was a writer for PIXARs Toy Story as well), air the series out of sequence, bounce its air time around 3 times (hard to do with only 11 aired episodes) and dont air all the episodes.  Then scrub it.  Never mind the fact it got great reviews.  Never mind the fact that it had all the hallmarks of FOX's only other hit series...One of the first things I thought of when I watched this was X-Files.  Its a little show that FOX aired that got little attention its first season, but because of stellar writing and interesting stories it grew into a mega hit through word of mouth.  Firefly has the same (or better) high quality writing and far better characters.It obvious that the folks at FOX just didnt get it.  I think some executive had his mind made up before the first episode hit the air.Well guess what FOX? I will never again watch another of your series its first season no matter how good it sounds.  Im tired of getting hooked on series that they will randomly yank (Dark Angel?  Space, Above and Beyond?) and replace with some other schlock I have no intrest in.	5.0	Bad Network.... Bad.

Because the characters are paper thin...because their dialogue is empty and quickly grating.  Granted, Voyager gave itself some dimension with those profile camera shots of the borg chick, but it's a better show with the volume off.

All of the characters on Serenity turn out to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch. The episodes just got better and better for me as it rocketed towards its premature demise. As everyone's said before, it really is a shame that it didn't get a chance to go any further in this format, because finding out about the true story over the course of several seasons would have been a joy to watch. I just hope somebody like SciFi will pony up and bring it back. If Battlestar can be so good on SciFi, why can't Firefly?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3H90Y7KMIW6C7	Joshua	Firefly, is a diamond in the rough. A hidden gem. The beautiful moon behind the clouds of a stormy night. Once you have discovered this beauty, it will not let you go.Straight up, the characters, and the story of firefly will suck you in. This show is set in a sci-fi future world, but that's not what it's about.  So you sci-fi geeks - come to  Firefly! While at the same time if you are scared about a sci-fi show... don't be. It's about the people and their relationships with each other, and their journey in life, which so happens to be in space on the same ship. You will laugh, you will be on the edge or your seat, you will hurt when they hurt.It takes a REALLY good story that is done REALLY well with REALLY good actors that play REALLY good characters to get me to like a show, but when it does...man it's magic. And that's what Firefly has done. By far - my #1 favorite show now. I will do whatever it takes if it is ever possible, to bring Firefly back.

I have watched the entire series with my girlfriend at least five times, and have watched it without her at least a couple more.  Needless to say I am in love with the perfectly matched cast, directing, and writing.  When prompted in the past, the best concise description I can muster for Firefly is ""cowboys in space"", but it is so much more.  I quickly fell in love with the individual characters.  The reality of living in space is made believable by the show's great writing.  There is a lot of great action and throughout the show maintains levity with very well placed laughs.  If you are a fan of the genre, Whedon's work, or are just curious about all of the highly positive reviews I would highly suggest doing yourself the favor of treating yourself to this set.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	"I am not surprised that this show was quickly canceled.  This is Joss Whedon's space western.  But this show was not cancelled because of bad acting, bad writing, lame episodes, or any of a dozen other common reasons.  The simple fact is this is a nothing show.  It is sort of like having a bunch of expensive, high-class furniture sitting in an empty lot.  In otherwords, quality merchandise with no framework.  I thouroughly enjoyed the acting, the humor, the drama, and the plots but I still could not help noticing that there is no series framework.We have a space ship with a crew and several passengers.  The ship and crew are usually involved in illegal activities and some of the passengers are on the run from the law.  The Captain and first officer were involved in the losing side of a war and one of the law-fleeing passengers was mistreated by the government.  But why do we care about these people?  They are criminals.  There is nothing given to show that the government is bad except for what might have been done to one of the passengers.  We know nothing of the war other than who won (and one episode paints both sides as uncaring although it wasn't aired).  Unlike Joss's Buffy, there is no ""in every generation..."" framework or a ""five year mission"" like in Star Trek.  There is nothing.  I wish there was because the show had great potential and some of the best acting and drama of any series but it was ultimately fine furniture in a vacant lot.  So all we really have are a bunch of stories that happen to use the same characters but there is little to connect them and hold them together.I know my review will not be popular with fans of the show (of which I am now one) but anyone who has seen the series should be able to see the truth in what I say.  If Joss has supplied that one last piece maybe this wonderful show would not have been cancelled so quickly.  There is one advantage to the lack of framework and that is that the show is much more watchable as an unfinished work than other shows cancelled in their first season."	4.0	A Show About Nothing	2007-03-10	10	2	8
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3RLRQX4HX3V2E	"Joshua Krebs ""Pendharker"""	"Absolutely BRILLIANT.  I had heard from my brother, my friends, and coworkers who had all seen the show during its undeservedly short and mangled stint on television that it was phenomenal and incredibly enjoyable.  I took them at their word, but just never watched it.  Time went on and it came out on DVD.  With a passive ""Oh, I'll have to get that some day,"" I brushed it off.  Finally, my good friend told me I NEEDED to watch it.  To convince me of this he showed me the trailer for the film due out September 30th this year (2005).  The trailer alone hooked me and I had to know what was going on.I went out and bought the DVD set (which took MUCH hunting; suddenly they are nowhere to be found) and I watched it... and then I watched it again (showing other people who had never seen it)... and then I watched it all with audio commentary.  I am now an ENTHUSIASTIC Firefly fan.  I only hope and pray that the movie in September will continue to convert others and rekindle interest in the show, thusly opening the door for Joss Whedon to continue and COMPLETE his ingenius vision.And, for the skeptical out there, my wife is ""not into"" Star Wars at all.  But she loves - L-O-V-E-S - Firefly.  Please, rent, borrow, buy, STEAL (well... don't steal, but go ahead with the other options) this set and just give it a chance.  If after watching the Pilot and The Train Job you don't crave to see more (or even think the show is relatively worth while) then you're probably dead or Amish.  You WILL love this show more than you'll ever guess or imagine.  And I'm not even using my Jedi Mind Trick on you either."	5.0	The BEST series you've never seen!!	2005-06-07	12	12	0

When I saw the price for the complete series on DVD was less than $25 on Amazon I knew it was time to check it out.Honestly, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The combination of western and scifi works better than I'd even expected and this show has pulled in both myself and my wife who doesn't know Star Trek from Star Wars.Absolutely worth the purchase, and at the price at Amazon can't be beat!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2X2VGYB5TAPQQ	Joshua R. Look	"I've never been attached to a TV show since I was much, much younger.  I don't even like TV.After watching Firefly, I like TV even less.In November of 2005, I went to see a movie called ""Serenity"" in a nearly abandonned movie theater.  The ceiling was missing in great chunks, the seats were falling apart and there was a total of 7 tickets sold that evening.  But this was the only theater left in the state showing ""Serenity,"" and something told me I HAD to see it.  Not far into the movie, I forgot all about the strange condition the theater was in.  I was hooked.  By the time the movie ended, I was obsessed.So of course, the next logical step was to check out Firefly, the show the movie was based on.  I found the show to be even better than the movie (affectionatly called the ""Big Damn Movie"" by fans).  There isn't a bad episode in the 14 in the series.  Some episodes are better than others, but it all depends on your personal tastes.  Some episodes will have you rolling on the floor with laughter, others will move you to tears.  And you will get no closure.  The only was to describe the way I felt after I finished watching ""Objects In Space,"" the last episode in the collection, was heartbroken.This is without a doubt, the finest television show I've ever watched.  But like I said, I don't watch much TV.  But I do love science fiction, and I can tell you this is of the highest calibur.  The characters are funny, moving, flawed, complicated, and ultimately human.  Joss Whedon has created a realistic vision of the future.  There are no aliens, no hyperspace jumps.  There are lasers, but those are for rich folk.  He's taken space being the final frontier to a more literal meaning by filling it with frontiersman.The production values, for the most part, are very good.  From time to time, there will be something that looks low budget, but these moments are rare.  And the cast...where to begin...just about flawless.  From the first episode, one might think the cast has been working together for many years.  They are the show's greatest strength, with the writing being a close second.I can't stress enough just how good this show was.  I've shown it to pretty much everyone I know, and there hasn't been anyone who hasn't fallen in love with it.  You don't need to be a fan of the science fiction genre to like it.  This is a show about the working class.  The characters strive to just continue.  To keep flyin'.  The going gets rough sometimes, but if they're all together at the end of the day, in the freedom of their ship, it's just enough."	5.0	Might have been the losing side.

My husband loves Firefly and I thought I would give it a shot and watch it and after only 4 episodes I am truly hoping the show gets better and I don't wind up giving up and never seeing it through to the end as it seems a bit tedious at this point.  And yes, I have seen all the episodes of Buffy TVS and Angel and enjoyed them but I can't wait for the show to be over when I watch Firefly.  I dunno what it is ? The dialogue is alright but the Chinese insertions are a bit irritating at times and River seeming to go thru every emotion in a 45 minute episode is a bit much....  Maybe I am jumping the gun or 'ship' after only 4 episodes but I must press on to the end and hopefully it will be worth it.  My husband also has the Serenity movie which I hope is lots better...  So far my favorite characters are Jayne and Wash and Zoe.  Sorry and NO OFFENSE to the MASSIVE adoring fans of this show.  I apologize and will try to press on until the end.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AVZCNV921X5IW	J. Patterson	"Of course it's a given that cancelling this show was an outrage, but what can be expected of thekind of people -- whether corporate bean counters or sponsors -- responsible for deciding whethera series lives or dies. They receive outrageous sums of money, bonuses tied to the bottom line (notto whether what they do is of any value) and live in grotesque mock houses in grotesque developments,totally cut off from humanity. For them there's no good and bad, right and wrong, just performance packages,bonuses, ratings and advertising. For a perfect insight into their mentality, which led to the murder ofFirefly -- episode for episode, Joss Whedon's best so far -- take a look at Aaron Sorkin's brilliant Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.In the show, one of the corporate bigwigs even talks about some great new software he was investing in which analysesthe different components of a show and can tell the user whether a car chase is needed at a certain pointor some female flesh or whatever: any show can be fed into it and come out a ""winner"". Studio 60 itselfwasn't cancelled half way through: far worse, in a case of life imitating art, the corporates highjacked the show and completely transformedit after about 10 episodes, changing it from The West Wing to a caricature of The Waltons, with sentimentality drippingfrom everything in sight like molasses.

I've only seen their reviews here on Amazon) just look at the insane number of 5 star reviews.  And consider the fact that a TV show spawned a major motion picture after it had been cancelled mid-season (Serenity is the movie if you don't know... but watch the series before the movie, that makes it even better.)One tip though (though it sounds odd) if you're a little hard of hearing (I personally have some hearing loss from injury) sometimes you may miss some of the more subtle lines spoken in this show (if, like me, you are hard of hearing, you're used to letting those go)....

If you don't have this series, please go back to watching television unplugged.  It would be more rewarding.Fox ordered a cheese burger and Joss delivered fine dining with the Firefly series.  In the Fox executive's ""make a quick buck"" mentality, the masterpiece that is Firefly was discarded before the rest of Fox's garbage lineup started to smell bad.  If nothing else, this should teach us something about what television broadcasters care about.  Money, right now.  Even though Firefly would have delivered FAR more in the long run than 15 new trash concepts that would sell well for a few airings, Fox execs couldn't see past their own 15 minute, pocketbook.  Thus, this shining jewel was thrown out with the moldy cheese.  Newsflash, not many big business tycoons care, or will ever care about the content of what they air.There has not been anything like this on TV.  It takes somewhat of a time investment to fully appreciate.  I have not met one single person who has not fallen in love with this series after a couple of episodes.  This work is inspired.  Also, Joss has stated that he will NOT continue this series under Fox, even if they came begging and pleading back.  The only way we will ever get this back on the air is if another corporation buys the rights from Fox.  This series is so good that the fans alone are trying to raise the money to do so.  The actors love this show too.  Most, if not all, have stated that they would drop everything to go back to Serenity.If you don't have this, I feel bad for you."	5.0	400 channels and nothing on..

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1AXLULXPNCMIO	J. Riley	Who-ever was responsible for the initial TV advertising for this series totally blew it.  I never even heard about it when it was on TV.Even as a serious fan of all the star trek series, I would say the first few Firefly shows were as good as or better than any of the early star trek shows.  This is a true shoot-em-up western sci-fi with a bit of the campiness of the best of the Dr. Who series.  That's a weird combination, but they do a great job pulling it off. The acting and character development are excellent, and you quickly get drawn into the series.  If you compare it solely on plot and acting (it has limited special effects), it's in the running for the best sci-fi series ever produced.	5.0	Riley Review	2005-01-16	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AZC562U18BK2S	J. R. Trtek	With almost 4000 reviews of Firefly having accumulated over the years, it seems rather silly to post another one, but I'll think of this short reaction piece as a message in a bottle and see where it goes. I had and still have deep affection for this series. Almost everything -- the characters as individuals and their relationships with each other, the writing, the settings, the production -- came together so well, and it is a shame that it that ended before its time. Though I thought there was a little confusion regarding space geography at times and a bit too much string-and-rubber-band artifice about the spacecraft, those were minor quibbles that were forgotten as each engaging episode rolled by. I admit that I dislike the film it spawned, but the television series remains on my list of all-time favorites. If you have happened to find this bottle lying in the sand and read this message, then I recommend you follow my last request: Get Firefly; I doubt that you will be disappointed.	5.0	A Gem that Doesn't Fade	2012-12-09	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A28XOUIK01FTJQ	J. R. Vanderhoef	I've spent the last 20 minutes reading through the 1-star reviews for Firefly on this website.  I was surprised to see so many people upset with the acting and the originality of the show, especially when these same people turned around and admitted to liking Star Wars and Battlestar.Simply put, if you're a science fiction fan, you owe it to yourself to at least try this series, and the feature film based on it.  In a week's time, I watched all 14 series episodes and the movie and am now an official Browncoat (Firefly fan) for life.The characters are all memorable and more importantly, likable.  Captain Malcolm Reynolds is an ex-Sergeant, who was on the losing end of a galactic civil war, and current captain of the smuggler ship Serenity.  His crew consists of a witty, but weak, pilot, a fun-loving mechanic, a mysterious Shepard, a fowl-mouthed muscle, a dedicated first-mate, and a brother and sister running from the Alliance (think Empire).The basic structure of each show has the crew of the Serenity traveling around the galaxy from planet to planet, job to job, bad situation after bad situation.  It does borrow heavily from established Sci-Fi genre conventions, but it also adds its own twists to the formula, and every episode has several surprise moments that will make you smile or laugh out loud.  Joss Whedon creates an engaging universe complete with quirky characters, and he successfully combines Sci-Fi and Western genres.To address the complaints I began this review with I have to admit the acting never really bothered me.  If you pay close attention it becomes obvious these were young actors who were still learning and proving themselves.  By the time Serenity came out I thought the acting was far superior to anything Star Wars ever produced.  Also, to call this show unoriginal and still admit to loving Battlestar, a show that is about robots vs. humans in a dystopian future, is a little absurd to me.  Everybody has their preferences, but most of the negative reviews here seem to be a direct assault on the fans of Firefly, not the show itself.	5.0	Becoming a Browncoat	2010-03-14	3	3	0

The character development is awesome, and no character is ONE thing, each has back stories and personalities that are not derived from one action or event.The stories are great, the mix of action, drama, humor and suspense, are wonderful. So we are rewarded from FOX with ...not even a full season.....Thanks FOX, once again you screwed us all.It seems like I find these shows too late, I came into Farscape after cancellation, and the same with Firefly, the thing is I barely knew either were ever on, and I watch a bunch of TV, I have to blame marketing for both....if you do not let people know what is on, your channels how are people supposed to tune it to watch?	5.0	I keep being let down!!!	2009-02-14	3	3	0

The characters are complex, layered and are slowly revealed as the story unfolds. Refreshingly dark and innovative perspective from an underdog point of view - had Fox continued the series I suspect that it may have faired as well as the new Battle Star Galactica. Unfortunately, management saw fit to attempt to direct the plot far too much ""trying to cheer it up"". Lots of potential for increasing depth of characters and plot twists and lots of fun moments that reflect what we all have thought at one time or another when trapped in a challenging situation. Still worth the rent and if you like SyFy it's a fun ride."	5.0	Great Series!	2009-12-27	18	17	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1IWKNSUI20JVC	"J. Stear ""BlueDevil98"""	"So you're a network executive at Fox.  You've got your hands on Joss Whedon, a man whose first 2 series spawned a large and fiercely loyal fanbase (not to mention bouying an entire network through it's infancy).  He's making a show for you that screams ""cult hit with crossover potential.""  What do you do?In the unfortunate world that we are stuck in, you hide this show in your Friday night line-up, against JAG (which pretty well wrapped up the sitting at home at 8 on a friday night demographic), and give it a whopping 6 or 7 episode run before you cancel it.  They could offer up the excuse that it was too expensive to produce, but that just highlights the fact that they weren't even watching the show.  (The show is visually stunning at times, and every dollar spent on production cost is justified by the outcome).Sorry to rant, but Fox blew it on this one.  Taking into account the current landscape of network television (which I refer to as ""all reality crap, all the time"") Firefly could be running strong as the best written/produced/acted show on TV.  All it would have taken from Fox was a little faith, a little time, and a little more advertising push.  This show had the potential to completely raise the bar for network programming.I can't praise this show any better than any of the reviews posted here.  For my money, it's the best show to grace TV in the last few years.  Get your hands on this collection.  Buy it, Netflix it, however you like, and then watch all 14 episodes.  Then try to think of the last time television, basic cable, a movie, or anything else felt that solid, and left that much of an impression on you.  Finally, think about this.  Fans of Joss Whedon know that it takes a season or two for him to fully develop his characters and get everything moving in stride.  Think how great this show could have been if Fox had had a little more faith.As for me, I can't wait for the movie."	5.0	Fox - The blind leading whoever will watch	2004-09-07	9	9	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQOC98L1194KG	J Trance	Shiny.There is no way to say how glad I was when I saw the first episode of Firefly that there would be more.  Never have I anticipated each episode of a show like I did with this one.  The cast has perfect chemistry, and the writing is smart and funny.  Half of the joy of watching came from the excellent twofold or even threefold plotlines which ran through almost every episode.  The other half came from the all-too-human interaction between the crew members.One of the greatest things about this show is its realism.  It doesnt ask you to believe in alien races or strange multi-dementional space phenomena, it just asks you to believe that life would be harder the farther you get from the Central Planets, and you might have to take a dirty job or two to stay alive.The death of this show first sent me into a rage, then into depression, as I realized that the TV execs were completely out of their gourd, and did not have faith in truly excellent TV when some idiot with a Nielsons card decides to watch Jerry Springer instead, or if...heaven forbid...someone might want to do something other than watch TV at 7:30 on Friday night.Since it was cut, I have been awaiting this box set, and praying that FOX would have enough sense to release it.

I never liked space TV shows, and from the way the show did in the ratings I guess a lot of people felt the same way. Boy do I wish we can all go back and watch what might have been the best show on TV at the time, FIREFLY. I could have gone the rest of my life never knowing what the show was about and never giving it the time of day, but I'm a huge movie fan and when I heard they were making a movie called Serenity, a feature lenght movie of Firefly I was surprised.Why would a studio green light a movie of a show that had been cancelled. I soon found out that the show had developed a huge cult following and that it was more of a Sci-Fi/Western then just a cheap Star Trek or Star Wars knock off. The DVD series was released and every single review I read online was great. To this day I have yet to read a bad review. I became very interested in this so I went out to purchase the series on DVD not to long ago. It has been one of the best choices I have ever made. The show just rocks. Great writing and a great cast of vertually unknowns unless you really know your TV history.These 14 episodes, 3 of which never aired are really not close to enough once you start watching. I don't care who you are as soon as your done watching the 2 part pilot, entitled Serenity you'll be hooked. I suggest if your a serious lover of great TV shows to go out and purchase this set and prepare yourself for September when the movie is set to be released. If the movie does well the studio already has there minds set on 2 follow up films. All of you out there that would love to see the crew of Serenity continue on go and tell your friends to not only buy one of the greatest TV shows on DVD but to get there money ready for the film.	5.0	One of the best	2005-01-16	4	4	0

I couldn't watch all the episodes, so I bought the whole intire series and I love it!!! The series was way beyone it's time and should not have ever left! Joss Whedon, has a great imagination. I am so sadden to have seen it come and go so quickly. This series should have stayed on for years to come. It was just getting started to where it needed to be and BOOM! Just like that it was gone!I loved each of the characters played in this series. I did get to see Jewel Stait in The Stargate Atlantis Series as the new doctor. I watched that series from begining to the end. She is a great actress as all of them were. I'm sorry to have just caught this series way too late.	5.0	Review of the series Firefly	2012-07-04	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQV7N4Q522IGP	Jules	I had friends who were rampant Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans, but it didn't seem to be my kind of thing. Maybe it wasn't. But because I didn't pay any attention to Joss Whedon's Buffy, I never even heard of his little show called Firefly before it was abruptly canceled by the faithless Fox network. I have atoned for my sins by spreading the gospel of Firefly as far and as wide as I can. My horizons have truly been expanded since I became acquainted with the Firefly universe.The show is brilliantly crafted; the dialogue tears at your heart one second and evokes a belly laugh the next, the intricate details of set and lighting and camera work unite the artistry of many masters under the cohesive vision of a genius. Joss Whedon is that genius and the cast and crew are the lucky (and incredibly talented) artists that make the show an addictive masterpiece. I don't just recommend this show, I IMPLORE you to watch it and share it with anyone and everyone that seems the tiniest bit likely to enjoy it. You'll be a Big D*mn Hero, in my book.	5.0	Hopelessly devoted to Joss Whedon	2007-01-18	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AURX8DZMY9X5A	Jule W. Felton III	I'm sad to admit I'm one of the folks that saw Firefly, became somewhat confused, and largely stopped watching. I gave it a second chance on DVD, and found it all made sense (and was incredibly entertaining).Because Fox did not show the pilot until the end, the first episode that aired tried to establish 9 different characters, and it was just too much to take in. (Fox also refused to air the show in widescreen as the creators intended).  Then Fox aired the episodes out of order.  To make it harder for the viewer, the show presents a completely new universe that fails to follow many Sci-Fi conventions, and it may seem strange that people still ride horses on some recently terraformed planets and the characters often curse in chinese (But check out the Alliance flag, its a combo of the American and Chinese flags--something not pointed out by the characters on the show, its just there to be figured out.)  Fox just made it impossible for the series to be understood by refusing to present it the way it was meant to be shown.The DVD set has everything in order, 3 missing eps, and some amazing commentaries.  Unfortunately, now that I know how good the show was I am sorry that it was cancelled.  Its a great DVD set though, and I recommend it for anyone that likes Joss Whedon's work (Buffy and Angel) or that appreciates science fiction, or just likes to be entertained with something other than &quot;reality&quot; TV.	5.0	Perfect for DVD (Maybe not perfect for Fox TV)	2004-06-15	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2W6I3LAM3JK8Z	Julie Eschliman	Pre-ordering this DVD set, for me, was a no-brainer.  I had seen all of the aired episodes and enjoyed them, then managed to completely fall in love with the characters when the pilot was finally aired (after the show had already been cancelled, which was both depressing and infuriating).  I counted down the days until my DVD's arrived, then began watching them at the first opportunity.My 18-year old nephew, who is staying with me, wandered into the room while I was watching an episode.  He must have seen something he liked, because he asked if he could take the first disc into his room to watch on his PS2.  Two hours later he was back, looking concerned.  Apparently he had noticed the air dates printed next to each episode description on the case, and was confused about what order he was supposed to watch them in.  I assured him that he should continue to watch them in the order they came on the DVD, because that's how their creator intended them to be seen, and FOX executives are apparently morons.Nobody in the family saw much of the boy over the next two days, as he only came out of his room to eat and to borrow more Firefly discs (cheerfully describing the show as &quot;my new obsession&quot;).  I was so thrilled to see that he was enjoying this fantastic show as much as I was!Then came the guilty moment, when my poor nephew showed up at the dinner table looking completely stricken.  &quot;That CAN'T be how it ends!!!&quot;  he moaned.  &quot;Are you sure that's the whole series?&quot;  I had forgotten to warn him that the show was prematurely canceled before the story arcs could reach their conclusions.  We had a great discussion about the show during dinner, and I consoled him by telling him Joss Whedon had vowed to try to continue &quot;Firefly&quot; in SOME venue, possibly a movie.It was my nephew who got on the Internet that night and found out that Joss has, indeed, written a script for a &quot;Firefly&quot; movie, and there is a good chance of a movie being made, as long as more executives don't screw up the whole deal again.  In the meantime, we have the DVD's to watch over and over and over again.Please buy this DVD!  Do it for your own intense enjoyment, and increase the chance of the movie getting made.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A127LCW9ZP3SP9	Julie G.	I am a Joss Whedon fan with Buffy and Angel but did not watch Firefly when it first aired on television.  When it was released on DVD I wondered if it would be worth watching, so I checked out the Amazon reviews.  With this many people writing reviews and the average was 5 out of 5 stars, I decided to buy it.  I'm so glad I did because it opened up a new world for me.  The DVD set definitely lives up to it's hype.  The only down side is that since it was cancelled, it leaves you wanting more!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A32AK8FOAZEPE2	"JustAReader ""NoNeed2Comment"""	i just don't know why all the screenplay writers who wrote for the sci-fi movies could never and ever get out of the stereotyped and cliched scenarios and plots originated from the first one. the firefly series, like any other sci-fi movies, mixed the future with the past by describing many planets were still in earth's 18th or 19th centuries, and mostly still in america's wild, wild west era. the other ridiculous part was mixed some chinese culture influences in this series, dialogs and settings were littered with many vague chinese. firefly, the space ship and its smuggling crew were copied from han solo's smuggling career in star wars, settings were refurbished from some other sci-fi movies such as the blade runner, the wild wild west, and star trek, they were so obvious if you still could remember those movies' scenes and scenarios.i've watched a total of 4 dvds, but the sequential arrangement of this released series was in random. i often realized that if i could have known in advance, i should not have followed their volume 1 to volume 4 arrangement. the dvds simply forced me to re-introduce those characters' personal histories one by one, again and again.i also realized that after the volume 2, it had become a bit tiresome to watch.the other thing i couldn't understand was how there would be a whore in the crew and the firefly, besides smugglings, would have to do escort and limo services for her again and again?to me, it's just a mediocre okay sci-fi series but not great at all. of course, if compare to 'battlestar galactica(?)', this firefly might be a greater one. because within 10 minutes, i've abandoned that battleship.	4.0	it's okay but not great at all	2006-12-31	10	0	10

I saw this through renting and then buying the firefly series on a blind buy. What I don't understand is how something this good got made in the first place. I can see how Fox missed the boat and now must be kicking themselves.  With the sets built, characters established  and a serious fan base in place why would they not bring it back.  What a media story that would be.  It's gotta be better and more stable than their newest fare.	5.0	Simply Doesn't Get  Any Better	2006-01-02	8	7	1

Not a lot in the way of special effects (no hokey alien monsters or light sabers), but the space-chase effects in ""Serenity"" are mind-blowing.  Relying mainly on terrific characters, stories and dialogue, this DVD set is one I definitely recommend!  The one sour note is the rather hammy acting of Adam Baldwin, who probably should stick to the ""B"" movies for which he's better known.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2JVQ37VU0MWCR	Justin Haefele	Firefly tells the story of a crew of nine very different people who come from very different lifestyles and have very different (and sometimes conflicting) goals and ambitions, following them on their journey through space aboard the firefly class ship Serenity.  Action sometimes takes the backseat behind creator Joss Whedon's unmistakable sense of humor, but every episode has a good mix of both.  The best part about this show, which only ran for one season due to low ratings when it first aired, is without a doubt the interaction of the unique cast of characters: the formerly rich and sarcastic doctor clashing with the short-tempered tough guy; the ship pilot with a soft and sometimes child-like personality bantering with his tough-as-nails war-veteran wife.  The contrasting personalities of these characters more often than not make for absolutely hilarious exchanges, especially during intense moments of disagreement.I could not more strongly recommend this show--not to just sci-fi fans, but to everyone.	5.0	Hilarious, Sad, Action-Packed: Joss Whedon's Masterpiece	2012-05-15	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A26X2TG93OTXVU	Justin Heath	"The world is divided into people who get Firefly and people who don't. In this series Joss Whedon created one of the most realistic post-war visions of the future ever committed to tape, that at the same time spoke about yesterday and today. Maybe a little too much today for its own good.The series is anti-corporate, anti-government and, while it takes the stand that some things are worth fighting for, it is largely anti-war. No wonder FOX did everything in its power to kill it off, including airing episodes out of order, skipping weeks after airing only three eps and, inevitably canceling the show without even airing episodes 12, 13 and 14 (out of 15). This was particularly damaging, as Firefly had a greater sense of ongoing plot than any other Whedon series in its first year. Viewers were left wondering, on more than one occasion, when a character would reference something we hadn't seen yet.The backstage dramatics aside, Firefly is intelligent and, like Buffy, mythic - except this time Whedon is dealing with the myth of America: the Frontier, the Civil War, the rise of the Corporation, etc . . .Firefly is a demanding show. It asks its audience to appreciate the shades of Grey in its characters' moral scale. The villains are not comfortingly dressed as an alien race. In 500 years mankind will still be its own worst enemy. Technology will be in the hands of a privileged few, and others will in ""The Black"" - Whedon's frontier third world - where it is possible to exist without the interference (or benefit) of civilization and government. Things will be dirty, and used. Firefly creates a universe that almost totally opposes that of (that bastion of television sci-fi) Star Trek: its Federation-like central power (the Alliance) is interpreted as being oppressive and dystopic. We are on the side of those who resisted (like the Maqui) and lost.The acting is strong, the writing as excellent, funny and moving as on any Whedon show, and the effects and sets create a consistent, believable world. It is a shame the series didn't have a more hospitable environment in which to grow and become all it could have been."	5.0	Beautifully Crafted and Enjoyable Series	2008-10-10	32	30	2

It's a shame it got canned so quickly, but I can't help the thought that perhaps it's good it didn't last long enough to turn into a soap opera.Joss Whedon has set a new standard that Star Trek and Star Wars can never hope to regain.	5.0	The single greatest tv series in history?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	"I was so set to give this five stars.  I was really enjoying the show, the characters (The sole exception being the character of River Tam, who got incredibly annoying with the ""craziness.""  I know the show was canceled before they could fully explain what her problem was, but that was dragged out for far too long.) and the world Joss Whedon created.  I am a big Whedon fan so it was no surprise that the show would be good but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS good.Then along came the last episode, ""Objects in Space"" and it killed a lot of the joy I had built up for the show.  I am dumbfounded by that episode, which features a black male character threatening two white female characters with rape and sexual torture.  The whole thing harkened back to the days decades ago when every black man was seen as a potential sexual threat to white women.  The script was written in such a way and his lines were given in such a way that there could be no escaping this racist subtext.  I felt like I had turned off ""Firefly"" and somehow started watching ""Birth of a Nation.""  It was totally baffling how that got A) written, B) filmed and C) aired.  Aside from that, the episode's plot was preposterous, the pacing lethargic and the entire thing awful, awful, awful.The other awful things about this show are the theme song (hands down the worst I've heard for any show) and the DVD menus, which are totally primeval.  There are no extras menus and if you want to access the commentaries, you must do so via the ""language"" option on each individual episode screen.  There are more special features on the fourth disc, but they're sparse and underwhelming.  Mostly everyone just cries about how the show was canceled.However, if you skip the last episode and try to overlook the other downsides, you'll likely enjoy this show.  It's innovative, it's well-written and it has all the hallmarks of a Joss Whedon universe.  I am still eager to see the movie."	3.0	The last episode killed it.	2005-12-15	65	8	57

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2D3L9CJZCN7UY	"Kansas_Jones ""He's Dead Jim"""	"Over two thousand reviews? I'm still going to put my two cents worth into the mix about my Big Damn Heroes.We all pretty much know the back story, but I'll keep it quick for any new fans who might be perusing this review area: Firefly was a short-lived science fiction TV series that got knocked out of the box way before it's time. In the aftermath, a legion of loyal fans (that's Browncoats to you civilians, and smile when you say it partner) rose up to the challenge to keep the series alive.This DVD collects the 14 episodes that comprised the TV Series.**general spoilers**Firefly, at it's core entertainment value, follows the adventures of a rag tag crew of mercenary adventurers under the command of Captain Mal Reynolds, a former sergeant in the Independents.Some years back, a civil war erupted between the Alliance, who wanted to incorporate all the planetary colonies under one flag, and the Independents, folks along the outer colony planets who weren't very happy with that option. The short version is, the Independents lost.Zoom forward a few years, and you have displaced former soldiers such as Mal and his former squad mate and now First Mate, Zoe, who are now seeking out a means of survival.The code is simple: Find a crew, find a job, keep flying.Along the way, Mal and Zoe gather a rather interesting sort of crew:Hoban ""Wash""  Washburn, the slightly off kilter ace pilot. Married to Zoe, the couple embodies the whole opposites attract thing.Jayne Cobb, a mercenary for hire who'd just as soon shoot you in the leg in exchange for some moola, yet has *some* good in him and that thick head of his.Kaylee Frye: Sweetheart of the universe, and a dang fine mechanic that can coax the firefly class bucket that they all zoom around in to keep on flying.The above characters were already on board at the start of the series. The Firefly series proper actually picks up at the point in time where Reynolds takes on three passengers: Doctor Simon Tam, Shepherd Booke, and River Tam, Simon's slightly mentally impaired sister.Tam is a deposed doctor who is on the run with his sister. Booke is a preacher by trade, but not much is known about his past. River is...eccentric. Yet, Reynolds needs paying fares (and he'd never admit it, but a good heart) and takes on the passengers.The Alliance is ever present, and the commanders of the organization continue to govern. Another threat out in the Black of space is the Reavers - men now gone deformed, sick with rage, and cannibalistic that prey on travelers.I love the Firefly concept: A space western, with some American Civil War overtones and Asian language and design thrown in for good measure; you have this crew that zips around in a Firefly class ""jack of all trades"" science fiction transport ship called Serenity (named after the decisive and heartbreaking final battle that saw the end to the war), yet Mal walks around wearing a six gun holstered low on his hip, a long brown duster coat (from his sergeant days, and where the ""Browncoat"" moniker comes from, describing the men and women who fought against the Alliance), and occasionally spouting off in Asian-type slang.The series is a gritty look at science fiction. No aliens here, everyone is human. The ports that Serenity pulls into can range from buzzing metro to down and dirty frontier planets. My personal favorites (though all of the installments are good) of the episodes are Ariel and Out of Gas. There is no such thing as an easy way to live, and the crew takes on what jobs they can to survive even if the job is illegal, borderline illegal, on the level, or somewhere in between all of that.The DVD collection is comprised of 14 episodes. If you like good science fiction, a good western, and some space adventure bolstered by an ensemble cast - do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of the DVD so you can check out a cancelled TV show that deserved so much better.Can't stop the signal......"	5.0	Best Dang Heroes	2010-06-07	4	4	0

If you are highly intelligent you will not like this mess of a production. The sound track is ridiculous, the dialogue is lame, and the fight scenes are amateur hour intense. I viewed all the great reviews and was misled. If you haven't had an original idea in years you may find some comfort, but basically I would stay away if you really thirst for something new and intense, something well written, which this is not. All the small town barn dances or country whatevers almost drove me mad with boredom. If I wanted a western with dancing I would have rented something from the 1950's. This is somewhere below science fiction, somewhere way below. A total waste of money unless you are simple minded or have a red stain on your neck.	1.0	FOR THE SIMPLE MINDED	2009-06-15	195	14	181

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZJJWF69R31ZL	"Kate Fredericks ""Kate"""	I have been meaning to write a review of Firefly for a long time. To this day, I regret losing this wonderful series in it's infancy. I was one of those people who didn't watch it when it was on, but found it a couple of years later.This true gem, with it's eclectic cast of talented people brought to us by Joss Whedon, as noted by the thousands who have reviewed it here, and reviewed it recently, has probably become the standard for almost perfect sci fi. Nathan Fillion, now known as Richard Castle, will never eclipse his role as Mal Reynolds, captain of his spit and duct taped spaceship, Serenity. The rest of the crew already named here probably a thousand times, can thank Firefly for their still huge popularity and success today. Those of us who love Firefly do so with great passion and loyalty.What exactly defines the wonderful series as what has become not just a cult series, but also simply a fan favorite is the magic this cast (and crew) weaved in each episode. It was far ahead of its time with stories so varied, smart and many times very funny, they can be watched again and again and one never tires of it. I still find it hard to believe this series was cancelled after only 13 episodes and the movie, Serenity, did not wow the box office as it should have. That is on we, the people, for not showing up and supporting it when it was needed the most.As for should you, the few people who have not seen it yet, should you get it and watch it? A resounding yes! I'm sure it's not for everyone, but if you like smart, sweet, excellent entertainment, it doesn't hurt to give it a chance. While the series 13 episodes are stand alone and the movie, Serenity, does tie it up, I suspect you will join the ranks of the rest of us who wish the network had made a bolder decision and stuck with it. Like NCIS today, which began around the time Firefly was on, it would have built its audience and those of us who miss it dearly would have many more episodes to watch over and over again. I join the many voices here and tell you to buy this wonderful, once in a lifetime series, and envy you that you get to watch it for the first time.

I was, after all, a religious 'Buffy the Vampire-Slayer' watcher.  All of the characters are good (even Jayne Cobb, admttedly my least-favorite character [sorry, Adam Baldwin]).  So, I bought the DVD and watched the shows, especially the ones I missed.  I enjoyed every one.The, to my surprise (and horror), the show was cancelled.  It is sad to see that FOX is as stupid as all the other networks.  My guess is, Joss Whedon pushed the movie 'Serenity' (by the way, excellent movie) through primarily to show FOX what a stupid mistake they made by cancelling 'Firefly'.  Also, I suspect that 'Serenity' comprises what should have been the end of either the first or second season.Back to my review.  Excellent DVD.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2VRD3XPNS8J2B	Kathryn Joy	I would give this series 5 stars, except that it is not family friendly. A couple of the episodes I would think the kiddos could see, but the rest of it is too scandalous and considered off limits to kids in our home. Most of the story is too intense for young children, and then there is way too much sexual stuff throughout the rest of it.The story is about a group of misfits, buccaneers in space, that are doing all they can to keep food on the table and their ship in the sky. Things go from rough to worse though when they help a mentally traumatized girl and her brother who are wanted by the government.This series is really fun and unique in that it is basically cowboys in space. But when you have cowboys, you also have.... ahem... &#34;companions&#34; (aka, whores). Most of the sensuality is really not out of context and is something that adults can understand and respect, but it is also one of those things that you just don't want kids to see.There are no aliens, but there are &#34;monsters&#34; - mutilated madmen that the characters occasionally encounter, but overall try to avoid. There is also the traumatized and mentally disturbed young girl throughout the series that really puts a lot of heavy gravity on the otherwise lighthearted crew.If you want a fun Sci/Fi series where the characters are believable, the adventures are a lot of fun, the story is unique and original... if you want a new Sci/Fi series that you can totally nerd out on = THIS is the series.Just a warning though: if you get this series, get the movie too! The movie is called &#34;Serenity&#34;. You WILL need the movie by the end of the series. I promise.I LOVE THIS SERIES!	4.0	I LOVE this series	2014-03-12	4	1	3

Most of everyone has said this is great, so I had to purchase the DVD to see for myself... and saw it all in one sitting, which I have never done for any other show.  How could this show have been cancelled?!?  I want more of the series!  One reviewer compared this show to the crew of the Betty on Alien Resurrection.  You know, that's what I thought... but my thought was that it reminded me of the first crew from Alien.  And that's not a bad thing!  It's good, it's really good.  I would have liked to know more about the Alien crew except that wasn't the point of Alien (where the crew existed to get killed off).  Firefly also reminds me of the Miles Vorkosigan book series by Lois McMaster Bujold... Space Opera at it's finest.  Humor, clever, soap, lots of action.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2TJDPN85SC2Y8	Katie Mayo	I was so disappointed when Firefly was cancelled and absolutely overjoyed when I learned they were releasing the entire series on DVD, including 3 episodes I had never seen. I bought the box set just a few days ago and have already watched all 14 episodes. This series has everything- an interesting plot, fascinating three dimensional characters and a fantastic setting. Fox made a big mistake when they cancelled it. I don't know why they didn't give it a better chance to succeed. It was mishandled from the very beginning- I won't go into the details, but Fox basically shot themselves in the foot here.Anyway, I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys character development, humor, drama, romance, action, adventure, etc.There's only one downside-after watching all the episodes offered, you're left wanting more. Each character has a mystery in their past and none are solved in this box set-which is maddening, I admit. But what's there is so good, it's worth the aggravation of being left hanging. AND I've heard distant rumors that a Firefly movie may be in the works!	5.0	Wonderful show, good DVD	2003-12-16	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A329TKLWCTZVSZ	"Katrina Neumann ""Manatree"""	I fell in love with Firefly as soon as I watched the first episode aired on FOX.  It didn't matter that it wasn't the pilot, and that they continued to air all of the episodes that they showed in whatever order they felt like, it didn't matter that the show combined Sci-Fi with Westerns, both of which I don't particularly tend to enjoy.  There was something about how the characters interacted with each other, about the family that they formed, that was breathtaking--and addicting.  I watched every episode FOX showed, and then I began saving up money for the DVDs.  I bought them a few months ago, and watch them all the time.  The dialogue and plots of the episodes lend themselves to rewatching, as I often catch things that I missed in earlier viewings, and the extras on the DVDs are spectacular, especially the commentaries.  Now, I'm simply trying to wait until the movie for more of these characters, these stories, this family.	5.0	Can't Wait for More!	2004-04-09	4	3	1

My brother gave me this DVD set for Christmas and said &quot;You must see this&quot;.  One slow night I watched the first show and was hooked.  Two big pluses for me:  strong women in non-stereotypical roles (second-in-command and engineer) and very witty dialog.  One warning - this is an adult show, probably a PG-13 at least, for adult situation and some violence.	5.0	Amazing!	2004-02-18	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A29CEEYBL7LWA2	Kay	I caught the first few episodes of Firefly when it was on TV, and while I enjoyed it, I didn't love it, in part because I am not a big Sci-fi or Western fan.  The premiere seemed so abrupt especially for the size of the cast that had to be introduced.  However, due to all of the excellent reviews, I decided to give Firefly a 2nd chance and bought the DVD. I quickly realized that the problem was that Fox is filled with a bunch of morons who tried to screw the series from the get go.  On TV, Fox played the 2nd episode first and played the series premiere last.  Smart Huh?  Fox then proceeded to show many of the other episodes completely out of order.  Once I got to watch the series in order, and could follow the character and plot developements, I absolutely loved the series.  Great writing, complex characters who you feel like you are just getting to know, and plenty of intrigue all make this series one of the best things to ever come to the small screen.  So even if you saw one or two of the episodes on TV, and wasn't impressed, I would suggest giving this series another try, it will blow you away.	5.0	Give it a try, even if you didn't love it when it was on TV	2005-01-24	9	9	0

Amazing show by Joss Wheaton! I hate that it was canceled mid-season. To the reviewers who stated the &#34;show/theme sucked&#34;, &#34;acting sucked&#34;: Every first season show starts off with shakey acting, but it gets better.

It follows the adventures of captain Malcom Reynolds and those he chooses or allows for his crew on the ship Serenity.  Their varying roles and personalities intermix (and often collide) during their various ""jobs"" to create a wonderful series.Some of the background and details within the show and of the characters seem to be elusive and the series doesn't have a proper conclusion either.  Many were sad to see the series end, because of this and because it was such an enjoyable show to watch!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A15UYL50LZY8Q1	Kaze	First of all i'm not one to write reviews but i feel compelled to do so on account of the quality of this particular show.I only caught the last half of one episode when the show actually aired and i thought it seemed very cool but had no idea what it was. Later my fiancee kept bugging me to buy it saying it was one of the best shows ever. I gave in, partially because i was a fan of Buffy and Angel. Honestly though i didn't know how well his writing would hold up in a sci fi series.The beginning of the first episode seemed decent, a small bit of very cheesy dialogue had me a bit worried but by the end of the pilot i was hooked and as i watched more and more episodes it just kept getting better. There honestly was not even one episode that i didn't enjoy. So why did i enjoy it?It isn't quite like other sci fi space shows. There are no aliens, not everyone has access to incredible technology, not every ship looks all pristine and new and they don't generally rely on a talking computer to solve their problems.In my opinion it is more realistic than most sci fi shows. For one thing there is no sound in space. People have left earth that was and terraformed worlds in another solar system more abundant in habitable planets and resources. Also the Alliance(controlling government) has control of most of the more advanced technology and the further away from the central core planets they control the more people have to make do with whatever they can scrape together. See not everyone wanted to live under alliance rule and so a civil war started. The Alliance eventually won the war against the Independants so those that still weren't willing to live under the Alliance went on to populate the outer planets. In my opinion this is a more realistic view of the future than many sci fi space shows present. So that's the backstory more or less but what is the show about?The show follows the crew of Serenity. A small transport ship. The captain was one of the Independants in the war. He got the ship and put together a crew so he could keep out of reach of the Alliance and maintain some freedom. They take whatever jobs they can find (mostly less than legal) to keep their ship flying and stay out of the Alliance's reach. The show is very well written and the characters are very believable and easy to relate to. Every character has depth to them. I really can't stress enough how well written this show is. I very highly suggest you at least rent the first disc and check it out even if you don't normally like sci fi as it is very different from most sci fi shows.For those that aren't aware, in September this show is coming to theaters in movie form. I was fortunate enough to have gotten a ticket to an advanced screening. I absolutely love the movie but i will not comment on it further as this is about the series and not the movie and also it's a bit too soon after i've seen it. I prefer to wait untill the initial excitement of seeing it has died down before i say anything.	5.0	My feelings about this show.	2005-05-28	12	12	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHQBXGFFMBBC9	kazper	Several years after this aired, I finally got around to watching the series on Netflix. I'll be totally honest, I made two attempts at this series.Attempt 1- Watched the first 5 minutes of episode 1. It reminded me too much of terminator and didn't seem like a show I could watch. I stopped the episode and moved on to something else.Attempt 2 (several months later)- I'm not sure what possessed me to try again, but I gave it another shot. After making it through the rough scenes of the first episode, I emerged on the other side and didn't look back. It has the Shadowrun (Sega Genesis) type plot line that I really enjoy. The characters are quirky, the story lines interesting, and I couldn't wait to tag along for the next adventure of the Serenity.The final episode seemed out of place with the others, but maybe they knew things were being shut down and decided to try and wrap things up differently.My only real complaint with the show is the opening song. The guitar is fine, but the lyrics are extremely basic. They definitely should have devoted more time to it than (I hope) they did.A great, short lived series that was cancelled way too soon. Maybe some time they will bring this gem back, but I won't hold my breath waiting for that to happen.	5.0	Oh the inhumanity!	2012-12-07	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ATG6HHXCV9YLY	"K. Binder ""BookInhaler"""	The cancellation of this show to this day baffles its devotees!  Joss Whedon at his finest with a great ensemble of actors weaving in drama and romance and adventure that surpasses Star Trek in my opinion and does so while fulfilling the niche of a space cowboy movie as nothing before or since.  Imagine a world in which Han Solo would be at home rather than an aberration in a movie series that was certainly fun (Star Wars) but full of stereotypical characters and plot development.  FIrefly revels in stereotypes, it loves them and leverages them to comedic advantage while causing the audience to find themselves living in the FIrefly world and loving it!  Nathan Fillion has no doubt brought in tons of green playing the lead in Castle, a series where references to Firefly are injected.  In a tribute to Firefly, Adam Baldwin makes a cameo in Castle in which HE is the guy who pushes Nathan Fillion around in a kind of role reversal.  Gina Torres has a great gig with Suits.  But no matter what roles the main characters are playing now, I believe they would all still come back to make a season two of Firefly.  The cast, the creator and the fans are holding out faint hope to this day!	5.0	Here is the great space cowboy series you likely never knew existed!

Brown	"I never watched the series and was actually pretty oblivious to it, but it's pretty popular in ""geek"" culture and since I run in those circles, I got interested in watching the movie ""Serenity"", which was a sequel to the TV series. I figured I'd bone up on the back story and such by watching an episode or two from some online sources. After watching the first, I was hooked and just decided to purchase the whole DVD set. I haven't been disappointed. While it's kind of cheesy at times, I think that's part of the charm. The characters are fun, their interaction interesting, and the stories are engrossing.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A876OABRN3KEX	K. Cooper	I'm reading through the other reviews ... especially the 1 star reviews and I think it's very funny that most of them are sci-fi fans and the things they say they don't like about Firefly.Like they love Star Trek and then they gripe about how Firefly is so unrealistic.  Because finding bipedal, English-speaking aliens on planets that all have the proper atmospheric conditions for humans is extremely realistic.  Or they like Battlestar Gallactica but complain that Firefly is too melodramatic.  Please.Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Star Trek growing up and I like Battlestar Gallactica, but I LOVE Firefly.  I love that it's about space but it's not about aliens or killer robots.  I love that it's about the people trying to scrape by instead of the people in the inner circle.  I love that it's real guns instead of ray guns, that they eat processed food, that they wear regular clothes, and have the same issues we all struggle with.It is an original take on space shows, it barely falls into the sci-fi category.  The language, the look, even the way they have handled all the special effects shots is unique.  The acting is terrific, the stories are great...Now for the people who watched 2 episodes and turned it off, you didn't give it a chance.  Me personally, I say you have to get to disk 3 in the set before the show gets really awesome.  But most people I've shown it to were hooked after the first episode.This show deserves the 5 star reviews it's gotten.  The only thing that would make it lose stars is it was cut prematurely short by the network.	5.0	Best space show EVER!!	2008-12-14	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PDAT5MVMN326	"K. Darby ""K. Darby"""	Unfortunately the limited understanding of the network[s], cancelled the series after one year.  There was so much more to see.  Joss Whedon was able to push through the 'thickheads', and bring us the movie 'SERENITY', which at least explained much to us.  What I don't understand is that MOST of his various series 'Buffy', 'Angel' to name two were hits from the git go.  Buffy only ended due to the cast wanting to move on in their own personal lives.	5.0	Great series	2014-03-20	0	0	0

With all of the reality tv (no offense to anyone who likes these shows) it was fantastic to finally have something worth watching AND on a Friday night. We had actually stopped hunting reruns and rewatching movies we own to watch Firefly. Do the people in charge ever listen?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A209NCM0EED0YH	K. Deans	I can't remember ever being so unhappy about a cancelled TV show before. And it wasn't just me. It was my husband and everyone I knew, including my mother, who is not a big sci-fi fan, but she knows great when she sees it. This was the best character driven show in years, with elements of drama, comedy, horror, thriller, as well as that edge that you usually only get with something done independently of the big networks. But it had enough of a big network budget that the special effects were done flawlessly. It was a killer sci-fi movie, but it was never going to end, you were going to get to watch an hour of it every week! And then, knife through the heart, it was cancelled. I cannot recommend more highly that you buy this DVD collection. See the episodes IN ORDER! See the ones they NEVER SHOWED! And prepare yourself for THE MOVIE!	5.0	YES!!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1OL6882MNEFGO	K. Dieckmann	And I'm talking about the quality of everything when I say that.I've loved this show for years now, and watching it in blu-ray? It's never looked this good. I've got no complaints about the sound or the picture, and neither does my brother (and he's a nerd about these things so he'd know).Other than that, the special features are brilliant. I've never watched any of it before so I don't know how much of it is new, but what I've watched so far is very very good, and will be of interest to almost anyone who enjoy the show.I have no regrets about buying this. I love it.	5.0	Excellent quality.	2011-12-15	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2O7P0578BBFBB	K. Doyle	"I got sucked in by the fact it was ""sci-fi"" and cheap, but it's not worth the $12 + shipping I paid for it used-- or for that matter, just the shipping.  Normally, I love sci-fi, but this goes to show that with bad enough writing, even sci-fi can be rendered completely inane.Ever since at least Star Wars, the idea of combining space ships with familiar stories has been there-- sword & sorcery, warfare, ancient mythology, etc.  It works when the familiar stories are handled by good writers.  The story is what carries it, whether or not it takes place in the past or future, or what the technology is.  This attempt to merge with westerns might have been good if the writing was up to par with any decent westerns, but it came up laughably short in that department.The pilot introduced the characters as you would expect, and already they were landing on alien planets where an ambush with bad guys on horseback was in store, where the three heroes handily win the day over impossible odds, all the good guys are crack shots and the bad guys can't hit the side of a barn.But when the second episode opens with a barroom fight scene where the main character is just acting totally stupid, and they get out of another impossible-odds old-west-style situation by pulling their spaceship up behind them from below the edge of a cliff was just too much (where have I seen that before?)-- I had to hit eject there and put it back up for sale on Amazon.No wonder it didn't even last a season, that should have been an important clue.  Anyone who thinks it has ""cult status,"" must either stand to gain on the profits of its sale, or is no more than about 12 years old.  Though come to think of it, I know some 12 year olds that can write better stories than this, so I may be a bit too charitable here."	1.0	Don't bother	2012-06-09	93	9	84

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A39P45KTJCI7NW	Keith A. Duperreault	"Another reviewer stated ""I am so very angry that FOX took 'Dark Angel' off the air just to put this show on. 'Firefly' didn't even last half of a full season. 15 episodes were produced 3 never aired and they weren't even done filming the first season. Here 'Dark Angel was,one of the most highest ratting shows getting ready for a third season when it gets cancelled so a show that didn't even last a full season can air. I can't believe FOX would cancel such a high rated show.""Let me tell you why such a good show gets cancelled.  Whedon was given the rights to create a new show based on his sucessful forumla or Buffy and Angel.  Fox figured he was money in the bank.  He has had an idea for Firefly for a long time and figured it was time to attempt it.  Fox exec's looked at the pilot episode and got cold feet....they weren't expecting intelligent sci-fi with some substance.  They wanted action - immediate action to draw in viewers, not character development or plot...just action (as if we were cows who will watch anything with explosions and fighting).  So they asked him to come up with the first few episodes to show them where the show was headed.The 2nd show is what ended up airing first on television.  This was the first stage in Firefly's fall.  The pilot episode contained all the necessary backstory that explained one of the ships main plots - why River and Simon are on the ship and the menace they bring to the crew.  So of course the 2nd episode airs with the crew already established and no backstory for the viewers.....it's just a ship full of people pulling a train heist.Then the brainiacs at Fox decide to show the episodes out of order....and for a show that is trying to build a story-arc it really hurt.  That's like showing Babylon5 episodes out of order to someone who's never seen it and expecting them to get interested in the story.  Because it didn't grab the rating they expected (gee i wonder why) they started moving it from night to night in different time slots to see if it grabbed better ratings sometime else.But what happens to a show that is shown out of order, then switched from night to night with no warning?  You get loyal fans of the show who tune in to find their show not on....left wondering where it is - and some viewers that have never heard of it tuning into it on another night and not being able to follow it cause it's in the middle of the story and they don't know who anyone is.  Fox did not advertise Firefly's timeslot and nightly changes....it was literally different each week.That was the final nail in the coffin as Fox was left wondering why this unadvertised, timeslot abused show had no viewers....so they cancelled it.I had been over at a friends house when the episode ""Ariel"" was on.  I only saw the last 20 minutes of it but I had always been intrigued.  half a year later I saw the DVD set in the store and decided to take a chance.  Best decision I made.  When my friend watched the DVD with the pilot movie first and all the episodes in order he told me it really cleared up the story for him and made a LOT more sense.This gave me the same feeling I got when i tuned into the first Babylon5 episode i ever saw - The Coming of Shadows.  Like ""Ariel"" it was an episode that makes you want to go back and watch the show from the beginning.  Thanks to the DVD set craze we are able to.  I highly recommend people pick up this relatively inexpensive collection to prepare themselves for the new movie."	5.0	Why good shows get canned	2005-07-30	7	7	0

I'm gonna start thinking bad, desperate, &  evil thoughts until someone gives me another fix!!""  Way back in 2005, when ""Serenity"" first appeared, I had never heard of ""Firefly"" (I stopped watching t.v back in 1993).  Up-to-that-point, my favorite S.F. series was (deservedly) ""Babylon 5"".  Once I saw 'Serenity' I was an immediate & nearly obsessed fan.  I watched it 3 times the first day (it was winter & I was sick) & twice the next day.  Within a week, I had the entire series & I watched nothing else until I had enjoyed the series 7 times thru (yeh; I kno--I kno....).  In-my-defense tho, I have yet to purchase any books, shirts, or trinkets, as such.  However, tomorrow is another day....  :)  Yes, I know (it's pathetic) &, I fully accept that view-point even tho it is criticism, because, it's pretty much true.  Joss (& everyone involved) did such a superb top-notch job--I was mesmerized!!  I havn't made it to any of the 'Brown-coats' fan parties or to any of the 'cons' (yet) but, one day...  For all of my 51 years, I have been a great fan of Star Trek, & other S.F.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQZD0NTM0KH0S	Keith M. Backman	"As my brother said, this is Star Trek should have been.  It's funny, but it also has more layers than that and the characters have various strengths and weaknesses.  You know, like real people.  Not like the cardboard cutouts in most TV series, who each have one defining characteristic.The only flaw is the Inara character, who is a ""Companion,"" the polite name for a unionized hooker.  Sometimes this is used to advance the plot, but there are a number of sex scenes (fairly explicit for prime time TV) which serve no purpose except to fill time.  So you might want to put the little ones to bed as you enjoy this fine series."	4.0	Almost Perfect	2008-10-10	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AAITY5VX3IEC2	"Keith OConnor ""keithoc"""	I never noticed Firefly when it was on Fox, but I did glance at it when it hit the SciFi channel.  One glance didn't do it.  I thought it looked stupid and never watched even one episode.Then it appeared on DVD and I read the reviews.  Hmmmm.  People loved it.  When they reduced the price I figured, what the hell, and bought it the same way Mary Tyler Moore threw the meat into the supermarket cart.Much to my surprise I totally love the show.  I watched every episode and not one, NOT ONE, was boring.  The characters are understandable, and there's a fair bit of comedy in each episode.  Best of all, unlike other SciFi stuff, there were no human-sized aliens who just happened to speak English.  Instead, we see a future where technology helps a lot, and where people are still people, warts and all.This is undoubtedly my favorite collection of a sci-fi TV show.  Please, please, please -- someone pick the show up and finish the story.  There are several mysteries the series didn't get time to explain.

It combined elements of all the things she loved - comedy, romance and wit into an amazing package with amazing actors.  Sure enough she loved it just as much as I and over the course of the week we consumed everything we could from the DVD's.Now there could not be two more avid Serenity fans.  We eagerly await the movie and even plan to post some posters for the movie around town - and are trying to get as many people as we can to see the DVD.All this for a show I never even saw on the air or even cared about until I found it years later on DVD.

I am now simply stunned at both the quality of this show and Fox's stupidity. This show has everything an intelligent science-fiction fan wants- great writing, great acting, interesting situations and sympathetic characters. The ensemble nature of the cast is outstanding. The different characters are extremely well-defined, unlike other shows such as Voyager. The whole ""Wild West in Space"" theme sounds hokey but really works, due to the talent involved. And the music is both memorable and effective.I cannot recommend this set highly enough. It's such a shame it's so small. I understand there is a movie version of Firefly in the works and I hope it lives up to the series. Better still, I hope it inspires another network to bring the cast back together for a new series.Buy this."	5.0	How could Fox possibly have cancelled this?	2005-01-22	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1MV8ZZFFHQB32	"Kenneth D. Ladage ""-- Patriot"""	Back when I first saw Firefly, I caught a couple of episodes and dismissed it as fractured, unstructured and odd. A friend recently got the DVD and asked me to watch it. I did. And I discovered why I thought it was fractured, unstructured and odd: the air dates are all over the freakin' place. If I recall the order correctly, FOX actually showed the pilot episode LAST!To let a series run one season, show the episodes all out of order, not air three episodes that are critical to the meta-plot...and then cancel the thing before it had a chance to shine; to not advertize the show at all (at least that I can recall); to simply let this gem get washed down the drain as it was -- I cannot imagine how anyone can see this as anything other than someone at FOX deliberately making all attempts to kill this show.And I cannot imagine why. After watching all of them; watching them in order (and thus seeing how each episode builds on the previous ones in the series) I see that this is the television show that would have become my favorite had it been given half a chance to succeed.FOX: wake up. You seriously messed up here. If you have any brains at all, once this movie comes out next year, you will renew the series and pick things up with season 2.	5.0	What in the heck was FOX thinking?	2003-12-15	5	5	0

Though only about 10 episodes made it to air, this package includes all 14 original episodes, and they put them in the right order (note: the pilot episode was aired as the season finale).

I was looking for something new and stumbled on this DVD set.  I bought it based on the customer reviews that I read on Amazon.  Even after I bought it, the set sat on a shelf, unopened, for a couple of months.  Then one lazy weekend morning, I decided to watch the first episode.  Then I watched another.  Four discs later and well after midnight I finally finished the set.  I hadn't planned on watching them all in one sitting but I couldn't stop myself.  I just wish there were more episodes to watch.

Firefly is one of those programs.only 9 episodes of the 11 contained on the DVD set ever aired, and they still won an emmy for best special effects for a television series...the concept of the colonization of space paralelling the colonization and westward expansion of the post american civil war era makes for great stories that i can't seem to get enough of, and after watching the Serenity movie last weekend, i am hoping to see more from this cast and crew.hands down one of the best television shows i've seen in long long time.	5.0	cancellation of a series doesn't always reflect the quality of the program	2005-10-09	3	3	0

As a huge Star Wars fan I was hesitant to say at first that it was as good as Star Wars to me, but now I say that it is as good or even better than Star Wars!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2	"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore"""	"It is a mistake to say that Firefly is new or revolutionary, since its key ideas have been print SF staples for decades.  What Firefly is, is ambitious and audience-centered in a way little TV sci-fi has been since the original Star Trek.  It anticipates a smart audience and rewards them with humane, high octane stories about clever characters in sophisticated situations.  So naturally it got cancelled.Dare I say that the best thing about Firefly is that it's incomplete?  Only fourteen episodes were made, introducing a story lush with promise and an energetic ensemble immersed in the kind of work that most actors long for.  It is this promise, unsullied by later network interference, which I think makes this the best TV to hit DVD in years.Beyond the writing, acting, and direction, all of which are superb, this show has some of the best visual design I've seen in decades.  Joss Whedon studied how space flight takes place even now, and reflected the cramped quarters, austere living conditions, and blue-collar immediacy missing from more slick productions.  Firefly is the latest true embodiment of George Lucas' vision of ""used space.""Firefly didn't find its audience until it was out on DVD, but it's clear why this story inspires comic books, a feature film, fan fiction, and a massive fan culture despite its brief span.  For true believers in TV as art, this show sums up the promise that the medium rarely accomplishes.  Fun, funny, and energetic, there is no question why a cancelled show commands fan loyalty even several years later."	5.0	I Don't Care, I'm Still Free	2009-11-02	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GVXCGOSI205U	Kevin S.	Firefly is the funniest drama I've ever seen. I've chuckled, even guffawed, at Wash's (Alan Tudyk) silliness, Zoe's (Gina Torres) deadpan gibes, and Jayne's-- Well, you'll just have to experience *Mr.* Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) for yourself. I also relished the convention-twisting surprises, such as the many spoilers I'm thoughtfully omitting right now.Firefly, however, is more than levity. Liberty and loyalty are central to the main characters, who struggle (and sometimes smuggle) to survive. They do so on the 26th century frontier aboard their transport spaceship Serenity. Some are there to be free of the Alliance, which forced every colonized planet to join. Some are fugitives from that government's darker side. Some are just along for the ride. Or are they?Would you like to see clever characterization and humor from superior writing, acting, and directing? Of course you would. In fact, you'll want to see these richly textured episodes again and again, so you should purchase your own set of Firefly DVDs. I did, and I don't even watch free reruns of other TV shows. Then in 2005 you can go see the greenlighted film version from Universal Pictures: Serenity.	5.0	Seriously funny	2004-03-29	9	9	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1W4UBPSZVMTGB	Kevin Tipa	I love this series and movie, even if the movie included some events that can't be undone... making future stories hard to do.  But that's treading into spoiler territory.  So I'll just say again: this is the best writing, acting, and production of any television series or movie.  The characters are so engaging that I didn't become attached to one or two, but all of the main characters (9 of them, or 10 if you include the ship...), and even some of the supporting characters.  The setting is definitely science fiction, but I think it's the most accessible sci fi setting in fiction.  A couple friends of mine, a married couple, are not geeks (unlike me) and are usually more interested in sports and so forth than anything that could be described as sci fi.  I introduced them to the show, and they loved it.  And then they were mad at me for showing them such excellence that ends.  Which brings me to something important...I hate Fox Broadcasting Company.  Such ignorant pieces of crap must work there.  They cancelled this show after one season.  Stupid Fox.Anyway, I can't possibly give this series enough glowing praise.  Watch it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A41B5KG7EOO2S	Kevin W.	Firefly is one of the few TV shows (and movie!) that I always keep coming back to. The characters are just so memorable, and the story very unique. While it is a Sci-fi show, the story behind River and Simon's escape, along with Mal's (the captain) military history gives this show a western, frontier settlement edge to it. The main characters aren't some badass all powerful supersoldiers set out to find or kill galactic aliens or robots, but are a simple ragtag group of people who have found each other and are just trying to scratch by a living with any job they can get. Some legal, others not so much. Give the show a shot, the first episode is set to introduce you to all of the characters and provide as much information as it can (hence its 1.5 hrs), but it's well worth it.Oh, and Fox, you guys suck for cancelling the show.I'll be in my bunk.	5.0	Amazing TV Show, Even after 10 Years	2012-05-23	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1QFR7S6AFFOOO	"""kfe123"""	Although this series has been way too often advertised as simply a &quot;Western-SF&quot; it is so much more than that.It's honestly the best television I have seen in forever, it has such great writing, acting, effects (Emmy remeber) and just such a great overall feel to it, it's simply amazing. It's also very refreshing to see a &quot;sience fiction&quot;, wich doesn't revolve around sience and aliens and the like, but just about the people. This makes the series probably more a drama than anything else, only in a just so much more creative setting.Really even if you don't like SF at all, there is a very good chance that you'll get hooked only halveway trough the pilot.The DVD set itself is very complete, 50% of all the episodes have commentaries (wich are very nice), and there are quite a few other intresting extra's (just Joss Whedon singing the (by the way briliant) theme song, and Adam Baldwin's verson of &quot;the Hero of Canton&quot; make this DVD set worth the purcase).And although there are only 14 episodes this set will over you ages of viewing pleasure, every episode deserves to be watch dozens of time, you'll be amazed at how many detals you keep discovering.Thereare only two bad thing about this series:1 - It's way to short, this 'verse' coulda gone on for ever, and by the time you'll seen all the episodes, it leaves you very sad and angry that there aren't anymore (so you'll just continu to watch them over and over agian)2 - It will make (almost) every other television series look cheap, uninventive and boring.Now you could go on and read all the other 700+ reviews, of wich 99.9% are positive or you could just order this set, and enjoy it, untill the movie is released (yup,for those of you who don't know yet, there'll be a movie about this series in 2005 called Serenity)	5.0	It's simply the best TV ever...	2004-03-21	3	2	1

Never before has there been such a perfect blend of the Wild West and science fiction. Moreover Joss Whedon does a phenomenal job of developing the storyline and the main characters to the point that the viewers become emotionally attached to their pains, joys, successes and failures. The biggest drawback to the series is that there are only 14 episodes and the viewer is definitely left wanting more.	5.0	The Greatest Failure Ever	2010-08-09	4	3	1

Just earlier this year, I was introduced to ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" which I fell in love with, and now consider one of if not my all time favorite show. When I learned the writer of Firefly and Buffy were the same person, I watched the series and fell in love with it. When I learned of the movie, I decided to buy the box set and watch it from beginning to end once more.This show is not just another throw away sci-fi show. The dialogue and story telling of Joss Whedon is something truly phenomenal. The man knows exactly what he's doing and is a master of character development and story telling.I believe this show can be enjoyed by literally everyone. It has characters people can easily identify with and characters you'll fall in love with and really care about. The story telling is magnificent, and even the visuals are quite good.

So, why did I buy Firefly? Well, it was in the top selling DVD list, and had an unusual title leading me to read the Amazon blurb and reviews. It sounded halfway decent and it had many (I think the most of any item reviewed here?) positive comments. For a reasonable price I decided to take the plunge.I was pleasantly surprised. The show has nice photography, unusual settings, decent plot (though a bit thick at times), beautiful women, good humor, and decent acting.I guess Jayne is my favorite character as his humor was some of the best. I never got into River as a character, which made the follow up movie Serenity a bit less satisfying - though the  extended fist-fights and bad special effects in the movie detracted as well.It sure seemed like the series got jerked around - the pilot was not aired, others out of sequence or not shown, etc, and I believe Fox created a cult classic by killing it off early.I like commentaries and extras, and this DVD has many.	4.0	I'll be in my bunk	2006-06-09	6	6	0

I have to admit I really liked it, after all where can you find a science fiction/ western in one show. The plots are a little convoluted but I like that. The final straw in the pile was it has been mentioned several times on The Big Gang Theory--what more could you want.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A37C4ZDY2IGR53	K. Hale	A big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel since the beginning, I was initially less enthused by this one until I actually saw it.  Now, it is clear that as good as Buffy and Angel were, they were the stepping stones to this, Joss' most intelligent and adult series.  With involving characters, gripping plot lines and witty dialogue, Joss created a world where the were no black and whites, but only shades of gray and yet his heroes were more compelling than any others to date.  With every episode, the Firefly world becomes more complex and rich.  An adventure, a western, a space epic, a comedy, a drama  Joss managed to blend genres into something new and wonderful and something we are not likely to see on TV again.	5.0	Joss' Greatest Achievment	2005-02-19	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AAMLZSJE3JTVK	kickit	This show had a bunch of very good ideas. Every single character in the series was very easy to follow. There was the calm and crude captain, the idiot pilot, the quiet doctor,the outgoing mechanic, the unoticable hor, the overreacting guy with the guns, the girl in the box, and a couple other characters were easy to connect with. Getting the characters personalities wasn't all that hard either. The show was also action-packed with lots of shooting scenes. Another thing was that this was one of the first space show that WASN'T trying to beat Star Treck. Out of all the space show, this was the only one that wasn't trying to be the next Star Treck. Why FOX canceled it, i'll never know. I think almost everyonewould like this TV series.	5.0	The Best TV Series To Ever be Canceled	2003-11-11	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2HUN9JGERD87U	killabsting	This show is hands Down one of the best made for tv series that the Sci-fi channel has aired. It is a refreshing change from the typical have alien will conquer themes that have been so unfortunately prolific in the Science Fiction genre.It has something for everyone from youngster to adult and beyond. It's attention to detailing character traits and humanist flair is unequalled in television. It was a very innovative series and had a large following of viewers,  of which I was one. I very rarely mark anything g a 5 star, but in this case and In my opinion, this particular series deserves that and more. Sci-fi deserves 1 star in comparison as it cancelled the series over the protest of thousands of viewers. For shame that finally quality programming came to cable and satellite and even though ratings were acceptable, upper management blew it.I recommend this series to everyone.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A192LISNB2UY0O	Kim A Miller	I was so inspired by this terrific show and the subsequent movie that I had to write something. Consider the following an homage to the show's philosophical core...... (warning: contains spoilers...)MercyMal has just knocked the huge man with the blade into the ship's engine..he pays for it later by being tortured by a man with no mercy....Mal decides to protect River Tam after casting her and her brother aside. She lies helpless on the ground. It is his moment to walk away. He picks her up and takes a step which will end the lives of two of his crew and yet, he finds mercy for her in that moment.Standing above the disabled operative, Mal turns on the recording that has finally freed River Tam and its truth stands as a final blow against the perfectionist alliance and its failed rulers. Mal takes mercy on the man and decides not to kill him while the young girl he took mercy on is saving the lives of his crew. She cuts down the reavers who are in the state they are in for no fault of their own. They are wild and crazed and innocent and receiving the mercy killing which is their only release.......And in the end, the mercy shown to the operative comes back and again, saves the lives of his crew........It is not an easy lesson, for Mercy on one has consequences for others.And it is never easy for Mal to know when to show Mercy.But he does.... Mercy to live. Mercy to die.Mercy to his crew to push the man begging him for mercy away from the Mule. Mercy to the same man to kill him when in the hands of the Reavers...Each moment while being the Captain of his crew he must choose. And that is his razor's edge.	5.0	A great show with some underlying profundities	2007-05-17	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IORSFM0GE609	Kindle Customer	I couldn't pass up this deal on Amazon. My viewing of Firefly on Blu-ray was my second time watching the full season of the show and it was every bit as enjoyable as the first. The sound quality was fantastic. This remains one of my favorite shows of all time and I always become sad when I near the end of the season and realize there won't be a second season. What I noticed while watching this time was how exceptional the dialogue was. I haven't seen anything that balances witty humor and serious drama as well as Firefly. If you haven't seen it you should definitely check it out.My only complaint, and it is very minor and has nothing to do with the show itself, is that the Blu-Ray box says there are 3 never before seen episodes. Well, it is only partially true. The episodes never aired in the first run, but they are on the DVD set which is where I watched it the first time, and I think they aired on Sci-fi too. Anyway, I just got really excited when I thought I was going to get 3 episodes I had never seen, but that wasn't the case. Still doesn't stop me from giving 5+ stars, just something that i thought could have been worded better on the box.	5.0	Extraordinary	2010-06-28	2	2	0

Now, years later, the BDM has appeared. I was so excited, but no one else was, so I bought this DVD set for many of my clueless friends, and together we almost single-handedly filled our small theatre. I was so proud.This show has everything! Action, humor, action, humor, and of course, tads of melo-drama. It's perfect, and I think it's a welcome addition to any DVD collection, or sci-fi collection. It's also a whole lot better than many people realize. Two of my friends(who now love the show) both said they never realized the show was good because it was cancelled so quickly they thought it was pretty bad. How wrong they were! The show just never had time to latch on to many people who just never had time to sit down and watch it!I'm proud to say I was a fan from the beginning, and that I have created at least 8 other fans, and the word is spreading from them to their friends. Just give the show a chance, you never know. You may be a Browncoat underneath and never had a chance to figure it out.	5.0	shiny	2005-10-22	8	8	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2DDM7V4HZX54V	"Kindle Customer ""media junkie"""	"I completely missed ""Firefly"" when it was on TV. That's not surprising, since network television rarely draws me in these days. So, when a friend invited me over to watch the ""Firefly"" DVDs, I had no idea what to expect. It was Joss Whedon's reputation, and my enjoyment of his previous shows that drew me.""Firefly"" is a space opera of sorts, taking place in a Western (as in cowboys) themed universe, where many earth cultures have blended together. Characters lapse into Chinese when cursing. There is a school of thought among sf fandom that, when a show has to resort to the cowboy episode (as the original Battlestar Galactica series did in the first season), the writers are truly lost for ideas. I had mixed feelings about the show's merits, until I got into it a bit.If I were to take ""Firefly"" too seriously, I think it's a show I'd probably detest, but 30 minutes of viewing convinced me that Joss Whedon had a sense of humor about him when conceiving and executing this short-lived series.The ""Firefly"" universe is a universe populated by rogue space cowboys, escorts, religious fanatics and a somewhat under-explained political struggle loosely mirroring Star Wars' The Empire and Rebellion. There's irony everywhere, some truly cheesy writing (and acting) and some great special effects.While I enjoyed the campiness of the show, I'd hate to leave the reader with the impression that the sometimes over-the-top humor is the only reason to watch. There are some truly superlative moments, running the gamut from tense to heart breaking. The interlaced humor serves not only the audience in making the show more enjoyable, but the character development as well.Overall, ""Firefly"" is probably one of the best sf shows I've ever seen. Take any aspect of the show and drop it into another reference frame, and one would run for cover. Somehow, Whedon manages to pull all of these strange odds and ends together into a cohesive unit that is really entertaining.Aside from the episodes, the extras on the DVD (including the gag reel) are well worth viewing, though - truth be told - I could probably go a lifetime without hearing the theme song again.While it helps to watch the episodes in order, once the characters are explained, each episode is great for stand-alone viewing. ""Firefly"" could probably have lasted a couple more seasons before deteriorating, and I wish it had."	5.0	One of the Funniest Series Ever Produced	2005-04-19	7	6	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1RUAG9KJOCFXC	"K. Jutte ""Girospeck"""	I am a big science fiction fan, but I don't like the majority of science fiction.  I am a huge fan of Star Trek - particularly Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation.  I watched, Star Trek: Enterprise and Battlestar Galactica (the new one) and was very disappointed with both.  I attempted to watch Babylon 5 and Farscape, but was very bored with the characters.When friends recommended Firefly I was skeptical.  I tried to watch the first episode and gave up about 20 minutes in (it seemed boring and uninspired).  About 3 months later, I decided to give it another chance.  By the end of the first episode, I was already growing attached to the characters and the setting.  I watched the rest of the show, followed by the movie, Serenity, within 2 days.  The characters and acting are suburb.  The setting and 'verse are intriguing and unique.  I felt that the show demonstrated potential and was particularly good for a first season.As of writing this review, it has been 1 week since I finished watching Firefly and Serenity.  During this week I have thought back to the show and 'verse many times and even imagined my own adventures.  I have also been very depressed about the premature cancellation (even though it was canceled 6 years ago).  As it stands, the show is very entertaining and enjoyable, but not the best science fiction.  HOWEVER, I honestly believe that if the show had been granted a full 7 seasons (like my favorite Star Trek series are) then it may have stood a good chance at dethroning my old time favorite.As it stands, however, both the show and movie are excellent and thoroughly entertaining.  I would rate the first season and first movie a 9.1/10 (which will round to a 5 star review at Amazon).	5.0	Firefly: A Diamond in the Rough	2009-12-26	1	1	0

The graphics are also great and do not hinder the story, as can sometimes happen with TV Sci-Fi.  Simply put, this is one of the most unique shows with its mash-up of the wild west and space and it should not be missed.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1OQDP20JECHXG	K. Lane	The Firefly Series is the sad tale of a show not given the opportunity to fully expand to its potential reach of tv audiences. The show is truly a terrific sci-fi western, filled with wit, humor, and action. The characters immediately draw you into their world and are portrayed effortlessly by actors that seem to feel right at home within the first episode and continue to develop throughout the short lived series. Watch just the first two episodes and you will be hooked. Caution: once you have finished, you will be left with so many questions, some of which may never be answered. Luckily, the new movie Serenity (in theatres Sept 30) with the same cast and characters begins to explore some of the future possibilities of the Serenity crew and will hopefully open the doors for this space saga to continue, big or little screen.	5.0	Fly Firefly Fly	2005-10-03	8	8	0

The characters, the setting, the stories, the storytelling, the music... It's all fantastically done.Although the generally used ""Sci Fi Western"" tag may seem a bit unusual, don't let it scare you away.  The crew of the ship is the focus, and they're so darn likable that it doesn't even matter where the show takes place.  Fortunately for us, the setting allows for some really cool action and intriguing sites.If you listen to some of the audio commentaries, you can see just how much heart everyone put into this.  It shows on screen, and you'd be hard-pressed to find another ensemble cast with this much natural chemistry.  By the end of the first disc you should have a decent understanding of who these people are.  By the end of the last disc, you'll have a hard time seeing them go (hurrah for the Serenity movie picking up where this leaves off).Honestly, I don't even like TV, but I loved this so much that I decided to buy the complete Buffy series on a whim (Joss Whedon's more well-known project).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1GTBOE5HYU727	Kludge	Firefly was one of Joss Whedon's more interesting ideas, a cross between science fiction and the old West where the good guys are actually bad guys.  The chemistry between the cast members worked marvelously and it's difficult to point to any one member and say that (s)he made the show great.  The sharp contrast in technology - blasters vs gunpowder, for example - made the concept interesting as did the contrast between the characters.  They also made the whole idea a lot more fun to watch.

Maxwell ""katmax1"""	This show deserved to be a modern SciFi classic, up there with Babylon 5 and Farscape as a real alternative to Star Trek.  Firefly is an odd mixture of traditional spaceship show and a western all mixed in with bits of asian culture. (which was actually a nice touch I think).That this show was put on air out of order, without even the pilot episode being shown till the *end* of the series was a tragedy.  When viewed in the right sequence, as shown in the box set, we have a wonderful and quite unique TV series with some great special effects thrown in.I got to the last episode and swore at the TV because there was no more to watch and cursed the stupidity of TV executives. (again)My only gripe with this box set of the show is that it is hard to find the episode commentries which are buried inside the &quot;language&quot; selection section for each episode.	5.0	Outstanding Sci-FI	2004-03-27	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Q70QO5UKNPCL	K. Munroe	Knowing that I was a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, my co-worker lent me the Firefly series to watch. Now this guy is a big science fiction fan and I am not. I truly find shows/movies with space travel, overblown CGI and characters (aliens) with elaborate prosthetics to be insipid and one of the lowest forms of fictional entertainment. I endured the recent Star Wars movies with my family since I felt it was a Constitutional duty. Begrudgingly I accepted my co-workers offer and felt compelled to watch at least some of the shows since I knew he would want to discuss them with me.I must say that I surprised myself when I was so readily hooked on the show. Sure there was this weird hybrid of Western/Science Fiction that yes, does include space travel, but what makes this series and every other script-based show successful, is a strong story line and endearing characters. After a viewing a few episodes, I was sure that Kaylee was my favorite character, but by the time I finished the set, I couldn't decide which character I cared for most. This is the hallmark of Joss Whedon; strong storylines delivered by likeable yet flawed characters. The viewer can not only relate to the characters, they can empathize with them. When I returned the series to my co-worker, I thanked him and told him that I would be purchasing the series and the Serenity movie. I told him that the set is in the top 20 sales at Amazon and the word must be spread about this show in order for it to return rightfully to television. My co-worker has turned on three people to this show and I plan to continue to spread the word. Firefly deserved a better fate; it is up to those who left positive feedback to try to reverse that fate.	5.0	Can a grass-root movement return Firefly to televsion?	2006-04-08	18	17	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2QEZSN0PPOQY1	K. Pring	This T.V. show is one of the epic pieces of work that Fox has let slip through over the years.  Despite Fox's ineptitude, the show got out and because and instant love for some many people.  You want a show with good drama, comedy, action, this is your show.  Staring Nathan Fillion as the captain of a smuggler ship taking cargo and people from one planet to the next centuries after the Earth was abandoned.  Fillion's character is just one of the reasons to watch the show.  He's not a good guy, he's not really a bad guy, but he sits on his own very careful side of the fence.  He hates the big government, which is basically a giant fascist regime that holds unyielding sway over the &#34;core worlds&#34; near the center of the galaxy and is always looking to expand its reach to the outer rim where the Firefly crew typically do their work under the radar.  I could go on but seriously you just should see it for yourself, you can watch it on amazon Prime, get the service for a month, watch the show and a few others while you're at it if you like it buy and and join us Brown coats!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17Y6XJWYKRUE6	"Krajcsovits Gyrgy ""krajo"""	I'm a big fan of Buffy and Angel, both created by Joss Whedon. I tried not to be a fanboy and buy Firefly right away when I first heard about it on a Buffy fan site. So, cautiously, I watched some episodes from the internet. I shouldn't have worried, the show is excellent. Very well cast, great storytelling, funny and without bumpy head aliens, sound in space, tight uniforms.To me the best part is the focus on characters and their interplay. I've always loved Robert Altman's work, so imagine my delight when Joss Whedon sais in one episode's commentary: I tried to make this scene like Altman, making it more intimate with staying further back with the camera... by the way, the commentaries on the DVD are well worth listening to. They're funny and you get a great insight into how much care went into creating this amazing show.And what's this ? Firefly is 10. on the Amazon DVD top sellers list almost 3 years after it was cancelled ?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A15AMUTKT7GZ6	Kris James	Joss Whedon's universe is gloriously fresh and beautifully flawed. He paints the aftermath of the war of unification with bright strokes, showing the richness of the Alliance planets, and their mutual success, support, and military might, as well as the can-do, independent spirit of the rim worlds who struggle daily with the little they have. With an entire galaxy to play with, there's plenty of room for individual stories to portray the clashes that arise in such a widely variant setting. And our guides on that journey all have their own stories to tell along the way.On the smaller scale, some of the main characters aboard the Serenity have taken sides on the war issue--along with all its sub-issues, such as what jobs they're okay taking part in--and some haven't, creating a delightful mix of viewpoints on the everyday workings of the spacecraft and how to get by. And no one is inflexible; all the characters grow and change over the course of the series, organically adapting as we all do to new situations. Love, fear, loyalty, friendship, greed...it's all in there.The episodes take us to a vast range of locations--some poor, smarmy, struggling, and backstabbing, and some rich and flush with the new technology, and all that it entails. Captain Reynolds and his crew generally know what to expect in the former, but they know they must be constantly aware of shifting alliances and unseen trouble in the latter, as well. Basically, it's true what the character Zoe says about the captain: the war never ended for him. He has to fight every day for his ship and his crew, against everyone that survived the war he fought in. But he's clever and he's got a resourceful band of allies, and they do the best they can to keep flying.The dialogue in this series fascinates me. The words and phrases it uses, whether borrowed from Mandarin (the other surviving language from old Earth) or whether patched together in space-Western style, clearly help to define the feel of the show itself. As a proud Browncoat, I can always identify other Browncoats by the way they talk about this series. And, of course, by the fact that they can't shut up about it.	5.0	Space Cowboys?

It takes place outside, at night. The first portion of the pilot is also a bit slow. With it being slow and hard to see what's going on, the first 30 minutes can be hard to get through.

I could have enjoyed years more.You know the plot, so I'll just tell you that Buffy and Angel fans (and doubtless many others) will love this additional glimpse into Joss Whedon's crazed mind.  Lots of quotable quotes (""my food is problematic""), eye-candy (the incomparable Morena Baccarin and her shuttle lair), and memorable catch-phrases (""Shiny!"") come out of this charming series.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AXQ1F9ZP46NU3	Kristy	"Firefly is a great series and one that I can watch many times over and not be bored with it. It combines science fiction with an ""Old West"" feel, has great chemistry between the characters, combines humor with drama and action, and shows the main characters/""good guys"" in a very human and flawed way, which makes it more relateable, without being cheesy in the least. This series ended far too soon, which as any sci-fi fan knows is something Fox has a tendency to do. It is a timeless show and well worth watching. My only issue with buying the DVD set is how expensive it is! That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The show itself is 5 stars, but the price, no matter where you look, doesn't justify 5 stars. And yes, price is pertinent to a review since the review is about the DVD set and not just the show itself. It's almost highway robbery, but it's such a good show that I finally broke down and bought it. I watch a lot of science fiction and fantasy, and this is definitely one of my favorites. It's Joss Whedon at his best!"	4.0	Ended too soon! But very spendy for only 14 episodes.	2011-06-19	3	1	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3CRRW2RFRXAP	"K. Rust ""joy beanius"""	"I missed this show when it was (briefly) on Fox.  Big mistake. But I thought ""An on board prostitute?  AND a preacher? And a doctor in space? Sounds stupid.""  Like I said, big mistake.I encountered ""Firefly"" again a few years later when I read a news article on the web about the ""Browncoats"" in Boston having a Firefly festival or something. I don't remember the specifics, but I was so intrigued by the song they were singing about the ""Hero of Canton"" that I wanted to check it out.  I checked my local library, but then I saw that the price for the WHOLE SERIES on Amazon was under 30 bucks, and I bought it, having never watched a single episode.Once the familiar smiley faced-box arrived, I opened it up and popped a disk in the DVD.  My son (about 15 at the time) asked what I was watching.  ""Firefly."" ""Oh,"" he said, ""I used to watch that.  It's pretty good.""An understatement.It's hard to explain.  A Western set in space.  Hard core pirates that you really, REALLY love. A captain who acts like Han Solo would have if he had had a pair.  A beautiful Amazon warrior-princess who marries a pasty white boy (hope for us all!).  A charming, innocent mechanic who can make an ancient POJ spaceship sing. A gigantic bully who names his guns (VERA?).  A snobby surgeon-on-the-run and his lovely demented sister.  And then there's the preacher and the prostitute, who becomes the moral center of the whole show. A crew that is constantly in conflict, until there's an outside threat, when they will fight to the death for one another.In short, a family.(WHY was that kid watching this without me??)Joss Weadon has created a shabby, mundane, future populated by people that seem like old friends.  The witty dialog, the intercut Chinese swearing, the plot that never slows down and always surprises, these things come together in a delicate tapestry that is Firefly.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this show makes Star Wars seem shallow and Star Trek (all versions) seem insipid.  This from a dyed in the wool Trekker.I watched the whole thing (six+ hours) in one sitting.So I went to work the next day and I couldn't resist.  I told Tanya, who borrowed the DVDs, and then bought her own and loaned them to Tim who loaned them to Kevin and Cassie, and so on.  I knew I was the Firefly Evangelist at work when John (my boss' boss) saw me working in the lab with blue gloves on (yes, I'm a science nerd), cocked his head and said, ""Two by two; hands of blue.""  His wife had given him the DVDs for Christmas, because he had watched Tanya's.  He loved them, too.So I went to the office Halloween party this year (2008) as Mal (Mal after a prosperous 20 years or so, I suppose). Also in attendance were Zoe and Jayne.  We shot the rest of them with our nerf guns.Watch it, get it, and you will be singing the same song as the rest of us:You can't take the Sky from ME!One note on the movie ""Serenity"", based on this series:  It's good, but... try the TV show.

How could a *space Western* possibly be good? But it is; it's really good. For running only fourteen-odd episodes and a movie, the character development is impeccable, the story line compelling, and I often find lines from random episodes popping into my head at odd times--it sticks with you.I only wish it had had its full run; several full seasons would have done it the justice it deserved.	5.0	I miss Firefly so much.	2013-07-21	0	0	0

In M*A*S*H it was ""Follies of the Living - Concerns of the Dead"", in Futurama it was ""Jurassic Bark"" and for Firefly, for me, it is this episode. The humor and drama is still there as is the growing camaraderie among the crew but added to that is a deeper look into Mal's and Zoe's mutual past.This brief expedition into their time during the war helps us to understand a little more of how their growth was affected by the people they encountered and ran with."	5.0	There is almost always one episode	2012-10-31	1	0	1

The confusion and frustration I felt made me finally give up. I blame that entirely on Fox, because I know of Joss Whedon's storytelling skills.So, after the dvd set came out, friends of mine kept telling me how crazy I was not to watch Firefly.  I remembered some interesting episodes and good acting, but just wasn't sure it was worth it to buy - especially since it was a season cut short.Well, when I saw the Serenity movie trailer and had some gift certificates to spend, I finally took the ""chance"" and bought it. And then I proceeded to watch episode after episode, night after night, engrossed in a great storytelling. Watching ALL the episodes in the CORRECT order really made this a fun experience. Shame on Fox for poor decision making.The Firefly DVD is worth every penny. Though the series' life was cut short, hopefully the Serenity movie due out in September 2005 (along with the comic series that will hit summer 2005) should continue the adventures of the Serenity crew.You won't regret buying this series."	5.0	Why didn't I buy the Firefly box set sooner?	2005-05-25	11	10	1

Tooker ""a/k"""	The only bad thing about this DVD package is that once you reach the end, there's hardly any hope of their being more to come! Firefly, despite it being a better show than Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Whedon's previous work) never caught on and was cancelled after only a season. The story is based a lot off of the American civil war with the villains holding a strong resemblance to the United States democratic government. Our heroes are a band of goofy space travellers who get by on petty thievery and smuggling (think Han Solo). An interesting twist is that though it is a futuristic sci-fi show, there are no aliens! The comedy, drama and action are wonderful, with of course Whedon's witty, entertaining dialogue in full effect.	5.0	Great Show...	2006-02-26	5	5	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A6WF8AUNLBE34	K. Truett	One of my biggest regrets is that I found Firefly years after the show was canceled. TV Sci-Fi was always a touchy subject to me because most shows are just plain cheesy. However I always heard people talking about how great this show was. After a brief unemployment stint I got a chance to watch it and fell in love.The series is great and even though it was short it had great potential. The marrying of sci-fi and cowboys probably threw most of the general public for a loop but I thought it worked well. Think of it as Han Solo's younger life. The universe itself was interesting and while some things have popped up before the mash up worked well.Having this on Blu Ray is a treat in itself as I can't go back to watching regular DVD. If you love sci-fi, definitely pick this up.	5.0	Great show gone too soon	2013-07-29	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3G6MHK3BRNQOA	K. Upchurch	I'm going to admit that I never watched this show when it was on Fox... But now that I've bought and watched the DVDs, I'm really sorry the shows over.  I think the show was doomed on Fox from the beginning - the premiere wasn't aired until the show had been canceled, and the shows aired out of order - which is really unfortunate.  Like Whedon's other shows - BtVS and Angel - the show is original, fun, and very well-written.  River is so well-played by Summer Glau; I found her character completely fascinating.  I also loved Alan Tudyk as Wash; he's great.  A wonderful actor, whether in comic relief or one of Wash's more serious moments.  Jewel Staite as Kaylee is another wonderful character: you can't help but love Kaylee.  In fact, the whole cast is fantastic.  I've heard Whedon hopes to make a Firefly movie, and I sincerely hope he does.  Until then, I will continually watch the DVDs.  Oh, and on a side-note, many of the commentary tracks that come with some of the episodes are a lot of fun, particularly Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion's commentary for the episode Serenity.	5.0	A great show	2004-01-17	8	7	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25QXNHCLQM04Y	Kuro Ori	"After hearing the reviews of this show(which I've never seen but definitely heard great things about), it reminds me of a certain show I love. It's not live action, it is actually an anime, straight from Japan. It's title is ""Cowboy Bebop,"" though the people who watch ""Firefly"" and the people who watch anime aren't really alike, the genre, style, plot and ""grittiness"" of an advanced, yet not very flashy future are almost exactly the same. Like ""Firefly"" the characters are all very individualistic and all have a future they are aiming for, separate from the future of any one character aboard the ""Bebop""(their ship).Quote from the plot summary from wikipedia:""The 26-episode series revolves around the often violent adventures undertaken by the arguably mismatched crew of the BeBop spaceship. The crew is made up of four unique characters: Jet Black, a former ISSP police officer who retired following a mob hit that cost him his arm, Spike Spiegel, a laid-back exiled hitman of the ruthless Red Dragons' Syndicate, Faye Valentine, a beautiful amnesiac con artist who awakened into the future world after a lengthy period of cryogenic hibernation, and Radical Edward, a hyperactive and barefooted preteen girl with a reputation as a prolific computer hacker. They are also accompanied by Ein, a hyper-intelligent, genetically-engineered stray Corgi dog.By a strange twist of their respective fates, this foursome ends up partnering together, using their unique talents to become a ragtag team of bounty hunters, although their fortunes as such are at best mixed.""Sounds very familiar.If you are a fan of ""Firefly"" I recommend watching ""Cowboy Bebop"" it's a great anime, and don't be drawn away from it just because it is animated. The mixture of humor, drama and action is amazingly well constructed and once you start watching it, you will end up watching the entire 26 episodes, it's that good. Also it was made 4 years BEFORE ""Firefly"" so if you think Bebop stole the idea because of it's very similar qualities, it is the other way around.(If you do decide to watch it, I strongly recommend the Japanese version with English subtitles, Japanese voice actors are infinitely better than English voice actors, but if you are turned off by having to read what is going on, the English dub is not so bad either)Have fun watching either of these shows, I'm sure you'll have a great time!Link:Cowboy Bebop Remix: The Complete Collection (Anime Legends)"	5.0	Sounds a lot like a certain anime?	2012-11-19	6	3	3

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A32W6O80V2Y4QW	kuvasza	"Firefly was a wickedly quotable television series that aimed too high, hit its target dead-center, then got cancelled by Fox Exec's whose job descriptions must read &quot;separate wheat from chaff... dispose of wheat...&quot;The set includes 4 DVD's and 14 episodes, presented in the order the creator Joss Whedon intended.  Although the show was cancelled, each episode has tremendous replay value, and the series is as quotable as Princess Bride (&quot;My name is Inigo Montoya...&quot;), Pirates of the Carribean (&quot;You cheated!&quot;  &quot;Pirate.&quot;), Legally Blonde (&quot;... endorphins make you happy...&quot;), Whedon's own Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or any of a number of well-known and oft-quoted series and movies of the last few years.  Three of the 14 episodes were never aired, a real treat.Firefly's dialogue is some of the best of the lot and the entire series is approachable for fans of old westerns, especially episodes like &quot;Train Robbery,&quot; &quot;Safe,&quot; and &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot;  Fans of twisty, devious plots will love &quot;Our Mrs. Reynolds&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot;.  Fans of Mission Impossible-style capers will love &quot;Ariel.&quot;  Those wanting strong character development will love &quot;War Stories&quot; (&quot;That was the torture talking!&quot;).  In fact, through the entire series the characters grow and evolve with each episode, which is possibly why Firefly died an untimely death.The cast of characters was dead on in nearly every single episode of this series with the possible exception of the last episode, and even that ends in a satisfying way.Whedon wrote fantastic male and female characters.  There's Zoe (Gina Torres of Matrix: Reloaded fame), who shines in ""The Message"".and has some of the most quotable lines.  There's Morena Baccarin as Inara, who is a: gorgeous and b: just too funny for words towards the end of &quot;Our Mrs. Reynolds&quot;, both in the delivery of her lines and the expression on her face.  Jewel Staite played Kaylie beautifully, especially in the episode where she joins the crew (&quot;Out of Gas&quot;).  Yet with strong female characters, Whedon didn't fall into the pit-trap of making the male characters weak, bumbling or inept.  The relationship between the Doc and his sister is much of what drives the series forward in this first season and the chemistry between them is perfect for close siblings (&quot;Safe&quot;, &quot;War Stories&quot;).  Mal is a fantastic character and after Firefly was cancelled, Whedon used Fillian to very good effect in the final episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  A show is sometimes as good as its villain and he made a fantastic villain in those episodes.  Baldwin as Jayne is superb as a treacherous, self-serving mercenary, occasionally hilarious (&quot;Jaynestown&quot; has at least one fantastically quotable line and his performance in &quot;Ariel&quot; was side-splittingly funny).  Zoe's husband is at least two different people and his relationship with Zoe is precious (&quot;Not every one gets Zoe and me, right off...&quot;).  Ron Glass (Barney Miller?) was the most enigmatic and potentially one of the most interesting characters as a Shepherd, a man of faith with a murky past, and one could easily see an entire season's story arc revolving around his character.  None of the characters is overshadowed or forgotten in the span of 14 episodes and all of them are worth watching.But alas.On the upside, there may be a movie.  Also it may well be that the series plays better in DVD format than it did on live TV with commercials interrupting the flow.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Too good to last	2004-01-06	11	11	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2N057NNTW5274	"K. Villar ""an enthusiast"""	"If you're not a Joss Whedon fan, if you're not a sci-fi fan, if you're not a western fan, there is still a chance you might enjoy this show.I am a fan none of these things  (in fact, I would say I hate a good number of those categories), but I still enjoyed the series enough to buy the DVDs. There are moments that are corny/cliche as well as moments that were not too well acted. The way in which Chinese and western culture is integrated is a little questionable. Although Chinese culture is an important aspect of the backdrop, there aren't really Chinese or Chinese American actors acting as a major charcter. In fact, I don't believe there is even a minor character. Also, in either the first or second episode the cast is walking through an international market sort of setting. There is a sign saying ""Good Dog"" posted above a barbeque area. This seems to suggest the stereotype that Chinese people eat dog, which is of course not good. But these moments are few and barely take away from the overall experience of the series.The strength of this series is what it tries to accomplish and the extent to which it does this. There is comedy, drama, action all well integrated into a well written and ambitious storyline. The dialogue and characterization is great. Almost all of the characters in this series are endearing. Three episodes in and you feel like you know the characters and want to continue to know them for a long time. The sci-fi and western elements of the show are executed in such a way that makes it accessible to non-fans as well as less gimicky, which I definitely appreciated.I highly recommend this series. Don't be afraid of the sci-fi and western. The storyline and characters is what relly gives it its appeal."	4.0	great series even for the non-joss whedon/western/sci-fi fan	2006-07-04	9	7	2

"Firefly was one of my favorite sci-fi shows to ever air.There, we've got that out of the way. The show itself had its flaws, no question. The standard romantic subplots were not only predictable, but sometimes horrifying to watch (Sean Maher's ""Simon"" talking to Jewel Staite's ""Kaylee"", for example). The tired Remington Steele-Scully/Mulder ""In love but in denial"" sequence has been played to death well before now, and took some more hits in this series.Ron Glass as Shephard Book was denied some decent lines, given some great ones, and often forced to play the relatively unconvincing role of one Who Brings Inappropriate Morality To The Forefront. It was grating, sometimes, to see such obviously weak characterization forced into play.Those were some of its weaknesses, and they were glaring. But the show drew me in despite these flaws. The interactions between crew members, especially the moments of normal life, were compelling. This cast obviously enjoyed working together, and the writing for them was typical of Joss's style: realistic conversations between real people.First sci-fi show I've seen where ships in space make no sound. Gunshot wounds bleed, and continue bleeding. People (especially Malcolm Reynolds) make hard choices, and ethics in a hard life aren't as clear-cut as we've been told to believe.The surprising humor of this show, which was a mixture of great interactive writing and excellent deliveries from the cast, was a true treat to see.Essentially, and I suppose I could have summarized it earlier, Firefly was truly a Space Western. Exploring the lives of gritty anti-heroes, nasty villians and hardships both personal and environmental in an action-packed way.It was NOT realistic. But it wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be a saga of anti-heroes, a couple of rebels, a treacherous lunk, two felons and a ship built for smuggling, and what they did in the worlds around them, both good and bad.For what it was supposed to be, Firefly performed exceptionally well. Even my bride-to-be, who hates westerns, found herself involved in the show and wanting to see what happened next. That Firefly was given a bad air-time, weak advertising, inconsistent scheduling, and eventually cancelled, is not at all related to how well crafted the product was.If you liked the Spaghetti Westerns, Batman (the movie) and/or Alien Resurrection, you'll want to see this show.If you watched the series already, then I doubt anything will keep you from getting the set. ;)"	5.0	The series, not the DVDs.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZWZHQEJLFZIX	K. Worthington	"Granted, I've never been much for television, but this would have changed my mind.  Firefly is, without a doubt, the best tv series I've ever seen, and Fox should be ashamed of itself for canceling it.  It has action, humour, suspense, romance, and the witty dialogue Joss Whedon has made famous.  The writing is superb, the action top-notch, and the 'verse becomes truly real, and a place that you want to reach out and touch.  As the PVP t-shirt says,  ""Joss Whedon is my master now"", and this show is why."	5.0	Simply the best	2008-01-25	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A14N3A5RKC6HW4	L. ADAMS	Firefly is an amazing show.  While I admittedly missed its original run on television, I was captivated by the show when I saw it on DVD.  So much so, I purchased the series myself!  It is filled with drama, humor, romance, intertwined plot lines, and more humor.  It is Joss Weedon at his best.  I watched some of Buffy, was (and continue to be) a huge fan of Angel, but Firefly is without a doubt Weedon's shining star.  It is too bad that the show didn't get more than a shortened one-season run.  The story line is riveting, and becomes increasingly complex and interesting as the lives (current and past) of the crew of Serenity are revealed to the viewer.  The characters start out believable, but become even more so.  The very best part, however, is the sharp and sometimes biting humor laced (Joss Weedon style) throughout the episodes.  You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, and laughing at the same time.  My hope is that the movie based on the series (Serenity) may draw enough fans to possibly lead to a re-release of the show on television.  If you like sci-fi, westerns, comedy, and romance, then you should try Firefly.  It is definitely a remarkable mix of them all!	5.0	Sci-Fi at its best!	2005-09-11	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1DZYCASJNC9BQ	Lady of the Loch	Firefly was a marvelous series that caught the hearts of many. It's lead character Mal, a man with a sad an tragic past, leads a small ragtag crew of faithfuls to stay alive in the new era lead by the (evil) Alliance. They take any job that comes their way (legal or not) and run into trouble at every turn.I like the description &#34;Space Cowboys&#34; to describe the show. There is a western feel to it combine with technology 500 years in the future.If you have any qualms about buying, get rid of them. This series is excellent and can be good family fun.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NGSDV7Z0FM1Z	Lady Shelley	One of the best written programs ever made for television.  Once again, network execs refuse to see the gold in their midst.  The series is a blend of old west meets final frontier with characters that are real, and believable.The series contains 4 disks with all episodes made of the series including the original pilot and three episodes that never aired. Programs are in widescreen format and overall good quality disks.  The sound is crisp and clear, and the video is very good overall though there are some problems with blacks getting grainy.If you didnt find the serie when it was airing, and lets face it they did make it easy to find, don't miss your chance with the DVD's.	5.0	Excellent Series	2005-08-15	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IO1ESNSIAXG3	L. A. Kane	Walking out of the movie Serenity I remarked to a friend of mine that I was really impressed and hoped they'd make a sequel. A day later he loaned me the DVDs for the television show. About an hour and a half later I bought the boxed set for myself. It's become one of my all time favorites yet I don't even remember it being advertised back when it originally aired. I'm truly impressed and that is no easy feat since I typically read books for entertainment, and even mediocre speculative fiction books usually blow the socks off of even the best television and movie productions of that genre.There are thousands of reviews already published on this site so you probably have the plot down pat. I'll add that it's much like Babylon 5: good acting (occasionally even great acting), a believable universe, intricate plots, and truly original scripts, all wrapped into a very creative, totally fun package. If you liked the movie and have not already seen the series you've got to get a hold of a copy.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ANCZV7DX2ZCR1	"Lane Stephenson ""lanedebbie"""	I watched a few episodes of Firefly during it's TV run but never really got into it.  I thought it showed promise, but it's Friday time slot and periodic preemption meant I didn't see much of the show during it's TV run. I can't say exactly why I decided to get the DVD set, but I am very, very glad I did.FOX's second biggest crime against Firefly (the first being lacking enough faith in the show to give it a fighting chance to find an audience) was their totally random episode broadcast order.  On the DVD set, you can trace plot threads and watch characters grow and change.  The rules of the Firefly 'verse are clearly shown up front in &quot;Serenity&quot;, rather than at the end of it's TV run, so things make more sense.But is it any good?  In a word, &quot;yes&quot;.  Most ensemble casts take a season or two to really come together as a believable &quot;family&quot;, but the very talented cast click from the first episode.  The stories are intriguing and well written (again, the proper episode order makes a huge difference), visually, both the show itself and the CGI are beautiful and the dialog is packed with patented Joss Whedon humor.My biggest concern when buying the set proved to be unfounded.  The series only ran half a season and was unceremoniously dumped by FOX, so how many dangling plot threads are there and (shudder) did it end with an unanswered cliff hanger type ending?  &quot;A few&quot; and &quot;no&quot;.  The characters are deep and unlike on most shows, not every bit of information you need to know about them is spilled in the first 20 minutes.  As such, you do have some questions you wish the producers and writers had been given time to answer (and probably will in the movie currently being discussed over at Universal), but nothing that takes away from the overall saga.  The ending of the series itself is very satisfying and leaves you wanting to spend more time with these characters, just as any good TV show or movie should.Just think of it as a 15 hour film that is ripe for a sequel (or two, or seven).  Although it is complete unto itself, it still provides lots of room for future growth (after all, Joss was planning for this to last a few years).  For what you would normally spend on +/- two DVDs, you get 15 hours of very re-watchable primary content, plus some decent extras and good commentaries).  If you took the time to read this review, you are obviously thinking about buying it.  Do it and you will never regret your decision.	5.0	To anyone sitting on the fence...	2003-12-29	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2S0WOS8DW2GMB	Lange	"If your thinking about getting a set of firefly and have access to blu ray this set is the spot on choice. If you've seen it on dvd or have it on dvd already the picture of this set is truly great compared to the dvd. I watched the series on dvd when I borrowed it from a friend and just got my blu ray set in the mail just now and I can already tell huge differences from just watching the pilot. The 1080P picture of the blu ray is no comparison. For a little technical details it is unique they kept the original ""grain"" that the show had and was intended when it was filmed but remastered in 1080p. Some reviewers have complained the show doesn't look as good as other blu rays because of it and other reasons but I personally think it is unique to the show. You will see when you watch the set it is a perfect balance of keeping the original authentic feel of the show and making it look great on blu ray. No this set does not look as good as a new release top of the line movie but even still it is very surprising how well the transfer worked. If you are a hardcore fan of firefly trust me and get this or if you have it on dvd and have the money get this set. It is the best the show can possibly look right now and makes it that much more enjoyable. The only downfall is it is pretty expensive compared to the dvd (almost double or more somewhere in high 30's to 50 or 60 dollars depending) but is it worth it by far. Shell out the extra penny and have a set that will last for years whereas your cheating yourself with the dvd as this show is probably going to look as good as it ever will at least for the foreseeable future."	5.0	Great	2012-07-30	1	1	0

It was interesting to see &#34;Lady Heather&#34; from CSI, playing a similar role on one of the episodes.  If you enjoy a story of people living on the edge, flouting authority, indulging in petty crimes, but working with each other honorably you'll enjoy this show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2NG6NL7WY2E0A	"Lara ""Pug Love"""	"Joss Weldon has the enviable position as writer and director of this prematurely canceled television series that through the support of fans and a not to surprising amount of DVD sales, spawned a brilliantly written, directed and acted main steam movie - after the show was given the axe! Who else can claim such a phenomenon? This movie brings some of the complex sub-plots to a  place of moderate satisfaction to those of us who are devote followers, however I was very disappointed that Wash was killed by the Reavers. It also carries off its own stand alone plot well enough to capture the uninitiated's attention as well. No small feat in itself. Another endearing quality of this short series is the cast Mr. Weldon brought together. The ""Weldon style"" extended family of actors has perfect chemistry. The cast will draw you into the ""verse"" in such a way that you will believe you are part of their lives. Once you have watched go back and turn on the commentary with Joss, you will find it very different than most as Joss is refreshingly un-bloated with arrogance. If you are a sci-fi aficionado, you will be pulled into the cult following and will feel the undeniable pull to purchase the series release on DVD. Be a part of the family who makes their home on the Firefly class spaceship Serenity, if only for the 14 episodes. You will find yourself wishing it did not end and hoping the series would be resurrected by Sci-fi network. Judging by the 2000+ positive reviews here an Amazon it certainly appears that it would be a lucrative endeavor. Undoubtedly you will wonder what form of insanity befell FOX for them to give this jewel the death sentence. Here our out-cry! Network want-to-be ""gods"" bring the series back!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1K3JIO6G5NLRV	Lark	As of three days ago, I had only heard of Firefly. I had seen a small clip of its sequelish movie, Serenity. I was up all night watching the series, and only took the briefest of naps before I continued onto Serenity. I'm only sorry to have taken so long to put in the first disk.This show is phenomenal. The casting is superb, as is the world that has been created, a unique  one, with a dash of Chinese culture that makes it all the more believable. The story doesn't focus around how amazing a fighter this person is, how they see a can see lie the moment it comes out of a mouth... no... It focuses on the entire crew, and how they fit together. How they mesh, mold, and clash.This series has much potential to go on, and forward. I've seen Buffy and Angel, and thought them fair shows. The plot is still there, waiting, with threads of the story still hanging lose, snarling.This is fantastical in every sense of the word.

One of the many who had never seen it on tv, but got the chance to see the dvds, and are now addicted and unfulfilled. I am a long time Buffy fan (I own every season), and even though my friends are shocked to hear it, Firefly is better. The first time I saw it I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning watching it. I finished the whole dvd set in one night/morning. When I finally finished the last episode, it hit me...there won't be anymore. I was immediately sorry that I had crammed it all into one night insted of enjoying it over several, and now I've seen the whole season three times in one month. There was so much left undone, and unsaid. I like to see the end of things, call me crazy. Even if I know it will suck (ie: Matrix Revolutions), I still want to know how something is going to end. I was happy to hear there was going to be a movie, although I still have yet to hear a release date, and interested in seeing how Joss does after doing tv shows for so long. The only thing that worries me is that Firefly, like all good tv shows, was meant to unfurl over an extended period of time, whereas movies have very limited time. But I have faith in Joss, as Fox should've had. So basically what I'm trying to say is that in my opinion, Firefly was and is the best show I've ever seen. And I too am counting the days...if only I knew how many I had to count.	5.0	Better late than never.	2005-03-02	14	11	3

It was a great show that ended too early. Every episode, I grew to like the characters more and more.  The crew of the Serenity was a group of very unique personalities and you grew to accept them as part of your family. You not only like these people, you learn to care about who they are and how they came to be on Serenity.Captain Reynolds kept you smiling with his laid back ways yet he had a heart of gold. His humor and compassion reminded me of a cross between Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.I've described this show to others as a western science fiction show.  It is set in space yet it is filled with scenes with horses, shoot-outs and bar room brawls. Everything about it makes it enjoyable and fun.Even though humor is a part of ""Firefly"", there are moments of intense drama and darkness. You experience many things with the crew-sense of family, loss, loyalty, love, suspense and laughter.""Firefly"" was also made very well.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"I got both ""Firefly: The Series"" and the movie ""Serenity"" for Christmas.  The former is the late lamented television show that was the brainchild of Joss Whedon, creator of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" (which explains why the title ""Joss Whedon's 'Firefly'"" appears a lot).  The four-DVD set ""Firefly: The Complete Series,"" includes all 15 episodes of the series, which is set 500 years in the future and reminds those of a sense of television history that ""Star Trek"" was originally sold as ""Wagon Train"" to the stars, because the western elements of this series are as strong as the science fiction elements.Since this is a Joss Whedon creation the obvious question is what sort of twists did he put into this one? The most obvious is that this is a science fiction series without aliens. Apparently there was nobody out there after all (or else they are hiding really well). The other major twist is that in the future there were just two superpowers, the United States and China, which explains why the characters tend to curse in Chinese now and then. I think if more people had known that there was a television show that was more explicit that ""South Park"" that would have meant high enough ratings for ""Firefly"" to survive. Finally, you have to appreciate that if this is Western set in outer space it is one that existed after the Civil War. Clearly Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) has the die-hard spirit of a bitter Confederate veteran.From my perspective the only real problem with ""Firefly"" is that it lacks a strong story arc for this abbreviated first season. I might be making too much of this, but one of the strengths of Whedon's other shows was that he always makes excellent use of story arcs, using by wedding a first half story arc to another one in the second half of season. The closest things we have to driving story arcs are (1) the mysterious Alliance forces trying to capture River (Summer Glau) and her brother Simon (Sean Maher) and (2) Mal and Irana (Morena Baccarin) wasting time insulting each other instead of getting on to business (so to speak). Both of those are clearly there, but things were progressing too slowly for my taste. I know Whedon had some big payoff for the first one, but he was keeping it awfully close to the vest and if this revelation is not a major part of the planned movie, I will be totally surprised.The strength of the series is in the characters of the crew, all of who are realized with some degree of depth. My favorite was Kaylee (Jewel Staite), who was smart as she was cute, a killer combination in my book. Captain Mal Reynolds was the most fully realized of the crew, mainly because he had a pivotal role in most of the episodes, but with the rest of the crew of ""Serenity"" you know there was more to come. We got a little of the back story on what Mal and Zo (Gina Torres) did during the big war, and there was a flashback that told how Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) and the rest of the crew were hired on by Mal. But it is the secret behind River Tam's strange condition that is is going to be the key in everything that happens next, which you will now when you watch ""Serenity."" It was also great to see Ron Glass as another familiar face in the regular cast.Of the 15 episodes collected here eight of them have commentary by various cast members (Fillion, Baccarin, Tudyk, and Staite) and writers (Whedon, Tim Minear, and Jane Espenson) and others.  The additoinal special features include three behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, Alan Tudyk's audition, Joss Whedon singing the ""Firefly"" Theme, and a gag reel (the last three are actually three separate things).  Each DVD comes with its own thin plastic CD box with shots of Mal Reynold, Shepard Book, Jayne Cobb, and Zoe Washburne posing in front of assorted nebulas on the respective covers (Notice that the alien landscape continues inside the slipcase).The more I watch ""Firefly"" the more it grows on me (Kaylee is currently my favorite character with her combination of cuteness and competence, although after watching ""Serenity"" it is hard not to be totally captivated by Summer Glau's River).  I just wish ""Firefly"" had not come at the expense of ""Dark Angel"" in terms of FOX's willingness to spend money on a show with a big special effects budget.  The irony that both shows were gone before the 2002-03 season was half over is not lost on me either. In a much better world than this one both shows would have survived, but having neither is really the short end of the stick for fans of science fiction on television."	5.0	Another television show with great potential gets shot down	2005-12-29	33	31	2

I never saw the show as it aired, or even heard of it. I saw the first disk as a rental at my local video store, and picked it up as a lark and was stunned.

Order it from Amazon!I bought the rest of series sight unseen, I was quite pleased anddepressed.. You see it was a great show, a classic show, but it was gone already.It was like falling in love with a movie star from the fifties, or a author who has passed away.Brilliant but gone, a bitter sweet thing that was not lookedfor, found and then lost.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1I434QHV2W13R	L. Baumann	"After years of hearing about it, I finally watched the whole series of Firefly online. Quite frankly, I can't believe I went so long without seeing it. Although it can be rather cheesy at times, Firefly is a wonderful sci-fi series with amazing characters and an interesting world. While the series as a whole is fantastic, the pilot, ""Serenity,"" and the final episode of the series, ""Objects in Space,"" are some of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. The ensemble cast is terrific, and I'm disappointed that the series had such a limited run.However, I have a few qualms with the DVD itself, which I received as a gift. Fairly often, the video appears quite low quality and grainy. Although this isn't a total deal-breaker, it's very distracting at times. The same goes for the audio, since once or twice I had a bit of trouble hearing what the actors were saying. While the sometimes less than stellar quality of the footage isn't EXTREMELY irksome, it would've been nice if a little more care went into making the product. Then again, if Fox actually cared about this series, it would still be on the air."	4.0	Amazing Series, Just an OK DVD	2010-07-04	3	3	0

But alas, this show was mishandled by the network, leaving it adrift and homeless.  That's where the fans came in.  Taking matters into their own hands, the Firefly fans wrote and promoted and spent and worked to get this show back on the air.  Although no network has yet to pick up the show - the fans won one battle that no one even thought was on the table:  a feature film.  Yes, Firefly was the first canceled television show to get it's own wide-released feature film (Serenity) on the big screen.  It's a great story, and I recommend it to everyone!

It was also hard to imagine Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, and Adam Baldwin being enjoyable to watch after I'd seen them play major baddies on Buffy and Angel.I'm so glad I got over that.Firefly was a wonderful series, more ""adult"" than the other two. It's wonderfully written, the acting is great, and the visual experience is beautiful. Since I got the DVDs I've watched the whole series two or three times, and now I'm getting my friends into it. The commentaries were great too. Nathan and Alan Tudyk are hilarious together. And you can always count on Joss to add his wisdom.Any Whedon fan should definitely have this in his/her collection.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2YQZ6M4LWEEJ	"LBRyder ""LBRyder"""	I bought the series without knowing a thing about it because it was selling in the top 50 with 1700 reviews averaging 5 stars. I'm adding another 5; joining the cult!A beautifully conceived storytelling treat, in book terms a page turner. Complex likeable characters, the women so physically *gorgeous* that the eye was pleased no matter what else was happening; the tension and the shocks and the ruthlessness and swashbuckling adventure-tales with brilliant 'taken for granted' high tech moments which didn't drown you in their 'cleverness'.I am sure this will be revisited for countless years by so many who will see it as a classic, just as now I am enjoying watching the Kung Fu series from the 70s. Owning DVDs is like owning good books; you can collect a library of your favourites.Watching the special features cheered me up some. I had read so often how this was a 'failed' series pulled by the network and I assumed that the the creators may have been feeling low down and discouraged, but it seems to be not the case. Everyone associated with it knew it was brilliant and it was interesting that perhaps because the series was under stress, it may have influenced its edgey punchiness for the better.Has it won any awards? Yes? No? Me ... I'd give it the Hugo, the Nebula, the John Wayne, the Bruce Willis, the Hugh Hefner, the Kill Bill ...	5.0	Legendary	2005-10-14	4	4	0

The show is a great mix of drama, suspense, humor, action and adventure.The characters of the show are unique because even if the characters dont get along (Simon, Jayne) they will help each other when the time calls upon it. And each character has their own faults and plus sides that make them seem more than just fictional characters.And if great characters and story lines dont get you into it then the very good CGI space scenes will surely grab your attention.Firefly is a show all it's own and its a shame that it had to be taken off the air and just having people telling you about it isn't enough, to actually get the full gist of what everyone is ranting and raving about you need to actually see it with your own two eyes and the best way to do this is to buy the complete series...believe me you wont be disappointed!	5.0	Joss Whedon's Best	2004-01-05	3	2	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Q2TTT2FWWJBO	L. Chrisman	"I had seen a few episodes and knew I would enjoy the entire series so bought the DVD Complete Series. However, I am disappointed with some aspects of the DVD Set. It was a good decision to move the `Serenity' episode to the beginning. Though aired as Episode 11, the writers originally intended it to be the pilot. It was the last episode aired before cancellation though three more episodes were released 7 months later. I think the show would have lasted longer had `Serenity' been aired first as it introduces everyone and includes the why about many things.What I don't like, nor do I understand, is that other episodes are placed randomly on the set.  Most sets have the shows in order of release, this set does not.  I am still confused with the timeline of the series.  Per IMDB, the set's three ""NEVER AIRED"" episodes were aired 7 months past the series end.  But IMDB shows episode 12 as airing after episode 13 & 14. I think the dates are a misprint on IMDB as the DVD set Special Features allude that ""The Message"" was the farewell episode.The DVD jackets show Heart of Gold, Trash, and The Message as NEVER AIRED. I know this is false as I have seen all three on television myself.The Special Features shed light into why the show is not on any more.  My impression, FOX exercised too much control and doomed the series from the beginning.  Had they allowed Joss Whedon the freedom granted Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright for Stargate SG-1, firefly would have lasted much longer.  Then unanswered questions could be answered, such as who was the Sheppard really?This show is great to me because, aside from being in the future and outer space, it's not always the extraordinary each episode as in a Stargate SG-1 or Atlantis. The show presents new ideas each episode and the characters are everyday people to whom you can relate. Looking at the timeline of Stargate you see its lesser years started at the same time firefly was released.  I guess FOX wanted another action-packed series and did not find it in firefly. It is a shame they were so short-sighted to miss the brilliance of this series.References:Disc Set Episode Order======================Disc 1: Episodes 11, 1 & 2Disc 2: Episodes 6, 7, 3 & 4Disc 3: Episodes 5, 8, 9 & `NEVER AIRED' 13Disc 4: Episodes `NEVER AIRED' 14, `NEVER AIRED' 12, 10 & Special FeaturesIMDB episode list: [...]Full episodes are also available at this link."	4.0	Good show but disc set needs some help	2008-09-17	4	2	2

I guess I kinda assumed it would be around and I'd get to it later when it was in reruns.  Well, we all know how that went. :(  When the movie came out, I had fellow sci-fi geeks--er, fans--tell me that I HAD to go see this--that it was SOOOOO incredibly good.  Well I hemmed and hawed but went to go see it and like so many here, absolutely fell in love with it.  Saw it again the very next week.  In my opinion, it was taken out of theatres way too soon.Well I just had to figure out a way to get some more somehow so my friends told me that the series had been released on DVD, so I got them from the library and did a (nearly) marathon watching party. Well I am now officially addicted to Firefly so I must buy this now.  It's absolutely worth having as part of my permanent collection and I simply don't collect series, not even any of the Star Trek series.  The movie was everthing Star Wars III should have been.

The only thing keeping me from curling up in a fetal position is the promise of the movie ""Serenity"" in September 2005 (Serenity is the name of the Firefly-class space ship the show is based around).  I can tell you what everyone else has said: The actors are great, the writing is great, the show is great, but what I'd like to add is that the FILMING and the MUSIC are STUNNING!Zooms.  Overshots.  Actors half in frame.  Focus adjustments!  Who's put focus adjustments in a TV show in the last decade?!  It's great!  It really does make you feel like you're THERE, watching the action and eating the dust left behind!  And the music?  The music isn't just in the background.  It sets the stage.  It quietly and subtly pushes your emotions along with the plot.  You can't help but feel what the crew's feeling!But back to thought #1:  Space Western?  Definately!  No aliens, no ""Anomolies,"" just classic plots.  A train robbery!  Saloon fist-fights!  Travelling circuses with proof of ""Alien life"" that's just as realistic as we have today(a.k.a fake)!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3T27DXB4MJICO	lebra	removed this series from the air.  I loved this show.  There were a few things that could be cleaned up a little but it is a show for adults.  I loved the plots, the futuristic theme and realized that even in the 26th century people are still the same. This show addressed that very well. The cast seemed to work well together, and meshed into their characters.I would love for some network to pick up this show and keep it on the air.  I feel that the network was hasty in letting this show go.  The characters just improved with time and I believe would continue to do so.  I found myself laughing, crying and just amazed at the occasional corniness but it also had drama.  Someone should pick this up.	5.0	It is a shame that the network....	2014-05-14	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A8LL0UL6IQRZP	lee	I'm sad there's only one season of Firefly.  The characters in this series are fun, interesting, and bounce off one another excellently.  It's a great lead into the Serenity movie as well.  My only negative comment is that the tv series has a slower pace than the movie, but the characters are great enough that it's not a detriment to the star rating.  5 stars!!	5.0	Phenomenal Show	2011-10-22	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2DSBRN6SGL6EC	LeeHoFooks	"Yep. It's true! I finally got around to watching ""Firefly"" a few months ago. I'm a full time student with a full time job so I'm pretty wary when it comes to taking on new interests that have the potential to distract me from studying. Let's face it; normal people can read a book or watch a TV show and move on with their lives, but nerd hobbies are all-consuming. Fearing a repeat of last summer (during which time I watched all 5 seasons of ""Angel""), I decided to give ""Firefly"" a shot only when I found out how short the series was. ""Just 14 episodes and a movie?"" I thought, ""How consuming an interest could this show possibly be?""Well what do you know? I'm hooked. I was hooked right away, in fact. The theme song got me. (I'm not even kidding.) I've read some books in my life that really had a profound effect on me. I've seen fewer movies that moved me as much. But for a television show to do the same is exceedingly rare.As of now, 3,110 people before me have written 5-star reviews about how ""Firefly"" is one of the greatest shows of all time, and about what a waste of potential its premature cancellation was. Honestly, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said by at least a couple thousand other ""Browncoats."" The one bad thing about my ""Firefly"" experience is that watching it was a little bittersweet. On my first viewing, it was a bit depressing to take such a heartfelt interest in the characters, all the while knowing there was so little left of it to see.Fortunately fans have been given some closure with the excellent 2005 film ""Serenity."" No, it's not the 5-7 (or so) seasons the series deserved to have, but it's a fitting end nonetheless. Having seen the film, I no longer feel depressed when watching the episodes.So if you're even later to the ""Firefly"" party than I was, I highly recommend that you see it. But consider yourself warned: For ""just"" 14 episodes and a movie, ""Firefly"" packs a big punch."	5.0	I Can't Believe I Hadn't Seen This Show Until Earlier This Year	2011-07-02	4	3	1

We loved the movie, bought it as soon as it came out on DVD and have watched it several times. When I realized it was a show, I immediately bought the DVD set and we're still watching it. We're so upset that we only have 1 DVD left before we're done! After every single episode we watch, I feel the need to reiterate, ""I can't believe they took this show off the air!!!"" We'll be watching it over and over for years to come, I'm sure. I love everything about the show - the characters, the relationships, the intensity and the light-hearted moments. It's just so much better than anything else out there right now. I really hope that DVD sales of both the show and the movie prove to the networks that this show deserves to be resurrected ""Family-Guy"" style. I can't say enough.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3PU1XWNENGO9B	Leighland Feinman	"It irritates me that a large percentage of the negative reviews for this show have some kind of agenda, such as ""This other canceled show I liked is better, you should go buy it"" or ""The fans of this show are artificially inflating its reviews.""  See, they're not artificially inflating reviews; they LIKE it because it is GOOD, and they review it as such.  That would be how reviews work.This series wasn't always the most polished that it could have been, and it had some plot flaws. The acting wasn't great, but it had some really powerful moments.  But every TV series has its flaws, and the strong points of this show make up for these minor issues.But it had some of the most brilliant creativity of any show aired in the past five years.  The idea of taking elements that had *all* been done before and combining them in ways that made it feel fresh and new was brilliant.  By cutting and pasting things from other genres and time periods, everything felt more genuine.  The really amazing element of this show is that Whedon and Minear managed to take the right pieces of each genre such that they would blend well.This is a show that makes one question morality, that makes one question belief, and that brings a lot of humor and action along with it.  The lines are witty, and the lesson in the end is that the only person who can guide you is yourself- every character, from the captain to the prostitute to the preacher, learns this at one point or another.  It's not about putting forward an agenda; it's about learning that agendas are just ways for other people to tell you what to think.You shouldn't buy this show because of my review.  I think it was awesome; you might not.  You should buy this show if you are interested in it and think it could be a lot of fun.  It is as-advertised; a Western in Space.  If you don't like westerns, if you don't like sci-fi, don't go for it.  You won't like it.  If you like either of these things, or both of them, you'll have a good time.  Don't look for me to tell you what to think about it; the series speaks for itself."	5.0	Without an agenda, this show is awesome	2005-11-28	8	8	0

I like to support good art and good shows.  So my Blue-Ray purchase was well justified.This show is really great.  I love it.  I hardly ever watch TV at all, in fact my finding this show was just by accident.  I was clicking around on Netflix a few weeks ago and happened to just stumble on Serenity.  After watching Serenity, I realized that the movie was based on the Firefly series.  So decided to watch Firefly as well.I have to say this is one great show.  I put this show on the same level as Star Trek the original series.  Its that good and even better in many ways.  I like the grit and gunplay on the show.  As well as the sarcastic jokes and cursing in Mandarin.  Very creative and very very good!

Joss Whedon's only mistake, I suppose, was making a show that wasn't about surgeons, lawyers or cops.  Then maybe Firefly would have had a chance.  Maybe if he'd written another copycat crime drama that took itself too seriously, or some meaningless and mundane sitcom, he'd have had something that would go on for season after season.  But no, he made something really .... COOL is the word for it.  Quality.  Unique.  Heaven forbid the network powers-that-be would let that continue.Update October 2012: Going on many years now and still have not watched the FOX network since their shameful treatment of this series.

"It is quite unbelievable that Fox network, after viewing the show many times has messed up the timing of the series (Second eps. first, first eps. last), and consequently killed the show because most of the viewers did not have a clue as which is which since the start of the series around year 2002. After a friend has recommanded to me the entire DVD set, I was still being skeptic about the name firefly, it sounded like a low budget sci/fi that did not make it to the big screen, boy was I ever wrong! I not only became a loyal fan and a active messenger for many of mine friends, but I also felt like part of the crew on a lonely cold space journey. Never before was I ever so attatched a TV series.I've been anticipating the movie for quite a while and it is worth every minute; however, certain outcomes from the movie in my opinion will definitely impact the future of the show if there is one. Unless they come up with something very creative like a prequel, or more things they did on their journey before the movie. Although there are a lot of unanswered questions still out there as to what is the true background of the preacher and the outcome of the captain and the companion's relationship etc. Many of the questions surrending the ""gifted child"" has been answered which is a big selling point of the show. If Josh Whedon wanted the show to contiune, he wouldn't have answered many of the questions in the movie.In my opinion, the series premier is a two hour episode which is pretty much like a movie and let's just view the movie as a two hour and half Grand Finale. If there will be future epsodes, I will be very much interested, so will every single person I told about this show.Peace"	5.0	Maiden Voyage and Final Hour of Firefly	2005-11-21	7	1	6

By the time I got around to watching the hilarious episode, ""Our Mrs. Reynolds,"" I was beyond hooked.

She wouldn't watch television with me if she saw &quot;that little planet in the corner of the screen&quot; (Sci-Fi Channel), refused to watch any of the Star Trek or Star Wars or Star Anything films.And then came Firefly.She started watching it with me, from the the series premier.  At first, it was to humor me.  Then she got into it.  Then she got royally angry when the show was cancelled.  Even she was surprised at how much she enjoyed the series.  It should say something about how well the show was written if a person who clames to despise Science Fiction can be drawn in.The characters were well-developed, and unique.  Even if you describe them as a cliche &quot;gunfighter&quot;, &quot;doc&quot;, &quot;preacher&quot;, they were all so much more.  And the show was somehow able to develope those character profiles without beating you over the head in the process.  Each flashback or insight into their thoughts was done so flawlessly that you couldn't help but be impressed.I had no idea that this complete set was going to be released, but I know where my wife and I will be when our copy arrives:  Curled up on the couch and completely entranced.Trust me on this.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking series that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, Firefly, along with Serenity, is definitely a series worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your DVD collection, as it will surely provide for hours of entertainment!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2KG9OJJVQAN9I	"L. hogue Maurice ""ldyhawkem"""	If you were a fan of Buffy and Angel, and more than that, a Joss Whedon fan, you will love this series.  The first couple of episodes left me a little puzzled, but by the end of the series, I was thoroughly in love with all of the characters, the music, the storyline and everything to do with it.  I have since bought Serenity and the Firefly soundtrack.  For me, Joss Whedon's writing and views of a possible future world are fascinating and fun.  This series is fun, imaginative and sheer enjoyment.  And, if you are a music lover, the Firefly soundtrack is a must have.  The music is incredible and it hasn't been off my CD player since I purchased it.	5.0	Joss Whedon Fan	2006-01-15	9	8	1

I watched it when it first came out and as any Brown Coat will tell you, it was short lived,but remains one of the best shows anyone who enjoys sci-fi can watch.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A15SH88X0BWTQN	Liam Gregory	This is probably the best science fiction series ever produced even though there are only 14 Episodes.I have bought one copy of the DVD for myself and another for my Dad and we have both been blown away.  Its such a weird mixs having both elements of western and science fiction, but some how it just works.  The dialogue is funny, and fun without becoming tacky or cringe worthy.If you feel let down by the volume of rubbish that studios produce these days... buy this and remind yourself what it is like to enjoy something special.	1.0	Wow	2004-02-08	430	51	379
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A214BWT7B37LSG	libbylou	Wrapt in sorrow, of the high quality sort, this show is so intensely real it drenches you in its spirit.  Written with a poise and reflection only attained by the best fiction out there (and i am normally of the sort to espouse the quality of the written word over anything obtainable on screen), this show transcends both genres of book and moving pictures with the marriage of an incredibly rich script and an absolutely gorgeous presentation.  The diverse cast of characters includes Jayne, a gunman with loyalties to himself first and foremost and with an interestingly twistable set of morals.  He is basically the down and dirty type, but is humanized by his occasional reactions so basic in nature as to be almost childlike.  There is Zoey, the ex-military commando woman with a tough and straightforward way of thinking.  She never quite broke out of some of her military habits, including her way of relating to her superior officer. Zoey served under Mal, the ship's Captain, while they were in the failed revolution together, yet she is married to the ship's pilot, a doofey hawaiian shirt wearing man.  There is the 'companion', a sort of legalised prostitute and escort who had to attend college to obtain the respect and credentials given to one with her title.  She and the captain appear to have some interest in eachother, which obviously leads to some awkwardness for a working girl like herself.  There is the preacher who mysteriously has knowledge much at odds with his chosen profession, the doctor and his sister who are on the run from the law, and a sort of hippie hometown girl who plays the ship's mechanic.  All in all, the interactions of the vast array of characters and the dangerous situations their smuggling profession puts them into, are used to the utmost in an extremely creative and illuminating manner.  As a portal to this frontier created by man's exploration into space and the struggle to establish communities on new planets, each step you take into this universe will only make you miss it more, because it only offers more possibilities as the story thickens.  I have yet to see the Serenity movie based on the show, but as far as Firefly is concerned, it is simply the best constructed collaboration out of anything i have seen for the moving picture genre.  Besides the obvious interactions between the characters and their environments, the interactions between the incredible story, the simply poetical directing and the superb acting, all came together and played off of eachother to create the most well-made, stirring set of relationships and scenes i have ever seen on a tv screen.	5.0	so good, it makes you want to cry at how few episodes there are	2007-11-05	4	3	1

I have seen all seven seasons of ""Stargate SG 1"", and it is quite obvious that the Colonel loves Carter even though it is not always shown. This keeps the interest of the viewer flowing.  Another thing, in the last episode, the companion says she is going to leave the boat... I can't believe this! She addsbeauty and elegance to the entire plot.  If she leaves the storywill be completely different, and you'll have to really bring out the other characters more!

Such as, when he killed the kid from the war, if anyone else had done it he would have hated them forever, this way he did it can hate himself and continue to not forgive himself for all he has had to do &/or done.	5.0	Superior	2014-03-22	0	0	0

They are criminals but with ethics.  Huge amounts of suspense, violence and plot twists.  The story lines are good but the violence is a little to much for me.  This is supposed to be in the future but there are lots of cowboys on horses that just dosen't seem to fit in the future but that is my opinion only.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30P4VAUJHF31H	Lindsay Archer	"Firefly has an intriguing plot, realistic characters, and witty comments that keep you glued.  There are no perfect, idealistic characters in Whedon's universe.  They are people trying to scrape by with good and bad qualities who learn and change throughout the show, making them sympathetic and realistic. Joss Whedon's writing resembles Buffy in the fact that the show cannot be seen out of sequence without you missing something, usually involving the evolution of the characters, but it is not fair to compare it to Buffy/Angel.  This is a new universe.  As Star Trek was supposed to be a Sci Fi Western, concealing the Western aspect, Whedon does the same, but unabashedly flaunts this ""New Frontier"" with horses and cattle.  The result is a show that appeals to a wide range of viewers of all ages.  Sci Fi lovers, Western lovers, and many in between. I know very few people that  have been introduced to Firefly that were not hooked after the first episode, which did not air until it was canceled."	5.0	So wonderful, they had to cancel it!	2005-10-17	2	2	0

Maybe it's realistic - as a frontier, space probably would have some Wild West aspects to it.You don't have to be a scifi geek to enjoy this series.  If you've never seen Star Trek or haven't seen Star Wars in 25 years, don't worry about it.  This series has enough for the geek and regular viewer alike.

As with all Whedon's work, the characterization is sharp, humorous and spot on. There is a large cast about whom you will care almost immediately, and the acting and FX are all first rate. Unfortunately, &quot;Firefly&quot;  was not well promoted and after being moved around was cancelled before all the episodes were even on TV.However, all 14 episodes made are on this set, together with many extras including commentaries by Whedon on several episodes. Also,  a feature film, &quot;Serenity,&quot; has recently been announced for 2005. If you need another positive review to convince you to buy and watch this show, well this is it!

The writing is witty, the characters flawed and believable. The ship, &#34;Serenity&#34; is a main character and has the beauty of an old friend. The effects, for a TV show were actually really quite good - the silence of space is a particularly strong concept, helps you really feel the vastness of space.

If you are new to the world of Firefly/Serenity and you like great characters, action, humor. love, sadness, triumphs and failures, then this is a great buy for you.

My favorite episodes are 'Serenity', 'Safe', 'Jaynestown', 'Ariel', 'Heart of Gold', and 'Objects in Space'. Check out the special features! See the movie when (not if!) it comes out!

JW shows his immense talent as a storyteller in Firefly. He did an extraordinary job of creating mult-dimensional characters and weaving them into entertaining plots. I'd be curious to see what JW could do if he were given the opportunity to do something with the Trek franchise... As for his own creation, it's too bad that Fox shelved Firefly.

I wasn't expecting much..having never been a fan of science fiction shows or westerns for that matter. However...this series completely blew me away. After just one episode I had to order Serenity so that I could watch it when I was done with the series (which I finished the next day). Amazing, amazing show. It's smart, touching, very well written and acted, hilarious, everything you could want from a TV show. It breaks my heart that it was cancelled so prematurely.For a little show that was only on for half of a season, shown out of order and with almost no marketing - to have inspired this much passion from people...you know that this is something very special.	5.0	I've never felt this way about a television series	2007-07-03	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IX96OBV3BGR3	Liz	"I heard so many glowing reviews about this. So many of my friends kept gushing about it, tossing about words such as ""inspired,"" ""visionary,"" and the like. So, I decided I had to see what they were talking about.Unfortunately, I came to a conclusion very early on in my viewing, one that didn't change through the rest of the episodes. Other than the Holy Trinity of Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, from which I can quote most of the dialogue and feel compelled to watch whenever I run across them on TV -- I don't like Westerns. I don't hate them but at best I'm just indifferent to them; they bore me.Being as objective as possible, I think Joss had an awesome idea. Sure, _Star Wars_ was the original Western in space, but Firefly didn't try to disguise it under a thick layer of pure sci-fi, it *was* a Western. It just happened to have spaceships and other planets. It's brilliant, really, and on the right network it should've run for a good five seasons. The acting was good, the plots were good and it had a loyal audience. FOX sucks as a network, that was the problem.But even if it'd had a seven to ten year run, I wouldn't have been one of the regular viewers. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the ones that took place solely within Serenity or within space itself, where it became straight sci-fi with little to no western in sight. Once they hit planetside, my interest waned and I started looking at the clock on my DVD player, counting down the minutes until it was over.The theme song was pretty bad, too. Yeah, the words were good, but the tune sucked and so did the singing. But, then again, I think country music sucks as a whole, so I'm probably biased.This really wasn't the series for me, unfortunately, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending it to people who like westerns, which I've done many times since. This may not be a show I personally enjoyed, but I do think it was a good one and it shouldn't have ended when it did."	3.0	A western in space. Literally	2006-01-12	36	15	21
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1XK78VXIP8Q21	Liz Miller	I don't watch much TV anymore, there's just not a lot out there I find interesting.  But I have been a Joss Whedon fan since the first season of Buffy.  And you know what?  Even I didn't watch Firefly when it came out on Fox.  I saw about 15 minutes of it and thought, enh.  Then the series came out on DVD, Serenity was being made into a movie, and I thought I'd give it another chance.  I'm so glad I did.  There are some great episodes here, and they're (gasp!) in order -- Fox originally showed the second episode first for some reason, it kept getting pre-empted and moved around so it never really found a home.The pilot is a wonderful introduction to the series, but one of the best episodes, Out of Gas, also serves as a good introduction.  Just watch it, you'll see.Also I'd recommend watching the bonus features at the end (and I never watch those).  This was how I finally understood why all the characters just randomly burst into Chinese phrases.  Apparently Joss's version of the future makes note of the fact that the US and China are the two major superpowers, so naturally  everyone would be sprinkling Mandarin Chinese into their everyday speech.  This is never really explained in the series, and once I understood that, I just thought it was brilliant.Of course, I think everyone should be a Joss Whedon fan, but let's face it, then what would those of us who are have to feel superior about?	5.0	It's a goram shame there aren't more	2005-10-07	5	4	1

The episodes were not aired consistently, and I would miss several due strange network scheduling.  Plus, I had trouble making sense of the story arc; I thought that this was because we'd never seen the original pilot until after the show was canceled.When I watch my copy of the DVD, I realized how much this wonderful show had been wronged.  Not only was the spectacular pilot not aired, but the shows that were aired were shown in the wrong order!  No wonder people were having trouble following the development of these characters!  I've never been particularly impressed by network executives ideas about their audiences intelligence, but this a huge insult to all of us.  Let them know how wrong they are, buy Firefly and let them know the viewers were there.I'm a huge fan.  This set is well worth the asking price.

Let me put it this way: if you frequently need to have knock-knock jokes explained to you, you won't enjoy anything Joss Whedon does. If you're like me and you enjoy surprises and quirky, subtle humor with usually likable characters, then you, like me, will think that Joss is somewhat of a god.Or you could just listen to these types of reviews: ""Poor screenwriting is killed this show."" Yes, do lets put a major typo in our review that criticizes someone else's writing.Bottom line: Fox has made (many) mistakes in the past. (""Family Guy"" anyone?) ""Firefly"" was another such mistake. It's a show that had two major strikes against it from the beginning. It had the crap-crappiest time slot ever, and it defies typical genres, which most of the below average public just can't understand or handle.If only it had been a reality show!

It didn't help that I wasn't a fan of Joss Whedon's previous shows, Buffy and Angel.I wasn't immediately hooked, either, due to Fox's messing with the airing order. I liked it well enough to stick with it, but that was all.I am very glad that I did; once I became acclimated to Whedon's nonstandard take on the future, I came to truely love the show. The characters are fantastic, the dialog crisp, and the acting is natural and true. Firefly is, quite simply, the best show of the new millenium so far, despite its short run.There's a kind of critical mass to Firefly. Once you've seen a certain amount, even the episodes you weren't previously impressed with take on new dimensions, and you find new enjoyment in them. Therefore, I would encourage everyone to purchase this DVD, even if you weren't thrilled with the show while it was on. There's a good chance you'll love it anyway.

Then, tragically, like all too many shows with original characters and plots, it was axed long before its time. I'm going to write to Fox again and tell them what an utter mistake they made in canceling this fascinating, unique gem. Then, if the cast is still available try to encourage Fox, or even better the Sci-Fi Channel, to pick up this show and run with it. Other networks try for years and years to create the kind of rare chemistry of an ensemble cast and story lines that work as well as this show did from the very first episode.

Some of the allure is in the fact that it was cancelled way too soon and that a lot of people (like me) discovered it only later.The best thing about it is the well drawn characters and the unique story line. So much sci-fi is just the same old same old that has been around since Buck Rodgers. There are no aliens,ray guns or teleportation here. The story is based on 19th century American culture, but this is not really &#34;a Western in Space&#34; as the series has been often portrayed, but a tale about the aftermath of civil war, immigration and the mingling of different peoples with a bit of social commentary. There is a strong anti-bureaucracy element and a quest for independence.Still,it is the characters that make this so good. Everyone has their own backstory that is slowing revealed (though you have to watch the spinoff movie Serenity to get it all). It is no wonder that there is such a cult following for Firefly.	5.0	a show with a lot of heart	2014-07-10	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3VI0J0DMCH05Q	Lorelei	Only 14 episodes and 1 movie. How could Fox cancel this show!?! Joss Whedon is a master at creating a character with 3 quick lines, an ensemble is in a couple of scenes and a universe in less than 15 minutes. The problem is after you've entered any of his worlds you suffer withdrawal symptoms immediately upon leaving them. So here I am... I've watched all the episodes at least twice and the movie 3 times. I'm contemplating looking for a spin-off paperback, but deep down I know that won't help. Maybe Fox will see reason and Joss Whedon will renege on earlier statements that he is done with Firefly and Firefly will start anew! And maybe gas prices will return to double digits. Anyway, I recommend this series to one and all. Please Mr. Whedon if you read this at least consider returning to TV!!!	5.0	Hopelessly Addicted	2008-01-11	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1UG4Y9PHYTEOU	Lorraine Culbert	While I am a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan, of Westerns - not so much. I wanted so much to like this, but  - despite the great cast - I kept experiencing cognitive dissonance with the uneven blend of futuristic space and &#34;old wild West Earth&#34; settings and themes. That being said, I will also give &#34;Serenity&#34; a try. The series has so many ardent fans, I must be missing something. Or maybe it's just that I can't get over the heavy Western element.	3.0	Great cast; wrong setting (for me)	2013-10-29	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3Q5JUMVUV7WG	loserboy	I should point out that my interest in science fiction, guns and blowing up stuff is limited.  If it is cleaver, if the dialogue is snappy, if the characters are well-drawn, then I can get into it.I do like Buffy, and Angel, on occasion (particularly this final season) is reasonably good.  I figured that this series by the same creator might be very similar in mood.The first episode, which took me two sittings before I could finish it (I fell asleep twice) was maybe 2 hours long.  I don't know.  It began with a battle scene, that made little sense to me, and then we actually get into the story, much of which also confused me.Often for a series, with episode two, you often begin to see some potential, and with episode three, a good series can begin to hit some high notes.  Well, I haven't gotten to episode 3 yet.  Episode 2 was less boring than episode 1 (which I recommend you skip until later).  But still, this is just moderately-interesting people in space with guns shooting other people who also have guns.  I am assuming the genre's which are being mixed are sci fi and westerns.If you are a sci fi fan, and you like star wars and star trek, then you'll probably like this.  If you like to watch various groups of people shooting guns at each other while flying in space ships or after they have gotten out of their space ships, then this could be the series you have dreamed of.  There is a plethora of gunplay, explosions and space ships.  For some people, you couldn't ask for anything more from a series.  There were all kinds of people who gave this series 5 stars.  If you are not specifically a sci fi fan, then be forewarned, this may not appeal to you.If you are looking for something as cleaver and insightful as Buffy could be (at its best), I haven't found that yet.  If you are looking for a heated argument as to who would win in a fight, astronauts or cavemen, well, I haven't found that amusement level yet either.  I've only watched 2 episodes, and I don't know if I am going to watch a 3rd. So, maybe it picks up and gets better?  I may never know.	3.0	pretty average	2004-05-21	68	6	62
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APCUHWVKWROT4	"Lost In Kansas ""James Corbett"""	This is going to be a strange review.  I bought this series in 2002 because I remember that few shows I saw I liked. It came in and I started watching and well I stopped after the third show. Time passed and the movie came out and I bought it,watched it, and I had my fill of FIREFLY. Then this summer{2007} I moved and as I packed I found my copiy of FIREFLY.  When I unpacked I put it out on the DVD player for later. Well after five years I got around to watching it.  I watched all 13 shows and the extras.  There are FIREFLY addicts out there who love this show as the Trekkies love STARTREK.  However I am not one of those, but I fell under FIREFLY's spell.  I really loved the characters, the ship, and the music. The later episodes were eye openers for me.  They contained subject matter that I never expected from this series.  For example Inara's love interest with another woman.  Mal's love scene with a madame.  The married couple preparing for battle and fighting over having a baby.  The last show about the bounty hunter really made me sad because it broght up things that I wanted anwers to, i.e when the bounty hunter said that Book was no shepard.  Remember the show when he got shot and produce his id and the Alliance went all respectfull?  River's deadly shooting was just beginning to show.  Well I could go on and on.  The point for a buyer is that this series was truly too good for tv and we will never see this type of show again. That is a shame.	5.0	A sad goodbye to dead loved ones	2007-07-15	2	2	0

Unfortunately, Fox exercised terrible judgment in killing it off after 13 episodes.  If only this could have been produced today, where it would have been featured on cable (FX, SyFy etc.) on something other than a lousy Friday night slot.  I know this will never be brought back, but it would have been nice to at least have a quasi-spin off that takes place within the Firefly universe--perhaps with different characters and storyline.  Summer Glau has been pretty quiet lately--I am sure they could use her as main character.  :)  Joss, I know you're busy with your movies, but food for thought???	5.0	Great Series that Fox Killed For No Good Reason	2014-02-28	0	0	0

I didn't receive FOX with my ""rabbit ears"" back when this was on, so I had not watched it until recently. One show has the shepherd explaining that the Bible isn't supposed to make sense, it is a book of faith, BUT it does make sense if you read it, study the texts and look at it without preconcieved historical religious dogma.Watching this, I'm reminded of ""Terminator, Sarah Connor Chronicals"", which was also cancelled by FOX and was a great show. Years ago, ""Christy"" was on CBS and it had a huge fan base, but it had loving, good, Bible believing people in it, so they cancelled that (looking back on it, it was a little too melodramic, at least the first season).  Did you know that old sensoring standards said that movie or tv shows had to show God and Christianity in a good light?

The actors made interesting characters come alive.  I'm looking forward to more!I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi and I didn't watch Firefly when it originally aired on TV.  But a friend loaned me the DVD collection and now I'm hooked.  Had to have my own set to enjoy over again and share with family.  The show is somewhat complex and the use of multicultural expressions and dress was at first a little confusing.  Being able to listen to the additonal commentaries helped ""flush out"" the back story.I've enjoyed Firefly more in DVD format than if I'd watch it when it first aired.  The shows were not broadcast in the preferred order, and a couple never made it on at all!

The universe is interesting and original.  The DVD itself has less than perfect menus and interfaces, but superb extra features.Unfortuneately, some people can't wrap their heads around a Sci-Fi Western blend.  If you don't like either genre, than you might be put off by the show, but if you give it a chance, than you'll probably be able to connect with the characters and love the show.  If not, than you can sell it used on Amazon.  It's a ten dollar gamble, which will most likely pay off.A word of advice: Don't read the episode guides on the back of the cases.

It has captivated many people in the world and the one question that always gets asked is why was the show ever canceled. The real reason for the show being canceled is the FOX network. Averaging only about 4.5 million viewers. The show was canceled. The only reason there were never more viewers is because it never got properly advertised By once again the fox Network.

I am looking forward to the DVD as the tension in Firefly is ruined by our Sci-Fi channel placing adverts in the middle of conversations.  Every single character is rich.  They work brialliantly together as a team.  I have not been drawn to any series as quickly as I was attached to Firefly.  Thank goodness for the DVD and hopefully a film.  Although it is unlikely to continue being made after the movie is the massive hit I know it will be, I will keep my fingers crossed.  Stranger things have happened.  They must hurry to sign up the cast though, as the loss of any one of them would be devastating.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1DZNXO12ZRTFV	"L. Veal ""Marrach"""	"When this show debuted the networks tried to bill Firefly as a ""Hip"", ""Funny"", Sci-Fi Western. I still remember the quick-flick promo commercials.""Hip"": that word has been used so much it has lost its original meaning. Firefly stayed away from Star Trek cliches and worse. It was crafted deeply and thoroughly so that nothing in the sets, the FX or the characters would make it ""Dated"". It is just as clean to watch NOW in the age of IPods, as it was years and years ago. The show is not about Technology-- It's about people. That's people with a small 'p'. People like us. Not loverboy Captain Kirk. Not Stuck up Janeway. Not ""Give-me-a-break"" Paternal Picard. Mal is just. . .Mal. Like River said: ""Bad, in the Latin.""""Funny"": In TV land, to call a show Funny is to tell the average viewer they are watching a comedy show. And the average viewer (And I'm not being insulting) who wants to see a comedy is turned off when they are subjected to something different and edgy. Firefly is ""Witty"" in the dramatic way: Edgy, Cutting-- its humor is the smile that comes between sorrows. The laugh is evoked seamlessly without need of an actor's pause for the laugh-track. There are NO lauigh-tracks. In fact, the scene has already moved past the moment that has you chuckling. And in the next instant, blood will pulse from a knife slash and no-one's smiling anymore. The characters are in pain, leaving the formerly chuckling audience wincing in sudden deep, quiet discomfort. Your average TV viewer does not like being made unconfortable by a show they were told would  be ""funny"". That, in turn, made the TV Exec's uneasy. Firefly was not following a formula. Even the sexuality woven into the show was NOT following TV land conventions. It was all tension, tension, tension- with no simple happy resolution at the end of the hour.""Sci-Fi Western"": Admittedly, a different approach, a flavor. But ""western"" can also be a term of derision. Forget Western and think ""Frontier"" in its classic sense. You only see a horse once in a LONG while for the entire series. Cows-- only once or twice. But remember that the Westerns that endure to this day were about the stories of the people on the prairie-- not the Prairie itself, not the horses, not the guns. Think about it--- A horse is a cheaper means of transport on a planet without roads. And Cows? Man without Beef? Never!A fan of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" would see a parallel here.Firefly is NOT a failed Series. TV/Cable/Broadcast Media Failed to recognize a well crafted piece.The Movie Serenity will complete this partial gem. I suggest you watch Firefly now. By the time Serenity is available, and in your player, everything will slide into place as the season finale that never happened all those years ago."	5.0	It bears quiet watching... once, twice and then again.	2005-11-11	19	18	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2JIEQ4SJQ29UH	L. Walker	Firefly is a blast.  It's opening I think is the one of the best I've seen, sets the mood perfectly for the show to follow.  I find myself chuckling often, and thoroughly enjoying most episodes.That said, Firefly is over-rated.  Obviously, that I cared enough to write a 5 star review for this show should be testament to fact that I am actually a fan of the show, and do think it is great.  But after reading all the reviews others have wrote, I almost expected the second coming of Jesus.The truth is, Firefly's best qualities are also a weakness.  Firefly isn't a show like Lost or Prison Break, where the plot is carried on through many episodes... sure there is the issue of River, but it isn't the most epic of storylines.  This makes Firefly light-hearted, and a joy to watch.  At the same time, however, it lacks the compelling nature of other tv hits like the aforementioned Lost and Prison Break... the desire to just plow through episode after episode without a break.At times the show is overly cheesy and predictable, and while the characters and their development are fantastic, the show is rather shallow.  But I still love it, and in fact that is part of the reason that I love it - it makes Firefly kind of refreshing.  Just don't get misled by these other reviews.  Firefly is one of the best shows that graced a television screen, of that there is no doubt.  But it is not the be-all end-all that many of its cult following make it out to be.  Honestly, it isn't even the best sci-fi show - that honor would have to go to Battlestar Galatica.  Then again, there really isn't much that is sci-fi about Firefly, it is much more western than sci-fi at heart.  So for anyone looking for a unique and refreshing experience, Firefly is definitely most highly recommended.	5.0	Great show in many ways...	2006-08-25	12	6	6

It was a BIG FAT HIT for me and everyone I know. I never saw anything online either that would lead me to believe anyone didn't like it of even LOVE it.  FoX did it to Stargate Universe too. It makes no financial sense to me. THis was The Old West, in Space. You know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. You fall in love with this cast almost immediately and wish you were part of the crew.

To my great pleasure, the following series of shows continued to build plot and the characters with a quality in a television program that I have not seen for a very long time.This set is a must see for anyone who enjoys sci fi, adventure, and/or drama, all with a clever twist of humor.

It was the best written show on television, had a fantastic score and characters that you wanted to run away and live with.

Absolutely everyone who enjoys science fiction, is a Nathan Fillion fan, enjoys well written shows or is a Whedon fan (old or new) should at least check this out.And if you buy this and by some fluke don't like it, you can always sell it somwhere because, unlike most tv shows, this one just keeps gaining in popularity.  It's been ten years and it recently had a special made about it on the Science Channel!  It was so good that the cancelled series spawned a major motion picture!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AD38IB5NODZX1	M. 9 Fingers	I purchased the series on DVD elsewhere and I have watched them in streaming HD a few tiles as well.  The series itself is excellent, and it really gives a fresh and interesting view of the eternal conflict between the haves and the have nots.  The pseudo-western setting amidst contrasted primitive technology and super futuristic space travel and hovering vehicles is really interesting.  I would strongly recommend this short-lived series to anyone that is a fan of Star Wars, Star Trek and other genre defining shows and movies that helped shape our expectations of what a science-fiction series/movie should be.  Firefly is in very good company in that regard.I am not reducing my star rating as a result, but $89.99 is an absurd price for this &#34;complete series.&#34;  14 episodes is not even a decent length season, and I can't remember gauging like this since the world was ravenously purchasing each successiove set of Soprano video tapes and DVDs years ago.  With teh discounts claimed here, the purchase price is quite reasonable, but I find the inflated regular price to be an appalling effort to market an otherwise very worthy product through what amounts to shameful tactics.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1IB609MPH85BH	madkiwi	I bought the Firefly set on DVD on the first shipping day. It is awesome that over 6 months later it is still selling strong (currently #46 on Amazon!).When this show was on the air we were confused and angry because of the pre-emptions (for the World Series) and the episodes playing out of order (the pilot was shown two months after the premiere). Let's just say that being an avid watcher was a little bit of work. When it was cancelled I decided that the executives at FOX were not playing with a full deck, it was funny, witty, the dialogue was crisp and fresh- totally unlike anything else on TV. I have pulled out the DVD with visitors over intending to just play a single episode and ended up after midnight having watched 4 or more. Invariably they had never previously heard of the show, but became instant addicts!Watch it, you'll love it.As proof that FOX executives have the smarts of a box of rocks, they cancelled Wonderfalls after 5 or 6 episodes. Gee, the only two inspired shows in the last decade that actually managed to capture our interest. I guess our household demographics are not what advertisers are looking for (2 adults aged 38 and 41, no kids, $150K income, college educated etc).

For reasons uncomprehensible to me, Fox canceled this intelligently written, funny, serious, character-driven, and totally unique show - presumably to air yet another ""encore presentation"" of ""When Joe Millionaires Attack the Simple Life"".  Grr.This is arguably one of the most clever and interesting shows ever done and it makes me so mad that it was canceled.  The DVD has only made the cancellation that much more frustrating.The pilot (when viewed first) is very well done and is a good introduction to the characters and with just enough backstory to keep the plot moving forward.The unaired episodes are some of the best and it's a mystery why they weren't aired.  And the previously aired episodes - well, they lived up to my memory of them.  They were even better the second time around. (And the 3rd and 4th!)I highly, highly recommend this DVD set whether you are a fan of Joss Whedon's other shows (Buffy/Angel) or not.  And if you don't like westerns or if you don't like shows with space ships, try it anyway. It combines the genres in a totally unique and cool way.Let's hope the DVD sales are good enough so we get a movie - and movie tickets sales good enough to bring the series back!!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1VOX8HO29UDE8	Magicians_assistant	Let me start by saying that I have never seen Buffy or Angel, never seen Babylon 5 or Farscape, and my entire exposure to Star Trek is less than five accidentally watched episodes. I don't read sci fi. I don't watch sci fi. I watched Firefly because it was highly recommended by a friend.I absolutely loved it.It is funny, exciting, clever, fun, has interesting characters, attractive (very) actors and actresses and a feeling of watching an old western with a twist.I read through some of the negative reviews (many of which are five star and the reviewer thought one star meant they liked it... seriously) and I should point out some things to people planning to watch Firefly:There are no aliens in Firefly. A lot of reviewers seems to equate aliens with sci fi as a prime element. Well, Firefly has no aliens.Firefly is essentially a space western. It makes use of old style western movie quips and puns, and relationship dynamics that were popular in 1960's western films. Hence, the noble and headstrong captain of the ship makes jokes and puns before a shootout, the hard bitten mercenary is a lovable idiot and such.Since it is essentially a western, it takes place on outer planets where settlers are trying to survive. Cowboy-like life makes sense in this aspect. It is the new wild frontier.The special effects are very good for a TV show.The show is good enough to have gained a large cult following of which I am surprisingly now a member of (Browncoats!)It is a good show, and did not deserve to be cancelled. it is a shame there are only 14 episodes.	5.0	review from a non-scifi person	2008-07-03	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GAINX7PJLP2W	Magin	"This is not a review for fans to read, because nothing I can say will help you make a decision, or give you any new facts about the forthcoming film, or really say anything fascinating and insightful about Firefly.This is a review for those of you who (like me) had never heard of Firefly until Amazon.com recommended it to me.  When that happened, I immediately dismissed the show as crap, because of the description listed for the item.  I mean, really.  It made it sound like your run-of-the-mill SciFi channel crapola.  ""Stake a claim in the action?""  ""Take any job... to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table?""  ""Desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eating Reavers who live on the fringes of space?""  That, friends, is a recipe for an unimaginative, worthless and otherwise forgettable TV series.Thank goodness the description was so stupidly wrong.I'm not sure why I even went out and bought it, two months later.  But, WOW, I'm glad I did.Sure that hard-boiled-frontiersman-outlaw-rough-and-tumble-badass description is part of the show.  What the box doesn't tell you is that -- apart from the very, very good pilot episode -- none of that stuff is at the forefront.  It's never just about the job they're doing, or the money they need, or about running from Reavers, or even running from the Alliance.  Because the writers knew that would be dumb.This show is, honest to goodness, about the characters.  Even the gratuitous geisha (yes, I know they call her a ""companion,"" but I *didn't* know that when I was deciding whether or not to buy the show... and yes, she is gratuitous, so please don't ravage me for not understanding why she's there) character has some manner of depth.  While we may not like every aspect of every character, or even understand why they were written in, the characters are always the focus.  Their decisions, emotions, actions and concerns are what makes the show more than just a scifi/western/action show.But let's not forget the scifi/western/action elements.  Those, like the writing, effects, sets, plots and characters, are supurb.  The universe of Firefly is very rich, always interesting, and something we can identify with.  There's never too much ""western,"" and never too much ""scifi"" to swallow at one sitting.So, don't buy this set because you like science fiction.  Buy it because you like good TV, and good fiction."	5.0	Not what I expected	2004-02-09	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQDI602797FSF	Maigray	Sure, I vaquely remember seeing ads for Firefly when it was actually on the air.  But all they did was make me wince at what looked like a completely unwatchable blend of sci-fi and western.  Another cheaply made, cliche ridden type of bad science fiction television.  It abounds.I have never been more wrong about a show in my entire life.A friend handed me the series DVD and told me to I HAD to watch it; it was sooo good.  Being off for the summer, and with seemingly no good television left on the air I thought - why not?Halfway into the pilot episode, I was hooked.  Completely, totally, irretrievably and obsessively hooked.  I have not been so taken in by a series since...well, I can't really remember.  I have proudly upheld Firefly's 5-star rating here on Amazon, and I do so with absolutely no reservations.  Everything about this show was original, interesting, and well done.  Lots of humor, angst, romance, drama and adventure - and great production values - make this a treat to see.  But the real strength lies in the ensemble cast and the subtle, deep and complex characterizations between them.  This ensemble is one of the finest I have ever run across - and it shows.Do what I did and take a chance.  Nearly two years after this show came on the air, I am one of Firefly's biggest fans.  I am betting anyone who sees the series DVD will be too.	5.0	What A Surprise!	2004-07-25	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1S3BJZKDAEUBV	Malcolm Kantzler	"The short-lived, ""Firefly"" TV series, and its motion-picture successor, ""Serenity,"" are not science fiction, but like Star Trek (which, it seems is forgotten, forged the first fan-recall in TV sci-fi), they are also fan-based, re-born fantasy, but rather in the vein of Star Wars, crossed with the Wild Wild West (of James West), where, without getting too specific, rogues and banded eccentrics, usually shunning fleet ships of the empire, operate their own varietal spaceships (including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, seen streaking the sky during a landing sequence to steal a collectors ray-type gun) between worlds and moons, with environs from sci-fi modernistic to dusty frontier, ground transport from horses to hovercraft, armed with weapons ranging from modified six-shooters, Winchester 1860 carbines, including Steve McQueen's ""Wanted, Dead or Alive,"" sawed-off, large-looped version, to the automatic and large-bore weapons of today's armies, and a partially-effective, futuristic sort of plasma, hand-held device, battling, at the beginning, and then circumventing a victorious, controlling empire in their always-questionably-legal quest to survive each other, their ship, their competition, clients, that empire, and a murderous sect of marauders, feared for their extreme violence, who always threaten but never really materialize until the climactic (but cleverly, also stand-alone) movie.Through all of this, the crew plots-on to keep themselves and their rickety spaceship, named ""Serenity"" intact and supplied when conditions are seldom like their ship's namesake.  The plots and story lines are typical, as they have to be.  But the characters, regardless of their role in the passage they all take together, relate to and interact well with each other, each having their moments without anyone stepping on anyone's toes, contributing to the successful melding that is what makes the crew become more of a family, with characters, like most families, from strange to black sheep and near everything between, of which the viewer doesn't mind becoming a part, sharing the risks, joys, and sorrows, no matter that the circumstances of their existence are tongue-in-cheek.It's good, escapist fun that won't stress your mind; good to have around for those times, every couple of years, when you want to waste some."	4.0	Han Solo, meet James West.	2010-11-10	4	2	2

That was my first thought, but after seeing the first episode it had me hook, line and sinker. Joss is, once again, king of series tv. Not only because of putting this idea together, but also for finding the writers who can carry it off with the style that is this series.I am in love with this show so I am trying not to get mushy, but the characters are to die for. They are all so real, yet bigger than life. Captain Mal, while having a hidden soft side, is not someone that you would want angry at you. He WILL get the job done. Jayne is a character unto himself. He is hysterical at times. While he is the ""muscle"" in the show and I don't think you are really supposed to like him, he is adorable. Maybe not someone you would want to marry, but someone you certainly would want to date. Book...hummm...you have to wonder about him. Zoe and Wash are great together. A perfect blend. Wash is a scene stealer too. Simon and River are great to watch. You are always wondering what is coming up with the two of them. Inara and Kaylee are beautiful. You never get tired of the two of them.The main storyline rolls on show after show and never loses your attention. The substories are true treasures. If you have any interest in an engaging story, great effects and pure pleasure, this is the DVD for you.And a hearty ""Hurray"" that Serenity the movie will be coming out in theaters this fall.I am just thankful that I have DVD sets like this one so that I am spared that horrible reality tv that is everywhere now.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQXSEGB1J0B86	Marcopolo777	This is yet another case where the TV network cut a FANTASTIC series short due to poor ratings on a poor night for broadcast! Joss Whedan (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, etc.) created a great show with this one!  I literally can watch it over and over again within weeks of each viewing--this series along with the movie Serenity (which happens to be the clincher in this series since the show was canceled so early during the first season.) Buy them BOTH!I highly recommend this series! Well worth the money! The plot, storyline, and dialog are ALL great as is mostly ALL of Joss Whedan's creations. These type shows need time to develop a strong following and it most certainly did after the cancellation. Hence, the movie Serenity. The network didn't see it that way and cut it short. Too bad--I would have loved to seen where Joss and the other writers would have taken it!This is a new concept in TV terms and the viewer following would have grown if the network would have kept it around for another season. The cult following is strong!On a side note: Amazon.com performed greatly with this order. I received TWO different sets of this series that had bad discs in them upon arrival.  Kudos to Amazon.com for kindly, graciously, and in a timely fashion replacing the full set TWICE without charge to me. This final set is clean! For this, I am grateful and highly recommend Amazon.com as well!Enjoy the series! Enjoy Serenity! I'm satisfied all around and I hope you will be too!Marcopolo777	5.0	GREAT Series!!!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2SMHYSKPQP56O	"Marcus Bailey ""Marc 'grailwolf' Bailey"""	Having glanced over the hundreds of reviews for this amazing series, I had two thoughts.  First was that I really didn't need to say anything as it had all been said so eloquently and often already.  Second, however, was how amazing it was that so many people have become or remained loyal fans of this too-short-lived show.  I have never before seen so many reviews for any item on Amazon which still maintained such a high rating.  The complaints are certainly few and far between.For this reason, I am throwing my $.02 in.  I can only hope that perhaps some network or studio exec is checking out these reviews and realizing that the audience for the show (and maybe the movie) is so much more vast than they assumed.As for the series, this is one of the overall best things I have seen on television.  I am a fan of Buffy and Angel, and so have some loyalty to Joss Whedon, the creator of both aformentioned shows as well as Firefly.  However, I am also a very critical television watcher.  I watch certain shows religiously but very little beyond those.  I wait for the diamonds in the rough and try to give them a chance to shine before giving up on them, but just have very little time to allow for this.Firefly did not make me go through this process.  It was shiny from day one, even given the idiotic network decision to air it beginning with episode 2 rather than the intended pilot.  I was a little confused as to who all these folks were, but the show engaged me immediately regardless.The concept is not as odd as it sounds.  The master storytellers at Mutant Enemy make this a completely believable universe, and the gifted actors do a wonderful job of bringing to life the characters that are the heart of the show.As I said before, all that can be said about Firefly has already been said.  All I will tell you is that, regardless of what genre of television you normally watch, you owe it to yourself to purchase or rent this DVD.  You will find yourself a member of the Browncoats in no time.Keep flying!	5.0	There's no place I can be since I found Serenity	2004-01-27	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A39SPI825MAHSV	Marcus Cassolato	If Firefly was on a much more appropriate cable network like Sci-Fi or even NBC, I think it would have went AT LEAST 5 seasons.  Fox (the spawning ground for Married...with Children and The Simpsons) was just not the right network to air such a finely crafted show like Firefly.  I know it had SOMETHING to do with Joss Whedon's Buffy/Angel fame that attracted Fox but Firefly's subject matter, although set in outer-space, was completely different and more realistic from the fantasy world of Buffy/Angel.  Such a shame it got cancelled but hooray for DVD!	5.0	This Show Shouldn't've Ran on Fox	2006-11-10	5	4	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AEZ1FHRWKJ7CQ	Mardy	I'm not really sure why I didn't hear about these Firefly series until this year. I'm kinda upset I didn't get to support this awesome series back when it first came out.After watching the first episode, I instantly fell in love with everything from the characters to the story itself.  I just can't believe this series got cancelled.  I love the cast, every single one of them fit in well and have their own unique roles.  Each episodes have a beginning and an end, leaving you satisfied each and every episode.And finally, it's a sci-fi series for those of us that have grew out of Star Wars genre, but not quite old enough to enjoy Star Strek.  I love the adult humor in Firefly, it's mature and refreshing.  Each episode makes me LOL. I've personally always found Star Wars to be a tad kiddish & cheesey at times, while Star Trek to be a tad slow & boring.  Firefly keeps me interested, laughing, and it has plenty of action.Anyways, I highly recommend this to any sci-fi fans.  I can only hope there will be more in the future, as I've already grown attached to the cast of this series.  Both my g/f and I are sad when we finished the last DVD and realized there are no more.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A18S2VGUH9SCV5	Margaux Paschke	"in this short lived tv series.  At first I was wary of a sci-fi/ western show but soon got hooked.  The anti-hero theme seems to be a favorite of Joss Whedon's but no complaints here.  Once again he makes women a force to be reckoned with and I found that the ""Companion"" character (a whore) who was the most respectable person as far as society was concerned in this ensemble cast was pure genius.  All of the universal themes of honor, love, betrayal, friendship and man's role in society are here and comedy threads them all together in riveting tv format.  The character of Jayne (resident macho tough guy) was especially laugh out loud funny.  I watched the series and mourned the loss when Fox cancelled this show along with everyone else, so I was very happy to be able to get all of the episodes in this complete series dvd.  It was great to be able to watch every episode, even the three unaired ones.  However, I was a little disappointed in extras included in this set.  I missed the lack of commentaries the most.

There is a huge Military/Government/Corporate power which is trying to stamp out the Independents (the Brown Coats).  Our 'heros' are trying to live below the radar, to find a life of personal freedom.I recommend these DVDs to anyone who loves driving trips (or getting out on the road on a bike), people who have always longed to 'ride the rails' or jump a freighter (my own personal secret desire), to live outside of society.

It has action, humor, intelligence, swashbuckling, romance, it makes you think, and a really great premise. I can't believe they stopped making it after only 14 episodes--and we still have shows like Dancing with the Stars on TV!The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that the actor who played Shepherd Book at times seemed a little unbelievable. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but he just rubbed me wrong at times. If I could be more specific with my rating, I would have said a 98.5% out of 100%.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2KN89AD9G1NNX	"Mark D Burgh ""Music, Writing, Art, Film, Hist..."	I was no fan of Buffy et al, but my wife told me that Joss Weedon was coming out with a Sci-Fi show, so I gave it a chance. The first episode hooked me bad.  No Star Trek anything here.  Scummy, run-down, selfish renegades, insanity, good boys gone bad, and Animal Mother.  What more could you want?As others have said, if you're reading this, you know the plot/premise, so I won't dwell on that too much.  The anti-utopian universe of this show, however, flies in the face of virtually all space-set television from the 1950's on.  Weedon combines paranoia about big government with piratical parasites, mixing in a dose of The X-Files and a hit of Blue Velvet just to make me shiver with halluncinatory delight.Most sci-fi shows have been about maintaining the status quo, including all the white knights who pilot the UFP starships across re-run hell. Firefly is about running away from the culture, about a failed rebellion against a totalizing post-capitalist galaxy that offers citizens every advance, but brooks no individual eccentricity. The characters on Firefly have been flushed into the sewer of this Universe and they like it.The utter nihilism of this show impressed me.  On the first episode, where the crew betray their smuggling operation to supply drugs to impoverished minors, the gangsters thugs come to menance them and one swears to hunt the crew to the ends of the universe.  Our captain kicks the thug into the turbo fan. I loved the show from that point on.Sure, there were weak points, and the plots didn't always skirt the absolute edge all the time, but seeing a totally immoral, amoral, and vicious character like Adam Baldwin's play against the goody-goody doctor and his crazed sister was just fine with me.Fox made a mistake cancelling this show.

For an old series, that price out to get you the full run and then some.*My rating is for the Instant Video Product offered, not the show itself.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>UPDATE:!!! Fanboys Unite !!!  You can attack me all you want but the Amazon rating system applies just as much to the product offered as it does to the original Movie/TV Show/Book/Whatever. I made it perfectly clear in my initial review that I was not dissing the show (which I, admittedly, had not seen).  I was criticizing the product offered for sale.  Goods damaged upon arrival, goods arriving much later than estimated, incorrect items delivered, Instant Videos that cannot be viewed due to server-side technical complications ... these are all valid reasons to give something a poor review.  Every movie or book purchased is subject to criticism of Amazon itself as well as the author, manufacturer or movie producer.  If you just want to rate a film or TV show then don't come to Amazon.  Go to the IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster.  Don't come here and harass people like me.I have since purchased the the DVD along with the DVD for 'Serenity'.  I have yet to watch the movie but I have watched the series.  I enjoyed it.  However, one defamatory critic who claimed, ""You won't ever find a more entertaining, absorbing way to spend your cash"" was exemplary of all you fanboys.  I've been around the block a few times and I am a pretty good judge of how to spend my money.  The show was enjoyable, but I am sure that the hundreds I have spent for the opera next season will be better spent despite being so much more money.  Maybe you fanboys need to get out more.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1XIGEJ9FMQCRE	Mark G.	With today's lack of quality television, and along with the devestating cancellation of Firefly I have lost all hope for television media and stopped watching all together. The disgusting thing is that while good shows like Friefly and Family Guy are being cancelled by FOX (The great, evil opressor of quality) moronic TV shows like &quot;my big fat fiancee&quot; and &quot;american idol&quot; are being aired instead. Excuse me while I vomit... Reality TV makes me sick.The thing we can all hope for is that DVD sales continue as they have. Then abe we'll get our well-deserved movie. If the motion picture hit's the silverscreen, someone might just walk up to Joss and say, quote &quot;Why don't we make a sereis out of this?&quot;.For now we have to wait patiently as Joss tries to get the movie through the various obstacles facing him. What we really need is to promote the sereis using &quot;Gureilla tactics&quot; (see fireflymovie.com) and something that would help out really is if by a miracle it re-aired on sci-fi or another channel (maybe UPN?).I know this isn't a review of the disk set. I simply don't have words for how good this show was and how it affected me. I just hope you all &quot;keep flying&quot; and aybe the series will get off the ground again.Thank you, Joss	5.0	The best sereis to grace my television's screen.	2004-02-04	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A19SFZIVC8RRDJ	Mark	I started watching this series on and could not stop.  This is an amazing show, and I can't believe FOX killed it the way they did.  I tried watching the show when it was on TV and I hated it, but what I did not know was that they showed the series out of order and they showed the first episode (the one that makes the whole series believable) last.  The can only think that they deliberately killed the series, but I don't know why.  Maybe an executive made the decision to green-light the series then got fired and his replacement was a moron.  Maybe FOX just wanted to make Whedon happy to get their hands on Buffy and Angel syndication for FX and FOX.Anyway, let's get to the real review.  The acting is great, the writing is both funny and moving, the Chinese accents are horrible (but hey, at least they tried), and the series has a much stronger opening half season than Buffy or angel ever did.  Edlund adds a humor to the series that left my side hurting at times.Top notch show.  I am sad to say I was happy to see it go when it was on FOX, but after watching the series, in order, it is far less confusing, and _the_ best sci-fi show I can think of.  (Well Maybe Automan was better, but I was too young to make a sober judgment on that show, I admit).	5.0	Best series on FOX ever... is it too late to bring it back?	2004-02-04	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3VND5SPIKATWZ	"Mark Horn ""Jiiri"""	"Oh boy, is this show a joy to behold. I would just like to add the 1911th plea for this show to be returned. It's my belief that if this show had been allowed to run into a second season, word of mouth would have propelled it into Star Trek-like cultural awareness. It's that good. In a lot of ways, it's much better than Star Trek......gritty, grungy...real. Like most others that have reviewed this show, I was led to it by a friend, and I resisted. I received it (Firefly - Complete Series Box Set) in the mail one day from him unannounced. Still, I sat on it for months. The thought of a sci-fi western with Chinese influences just made my stomach churn. Finally, on a bored afternoon, my wife upstairs doing homework, I popped it in.I watched 2/3rds of the first episode and was in tears with joy and laughter, and fully in love. I ran upstairs and begged my wife to abandon her responsibilities and come see this. As expected, she resisted as well, citing the same reasons. ""Sci-fi western? Honey, I love you, but....you know that's not something that I would enjoy.""Well, I begged.....and begged. She finally acquiesced to 1 hour, 1 episode to make me happy and get me off her back. 14 hours later we had a deep, collective anger towards FOX for cancelling this gem. Both of us have since become, like so many others, Firefly evangelists. And so far, as I spread the word, not one has resisted.This show just brims over with quality. Every aspect of it is masterful. Please, please....bring it back, someone. Let's all buy lottery tickets, and if one of us hits it big, our problems are solved.And thanks Joss."	5.0	Firefly - *sigh*	2005-12-15	18	16	2
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2CG4UR3T6AN86	MarkJ	My wife and I purchased this series to watch. We like SciFi and this seemed like an interesting possibility. It is a strange combination of cowboy lore and SciFi, which is unique and fun.The actors immediately caught our interest and we were able to get to know them fairly quickly. We thought they worked well together in their various missions and troubles. We especially liked the fact that the captain stood firm on his convictions and was able to command the ship/crew in a strong and sensitive kind of way. He is also a bit of a mystery.For the SciFi and story lines, I would give this series four or five stars. However, the sexual innuendoes, and occasional crassness forces me to give it only three stars, and in some episodes deserve one star on this count. The next to the last episode -- I think one of the unaired episodes -- was especially crass and the sexual theme was distasteful to us. Unfortunately, the captain was unable to stand firm in the midst of temptation as well, which was disappointing.Most of the episodes are not like this and many times we ended an episode wishing for more. We were sorry to see the series end, despite my negative review in part. There are many loose ends which would be nice if they were resolved. I agree with many reviewers: it is frustrating that networks lower the boom on the continuation of a series without giving the writers and producers enough time to wrap up details. I guess that is the way it is in network television, one of the reasons we have stopped watching network TV.Bottom line: a fairly good series that SciFi lovers will enjoy. And if sexual content and crassness is no bother to you, then you will probably love it from beginning to end.	3.0	Interesting Series, A Bit Risque	2013-02-09	2	1	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3L8R6HQ8JGMKK	Mark Klobas	"I must confess that I missed ""Firefly"" during its brief run, and was only introduced to it when a friend gave me this set for Christmas.  After watching it, I can't believe that I passed on such a wonderful series - or the stupidity of the FOX network in botching its presentation.I'm not going to echo the same praises sung by the many positive reviews of this set, only to say that I am in agreement with the wonderful things written about it.  This is television at its best, with quality acting, good special effects, and some of the best writing around.  Each episode draws viewers into a developing story, and while not every episode is perfect (in particular, I found ""Safe"" to be rather formulaic and disappointing), each can also stand alone in its own right as an entertaining tale.But one of the most interesting aspects of the set wasn't on the discs but on the slip cases.  The progression of the episodes in the set seems natural upon viewing, yet upon reading the airdates of the shows I began to understand why the show was cancelled.  They offer stark testimony of how FOX shuffled episodes around and broadcast them out of sequence, turning a clear and progressive narrative into a confusing jumble of events.  It's led me to conclude that in this day and age the only way to truly appreciate what the creators of television series are trying to achieve is on DVD, where it can escape the idiotic tinkering that network executives constantly undertake.So watch this and see a television series as its creator intended it to be seen, free from the moronic meddling of network executives that have marred the fate of so many good shows."	5.0	The way great television should be seen	2004-02-27	10	9	1

We American TV consumers are idiots, and we pay for it in talk shows and ""reality"" TV.Like many others here, I was captivated by the quirky ads for the film ""Serenity.""  I was hooked from the first landing of that great little ship and crew.  I saw the movie again a couple of days later, which I rarely do.  A little web searching, and I found the DVD series.  I've just finished disc 3.This series (and related film, ""Serenity"") capture the best of what it is to be a human, and the worst.  In the persona of Capt. Mal Reynolds, Nathan Fillion plays the ultimate redemption tale; a man who has been on the right side and lost the battle, a man who has lost his faith yet remains good at the core just because.  The series teaches, with humor, drama and poignancy, what ""love"" really is.I thought I was just getting these for me.  My 17 year old, very cool football playing son ended up watching the whole series in one day while home sick from school.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FOEVVNPL9N10	Mark O. Hilstad	Firefly was intelligent, funny, original, and unique.  The characters had individuality and depth, and were very well acted.  The people who cast this show were either geniuses or very lucky, since I can't imagine a better choice for eight of the nine main characters, and the ninth was quite good as well.My brother bought me the DVD box set for Christmas, and in the next two months I watched every episode at least three times, and most of them more.  The only bad thing about Firefly is that it only lasted half a season, and every time I watch an episode I end up mad at Fox for prematurely terminating a show that had more potential than any other series I have ever seen.This is what television should be.	5.0	A rare example of what television should be	2006-03-15	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A129UUJMZ6K8O0	Mark Robert Kaludy	Joss Whedon created an amazing program which in some ways was before it's time, and through an unfortunate set of circumstances was cancelled well before the later ground swell of followers were able to appreciate the genius of this series. From themes addressing the potential corruption of an overexpanded centralized government to the required survivalist mentality employed by  those who choose to live freely in new frontiers where the influence of that government and the accompanying law enforcement are minimal, one cannot help but become absolutely intrigued with the characters and their accompanying moral ambiguities and personal flaws. The moral and intellectual relativism between the characters creates a dynamic which presents each as flawed and incredible at the same time,drawing you in to the storyline behind each character. In turn, one cannot but help to make an emotional investment into the truly three dimensional characters presented. The only down side is after the last episode, you will find yourself saying, &#34;That's it?!?!?!&#34; And wishing it had been allowed to continue.	5.0	SCI-FI Master Piece	2014-03-26	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AUVTMOAWSWIXB	Mark Rojas	Firefly is the short lived series created by Joss Whedon, director of the hugely successful Avengers movie. This series meet its unfortunate end too soon because as the episodes suggest there are plenty more adventures in store for the crew of the Firefly class ship named Serenity. The movie &#34;Serenity&#34; is a follow up project resulting from the show's cancellation and is the best follow up to this complete series set. As an aside, I watched the Serenity Movie way before watching this series and was pleasantly surprised how much this show expanded on the relationships within the small space-craft.The High Definition graphics were a bonus and transition well to the current standards.	5.0	Joss Whedon Classics	2012-12-03	0	0	0

They are not out to explore strange new worlds, not contact new civilizations. They are out to make a fast buck and are not finicky about legalities in doing so. Firefly was a kind of space western with situations and dialogue that were top notch. (Example: The Captain of the star ship retorts to one of his crew, ""I'm pissed off and heavily armed, so why are we having this conversation?""(...)It was too bad that the network put the series in a bad time slot, showed the episodes out of order, and then cancelled the series before it could find an audience.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A317SKV5OC4SE8	Mark Talmadge	Most would probably agree that their interpretation of Josh Whedon isn't all that great. I found myself along these same lines mainly because of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Slayer and Angel and I've never considered myself a fan of his work. While I had watched Buffy on more than one occassion it was mainly due to the fact that there was nothing else on at the time so I watched it during those offbeat times.Then, when Firefly aired, I had caught an episode or two and soon stopped watching it for various reasons but I think the main reason was because it didn't hold my attention at the time. When the series was announced to be coming out as a DVD Boxed Set I was like okay, I think I'll pick this one up and considering that the price at the time, $34.99, was more than enough of a reason to check out this series. After watching the first episode, I soon remembered watching this series on television and sat through all 15 episodes of this set. I soon became enamored with this series and quickly wondered why this show hasn't been brought back by the powers that be.Recently, Universal Studios just released the movie Serenity, the big screen adaption of the television series which served to wrap up the lingering plotlines that were left open in the television series and served as a finale tribute to the short-lived television series. Even if there were no more Firefly projects in the works it was nice to return for a visitto this wonderful universe of characters.Josh Whedon's direction for this series is plainly evident in these epsiodes that accompany this wonderful set and considering the multitudes of science fiction that is available this is one of those very rare science fiction shows that actually fares a lot better than Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Andromeda and the like. The writing for these characters in Firefly actually is so well written and well acted that you can't help but fall in love with the characters that take you along for their adventures.It's just a shame that not many science fiction fans have discovered this series just yet. There are some episodes that are quite amusing and the writing of some of the episodes is so well done that it's believable and doesn't leave you shaking your head and wondering how the shows writers can defy the laws of gravity or physics. Evertything about this show doesn't leave you feeling like you can't feel for these characters or what they are going through.If you get the chance, you really should check out this series. I'm a hard fan to satisfy, especially when it comes to science fiction, but this series really needs to be experienced in its entirety before coming to a final judgement call on the show.The western theme of the series did die out after the sixth episode, mainly due to the studios concern with Josh Whedon and the deviation away from the western theme also seemed to make the acting a lot better as well.	5.0	Science Fiction Westerns: Firefly Soars	2006-01-13	8	8	0

Maybe it was just a mood, I don't know.  But I have several friends that swear by this show so I rented it, then immediately bought it.  What a fantastic show this was (and in April 2005 will be a motion picture).  I can't rave enough about the quality of acting and writing in this short-lived series.  Neither myself nor my wife are easily hooked into a TV show but we both were right from the beginning.It's a kindof western sci-fi, where post-wartime humans are pushing out into the ""wilderness"" of space.  The show portrays these little bands of poorly-stocked colonies in a western motif (maybe how it would actually be with little or no supplies), while the center of ""civilization"" planets are more urbane and clean.  The crew of the Serenity routinely travel between the richer inner-planets and poor outer ones, looking for their fortunes and running into all kinds of trouble.Don't let the fusion of wild west and sci-fi trip you up -- it's really quite brilliant and probably more realistic than the way traditional sci-fi is portrayed with sterile environments and beautiful overeducated people."	4.0	My new discovery	2004-08-23	5	5	0

The only reason why I spent money on Firefly is because it carries the all holy name ""Joss Whedon"", which us Jossverse fans know him ""GOD"". Which he is. So I decided to look into it.I was afraid it was going to be another ""hyped show that didnt live up to its expectations* type of thing, like my most recent purchase in ""The Wire""...that is another story. But I shouldnt have been surprised in Joss. Firefly is a wonderful hybrid of almost all genres rolled up in one, and sometimes its so seamless you couldn't even tell. I felt like I knew the crew on Serenity. They were hard working people with flaws just trying to make it and that is the hallmark of Joss Whedon's shows. No matter how bizarre the plot, they're always about the characters.Although, I wouldn't rate Firefly above his other masterpiece, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", which is the greatest piece of entertainment ever created, it is a worthy addition to the wonderful Jossverse.

The story of the FIREFLY and its crew is delightful, bizarre at times, funny, deadly serious with a lot of violence, action packed and never disappoints the viewer.

What a great series! A Sci-Fi Western as well done as most feature films. Like so many others who have reviewed the Firefly set, I ended up watching all of the episodes over three nights marathon-style, all the while both marveling at the quality of the acting, writing, music and overall production values, and disbelieving that anything this wonderful could be cancelled! Well, leave it to Fox, I guess. The cast of Firefly achieved a chemistry that only rarely is seen on television, and usually only after two or three seasons, if at all. My father-in-law and my son who were both visiting also quickly became converted and purchased their own sets. This is a series which continues to resonate within you long after you finish watching.

No perfect shiny people with perfectly corrected shiny personalities in perfect lycra spandex for their perfect bodies (nourished by perfectly replicated foodplans and sythahol?) No pseudo scientific techno jibberish? A sci fi series with real people, real skulduggery and real dirt?Don't get me wrong, I love Trek too, but sometimes the socialist utopianism becomes irritating, its just too . . .  shiny. Space as gritty frontier is nothing new to sci fi, nor is the libertarian zeitgeist highlighted by this series; however, the juxtaposition of well ordered civilization (where one yearns to breathe free) and chaotic freedom (where one yearns for a doctor) is presented in a fun, ironic and not too preachy mix.I'd heard good things about this show so I bought the DVDs on a whim, boy what a treat! Its funny, smart, mixes two very different genres in a way I would not have thought possible, and makes you care for the crew (and a few other characters too.) I can't believe they canceled it -- get a rope.Looking for parallel universes? Time travel conundrums? Puzzles that demand higher order thinking? Keep looking, this series doesn't even pretend to humor the ""calculus = baby math"" set (though I suspect more than a few Browncoats are members of Mensa.) Want Plato or a long analysis of The Grundrisse? Not a chance. You won't find much diplomacy here; however, you will love the Alexander vs. Gordian Knot approach to the moral quandries foisted upon the crew. You will appreciate this show all the more if you can give a nod to Rousseau, and can imagine being in a more natural state in a plastic rathole on an airless, sterile, but anarchic planetoid, than when camping out at Yosemite Park (with a Park Ranger around every tree to wag his finger at you when you drop trail mix on his flora.)One unique blessing is the lack of english speaking ""aliens"" who, aside from a brow ridge or two, are still bipeds who can interbreed, despite having evolved in isolation from each other. Last, the use of Chinese is easier to understand if you live in an area where more than one language is spoken regularly. The crew tends to use their other language in much the same way real people in such situations actually do.This series is exactly what it intends to be: above average entertainment, fun, witty and smart, plus a few strokes for those who don't cherish a society where everyone has a place -- and stays there."	5.0	This show was canceled?	2006-11-06	8	7	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1XVAASG1ISP8O	Matt	I didn't know what to expect when i first started watching this show.  The funny thing is, i didn't even know it existed even after i had watched serenity.  I heard about it a little while after i had watched serenity, and always wanted to see it.  Finally about 6 years after watching serenity, i finally find firefly on netflix.Boy, i was in for a treat, this series became one of my favorites instantly.  The characters were well written and the actors played their parts perfectly.  None of the characters are left out, and you get to know them all on an individual level.  Learning about their relationship with each other and their personalities.My favorite characters were River and Kaylee.  Kaylee was entertaining with her crush on the doctor, and how he was so clueless to her advances.  She had a very bubbly personality though and was always upbeat and positive.  She was also a very hard worker and kept the ship going.River was also a entertaining character in her own way.  She always had the strangest comments and was a little off, but in a good way.  Her behavior intrigued me and kept me questioning what she was going to do next.All the other characters had their own unique personalities as well and were great in their own ways as well, those 2 were just my favorites.  Nathan Fillion is probably my favorite acting wise, i think he is a great actor, however his character just was not my favorite, but don't take that the wrong way, i don't mean it like i didn't like his character i just meant since the other 2 were my favorites that was why his was not.  I loved all the characters in the show, and my only complaint is, that it was canceled way to soon.I wish the show would have been on for a lot longer.  With less then one full season, it leaves a lot left out, even with the movie summing everything up.Now i guess i should tell you what the show is about and not just about the characters i liked.  These show is basically about space scavengers, in a way.  Nathan Fillion's character is captain of the firefly and they travel through space looting abandoned or destroyed ships that they find out in space.  They also take jobs from random people throughout the galaxy.  Most of the jobs are not always on the up and up, but they always pay well.  In a way they could be also called space pirates.  But they are good ones so that is all that matters, right.Nathan plays an ex military veteran who opposed the alliance, so now that the alliance has won the war, he must perform his missions under the radar of the alliance.  Since most of his mission are not always legal, they have to travel fairly low key.  Then there was also the Reavers, who were deranged psychotic humans that committed all sorts of inhuman acts.If you are a fan of Sci-Fi movies and tv shows, then you will most likely love this show.  I know i sure did.	5.0	One of my favorite shows.	2011-11-15	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A23WXH30LFXNV7	Matt	This show was a very unique sci-fi show mostly because it didn't use all of this futuristic technology that can do a million things at once.  In fact the only real thing that's futuristic about the show is the ship itself.  Everything else seems like it was from the old west.The characters are all well thought out and their dialogue is typical Whedon style, which is extremely witty.The special effects are better than most movies.  When you see the ship flying in space it looks like there's a camera actually there, following it.  The camera is moving around like an old family reunion tape shot by your uncle.  But the most atmouspheric thing about it is, is that there's no sound.  They decided to take a realistic look at space:  no air = no sound.  Unlike Star Trek and Star Wars.I would recomend this DVD set to anyone that wants to have a good time watching a great show.	5.0	Great Sci-Fi	2004-06-20	5	5	0

The best shows burn bright, hard and fast, and are always ultimately killed before their time. Firefly is the hardest example of this disturbing phenomenon. Fox wanted an action-oriented sci-fi franchise with a built-in fan base. Joss re-wrote and re-tooled and addressed every one of their notes. The show was groundbreaking, beloved by critics, and had a fanatical following before the first episode ever aired. So naturally, Fox dumped it in the time slot of death, Friday evenings, began the show by premiering with the second episode, not the pilot which explains who these people are and why you should give a damn, sporadically removing the show even from this slot some weeks, sometimes without even saying so. After 10 episodes, less than half a season, Fox canceled the series before it ever had a chance. The fans rallied, and Mr. Whedon was able to retain the rights to the show, shopping it around until Universal picked it up as the major motion picture ""Serenity,"" a bittersweet triumph of sci-fi that wraps the show up beautifully. Buy this series, and give it a chance. No one who watches the whole first disc comes out the other side a non-fan. It's quite simply the best television series in human history."	5.0	The best television series in human history.	2006-08-11	16	14	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AEXWQ6BOCDVXE	Matthew Hunt	Let's start by saying I've been a Firefly fan for the better part of a decade, now.  So I will admit, biased review.  It's such a shame that the show was cancelled so early, but at the same time... I rather enjoy rewatching it and puzzling over the various unsolved mysteries.  What was Book's secret past?  Does Mal ever grow beyond his need to fly?  How to Zoey handle her situation after the end of the movie?The fact that I still ask these questions is a testament to this story, and how in a short 16 episodes, I was so gripped by their interactions that I still wonder about them almost 10 years later.  I can't say any other show has ever taken hold of my imagination so absolutely, and for that, Firefly is not just good, not just unique, but downright special in the world of TV.	5.0	Best sci-fi of all time	2013-06-20	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3KCG8WIOPP631	Matthew Jackson	I remember when I first heard about this western in space series and laughed it off, thinking it sounded like a silly idea. I never watched the series and when it disappeared shortly after, I felt no loss.At the prodding of friends I bought the movie DVD and watched it, it was decent and the setting was interesting enough. This last weekend, I was bored and snagged the DVD set on a whim. In a single day I watched the entire series. My wife, who hates when I even pass the Sci-Fi chanel on the tv, ended up watching the whole series and now cannot wait to see the movie (probably tonight, just not enough hours in a single day!).I have to say the series was a complete surprise as how good it ended up being. A great character study with just enough action to keep you from thinking it is just a drama. The characters are great, you learn to care about them, the setting of the show pulls you in and makes you want more, and the special effects are outstanding.Overall I am very pleased I decided to purchase this DVD set and highly recommend it to everyone.	5.0	A great series, worthy of a second chance.	2006-03-27	9	9	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ANU2LSLE8SKK2	"Matthew J. Campbell ""graheim"""	Firefly was a brilliant show that was too good for television and ended up running for a mere half season.  Normally, that's it for a show but this one bucked the curve.  Legions of fans launched an immediate campaign to get their show back and it's creator Joss Whedon worked even harder to bring Firefly back in some form.  Thanks to such tireless effort it's coming back as a movie, &quot;Serenity&quot;, in 2005.The reason it's inspired such devotion and uncommon effort is because it's just that good.  Special effects, characterization, dialogue, plot, music; all are top of the line.  I was one of the first to pre-order the DVD and everyone I've shown it to has become an instant convert.  If you like Sci-Fi BUY THIS SET.  Or, if you're not ready to commit, rent it from Blockbuster and then come back and buy it.  Because once you've seen the pilot this DVD set will grace your bookshelf.  It's just that good.	5.0	It's just that good.	2004-06-28	4	4	0

Blame the utter morons at Fox for once again, killing an excellent series with ineptitude in marketing it.Firefly is the perfect series- I have a mild interest in sci-fi (ie I never watched Babylon 5 or Farscape but enjoy sci-fi in fiction and occasionally on film) but the series shines in its character development- each member of the crew of the Sernenity is so fully realized that as the last episode of disc 4 ended, it was like realizing you'd never see some old friends again.  There was not one weak performance with special kudos to Runora (sp the companiion) who is beautilful and amazing and the doctor, who truly grows as a character during the course of the series.  And the captain is a wonderful character, pulled staight out of the old west.Somebody should pick up this series- Sci-fi would have a HUGE hit on its hands.	5.0	Perfect Series, Sci-fi or otherwise	2004-02-07	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A22GUJNHS32PA6	"Matthew Manuel ""Conor Karrel"""	"Well, I've been a fan for a long time of Joss Whedon's writing.Irrevant, funny and biting all at once. He's the rare artist who can make you fall in love with a character one minute revile him the next and forgive right after that. One able to write plausible plot twists with unexpected consequences. In other words, he has vision. Something woefully lacking in the film and television arts these days.I would highly recommend anything Joss Whedon has had a hand in (even though his Aliens 4 script was completely ruined and the film version of Buffy got sideswiped by the Donald who thought he could write better dialog because he just ""didn't understand"" what was written, they're still elements of Joss's vision in each), and to those who didn't like Buffy/Angel tv series, well, this is a completely different feel, MUCH more adult and a great story ready to be told.Can't wait to see the film ""Serenity"" and hope that, eventually, a network will pick up the show again and run with it!"	5.0	Simply the best show not on television!!	2005-05-24	4	3	1

The soundtrack is great, the plots are captivating, the dialog is witty and interesting, the theme song has meaningful lyrics, the visuals are stunning, space really _is_ silent, the doors don't follow the script, and the mixture of the western and sci-fi genres is convincing.Anyone can fall in love with this show.

I actually waited to see this series because I'm not a fan at all of Buffy or Angel (which I believe are terribly written), but this series is one of the most intelligent, gritty series I've ever seen, and I regret I hadn't seen it sooner.With Serenity (the movie) coming out, I hope somehow this series gets a jump start, but from what I've read, Universal's agreement with Fox to make the movie forbids this.In any case, this is a bunch of characters you'll fall in love with."	5.0	Best sci-fi series in a long, long time	2005-09-08	7	5	2

I watch very few shows on TV anymore.  This show, however, has fun (and interesting) characters, great dialogue and a neat plot for each episode.  It is probably the most realistic portrayal of what the galaxy might be like in 500 years or so which matters to me since fantasy is sometimes hard for me to watch when it's so dumb.

At least enough to go out and buy the box set.  Probably one of the best buys I've made, because the depth of the show and its characters is amazing.  Each crew member from Serenity brings different qualities and as a crew, you can see them struggling to find themselves and to just survive.  Firefly's got a great combination of action, drama, and comedy.  There are some great, serious, touching moments and then some of the highest of high comedy.  Any scene with Jayne in it is bound to be funny.I'm pretty sad that once I finish the DVD set, I can't look forward to more seasons, but at least Serenity is coming to the big screen.  I hope it gets enough good reviews to get Fox to consider reupping the series.Anyways, give the DVD set a look.  It's well worth it.	5.0	Joss, Please revive the show!	2005-09-14	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2FB2HRCHCCA6T	Matt Lewis Reese	I must admit I am an avid Star Trek TNG fan. I grew up watching that show. It defined the science fiction genre for me. Since it ended very few shows have come close to competing with it. And I will agree with many of you in saying that TNG was very hokey and fake at times, but even so nothing since then has been able to compete.Then came Firefly. At first I was a little skeptical of this show mainly because everyone I have talked to that watched tried to push the show on me almost as if it was an addictive drug. Finally, the other night, one of my friends convinced me to watch the first episode and I was hooked. The show was amazing, and you can hardly tell it is even a science fiction show. It is the genre a space western at its best. I watch most of the rest of the series before I went to bed (I stayed up late).If you like science fiction, even if it is only a small amount, you will love this show. It is by far one of the best dramas of any kind I have seen, period. Even better this DVD is cheep.

Nearly every episode had something so funny that I just had to laugh out loud even though I was alone. I think besides the terrific characters, the cinematography is owed a thanks for this. Whether enjoying the witty dialogue or the action, the camera always moves fluidly like you're there. I think its what brought me in and made me the 10th crew member aboard this amazing ship (which has been deemed by a DVD extra feature as the 9th crew member) you can't help but love. In fact, I enjoyed it and laughed more the second time, and plan on going through it again before the dvd comes out.	5.0	Alone in the house laughing outloud	2005-11-17	9	9	0

I've also seen the movie (was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview) and, while the movie was great, it was different from the series.  The series was all about character development and making you fall in love with the crew (which Fox so irresponsibly denied us the chance of fulfillment).  The movie is more plot-driven.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3R08MI8O78XKN	Max Berman	First off - If you haven't seen Serenity - go see it. Not only will you be in for a corker of a movie, it's another pie in the face of Fox, the company that pulled this series from our screens. I am not a fan of Star-Trek, Buffy or Angel. To be honest, I find them a bit formulaic and bland. For me, Firefly is something entirely new. It is fresh, fiery and brilliantly different to any other sci-fi I have seen in recent memory. I am a believer that regardless of an astronomical budget, every Hollywood star out there and infinitely large explosions, good TV aint good TV if the script sucks. You will quickly find that the scripts for this series really do shine. The characters leap from the TV, the plots twist and turn and nothing is ever resolved by re-calibrating the discombobulator. It is a sad indication of the state of modern TV that this show was pulled. If Hollywood and big TV networks are anything, they are not risk takers. I guess the figures didn't instantly add up with Firefly and it was canned. I can only assume that Fox thinks that we, the public are unintelligent, unimaginitive suckers. I guess the TV execs aren't visionaries, even if Joss Whedon is.	5.0	A sad indication that TV companies don't know who we are...	2006-01-02	9	9	0

This is probably the best series I have seen, I can hardly believe it was ever actually shown on television, the vast wasteland.  It is smart, deep, and completely entertaining. It is probably not something you want to watch with children (they wouldn't get it anyway, as it isn't children's programming) It shows a completely possible future, with those wanting to control what everyone does on the one side (the alliance) and everyone else on the other (settlers, rebels, etc) and the Chinese influence from having become the next world superpower.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AXQ8T2D9IT6UG	"M. B. Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa..."	"""Firefly""... What does that word bring to mind? For some, nothing, or maybe at most some kind of bug with a beautiful name... For a few, like me and maybe you, ""Firefly"" is a great though somewhat weird show that was untimely cancelled by Fox. We were robbed of the opportunity of watching that show, but at least we enjoyed it while it was on air, so I think that we were the lucky ones...Fortunately, this dvd allows everybody to be a winner, in the sense that if you lost the opportunity of watching the series, you can do it now, and if you already watched and loved the series, you can watch it again as many times as you want.Should I tell you something about the series, in case you are completely clueless regarding ""Firefly""? Well, ""Firefly"" is a sci-fi Western produced by Joss Whedon, the person behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"". The series is set in the future, and it tells the story of a group of rebels that oppose the Alliance, a dictatorial government. These rebels live in a ship, the ""Serenity"", and their leader is Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a former officer in a war against the Alliance that his side lost. We also have Zoe (Mal's second officer, played by Gina Torres) and her husband 'Wash' Washburne (a pilot, played by Alan Tudyk). We cannot forget the utterly unlikable Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Kaylee(a mechanic and an eternal optimist, played by Jewel Staite), Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), Inara (Morena Baccarin), Simon Tam (a doctor, played by Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau), a psychic on whom the Alliance experimented before she managed to escape.In a nutshell, this series is pure, unadulterated fun that was cut short for thousands due to the fact that it was cancelled when merely 11 of the 14 episodes this dvd contains had been aired. I suppose that the fact that Fox is behind the release of dvd could be seen as some kind of atonement for the cancellation of the show, I don't know. In any case, I am pretty sure that more people will become fans of ""Firefly"" after watching this dvd, and that won't hurt the chances that the show has of returning to the small screen.Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that the bonus features that ""Firefly"" offers are great, but what really completes this dvd is another one, ""Serenity"". ""Serenity"", now available in dvd format, is an excellent film directed by Joss Whedon and based on the ""Firefly"" series, that provides it with an interesting ending. If you can, purchase both ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" at the same time. You won't regret it, and you will save some time  :)Belen Alcat"	5.0	In a nutshell, this series is pure, unadulterated fun...	2005-12-27	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1VVIHU3MWFQH0	"M. Belfort ""bookreader"""	I saw Serenity on a whim.  I certainly never heard about it or anything like that...you see, my eyes are very pointy right now; giving pointed looks.  Being someone who likes sci-fi, I remembered seeing a rather cheesy poster with spaceships and scary close-ups and vaguely recalled that the movie it was, I think, promoting...right, yes? was S-something.  The only S-titled movie on the show board was Serenity, so I bravely (operative word here) bought a ticket to see it for the 3:30p showing.Best $9.00 spent.  Ever.And that is basically how I came to buy this DVD box-set.  Joss Whedon, the mastermind behind cult classics Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, really outshone himself on this one.  From episode one, Serenity, there was no turning back (see, guys, the original episode one of Firefly; I got *hooked* from episode *one*).  I watched all 14 episodes back-to-back, meaning 1) sleep deprivation and 2) angry boss person.Ultimately, it's the characters that will draw you in.  Unlike most sci-fi shows that have, by some fluke, managed to stay on air, where the characters are one-dimensional and some look ugly (aliens?), this show offers you...*us* (and if you're ugly, that's entirely not my fault).  You see, we're on this ship called Serenity.  It's kind of a crappy ship; it's falling apart and might spontaneously explode one day, but we live in it; we're even kind of fond of it.  We also eke out a living by being thieves...you know, out of pure economic necessity...that, and sometimes the life of an outlaw can be quite exciting...only, we don't like it exciting because we're not crazy about dying, so -- hmm -- never mind.  But that's the thing, you see; we're human; we're fickle and we're, well, slightly defective.  We also, despite our better judgment, love.This show has everything: stellar performances delivered by a cast of no-names (probably not for long), action-packed sequences, humor, suspense, romance (tasteful and not gag-inducing), great, great, great -- did I mention great? -- writing, a fascinating vision of the future, and last but certainly not least, expletives in Chinese.  So, if it had all this going for it, why did it get cancelled?  Don't know; smacked of substance and intelligence, I guess.Pfft -- figures.	5.0	FOX execs lined up for mental examination	2005-11-27	15	14	1

Fox has responded to a mail campaign regarding the series cancellation with this DVD set which offers ALL the programmes in the series (including 3 unaired episodes) and a host of ""extras"".A Firefly film is anticipated in 2004, and, like ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" (which originally aired in 1992 only to disappear before the phenomenally successful re-incarnation) further series' of Firefly will surely come (hopefully with the original cast).This is a ""Must-Buy"" DVD set and pre-ordering is essential.

I was really tired at the time, so I remember now being overly impressed with those episodes. However, I did think them cool enough to maybe watch the other episodes sometime.Thankfully, my friend bought me my own DVD set as a gift before I moved to Florida.I have to tell you, this is one of my all-time favorite shows. Top 5 at least. I love the concept, the characters, the stories. I keep the DVDs in my room on my bookcase, and I treat them the same as a favorite novel. It's a very rare instance when a TV show really touches me like this one has.Unfortunately, this show is yet another example of the stupidity of network TV that is consistently outdone by the cable networks as far as quality of programming. They finally get a good show and throw it away when their efforts to keep ratings low are sucessful.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AK7IWOV7UY7DY	M. Damien	&quot;Firefly&quot; is Joss Whedon's first expedition into science fiction, a genre completely different from earlier creations of his like &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;.  In a way, it's a much finer vintage than either, strengthened by his years of experience in imaginative storytelling.  The series tells the story of Serenity, a Firefly-class space transport, and her crew.Each character of the main cast is memorable, and as the series progresses you gain more empathy for each of them.  Malcolm Reynolds, the former Independent who fought (but lost) against the tyrannical Alliance alongside his first mate, Zoe.  Wash, Zoe's husband and a pilot of exceptional talent.  Kaylee, young and boy-crazy mechanic savant.  Jayne, the greedy and less-than-bright muscle.  Inara Serra, courtesan and Companion (a social class which is highly esteemed in this culture).  And the passengers:  Shepherd Book, a priest whose background is shaded in mystery.  Simon and River Tam, fugitive siblings, he a talented trauma surgeon, she a intuitive genius who had been the guinea pig of some mysterious group's experiments.The series' stories are well-written, though primarily episodic rather than plot-arc-based.  They have much more of a sense of realism than most space-opera type shows (Star Trek, for example), and that's one of the things that draws a viewer's attention.  There are no aliens, no &quot;bumpy forehead&quot; prosthetics -- it's just humans, alone in the black.  Fox, the production company, chose to hamstring the series and cancel it before it really got off to a solid start.  Nonetheless, the DVD set of the series is well worth buying -- it's one of the finest bits of storytelling around.	5.0	Magnificent storytelling by Joss Whedon.	2004-02-19	7	7	0

Everyone I've ever introduced to it has been skeptical at first, but it only takes an episode or two for them to love it, too.I've heard Firefly describes as ""a western set in space,"" and while that's quite true, it just doesn't capture what the show really is.  It's a western in the sense that most of the series takes place in the frontier region of space.  There are outlaws, limited technology, new struggling settlements... it's just a more brutal existence than in the core planets where everything is highly advanced. The weapons are also like you'd see in a western, pistols, shotguns, rifles, and of course, reliable knives.  There are other little western touches, so to speak, like dust, leather, long coats, bars.  And of course this is all mixed in with the ability to travel through space.Anyway, the great thing about Firefly is its characters.  They do a great job of drawing you in and connecting you to the characters.  They're deep, they're believable, and while they all have their conflicts, they're a family.  You get the overwhelming feeling that for the actors, they aren't acting; it's natural, and they've actually developed strong bonds together.  (They even say so in the commentary.)The dialog is witty, the action is great, the stories are exciting.  You think something stereotypical is going to happen and they completely play off of your expectations and throw something else in.  You're never bored watching this show.It's such a shame the show didn't get the start it deserved.  Apparently the episodes were shown out of order, the pilot was skipped, and that would completely mess an audience up.  Just a word of warning:  the show was canceled and feels like it ends abruptly, but there's a movie they made that adds on perfectly and ties up a lot of the loose ends--Serenity.  (Serenity is the name of the pilot and the movie, but the two are completely different.  One is the beginning, one is the end.)  You really need to buy Serenity to complete the collection.  Also, I'd recommend watching the episodes before the movie since the movie is essentially the end of the series.  They go out with a bang.Get it, watch it, love it.  It'll be one you'll hold on to and watch over and over again.  Plus the Amazon price when I bought was the lowest I could find.

Real, clever, gritty heroes, who dressed like cowboys, flew spaceships, and cursed in Mandarin Chinese. They exchanged witty repartee, travelled the 'Verse from one end to the other looking for work (honest or not), and even attended a couple of Shindigs. When things got a little slow, there was always the psychotic psychically-gifted child to look after, or the flesh-mutilating cannibals from the edge of space to avoid.And then Fox, in a decision even more mind-numbingly stupid than airing any of its reality shows, cancelled it mid-season. Thanks to the efforts of Browncoats (as ""Firefly"" fans call ourselves), ""Firefly"" lives again, with all fourteen episodes (two of them originally unaired) and some juicy extras on four DVDs. Joss Whedon's sci-fi/Western/fantasy world - once described to me as ""Star Wars, but Han Solo's world, with Han still shooting first"" - is one of the most original things to air on television in a long while...possibly ever.""Firefly"" is set approximately five hundred years in the future, in a new universe with ""terraformed"" planets made inhabitable for Earth colonists, whose numbers have grown too many for Earth-that-was. Chinese and Western cultures are the dominant influences; characters dress like John Wayne and are fluent in Chinese, at least enough to swear in. Unlike most sci-fi, there are no aliens; the Reavers, cannibals who mutilate their own flesh and eat others, were once human too, till something drove them over the edge of sanity. The Alliance, a hyper-controlling government coalition of the central planets, manages most legal trade and activities, and have ever since they won a war some years back with the Independents (or ""Browncoats"").With the Alliance in control of all legal economic activity, those Browncoats were forced to retreat to the ""raggedy edge,"" taking what jobs they could to eke out an existence. Some of these are the crew of Serenity, a most rag-tag group of compatriots whose numbers include warrior woman Zoe; her husband, geeky pilot Wash; cheerful and nave mechanic Kaylee; gentle man of the cloth Shepherd Book; exotic geisha-like ""Companion"" Inara; ship's doctor Simon Tam and his genius but damaged sister River; and man's man Jayne, the blunt mercenary with a softer side. They are led by Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, who is if nothing else a man of determination, who lives by his own code of honor: stand by your crew, love your ship, get the job done.It is in this world, with these people, that ""Firefly"" makes its home. And what a home it is; even though we only get fourteen episodes, it is easy to develop attachments to these characters, and to care about what happens to them. Whedon's stories are tailored to provide layered character development, with each episode building on the last one's jokes and insights. Even Serenity, the ship itself, becomes a character of sorts: its nooks and crannies feel familiar and homely, something to be loved and protected.In this short span of time we also learn that Book is not all he appears to be, that River has been brutally experimented on by the Alliance to make her into a weapon, and that Mal has serious issues with womenfolk and relationships. It is sad that these hints of stories were cut off before they could be told; one senses that ""Firefly"" could have developed into the most interesting show on television if handled properly.What it undeniably is, however, is fourteen episodes' worth of brilliance. Whedon's dialogue is one of the high spots of the show: rarely has anything been as quotable as ""Firefly."" The wacky humor and the often unfamiliarly Westernized syntax give a simultaneously homey and foreign feel to the show and its characters; we recognize these people as kin to us, but maybe second cousins. The theme song is particularly good, an innately hummable ballad that will stick in your head even when you're not watching the show.The acting is truly amazing; although there are no big names here, everyone delivers heartfelt performances that feel real and personal; they make us care about their characters. It's hard to pick a standout performer; this crew works together as an outstanding ensemble, and they are the core of the show's strength.There's no shortage of action, either: as outlaws on the run from the government (and sometimes disgruntled employers), the crew of Serenity encounter their share of enemies, including the sadistic Dr Niska and the sinister bounty hunter Jubal Early. And there's River, too, prone to psychotic episodes that endanger everyone in her path.There are true gems even amongst the fourteen: my favourite episodes are ""Shindig,"" ""Our Mrs. Reynolds,"" ""War Stories,"" and ""Objects in Space."" All of them are excellent, but these four combine all the elements of style, dialogue, humor, and action into episodes that will inspire side-splitting laughter and some moments that will take your breath away.A sidenote: there is a movie addition to the Firefly 'Verse, in the form of ""Serenity."" It's darker and grittier than ""Firefly,"" but well worth seeing on its own merit as a fabulous space opera. So go ahead, embrace your inner Browncoat, and immerse yourself in the wonder of the Firefly-that-was.

Adam Baldwin got THE loudest applause.  Zachary Levi was charming which lead me and my husband to watch Chuck.  We both Loved Adam's character Casey in Chuck so we began to watch Firefly together.  I think I did a marathon watching of it the 1st time in 2 days.  Have since watched it a 2nd time and the movie 3x.  Have gotten multiple friends and family to watch it and am having a Firefly marathon introduction to my family during thanksgiving.  Loved Nathan Fillion in it so went and watched Castle (also a great show AND in the 2nd season they have him dress up as Capt. Mal for Halloween, i DIED!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ADTUS88NFTW23	"Melkor ""dark lord"""	"Gene Roddenberry originally pitched Star Trek to the networks as ""'Wagon Train' to the stars"" and ""'Gunsmoke' in space"".  I love Trek, but the show always seemed more like a commentary on society.  It used aspects of science fiction as an allegory to address difficult issues of what was going on in the world in the late 60's.Now, with Firefly, it seems like Joss Whedon has finally realized Roddenberry's original dream.  This is a really fun show.  It is a science fictions show with cattle rustling, gun fights, whore houses, train robberies, bounty hunters, and so on.  Basically, all the essential elements to a great Western.  Admittedly, the show starts out a little dry.  It's my feeling that most shows start out that way, though, because you have to wade through all the introductions to characters, settings, and such.  That being said, by the time I was done with the first disc in the set, I was hooked.  To set the basic story, it takes place in the future where the only two surviving super powers are the United States and China.  This series takes place several years after a war, where a crew of misfits (the best kind of crews!) aboard a smuggling ship are trying to stay independent, and keep out of reach of an increasingly oppressive government.Firefly is something completely different than anything Whedon did in his Buffy shows.  The most noticeable difference is that Joss and crew are writing for adult characters, instead of characters in their late teens.  There is not the witty back and forth banter that was so characteristic of the Buffy shows.  The characters in this show are a little darker, but less brooding.  They are all conflicted, and they all have secrets to hide.  Sometimes the characters are almost more interesting for what they don't say.  There is a lot of mystery, and a lot of questions in this show.Unfortunately, this series is barely able to touch upon that.  It was canceled by Fox way too soon.  Too bad, because I think a second and third season could have been explosive.  Hopefully after the ""Serenity"" movie comes out (the new Firefly movie Joss is currently working on as I write this review), a new station will pick up the show and let him finish the story.  (I could be wrong, but I believe something similar happened to Babylon 5.)  Anyway, fans of action based science fiction who have been itching for something new should definitely pick up Firefly.  I think people who liked Joss Whedon's work on Buffy/Angel know what kind of stories he likes to weave; and if you enjoy that kind of depth and complexity, you really should check out this show."	5.0	"Now I really can't wait for the ""Serenity"" movie!!!"	2004-11-18	13	12	1

Firefly is a good show, but I am not a devoted fan like many of those who have given reviews.  I really think they take all the character study stuff too far.  It is a show, period, and I do not think it is any where as good as Buffy or Bab 5. My lower rating is very probably due to the fact that I do not like Westerns.  Not in clothes, books, tv, movies or music.  Westerns leave me cold, and this is all about westerns.  I had hoped the Sci-fi side would be the most dominate, but it is really not.  Even the costuming is heavily western.  So, while it is an interesting show, if you don't like westerns, you will probably not be able to call it great.  As far as I'm concerned, this is just another western that uses a space ship in place of a wagon.  Disappointing.  It gets the middle rating of 3 stars because the characters are fun, if not as deep as some reviews would lead you to believe.  :)  If you are not a Westerns fan, approach with caution."	3.0	Good if you Like Westerns	2010-08-16	9	3	6

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APDHKB7LMA8WL	Merryl Gross	"If you managed to catch this show during the 35 seconds that Fox allowed it to air, you know that it's unlike anything else.  For the rest of you, a brief summary:In the future, the Earth finally gets trashed by mankind.  Fortunately, before that point we developed the technology for spaceflight, and the ability to quickly terraform asteroids and other planets.  So the folks with the tech did that, then scooped up whole populations of other folks and dumped them onto those terraformed places, with not much more than basic supplies, seeds, and food animals.So what you've got now is essentially what we had during the settlement of the American West: transplanted pioneers in isolated towns, some as little more than slaves to corporations and others with money.Of course, most don't know this because Fox, in its infinite wisdom, chose to show the episode that explains all this LAST.  Before cancelling the show without even showing 3 of the episodes.While some shows are doing ""Vietnam"" or ""World War II""... Firefly is doing the Civil War.  You're looking at a post-Civil War society, and people trying to put together the shattered pieces of their lives.  And then there's the girl in the box...The characters were quirky but not cute.  The show was doing a GREAT job of fleshing them all out, and moving the plot, and making you want to know what happens next.  You could see signs that none of them were quite what the stereotypes said they should be.  (Well, maybe Jayne was.  Except when he was a hero.)  The high tech was very realistic, down to the dirt and grit and up to the great use of smart paper and other REAL technology.I'm really looking forward to getting the DVD, so I can finally understand all the nuances of what was going on!!

Mora ""Bad Wolf"""	I'll admit, I watched the first episode shown on FOX during it's inital airing and didn't think it was that good but this of course was not the original pilot made so the show didn't make much sense to me. Flash forward three years and I am a convert. I think after hearing that people were lining up for the pre screenings of the movie and hearing how dedicated all the fans were made me really curious. I think, always in the back of my mind, I thought that it couldn't be that bad if the name Whedon was on it. Having been a fan of Buffy and Angel for years, and loving them, and him delivering some of my favorite TV over the years, my curiosity got the best of me and boy am I glad it did.I watched the first two or three episodes and enjoyed it but it wasn't until about the 4th episode it really started to gel and show just how well written, dramatic and at times funny this show was. The mix of the character and interplay was very Whedon which made me want to watch more and more until I was finished within two weeks.The only bad thing? No more episodes to see how these characters grow.The good part, at least we get a Serenity movie.So now I can experience the rage that all fans felt when FOX yanked it prematurely from everyones living rooms.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2RAK1QMNO20KD	M. Goldman	I think this is my first review...I just had to give my input here, though.We don't get to go out to see movies in the theater since we have a 7 month old baby girl and three older boys. We had read good reviews of Serenity, and liked the preview of the movie that was on some other DVD we were watching. I asked a friend (no kids) if he had seen Serenity. He was very enthusiastic and recommended watching the whole series first to get a better feel for the movie.We got Firefly from Amazon...love that free shipping! After watching the first hour I was not sure. By the second hour I was hooked. I really do not like westerns, and this is definitely a sci-fi western...but whatever you label it, it just WORKS. Lots of LOL moments. The characters are very well developed, and the Firefly DVD set left us wanting more. We just watched Serenity last night, and it was a very good addition to the series. It is unfortunate that it did not do better at the box office since that may seal the fate of the series. Of course the 2005 box office was just disappointing in general, but unless the DVD sales are phenomenal, this may be the end for Serenity.So, we happily did our part, buying Firefly and Serenity for ourselves. We also introduced Serenity to two relatives by giving the DVD set and movie as holiday gifts. Who knows? Maybe the word will spread and Serenity will fly again!	5.0	Should be brought back!	2006-01-03	5	5	0

Hartmann ""abayyan"""	"I had to laugh when the ship, ""Firefly"" was referred to as a boat.But what a great place to live - traveling the galaxy.It seems we go five hundred years into the future [such as it is] and meet the Firefly-class spaceship SERENITY.  We soon learn this is named after a battle that introduces us to [Nathan Fillion] Mal Reynolds, the captian of Serenity.  He seems to have fallen in love with this ship.I will admit that the presence of Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb was another reason I wanted to collect this series.  I certainly enjoyed the conflict and bonding of this group of characters and their risque way of talking.I didn't know that there was a difference between a ""Companion"" and a prostitute.  Morena Baccarin as ""Inara"" was very beautiful in this role.  It appeared that there was an intense attraction between Inara and Mal.The brilliant doctor, Simon and his genius sister, River added a great element of being on the run from the men in blue.They showed us the meeting of Wash as a great navigator and pilot of the Serenity and then we find out that he and Zoe, Mal's right hand warrior, are married.  When did Wash ask Zoe for her hand in marriage?  Eventually she says it is about time to have a baby - Wash seems reluctant.The intoduction to Jewel Staite as ""Kaylee"" was a bit torrid and a bit embarassing to Mal.  Kaylee was the only one that could keep Serenity in running shape.I about cracked up when ""Saffron"" claimed marriage to Mal and her seduction scene with Mal ending up flat on the floor.  And that wasn't the end of their association.Ah, but Jayne was a masculine riot.  I loved his character - his uncaring attitude which didn't hold, his flustered and embarassed attitude when he finds out that the mudders have made a hero out of his memory.  He definitely wants the reward for turning in the fugitives, Simon and River and then has to rescue them.The great scene [other than Mal being naked in the desert - a bit funny] was when they were standing on the edge of nowhere and Serenity appears in the back of them, rising like a giant monster.  [reminds me of the sub blasting out of the ocean in ""Hunt for Red October""]  Same feeling of WOW!Not a set for kids - but great adult entertainment!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - thoroughly enjoyable!  definitely a keeper!"	5.0	FIREFLY - WHAT A BOAT?	2005-04-26	7	3	4
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AS8RBVEI9HI39	"M. Heather ""madjh"""	I must admit that as much as I absolutely adore Star Wars, I'm not a huge fan of Science Fiction (hides from all of the Trekkies in her family.) The beauty of Firefly is that Science Fiction is merely the backdrop for character driven scripts. While there are things that might concern parents of young children (some nudity, brief sex scenes and mild language,) this show is engaging and interesting to all types and ages of viewers. The characters all have many layers and throughout the four discs the audience really gets to know them and relate to them.I can see why Firefly was cancelled. It's one of those rare shows that crosses boundaries. It is undefinable in genre. It gets plopped into Sci-Fi, but it is so much more than that. It's a western, a drama, a situation comedy, a political commentary, a thriller/action... Perhaps Fox did not have the wherewithal to market this brilliant series to all of its potential viewers. I know I hadn't heard of it until after it was out on DVD and someone told me to rent it. Perhaps Fox was afraid of what the writers had to say in their scripts and how they went about saying it. For a show about thieves, there are a lot of moral tales.The series follows a Han Solo-esque Captain on his many adventures and show how a band of misfits joins up with him. It combine intricate morality issues with sex, violence and larceny, and does it all in such a way that your kids could wath it without much ado. The writing is brilliant and the actors are amazing. One is hard pressed to see that they are filming on a TV budget as the sets and costumes and cinematography are all top notch.As for the DVD's themselves, I'm a big fan of commentaries and several of the episodes have commentary tracks included. Hearing from a variety of cast and production crew is amazing and you really hear the love in their voices for this project. My only complaint is the navigation of the menu's is a bit difficult to manage on a PC. I alos wish there were more easter eggs as this is the sort of genre where you'd expect them.In a sense, I'm glad the show was cancelled. We now have a movie to watch and this is really a story for the big screen. Like the original Star Trek, I think Firefly's niche is about to be discovered in a series of feature length films... and why not? Another complaint I have about each episode is that they're over with far too quickly. When it comes to the crew of Serenity, I'm greedy and always want more.	5.0	Not a Sci-Fi Fan	2005-09-29	0	0	0

I didn't remember ""Firefly"" from when it was actually on air, and I didn't see ""Serenity"" in theatres. Yet enough of my friends kept mentioning this series repeatedly. So I watched, and when I started watching, I fell in love with the characters and witty dialogue. I was surprised how many unaired episodes were included on the dvds, and that the pilot episode was not shown at the beginning of the on-air series because Fox didn't think it was action-packed enough. Perhaps the fate of this series would have been different if Fox has listened to the intent of the creators and given it a fair chance by showing all of the episodes.

First, the pilot was remade because they wanted more action. Then, the network showed the episodes out of order. Normally this wouldn't be a major problem. But with the storylines that writer/creator Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was putting together, it became hard to keep up with the character changes. Not long into the first season, Fox cancelled it. To add to their already insulting treatment of the show, they showed the revamped pilot episode last.Some great writing, direction and acting made this an excellent series. Truly a western in space with super special effects as well.I am a bit bewildered by the choice to release the eps in full frame.

I had no faith in Joss Whedon to entertain me and the tiny bit of the show I saw once made no sense. No doubt because Fox directed that the episodes be aired out of sequence. Time passed.Thankfully, one night when there was 'nothing on' I settled on this. I don't remember which episode but I gave it a chance this time and within minutes I was hooked. I Tivo-ed it the next time it was on, from the beginning, and enjoyed the opening sequence. Just like that I was hooked. The characters are quirky but believable and well-developed enough that I wish there'd been more chance to show their growth. The scripts are clever and inventive, the stories are amusing but almost beside the point since what I enjoy is the way the characters interact.I especially enjoyed the ""Out of Gas"" episode with all the back-story about the crew forming and the launch of the Serenity.  But ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" is also great and hints at what might have happened between Mal and Inara, if FOX hadn't dropped the ball. I never caught Dark Angel either but based on what a gem I found Firefly to be, I think I'll have to give that a try, too.Good special effects, a unique storyline set in a non-Trek future and this time Joss was in top form. I can't wait to get the DVD set to watch the episodes that never aired and I'm eager to see the big-screen version when Serenity opens.

Intrigued by the massive outpouring of positive reviews here, I took a chance on the dvds. It didn't take more than half the first episode to convince me of the quality of the series. Epic sweep and intimacy, real people, real emotions, subtle characterization that develops each character over time, editing, music and use of the camera all at cinematic levels - this series is a jewel.There are weaknesses. Some of the villains and some of the plots tend toward the generic, and there are occasional plot-holes. The overall quality outweighs all that easily, though. By the end, I felt as if I'd found a family. I'd follow Malcolm Reynolds anywhere he wanted to lead me and I'll be waiting with as much patience as I can muster for the film.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FS1O0IKD2BA3	Michael G. Bailey	As a fan of Star Trek (TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise) as well as Babylon 5, I was skeptical when I watched the first episode of Firefly.  After all, I thought I had pretty high standards.  How could this upstart space western compete with my other favorites?  When Firefly episode one had ended, my standards had been redefined.I had never seen the kind of high quality acting, writing, and production on display in the Firefly series.  Most science fiction series are, to be quite frank, kind of lame for the first season, since it takes a while for the cast and the writers to develop the characters, storylines, and relationships.  Firefly shatters that stereotype, and from the very first episode, the characters seem like they have been &quot;in their skins&quot; for their whole &quot;lives&quot;.Firefly's aura is dark and mysterious at times, which makes the Star Trek series seem almost boring, clean-cut, and unrealistic.  But Firefly also has a fun side that really comes through with a down-home western feeling.  The tension that exists between the supposed &quot;good guys&quot; adds a dimension to the stories that does not exist in most heroic science fiction, and the writers of the series successfully captured the stories of flawed heroes that really triumph over their own dark sides more than simply beating up the &quot;bad guys&quot;.Like any science fiction series, Firefly requires the suspension of disbelief.  There are some flawed economic theories at work in the show's premise, and the laws of physics are ignored in space travel, just as they are in Star Trek.  But the quality of the acting, writing, and production makes Firefly a series worth watching.  Be careful; watching Firefly may ruin you for any other science fiction TV shows!Disclosure:  As a side note, I found it unbelievable that an amazing show like Firefly was canceled after a partial season, especially since its viewership was very close in size to the viewership of Star Trek Enterprise (a much worse show).  I participated in the &quot;Save Firefly&quot; campaign, which failed to convince management to keep the show running.

I said I would probably see the movie just to give it a try, but as I wasn't that gung-ho about it, I never made seeing it at the big screen.Looking around for Christmas and having some down time over the holidays, I saw the reviews for this on Amazon.com. It again piqued my interest so thought well the movie is coming out on DVD so what the heck...I saw it the other night and was indeed pleasantly surprised... it is one of the most original and better movies I have seen in a long while. What grabbed me most and from the start was what all the reviewers had been saying - the characters - 9 most different and individual characters all with their quirks, good sides, bad sides (crazy sides), etc.I felt that everyone of them had a history behind them, some cloaked in mystery, some not so, but each intriguing in their own way. This just in the first 30 minutes...not so much told verbatim by the characters and lines, but just the way they were written and portrayed, and the atmosphere. That is rare. I felt that boy!, I really would like to get to know these people - good or bad - and what in their pasts led them to this, what motivations drive them, what secrets they have, etc.I could also see the bonds and comradeship between them, a family - a disfunctional family for sure, but still a family. Again this seemed to really just flow out of the movie by subtle dialogue, good writing, and good acting.It had some delicious humor, some good action (some a little far fetched but what action movies don't), some surprises, great characters, interesting storyline. All that left me wanting more.So out to buy the series. Saw the first episode (the original 2 hour pilot that was axed in favor of a more action packed 1 hour episode by the studio execs - as usual a ""brilliant"" decision by them - not..).Anyway, again very interesting storyline, good and diverse characters, got to know how things got started for the current group, and looking forward to watching the rest, but also sad that I know it is limited...I cancelled my cable last year because I never watched TV much and decided to see if I would miss all the junk they put on - in over a year I really haven't. Maybe because they keep putting the same ""stuff"" on - reality shows, extreme makeovers, show that glorify pulling others to pieces in public, etc, instead of more original shows like Firefly looks to be.Is it perfect? no, (nothing is)...is it the best show ever? Not for me... But this show and characters grabbed me as no other has for a while, and that's saying something. So decided to write my views and opinion here where I started my journey into the Firefly universe...I hope someone will come along and pick this show up again somehow as I feel it still has much promise, but kinda doubt it..originality seems to be a thing of the past nowadays...sad...Mike Haslam"	5.0	Surprised so far...	2006-01-02	9	9	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHZRK7F3UNCAC	Michael	After viewing so many different styles of sci-fi shows, this one takes the slice of cake in being completly different.  Who knew that the western style would end up moving from earth, to outer space and still thrive the young and old alike.  I would have to recommend this movie to all alike, because in a way everyone has one type of personality trait from each of the characters.	5.0	A view through a madman's eyes	2004-04-23	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2B2C3DEWQ6KJH	michael	There was only one season of Firefly, although a fairly successful film was spun off of the series. There could be said to be two main genres of science fiction screen adaptations. The first and most prevalent of these is the space opera &#8211; basically a &#8220;western&#8221; action piece set in space or in some futuristic setting. The second would be a philosophical speculation about how our current circumstances and essential nature (culture, social institutions, politics, religion, folly, etc.) might be expressed as time and technology evolve.Firefly is primarily a lush and well-done example of the first genre, with generous and intriguing sprinklings of the second. Larger themes which run through the episodes include how people might bond or interact in stressful situations; what &#8220;ethical&#8221; might look like in the context of an essentially unethical civilization; and explorations of conformity or resistance to a powerfully dominant and intrusive culture.That might sound bloodless or esoteric, but such themes are imbedded within what is, for the most part, inventive screenwriting and well-crafted plots. Science fiction succeeds when the projection into the future (or alternative now) is rich with consistent and interactive detail. If this series would have been allowed to continue it might have gone even more interesting places, but the season we have is worth investigating.  If you like Firefly, by the way, you will probably love Babylon 5 &#8211; a five season masterpiece.	5.0	Quality Science Fiction	2013-02-23	1	1	0

Later we watched the series and it instantly became my all time favorite of any series/movie/show I have watched.  After watching at my brother's house I went out and placed an order to have it myself as well.It just kills me that they haven't made more seasons or movies.  I really hope they do both and soon.At this price..I felt like I was stealing when I ordered.  I would of paid $100. easy for this series, it is a must have.	5.0	Best Series Ever	2006-12-08	8	8	0

Ridiculous? Awful? Cause of severe eye-bleeding? I'm not sure how I can really describe this show.  I probably even managed to make it through half the episodes without knowing or caring who was doing what before I gave up and sold it on here to some poor misguided soul. The acting is bad.  So is the writing.  And the western style is absurd.  Why in the H would people redevelop western accents?  Is the medieval British accent making a comeback?

It's funny, Fox used to be THE risk taking network.  Now if something doesn't take off like a rocket they burry it.  What's even more sad is that dispite how this show was treated during the half season run...it's still loved by legions of faithful fans, and even scored a feature length movie.Great storytelling, solid acting, and characters you'll fall in love with.Firefly is also getting a board game in September 2013.  I played a demo at GenCon, and decided to buy it.  Oddly enough, for a show with so little merit that they didn't even bother to air every episode...the 300 copies of the prerelease were sold completely out less than ten minutes after the exhibit hall opened on Thursday morning.The more time passes, the less likely a comeback seems, but Fox can't take the sky from me...here's to hoping.	5.0	Tragic...	2013-08-27	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A158DIYAGUWCPU	Michael M. Dunlap	"When this show first started airing on TV, people were hyping it up on the sole reason that it was a ""Joss Whedon"" show.  Being neither a big Buffy nor Angel fan, this told me nothing, and I let the entire short run on Fox pass me by.Having only been introduced to this series a few months ago, I have fallen in love with it.  The setting is robust, even if the episodes ocassionally have moments of trying to find their own place (a blatant X-files like reference in one episode that is never repeated stands out as one).  Some of the best episodes invole the wackiest situations (Jaynestown and Our Mrs. Reynolds being 2 of the best episodes), but they all shine as great episodes on their own.The characterization is great, the store gripping, and the concept engaging.  Overall, this series is well worth the $40 I paid for it a few months ago.Finally, a parting note about the upcoming movie ""Serenity"" - if you liked the series you'll LOVE the movie.  It continues on with the store of the crew of Serenity and tells the in depth story of River (played by Summer Glau) and why she is chased by the galactic government known as the Alliance.  I would highly suggest seeing at least some of the episodes on this DVD before seeing the movie."	5.0	An amazing series	2005-06-08	8	8	0

What really caught my eye in the beginning was the space ship, Serenity, a ""firefly-class vessel"".  The ship layout and design really spoke to me as an engineer, but the story lines, characters and plots were just as intriguing, mixing a ""wild-west"" theme with deep space expansion.  The parallels aren't too far off the mark.  Too bad this series was ahead of it's time and was cancelled after 11 episodes, would have liked to see the rest of Season 1 and many more!

Given how little it cost for this DVD, I felt I had to get it.  I don't feel this is Academy-award material by any means, but it is, as I said, ""very solid"".  The acting is good, the production is clean.  The sets and environments are interesting, and well-crafted.  The script walks the line between funny and serious.  It isn't a comedy, but there is camaraderie and joking, but also a willingness to explore serious topics and not pull punches in the process.  The characters are interesting and unique, and have an obvious chemistry.  It is definitely enjoyable.  I love the theme song, it's pretty awesome, and perfectly suited to the show (though I don't know if it was custom-made for that purpose).If you like this, I would recommend Legend of the Seeker.  A very similar show in many regards (though fantasy), also cancelled early (though it made it further along).  The Legend of the Seeker is based off the Sword of Truth series, and deals with a lot of moral issues."	4.0	very solid	2012-10-02	4	2	2

I found the story line different from other sci-fic series. A touch of the old wild west meets modern technology five hundred years in the future with plenty of humor. The Serenity (a spaceship) and its crew traverse space making a living anyway they can while keeping clear of the ruling authorities. Pleasantly missing for a change are any fancy robots and aliens to detract from the story. Not to distract from the rest of the cast, who are all terrific, but Ron Glass from ""Barney Miller"" TV series has been missed. He is a great actor. Too bad the series ended after one season. Only thing I can add is after the series get the movie ""Serenity"" It answers some of the lingering questions."	5.0	Terrific Sci-Fic Series	2010-10-10	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A18IZ5QX2PRB3C	Michael Stack	"I realize that's a tall order I've written in my title for this review, but its not an exaggeration-- Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" is one of those rare things-- the right combination of concept and execution that ends up producing something magical.Captain Malcolm Reynolds (playing by Nathan Fillion) commands a Firefly-class starship (which he dubbed ""Serenity"") and a small crew-- first officer Zoe (Gina Torres), pilot 'Wash' (Alan Tuydk), engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite) and hired gun Jayne (Adam Baldwin).  Reynolds and companies take whatever jobs they can find-- everything from legitimate business to smuggling, impolite odd jobs, and so on.  The large, centralized government can't quite provide for its citizens, and sometimes desparate measures are necessary.  Still, legitimate business is a good thing when available, and a Registered Companion (a legal prostitute named Inara played by Morena Baccarin) travels with the crew to give them some respectability.  One day, they take on some passengers to make some extra cash-- a shepherd, sort of a modern preacher, by the name of Book (Ron Glass) and a young doctor-- Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and it pretty much all goes downhill from there.  Along the way, they meet the doctor's sister (River, expertly played by Summer Glau) and discover they've gotten a bit more than they bargained for.But what makes this any better than any other science fiction show?  What separates out ""Firefly"" to have all these dedicated fans who organized letter writing campaigns and will tell anyone who listen about how wonderful the show is?  What makes someone like me, who never saw it during its first run and was given a copy of the DVD set for Christmas, go out and buy sets for other people as a gift and tell everyone I know they need to see this, including finally sitting down to write this review?Well to put it short, it's not a standard science fiction show-- its not glamorous, there's no incredible high technology, there's no aliens, there's no dramatic space combat.  It feels more like  a bunch of lower-middle-class folks trying to find a way to survive in the world and get by.  Sometimes they do things that aren't great, and a lot of people look down on them, but they can hold their head up high knowing they maintain their diginity and respectability.Add to this a series of superb scripts, absolutely brilliant acting across the board, and a chemistry between the cast that is so rarely found anywhere and you've really got a reciple for brilliance.  By the second episode, you know each of the characters pretty well, you understand them, by the middle of the season, you get bummed when one of them has a bad day.  By the end, you can't believe that Fox was naive enough to actually cancel this show.This is really essential viewing, not just for fans of science fiction.  Anyone who enjoys good drama should check out ""Firefly"" (and the forthcoming ""Serenity"" movie).  This is among the best material ever committed to celluloid.  Highly recommended."	5.0	Perhaps the best science fiction to grace television.	2005-08-01	12	12	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2MXZEVFQ0M3NF	Michael Surma	I'm often surprised at the poor reviews this series gets from 'Sci-Fi addicts'.  I more often find that people complain about the setting, or specifically call out Joss Whedon rather than focusing on the show itself.  So, before anyone goes too far off the mark, let's call a few things to light.First, it's Joss Whedon.  The show is meant to be campy to a degree, and the show is meant to be enjoyable and generally light with a present but contained darker side.  Look at his other work in TV - much of it fits this bill, with only a bit of variation.Second, it's a western... in space.  Period.  It's not supposed to be the evolution of man, the pioneering of new worlds, or societal fall-backs to an older time.  It's treated like a standard western moved into a space setting.  It's also Sci-Fi, so don't expect anything less and enjoy the combined oddities space and westerns add together.Third, the characters develop over time. They're not transparent, and those that have reviewed and talked about poor character development certainly haven't watched the show enough.  I've gone through the series once, and have quite a bit of detail about each character involved (save one, who is purposefully left in a hazy background).Fourth, the plot lines may not be the most original, but they each have their own twists.  With the amount of western material out there, I don't expect much new on that front, so transferring it to space only present limited options to expand.  However, each plot line was delivered well, and has enough personal flavor to stand alone.If people have a problem with the plot or the acting, it's all based on personal preference at that point.  I personally thought the plot was fine, and the actors did a respectable job.  My main reason for such high marks was the enjoyment factor - the series was Whedon staple, enjoyable content with humor and camp appropriately inserted.  I enjoy a good laugh, and as long as I'm laughing with the series and not at it, I call that successful.  And while I don't know that this show would be winning any particular awards for the series, it certainly fits my bill for a repeatable enjoyment factor - something I'll definitely watch again in the future when I need a light-hearted laugh.	5.0	It works for entertainment, it's not meant to be reality.	2008-08-04	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L	Michael Valdivielso	Firefly was a great show, a show that could have been greater.  With only 14 episodes, many of which were never aired, this character-driven, action packed, sci-fi TV series really was never given a chance.  With such wonderful episodes as War Stories and Out Of Gas it should have been around for five or six seasons.  This DVD set gives you all of it, with added audio commentary on some of the episode, deleted scenes, a gag reel, behind-the-scene features and even a Easter Egg of Adam Baldwin singing the Hero Of Canton.  With the movie out maybe they will think about re-starting the show?New or used this is a MUST for any sci-fi library.	5.0	What could have been...	2005-10-08	3	2	1

This is a good series, but not great. FIREFLY doesn't deserve one hundred percent five-star ratings, guys. Okay? I mean REALLY. For one thing, the characters are still using shotguns five hundred years from now. How lame is that? Plus the series comes off as a kind of western oater with spacecraft. I mean, the guys on the show dress like nineteeth century cavalry troopers, with the riding boots, pants with the stripe up the side, and the suspenders, instead of 24th century types. And frankly some of the scenes look suspiciously like cheapo backlot studio sets rejected from grade B western flicks. (Hey, quit throwing rocks, you fanatics! Note that I give FIREFLY four-stars. OKAY?) Let me say I like this series because of its clever and witty dialogue, hot chicks and studley heros, and the relationships between the crew. (Will the captain ever confess his love for the ""whore""? Will the flight engineer and the doctor get together?) I like the ugly spaceship, Serenity, which looks like a giant june bug with rotating Harrier jet pods and a drop-down loading ramp. I like the characters, especially the foxy prositute and the business-only captain. These actors somehow should be in movies somewhere, they are that good looking and that talented, but for the life of me, I can't rememeber seeing them elsewhere. FIREFLY at times is pure western soap with shoot-outs on horse back and bar brawls, but, uh, WHO CARES? It's so well done. Elements have obviously been borrowed from ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER and western flicks, and at times it is both corny and sexy, but what really saves FIREFLY and propells it out among the stars is the writing and the acting. To the objective observer, there are reasons FIREFLY as a series didn't last; it certainly could have been better with a little more imagination and creativity, but it is pretty good and a lot of fun....Whoa there, Trigger!"	4.0	WESTERN SOAP BUT WHO CARES?	2006-02-03	26	7	19

I was finally turned on to it by a friend, and have never looked back. Now I regret that Fox was ever managed by a bunch of numbskulls that cancelled a brilliant program. It is a drama, but with the right touch of humor. It is 'sci-fi', but not too fantastical. It is believable and watchable and incredibly engaging.I know I am likely in the minority, but now, so many years later, I don't think they could bring this series back. Part of the mythos is from the outrage against Fox for cancelling it, and the years it has lived and breathed in the fans' hearts and minds have given it a reputation that I doubt it could live up to if 'brought back'. Fox screwed up royally, but there's no way to fix it now. Now, we have to be satisfied that Joss Wheadon has shown all those naysayers that he was the horse to bet on, just as so many fans did, and that we all 'knew him when'.I'll just have to be content to think that Serenity is still out there in the black, making her runs, giving her crew a home, and that they are content with that home.	5.0	No power in the 'verse...	2013-04-25	1	1	0

There was adventure, drama, comedy, a great plot, and and excellent cast of likable characters.  It was a very unique mix of the sci-fi and western genres, as well as a bit of an Asian flair, since in this version of the future, China was one of the major superpowers to survive.  It all made for a great story of outlaws in space, making their way in a postwar world.In summary, the acting and writing on this series was stellar, the plot and character development was excellent, and it will leave you wanting more.

A western style tale set in the ""frontier"" of space, the show focuses on humanity instead of aliens.  Each character has a fully developed history and relationship to the rest of the crew, and the plot slowly unfolds to reveal a larger picture. Given an open mind and half a chance, this show is thought provoking, highly entertaining, and provides a variety of personalities for folk to relate to.  Joss is brilliant at creating a familiar world of consistant phrases and speech patterns for each of his shows, and this series takes it a step further by incorporating an actual foreign language in place of common slang.  The crew holds true to their own code of honor, while trying to stay one step ahead of trouble.  Another plus is the unique, fresh cast selection, which is largely unfamiliar faces, who will hopefully become more familiar in the future.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A26AOJ8OFEW43J	"Miguel D. Rodriguez ""miguel"""	"And a show that is in my Top 5 of all time.  Firefly was a thoroughly refreshing and original show that dared to defy the conventions of the genres that composed it.  Namely Sci-fi and the Western.  One departure from the norm--space dramas do not have to include aliens!  This show is about familiar human problems--and responses to those problems--when placed in an extraordinary and fantastic setting.  The characters are incredibly three dimensional (and this includes a wide variety of wonderful character flaws) with sharp dialog and acting that makes the viewer forget that they are watching a work of fiction.Yes, the Special Effects are exceptional.  Yes, there is an abundance of humor and action.  Yes, there are high-speed spaceship chases!  These facts are really just a BONUS to a well-written and character-driven show.Firefly premeired in 2002 on the FOX Network.  FOX, being a major network that demanded immediate and equally major ratings, pulled the plug on this show prematurely when the ratings weren't up to expectations (of course, this is due in part to it's doomed friday night time-slot and FOX's decision to show the episodes out of order, but I digress).This show's cancellation is not a testament to the quality of the show.  The DVD sales upon its release were impressive enough for Universal Studios to greenlight the feature film ""Serenity"" based upon the series.  There have been three separate advanced screenings so far across the country that sold out immediately.  The release is September 30th.As of this writing, the DVD set of this ""failed"" Television show is #4 on the Amazon.com Top Sellers DVD list.  The Serenity movie official fansite (browncoats.serenitymovie.com) has close to 40,000 members and the number is growing every day.  All this is mainly through word of mouth.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKIIETXG91DHH	Mike Flagstaff	This television series got lost somehow among potential viewers as it was short lived. Maybe the gratification factor wasn't quick enough to grab a large viewership. Maybe it was poorly or under promoted. Maybe the television executives long ago traded in their sense of pride in craftsmanship for the almighty buck. Nevertheless, the writing and directing produced a synergy of characters and storytelling unlike anything I've seen on television since Twin Peaks and Babylon 5, not that there are any parallels to be made. Firefly enveloped you with every second of storytelling. In Firefly, character development and synergy are unmatched, and I couldn't help but feel like the crew should be in my own family; when the series ended I felt left behind. The new movie, Serenity, will, I hope, revive the television series, or at least spawn a series of cinematic sequels, that will hopefully fill the coffers of the moguls to keep it going but will unquestionably satisfy the fans.	5.0	Pure magic	2005-10-12	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A33AV44C4FFZL3	MikeFrett	Religious folk should probably think twice about watching this series as it's fairly anti-religion in nature. Oddly enough, most Republicans claim to be Religious but watch Fox News which is owned, of course, by Fox. Incidentally, Fox makes some of the most Liberal films today. Something to hang your Hat on.Character development is very high and overpowers any action that may take place. The character played by Summer Glau however, has many plot holes and after 14 episodes, we still don't know much about her. This could have been one reason for cancellation as having a main character without any character development is a setup for failure. It's not really a series for those who require high amounts of action. You could think of Firefly as a Sci-Fi Western.Sometimes, Chinese is spoken as mostly nonsense curse words. Fox let this slip because the show was targeted at American audiences. That's probably insulting to a lot of Americans. It's a great series, I enjoyed it. be sure to buy the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; because it brings a conclusion to the show. You have an incomplete purchase if you fail to buy the movie.The show is anamorphic 1.78.1 AKA It fills your Widescreen TV (The Movie at 2.35.1 does not). Picture quality is fantastic upscaled but the Menus are very slow because they are animated and the Episodes are not numbered nor do they have a description.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3HCPK54FATFO4	Mike Garrison	This is one of the two most frustrating TV series ever. (The other one was Cupid, with Jeremy Piven.) It wasn't perfect, it wasn't the best thing on television, and once in a while it wasn't even particularly good (&quot;The Train Job&quot;). But it had a soul, and when it was firing on all cylinders it was very special indeed.The DVD set merely exagerates the pain, because it shows how much better the series would have been without the network interference. Many of the strange shifts in the story (and the characterization) become understandable when the episodes are viewed in their proper order. And then ... it ends.I almost hesitate to recommend this DVD set, because I feel bad about breaking the hearts of a new set of fans. But the more people that buy this set, perhaps the more likely that the next chancy, bold, intelligent series might be given more of a chance to succeed.	5.0	bittersweet	2004-04-12	8	8	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	All you have to do is look at the air dates on the back of the DVD cases to see how Fox royally screwed this show from the outset.  The episode that was meant to be the pilot, to set up the entire series, was not aired until the show was on the air for three months.  Even then it was not aired in its entirety.  Episodes were aired out of order so the story arcs did not flow, and as a result the story did not make as much sense.  All this ensured the series could never gain a foothold.  Anyone with any inkling of Joss Whedon's storytelling style on his other shows knows the way Fox handled this show was the death knell for it.It is sad that these 14 episodes and the movie Serenity are all that will ever be of these characters and the world the writers were trying to create.  It was a unique blend of sci-fi, space exploration, and wild-west shoot outs.  There were many characters all with unique stories that could never been fully explored.  Much like how Buffy started out, the cast was ensemble, with lesser known actors in the lead roles.  Nathan Fillion was probably the most recognizable actor as the series started, but even he was not a mega star.  All that said, because all of the actors were good and the writing was top notch, they pulled it off extremely well.The best way I can describe the show is a mix of Star Trek and Dukes of Hazzard (yet not as cheesy as the Dukes could be).  If you are a fan of Joss Whedon's other shows like Buffy, Angel and Dollhouse, or even watched Firefly when it was on the air but could never really get into it, get the series and see it as it was meant to be seen.  It was a unique show in which the good guys were not totally good, and the bad guys were not all bad.  There are a lot of shades of gray to the characters, and everyone has a sense of being in it for themselves.  If you have seen the movie Serenity and it did not make much sense, this will fill in the gaps and give you the back-story for the movie.  Serenity shows where the series would have gone had it been given a chance. Now we can only wonder how they would have gone from point A to point B	5.0	A wonderful show that still makes you wonder what could have been	2012-08-24	1	1	0

But Star Trek was a sterile proto-socialist fantasy, without a comprehensible culture beyond starfleet itself.I like Star Wars better, but despite the detailed world building it remained a fairly predictable space opera.Firefly (and the Serenity movie) are the best damn science fiction I have ever watched on a screen.  I can't believe that there is no more of this to watch.  I will not believe it.  I am going to think really, really desperate and evil thoughts until someone gives me another fix.OK, so I hate reviews that just say something was good and the network is evil for having cancelled it, no matter how true that is.  A person reads a review not to determine whether someone they have never heard of likes something, but, hopefully, whether they might like it.  So here is my pathetic attempt to describe greatness.  Why I loved Firefly1. Detailed world building.  I can easily see how the worlds of humankind shown in this series evolved from the world of today.  Any projection into the future is hazardous, but at least this series makes a reasoned attempt at such a projection.  I see bits and pieces of the world we know, taken apart and reassembled on another stage, as, indeed, they will have been after the passage of 500 years.  Whether it is the Chinese characters in the shop windows, the opulent, almost Raj-like feel of the Tam estate and the clothes worn there, the eclectic, practical, almost wild west garb of the outer worlds, or the oriental but not quite specific derivation of Inara's quarters, I can tell that someone spent a lot of time and energy trying to trace out the lines of this future society.  Which leads me to2. The emphasis on the everyday and practical.  There aren't any aliens cluttering up the landscape.  What's more, industrial zones look like there is active industry, rural areas have real farmers and miners.  Laser weapons exist, but there is a realization that putting a high speed piece of lead through a person is likely to be just as fatal (if not more so) than burning them with a laser.  (And I loved the ""check battery"" indicator on the laser pistol, too.)  We also get to see what sort of goods a future smuggler smuggles, and its not always ""spice"" or precious metals.  Firefly deals with medical supplies, concentrated food bars, engine parts, ceramics, seed, even a herd of cows for goodness' sakes.  Anything real people might want to get that they may not have.  They even talk about buying clay of high quality (though this is a cover) Which leads me to3. A view of the future from street level.  There are few worldshaking events in Firefly, and what there are are seen from the viewpoint of ordinary people, hustlers, dirt farmers, ""mudders"", mechanics (and, yes, prostitutes, but preachers, too).  This show is not about ambassadors, jedi knights, queens, admirals or generals.  I think it's significant that Mal was a sergeant in the Independent army, not even an officer much less a field commander.  Which leads me to4. Nine very unforgettable and well formed characters.  None of them are particularly extraordinary people (ok, River is, but that's the exception that proves the rule.  The series ended when we were just getting a glimpse of how extraordinary she is.  The movie tells us a lot more.  She is, however, still a ""little person"")  All of them are complicated, all of them are compelling, and all of them could make a suitable paper about character development in a college English class.  Sometimes I might think I like Kaylee best; her wide-eyed upbeat attitude, her poor white trash background (being as how that's what I am), her crush on Simon, or the bigger crush she has on engines.  I think of her lying wounded crooning ""there's my good girl"" to the ship.  Other times I can't help but like not-quite dumb as a post tough-guy Jayne, who always seems to want to kill somebody (and tries selling out fellow crew members once) but who wears the stupid hat his mother made him and agonizes over the young man who dies for him in ""Jaynestown.""  Actually, I love them all, but I don't have room for more examples.  (My daughter, the English major, doesn't care for Inara and Simon.  I think she's wrong.  The show would be different without them.)  All of which leads me to5. Real people dealing with real moral dilemmas.  Mal likes to think of himself as a hardbitten criminal.  Problem is, that in the course of the show he is constantly turning down jobs, backing out of them, protecting people with no hope of return, and doing other insipidly noble things.  He drives Jayne to distraction, but Jayne is not immune to this malady either.  None of them are.  Shepherd Book may comment that he seems to have gotten on the wrong ship, and Kaylee may lightly reply to Simon's question about what they are doing with ""Crime."" but these are basically good people.  The epitome of this, of course, is the fact that Serenity takes in Simon and River, despite the trouble this is bound to cause them.  On the other hand, evil in the world of Firefly is both less obvious and more real.  (Clue: The Alliance is evil).  However, there is no leader in black robes with a maniacal laugh shouting out that here lies evil.  In point of fact, perfectly good people might and do honestly see the Alliance as a force for good, as exemplified by Inara's statement that she supported unification.  No, rather than being told that evil is here, we are shown it.  The epitome of this is what was being done to River, but there is much more.  ""We meddle,"" says River in the movie.  Darn right they do.6. Contravention of stereotypes.  I always thought that if a villain told me he was going to hunt me down and kill me, that, rather than walk nobly away, I would shoot him in the head.  Mal does me one better.  He kicks the guy into a spinning turbine.  Another example: when Mal demands of a recalcitrant crew ""Do you want to run this ship?"", Jayne replies ""Yes!"", and all the flustered hero can think of to say is ""Well, you can't.""  Not to mention other cool and different things enumerated above incidently, like the continued use of slug-throwing weaponry (and even non-laser swords and knives).7. I can't enumerate all the really funny parts.  Just one example is when Jayne wants to trade Mal his favorite gun for the woman Mal supposedly married while drunk.  ""She has a name,"" says Mal, and Jayne replies, ""So does this!  Vera . . .""  (Vera sees action in at least two episodes.  She is indeed a fine gun.)The one thing I can't get my mind around is that this series is Joss Whedon's work.  I am something less than a fan of his other work.  I can't imagine in what corner of his brain he was hiding it; I just want to thank him for it.  I can't believe I missed the series when it was on tv.  I can't wait for another movie.  Can somebody take the hint out there?  I'm a bit desperate."	5.0	I can't believe there is so little of it.	2005-12-14	551	519	32

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"I must now make my anguished confession: I was one of those who let ""Firefly"" die. Not that my watching it when it was first broadcast 11 years ago would have saved it, but I certainly would have been one of the thousands of fans who wrote to the Fox Network and helped pay for trade industry ads in an attempt to save the show. Only just now have I watched the complete series--all 12 episodes of it--and I think it is one of the best shows in the history of television. It is witty, poignant, exciting, with a spaceship full of rich, fully realized characters played by a sterling cast. All the actors were so wonderful, in fact, that my favorite tended to be the one I was watching at the time.I like science fiction and love Westerns, and Joss Whedon's synthesis of the two genres went far beyond clever. In a mere handful of episodes, Whedon and his collaborators created a totally convincing fictional world, with consistent rules and very believable dangers. The ""Making Of"" documentary in this DVD set demonstrates amply the attachment the actors and crew had to the show, and to each other, as well as the disappointment bordering on abject grief they felt at the show's cancellation.I'm happy that most of ""Firefly's"" actors have gone on to success. But I'd much rather see Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds than as Richard Castle, and while I wouldn't give up Christina Hendricks as Joan Harris for anything, I will miss her as Saffron, the baddest bad girl in the galaxy. In any case, ""Firefly"" is a textbook example of a program that should have premiered on premium cable, where it would have had a chance for an audience to acclimate itself to the world of Mal Reynolds and his crew. At least I have the feature film ""Serenity"" to look forward to, and I can buy this DVD set, which I plan to do. But meanwhile, if Jayne Cobb decides to come after me, Vera in hand, all I will be able to say in response is, ""Mea culpa."""	5.0	Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...	2013-02-03	2	2	0

Although I'm disappointed that Amazon raised the price of this set by $10 (which made it fall from its number 6 spot in the Top Selling DVDs list into the 30s), the fact that it still remains in the top 40 highest-selling DVDs is yet another testament to its enduring appeal. Never has a television show been more deserving of a renewal than this one. FOX, if you're listening, please put this show back on the air. And consumers, don't stop buying this set.

It's smart, funny, touching, smartly funny in a touching way, and touchingly funny with a smart fashion sense. It's everything a show should be. To swipe a line from Blade Runner (hopefully to sell it later for fantastic profit), the light that burns twice as bright burns for half as long, and Firefly burned so very, very brightly. Sadly, that means Firefly's life was far too short. There's a reason fans are so passionate about this show. Get this skinny little box set and find out why.Plus, watching this show will instantly make you a big damn hero. I'm not kidding. A big... damn... hero.	5.0	I need this show back. Not want.

I had recently become a huge convert to the Buffy-verse, but was dubious about the premise of a ""space western.""  Silly me!  Once I'd watched and rewatched all my Buffy and Angel DVDs, I just had to have more Joss and turned in desperation to Firefly.  I was hooked less than halfway into the pilot movie and had to fight the urge to call in sick the next day so I could watch the whole series back-to-back.  I was so distressed when I got to the last episode, ""Objects in Space"", that I made myself go back and rewatch all the other episodes first so that I could savor the experience.  Imagine my delight when I got online and discovered that Joss and crew have already shot a feature film and that it will be out this spring!  Firefly lives!Now, about this premise.  The western thing took awhile to buy into, but stick with it and before long galloping horses and the abundant use of ""ain't"" get less jarring as all the pieces fall into place.  It all works for two reasons - the ensemble cast is amazing and the cinematography is breathtaking.  It is so evident that each and every member of the cast and crew was having the time of their lives working on this show because each element is so meticulously perfect.  I don't have the vocabularly to convey how very, very good the cast is.  This show wouldn't have worked without Nathan Fillion.  Dare I say it?  He almost makes me forget Captain Piccard.  Charisma, angst, comedy, passion - not to mention the good looks.  This boy has it all.  Gina Torres is a goddess, and Summer Gua gives a beautifully nuanced performance.  Adam Baldwin is masterful, and it's a delight to see Ron Glass again.All the episodes work, but expect a wide range of genres.  There's horror (""Bushwacked""), comedy (""Our Mrs. Reynolds""), classic sci fi (""Ariel""), even a study of existentialism (""Objects in Space"" - and thank you to Joss for explainging that in the commentary).  The only episode I wasn't crazy about was ""The Train Job"" which isn't surprising since it was the network's misguided pilot do-over.This DVD set is loaded with extra features.  Half of the episodes have commentary.  Joss himself chimes in on three, and several members of the cast participate as well.  It is so, so refreshing that the stars of the show participate both in the commentaries and the ""making of"" featurettes.  I only have one teeny complaint.  More a piece of advice than a complaint, really.  The title and individual episode menus don't indicate which episodes have commentary; you have to click on the ""language selection"" option to find the commentary.Words fail me.  I can't thank Joss Whedon enough for this masterpiece, and I am eternally grateful that he was so dedicated to the show that despite all obstacle he's made it into a feature film.  This is how much I love this show - I'm seriously considering buying a plane ticket from Armenia where I work to the States for the premiere of the film.  And I'm not even a sci fi geek!  Well, maybe a little.  I'd try to come up with more superlatives, but I must go order copies for all my family and friends.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A34NYSFTLPY3UQ	Misha Lee	My only complaint is Fox only aired Firefly for one season (14 episodes). It's once in a blue moon that a series grabs me enough that I *have* to watch every episode. The others: Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Shield. It's rarer still when I can watch a series repeatedly. The other, Buffy, also by Joss Whedon. He's absolutely brilliant with a lot to say.I didn't come across this masterpiece until a couple years ago when friends thought I would like it. I love it! After I watched the series, they had me watch Serenity, which ties up loose ends to the too soon cut series. Talk about going out with a bang. I now own both. Only after these and falling in love with Whedon's cinematography and writing did I start enjoying Buffy (thanks to my same friends).Even if you aren't a huge fan of sci-fi or westerns, the plots and character depth is enough to catch one in their snares. It's witty, funny, cliff hanging, and cutting edge for a series. The cast is superb and I now perk up when anything has Nathan Fillion, who got the part of Malcom Reynolds after a short appearance as an evil priest in Buffy. Firefly/Serenity have an increasingly large mass of fans and followers. It becomes a contagious addiction. I now have two friends hooked, lined, and sunk.	5.0	Short changed by Fox!	2007-05-16	3	3	0

I resisted watching these, the original description made the show sound like a rip-off of Han Solo.  So, I come to this show 4 years later and so sad it took this long.I watched 8 hours yesterday. Sometime during Disk 2 I got hooked. And as my interest grew, I noticed that the box said ""complete"" season, not ""first"" season.  I saved the last episode and the Serenity movie for tonight, so my firefly-topia isn't over yet.I didn't get it at first.  How can you mix Space Age technology with Gunslingers and the Old West?  As the series progresses, you come to realize the Old West type planets are the outlying settlements away from the ""Core"" as they call it.  Human colonies staking a hold on new planets, similar to the settlers migrating from mature European cities to colonize America.There is a strong bond of camaraderie among the small ship crew that is tested again and again.  The banter of dialog is appreciatively written for a grown-up perspective.  The lines delivered quick, spoken in tones and undertones suitable for the relationship perspectives given.  The dialog and acting are full of nuances and suggestions, raising the talent to a level that outshines its humble yet lovely theme song.The brother/sister characters, River and Simon(the doctor).  The madness of River, makes this relationship reminiscent of Hamlet.  Remember Ophelia?  Daisies for Remembrance.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25AXWGBGJ5KBS	"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo"""	"Without an ounce of hyperbole, this show was the best thing on television in the last thirty years.Better than MASH, Hill Street Blues, Cheers, Seinfeld, Buffy, ST:TNG, Sopranos, West Wing...anything.Because this show takes ALL those shows...all the great aspects and beloved moments of those shows...and mixes them into an altogether original and completely satisfying entertainment.It's a little sci-fi show that has heavy Western (as in John Wayne, not as in hemisphere) elements, an elegant juxtaposition that brings the future and the past together in a way that makes is, funnily, remarkably current and fresh.The drama part of the show leans towards the romantic (like ""thirtysomething"") and the medical (like ""ER"").The action is more ""real"" and less ""lasers""...the science fiction part of the show is not about aliens or the ""weird"". It's about how in the future, people would either speak English or Chinese, both with equal facility. The fact that their cursing and other interjections are ""spontaneously"" in Chinese comes off hysterically funny. Plus it adds realism by avoiding ""bleeps"". The violence is not cartoonish at all.The cast, seriously, is a joy to behold. Nathan Fillion, as Captain Malcolm Reynolds, is a find. He brings a swashbuckling smart-ass quality as the group's leader. Adam Baldwin, as the swaggering, dim but aggressive Jayne, adds loutish humor to his well-played menace. Gina Torres, as First Mate Zoe, is a terrific character. Black, smart, beautiful, capable, loyal, intense and female. The type we need more of on television, whether you're paralyzed by political correctness or not.Zoe is married to Alan Tudyk's pilot Wash, who is the ""funny guy"" on the show, but his function is not only to be funny. The two of them add fun sexy moments to the ensemble.Sean Maher, as a young trauma surgeon (hooray!) and Summer Glau as his mysterious, odd sister River mix perfectly with the others. River's storyline adds a whole ""X-Files"" conspiracy thread, and having a surgeon on board allows for all sorts of medical crises that elevate suspense and tension. In the 14 episodes, everybody gets shot or stabbed at least once.Ron Glass, as the incredibly cool preacher, Shepherd Book, clearly has a past that is hinted about, but due to the cancellation, is never fully revealed. But his character allows for the entry of several theologic and religious ideas that broaden many of the plots in ways you could have never expected.Jewel Staite, as the adorable mechanic Kaylee, is an irresistible creation. Cute and sexy, fallible, vulnerable, but a whiz with the ship.And finally, Miss Baccarin as Inara. Is there any male out there who saw this show and didn't absolutely melt whenever she came on the screen? She's one of the most unexpectedly beautiful women I've ever seen. She plays a ""Companion""...a courtesan of sorts...who generates blinding sparks with the Captain.Palpable heat. Your TV set WILL get warmer.It's the classic situation...they can't fall in love, but you know they already have.The scripts are impossibly funny, unpredictable, exciting...never boring or routine. Whedon, Minear and friends lead you down a path that feels familiar, and suddenly, you're in a place you never considered. Blissfully.The acting is top-notch...THIS is the best ensemble cast of recent memory. Better than the West Wing. Better than the Sopranos.And I LOVE those shows...The special effects are nicely done, and the cinematography, in combination with the digital effects, adds startling immediacy to the proceedings. ""Hand held"" shaky shots of a landing spaceship? Things slightly out of frame. Fast zooms to a ship out in the atmosphere...it's a brilliant idea perfectly executed. It may be impossible to describe, but once you see it, you'll know what I'm trying to describe.After regretfully finishing the last episode, I found myself angry.I wanted more. I was disappointed with myself that I didn't support the show when it was on the air. I was disappointed that it was cancelled abruptly. I was angry that HBO or somebody didn't take it over......it goes without saying that I am now unbelievably excited for the movie this year, but had not been before seeing this show.My only hope is that enough people see the movie, to make some ignorant network bigwig thing, ""Hey...we should turn this into a TV show!""I love this show."	5.0	The best television show of the last 30 years.	2005-06-28	19	17	2

There may be life out there, but I don't think they're waiting for our first warp signature.If after watching Firefly you wonder why it was cancelled, remember network execs always program to the lowest common denominator and don't know what to do with a series that requires a bit of attention to witty dialog. Also, Firefly was aired erratically, no one knew if there would even be another episode. The canceling of Firefly falls right in the programming department's lap. It's a sad commentary on the state the entertainment industry.A couple of weeks ago, we took our 12 year old twins to see a preview of the unfinished Serenity (the first of a trilogy of Firefly theatricals in the making). Even in its incomplete state it was a treat. We are all impatiently waiting for September 30th and the final theatrical release. As children do, the girls are playing the discs whenever they can. They even want a Firefly marathon birthday party to introduce their friends to it. They just adore River and Kaylee!If you haven't seen it ... buy it!	5.0	Space expansion: as it will really be!	2005-06-07	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38M6Y4K9GQCCR	M.K.	I remember watching this series when it first aired on Fox and being disappointed when it abruptly vanished; I was sure it would never be available to buy so I was kicking myself for not having taped all of the episodes for repeat viewing. I was absolutely overjoyed when this came out on DVD, and the boxed set does not disappoint; the extras are cool, the commentaries are absolutely terrific, and even the packaging (with very slim DVD cases that I think everybody ought to use) is outstanding. There are three episodes in this set that were never aired in the US, and it's such a joy and pleasure to be able to see them; I think they're some of the finest the series has to offer, and a clear indicator that if it had been allowed to progress, this show would've just gotten better and better.I really can't recommend this DVD set strongly enough. I received my copy as a gift soon after it came out, and my roommate -- who says she likes the show but not enough to buy it -- has been &quot;borrowing&quot; discs on a regular basis ever since. I've run the series with several friends and every one of them gets hooked. &quot;Firefly&quot; is a show that's easy to love and real easy to get addicted to. I hear a movie's in the works, and I absolutely cannot wait.(Also, for those who haven't seen it, if you put in the last disc in this set, go to the extras, select the &quot;Joss Whedon sings the Firefly theme&quot; extra and then key left, there's an easter egg there of Adam Baldwin singing the ode to Jayne from the episode &quot;Jaynestown,&quot; while wearing the hat from &quot;The Message.&quot; Brilliant stuff.)	5.0	This boxed set is gorram brilliant!	2004-04-13	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GS5HP1Z4LASB	"M. LeBlanc ""i am comfortable"""	"The writing on this show is brilliant, and the actors carry out their lines well. Some people think that Inara is wooden, but I think that is how her training as a Companion would behave; very composed and proper. Also, other people complain about sex on this show, and how it has no place in science fiction. I totally disagree. If a series is supposed to be portraying the lives of 9 very different people (2 of whom are married on the ship), isn't sex a part of life? Every time I watch the last episode, I get depressed because there is nothing to follow. They did try to tie up some loose ends with the movie ""Serenity,"" but it still wasn't enough. Watching the bonus features, you can tell how much the actors loved and believed in the concept of Firefly, and how heartbroken they were when it was cancelled.I am a casual Sci-Fi fan. I don't immerse myself in these different worlds the way other more die-hard fans will. I love the ""Space Western"" thing. I love that there are no aliens and no travel at warp speed or hyperspace. Some criticize all that as unbelievable, but I think it's just another option. I was introduced to the series only a couple of years ago. I don't remember it being advertised when it was originally aired.

When I heard Joss Whedon was doing a new show, I knew I had to watch it. Within the first five minutes, I knew I was seeing something truly magical.Firefly was a gift. The dialogue is clever and witty, which is typical of Joss Whedon's shows. The characters are beautifully portrayed, human in their flaws, but still so loveable.I suggest everyone try watching it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1VQEOF99I8XLZ	"M. Li ""scutmonkey"""	Knew nothing about the TV series. Rented 'Serenity' on a lark and immediately got hooked on the characters and their back stories. Went back to rent the 'Firefly' DVD's. After watching just the first 2 discs, went online and purchased both the movie and TV series DVD's. Like what many of the previous reviewers have said, this is science fiction at its best. Any serious sci fi fan should do him/herself a favor and invest time in catching up with this show. It captures the essence and spirit of the original Star Wars Trilogy and the first two Star Trek series, which ironically, the latter have failed to do in recent sequel attempts. I am hopeful Mr Whedon and the powers that be can find some way to revive the Firefly series. Perhaps given a second chance (or I suppose a third if you count the movie), the public will realize what great story-telling they have missed out on.	5.0	A Must See!	2006-09-08	0	0	0

The core of nine main actors stayed totally in character and did an excellent job.If you enjoyed this series, I highly reccomend also getting ""SERENITY"". Although it is a good story by itself, it does tie up some loose ends from the FIREFLY series such as why the alliance was so obsessed with getting River back and also the origin of the Reavers."	5.0	FIREFLY - The Complete Series and SERENITY  dvds	2006-11-10	7	6	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1R6HIJMBIA2CZ	"M. Marsh ""broke college student"""	"My roommate introduced me to this series this year, explaining that I absolutely had to watch it or he would never forgive me.  And I understand why.  It's a well-done space western with great characters, good music, and fantastic writing.The addictive thing about Firefly is that it's essentially a character study.  There are nine members of the crew of Serenity, each of whom has a completely different personality.  In the course of the show, you get to know each character's wishes, dreams, vices, etc.  You come to love every character, even the ones to whom you can barely relate.But what really makes the show is Joss Wheedon's writing.  The series is full of laugh-out-loud lines (which means an awful lot, coming from me) and fantastic situations.  The addition of an awesome soundtrack with influences from everything from Chinese to old western music, not to mention a theme song that's simple and beautiful, doesn't hurt.The plot is basically concerned with following the various heists and misadventures that speckle the lives of the ragtag and sometimes criminal crew of the spaceship Serenity.  One failing is that in the course of these 14 episodes, there isn't a great deal of plot.  I should adjust that statement: the episodes themselves are tightly plotted and fast-moving, and there's some set up for an overarching plot, especially with the character of River Tam.  But there aren't many ties from one episode to another, and sometimes you aren't sure whether one day, one week, or six months have passed between episodes.  They generally don't tie together, though there are exceptions.  I'm not sure whether to blame Wheedon for not writing enough ties between the episodes, or to blame Fox for canceling the series before he could develop a large enough fan base to afford introducing a lot of plot.  What we get is a very episodic character study, which suits geeks like me.  And I guess that kind of thing is typical for dramas.Of course, if you want to see these characters involved in a plot, you can watch ""Serenity,"" the feature film follow-up to the canceled series.I could explain plots and characters, but it's essentially more fun to see the series and learn them yourself.  If you don't feel like buying the series, then just find your geekiest friend, especially if he or she likes spaceships.  Chances are that such a friend already owns the series."	4.0	great character series	2007-12-21	2	1	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1FH79YMHTZ2IK	"M. Mealey ""Cinemama"""	"For all those regular joes out there who can't possibly believe it's THAT good...It's not. But it IS good.I'll try my best to give a fair, balanced, honest, review.I did watch it's first run, missing a few episodes, here and there. I remember thinking it was only just okay, with potential to be better...Until I saw Objects in Space. With that episode I was convinced that this was something unique. In the end, I gave up watching because of the erratic program schedule.I ultimately saw the DVD this year, after seeing so many fansites still up and the news that this (Say what?!) is being made into a feature film...To be released in, no not TV, not direct to video, but in MOVIE THEATERS.First of all, if you dislike westerns, sci-fi, and quippy dialogue, stay FAR, FAR, away from this.For all of those who have never seen Firefly, and especially in light of recent Serenity screenings, you must ask yourself, ""What is it about this show that garners such an eusthusiastic cult audience? What is the deal here?""#1 It's the thoroughness with which the characters were written. There are many main characters, nine in all, and they are all completely rendered. There are no flat, clich&eacute;d, ""types"" here.One can tell, that had the series survived, these characters would have evolved and/or devolved in spectacularly interesting ways.#2 It's the thoroughness and uniqueness with which the world was concieved. There are details that make the series feel tangible, plausible, dirty even...Like good speculative fiction.No sound in space...No aliens...No ""lasers"" on the ship...A shot of Mal's tiny stainless steel toilet...Yes, a toilet was actually shown on primetime television.Fully-rendered worlds ALWAYS garner cult followings. Potter, Star Wars, and most famously, Star Trek are prime examples.The ship itself (the most important character on the show, hence the title) is small and submarine-like. This feels more plausible than deck afer deck of sleek corridors.The pristine, sterile, expansiveness of most other sci-fi series is not to be found with the heroes here.#3 Nobody's perfect. Everyone's got something going on. There's not one episode, where the characters are ""in the white""...They are always grey, sometimes dark grey.#4 The audience is trusted to have the attention span and patience to watch a multi-episode, multi-season character arc...Now, this could be a good thing or a bad thing for you.If Lost has already lost you, you may not want to see this. For me, however, I find it refreshing when writers trust their audience with pacing that's not for ten year-olds with a sugar-high.#5 For a TV series, the tone and action in most episodes is bleaker than average. It also explored some experimental non-linear directions...Objects in Space, Out of Gas, and War Stories, in particular, come to mind.Now, here are the aspects I think could more than likely turn off the casual viewer...#1 The eccentric dialogue a.k.a. western speak, country-western influenced music, and Chinese curses may be not be ""shiny"" (great), for everyone...#2 For the Star Wars-heads, Captain Mal Reynolds, the main hero, is quite similar to Han Solo...Or maybe that's a plus?#3 It's set in a future where eastern influences can be felt everywhere and yet... Full-blooded Asians are simply used as rare, background flourishes here and there.This is dissappointing and offensive for many Asians, whose Hollywood visibility, outside of Kung-Fu flicks, isn't exactly high to begin with...And here, the justifiable chance to use them in what could have been the first fully dimensional way on TV was squandered. And on Asian-infuenced show, no less.It must be mentioned, however, that many of the main actors are of mixed ethnicities...#4 With so many characters, there are bound to be a few who don't click for you...I like Mal (a cool M.F.), Kaylee (sweet and lovable, without inducing sugar-shock), and Jayne (funny without trying too hard to be). The actors portraying them do a particularly wonderful job.I don't really care for Simon (too lame/boring), River (too crazy), or Wash (too quippy).#5 And finally, the ""sci-fi western"" genre is not new. There have been quite a few other shows that have tread a similar path like Wild Wild West, Galaxy Rangers, Cowboy BeeBop, Brisco County Jr., and yes, even Star Trek...But then again, hospital shows aren't new either and there seem to be quite a few successful ones on TV.In other words, if you're looking for something COMPLETELY different, you won't find it here.I just want to reiterate that this isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's simply an above average, high-quality, well-written, show that was cancelled before it got a fair chance.The episodes were aired on a Friday, out-of-order, with episodes pre-empted for weeks...I think Lost, for example, depending on where it's going, is a better show...And it's home network did a FAR BETTER job of promoting and nuturing it...Fox execs, do you see what happens when you actually believe in a good show?? Yup...I don't guarantee you'll like Firefly. I know a few folks who don't particularly care for it. But just rent this thing or borrow a friend's set and give it a try. It's worth a look."	4.0	A Balanced Review	2005-05-14	53	42	11

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A16619CS5SNV31	moosee19	This incredibly lush universe was so fantastic in its creation, so bold in scope, and so chock full of ambition that the producers at the network pulled the plug midway through the first season. Each episode is largely standalone, so the only thing that suffered was the overall story arc of where these wonderful characters were ultimately headed, as well as backstory from which they found their place on serenity, and why they are, say heroes of a mud planet. The overall theme of the show is about a group of super lucky thieves with hearts of various precious and unprecious metals, that always make it out alive, but almost never score the loot in the process. Super lucky to live, super unlucky to be happy and at least comfortable. Ironically,  the shows financial backing took that theme literally and stopped funding.Do yourself a favor. Watch this show. Its on Netflix. Do joss and Nathan and super lovely jewelry a favor and buy the (admittedly backwards) DVD. Show it to your friends. Show it to your neighborhood.  Tell them to buy it too.

The characters and world are rough, dirty, and dangerous.  Technology only gets the characters into trouble, not out of it (smart wits and a steady trigger finger get them out of trouble).  There is no sound in space.  If your space-ship breaks outside the solar system, you don't invent a warp drive.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1YOYEB5K3XFTU	"MovieLover ""movieloversyd"""	"It wasn't until Halloween season of last year (2012) that I first found out about ""Firefly"" (and Serenity). While working at Universal Studios, at their annual Halloween event, most of us spent our break times discussing our favorite 'scary' movies and other movies / t.v. shows. Now, I know that 'scary' is not really applicable to ""Firefly"", let alone ""Serenity"", but both the series and movie came up in conversation on more than just a couple of occasions. I had never heard of either one, let alone knew what either the series or movie were about (?). I must have kept those conversations in the back of my mind though ........Several months later the ""Firefly"" series aired on one of our cable stations, and remembering how many times this series came up during those Halloween night conversations, I decided to tape the series and check it out when I had the time. Well, that said, I was hooked right from the very first episode. This is unusual, considering that I'm not exactly what you would call an avid sci-fi fan. While I can't pinpoint the precise reason or reasons why I was hooked so quickly I can recall recognizing only one of the actors ~~ Nathan Fillion (whom I had seen in White Noise 2). While I had never heard of any of the other actors, I thought that the overall casting was a great effort. Some casts just ""gel"" while others don't; this one definitely did !!!! There's a bit of something for everyone - i.e. action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy. As for the basic plot of the series, it's certainly been rehashed in so many already posted reviews. So rather than rehash it again, I'm posting this as a newcomer to the ""Firefly"" series, as well as someone who hopes to convert more newcomers. Better late than never, I suppose ......If you like a good story, in the form of a mini-series, with the sci-fi aspect reminiscent of Star Wars ... in that it's not the type of sci-fi that is especially for the die hard sci-fi crowd, then you might want to give this series a chance. It seems the network / studio that aired the series back in 2002 didn't agree with my last statement, as the series was cancelled after only a few brief months. That said, the fans ~ known as ""Browncoats"" ~ refused to let the series just die and fade away .... much to the surprise and approval of the cast and creators, whom also thought the series had not been given a proper chance. IF I had known about ""Firefly"" back in the day I would certainly have been hooked when it originally aired. I have a feeling that a lack of knowing about this wonderful series (or perhaps a lack of publicity?) is why others probably also didn't know about it until recently. I am now a proud member of the ""Browncoat"" family and, thanks to syndication and DVDs, a happy owner of both the series and the follow-up feature film. It's a shame that so many GOOD shows die an early death due to premature cancellation, only to be upstaged by more and more idiotic reality shows. I want to thank all the ""Firefly"" fans for not letting this one get away ...."	5.0	Wish I Would Have Known About This One !!!!	2013-09-15	1	1	0

Truthfully and honestly, to all the people out there considering making this purchase, i say this:  The ONLY bad thing about this entire TV series is the fact that there is only 1 season.Now that you've got this, go out and buy the movie Serenity, the two graphic novels Better Days and Those Left Behind, the one-shot comic book Float-Out, and the fan-made film Browncoats: Redemption.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2T86KSJUEUKS9	Mr. Details	Santa brought the DVD series to my stocking and I just finished watched the Pilot episode. Truth be told, I was a fan of the show when it first aired and was very disappointed in Fox for cancelling.  A series like this takes a moment to relax into the roles and create the plot-lines which keep us coming back. (Take a look at the first episodes of Star Trek Next Generation in comparison to season 5 and beyond -- horrible.)What made this series for me was the ensemble characters (perfect save one -- I'll mention later) and the dialog.  Fresh, novel and totally without genre peer, this DVD series brings a smile to my face.  Its nice to relax with crew.For me, and this is more of an indictment of the series as a whole -- and perhaps why it took a killing blow -- I think the &quot;girl in the box&quot; was too flighty, too annoying and just hard to watch. I think this was the most crafted element of the series -- everything else felt natural. Imagine the rest of the crew going adventure to adventure without the &quot;girl in the box.&quot;  Too bad we won't see that plot line run its course.Highly recommend this series.  If you've not seen it, take a $32 gamble, you won't be disappointed.  Just wish there were more to see.	5.0	Yearning For More ...	2003-12-29	2	1	1

This is far better than some similar space dramas that have survived and thrived across multiple seasons. Had this show not had the plug pulled so quickly, it very well might have become one of the more successful examples of its genre.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	"When you consider that the majority of people who watch this series, ends up loving it, it is a wonder that it was ever canceled.  But sadly it was, and this partially completed first season is all we have to enjoy (unless you count the movie that came later on).  But at least what we do have is entertaining.Firefly is the space cowboy series originally thought up by Joss Whedon.  Following the crew of a smuggling ship (or really whatever job they can get) it shows them trying to keep away from the central government.  Which proves tough to do with their line of work and the fugitives that they are transporting as well.  Add in Reavers (crazy space raiders) and not so friendly locals and space is just not a safe place.  But it's a place that feels like home to the spaceship Serenity and her crew.Characters:Nathan Fillion - Malcolm ReynoldsGina Torres - Zoe WashburneAlan Tudyke - Hoban WashburneMorena Baccarin - Inara SerraAdam Baldwin - Jayne CobbJewel Staite - Kaylee FryeSean Maher - Simon TamSummer Glau - River TamRon Glass - Derrial BookMal Reynolds is the captain of the Firefly ship and he's a no-nonsense but fair kind of guy.  He's also got a reasonable sense of humor and he's such a great leading character that you always want to find out what he's going to do next.  His first mate Zoe and her husband (the ship's pilot) are also interesting characters.  Although I think Zoe is a little too serious at times, especially when you compare her to her jovial husband.  One of my favorite characters is Kaylee, the mechanic of the ship, because she is so sweet and down to earth.  She really provides the ""nice"" that the crew of the ship needs.  Jayne, on the other hand, is the muscle and is somewhat dumb, but funny in that dumbness.  The Tam siblings provide some interest, but when it comes to being watchable, I find them the least enjoyable, but when it comes to that series, least enjoyable is still quite good.  Inara is the only one with legitimate work, but it's very interesting and I've seen her job likened to that of a geisha, which I think is pretty accurate.  The last main character, Book, is the preacher, but he has a lot of secrets.The whole space cowboy thing could have been very cheesy, but it's not.  Because of the depth of the characters, settings of the worlds, and the way the plot works, it is wholly original.  I loved that the crew didn't like the main government but had to learn to work within the confines and restrictions of their world(s).  The sets were very realistic and not overly showy.  Even the technology seemed not out-of-this-world and realistic.  And while there was a main plot that ran through the whole series, each episode was a good stand alone and had its own adventures.  Even the bad guys were pretty scary; a government that thinks it's doing good and evil space people that have gone mad.  Gives you a shudder just thinking about it.The special effects, for this being in its first season, were pretty good.  They used a lot of the same sets so they were able to really get it detailed.  The inside of the ship was well done.  I also really liked the music in the series as well.  It followed the country theme more, although there was some ballroom music.  The main theme song was great, lyrics and everything and kind of sets up the whole tone for the series.An excellent show that should have never been canceled.  It's one that I come back to time and time again.  I honestly love everything about it and can't personally find any flaws with it.Review by M. Reynard 2013"	5.0	Firefly	2013-08-04	0	0	0

It doesn't matter how you get a hold of this series, but I urge you to watch this masterpiece.  It is enthralling, witty, imaginative, and like nothing I have ever seen.

I have no doubt it's poor ratings were due to the lousy job Fox did promoting it which is one reason I did not see the show when it originally aired.  In fact I saw Serenity first which I enjoyed far more after watching the series on DVD and becoming more familiar with the wonderful cast of characters.

A minor note is that the rendered CGI scenes are apparently still standard def, although this was not something obviously apparent to us.	5.0	Unfair review five stars	2011-01-01	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A16Q2CW3MAOFJI	"M. Robesch ""mattro"""	One of the best DVD box sets produced.  My only complaint: It says &quot;The Complete Series&quot; on the cover instead of &quot;Season One&quot;. That's right, in a better world we would all be enjoying season two of Firefly right about now. Not sure why the knuckleheads at Fox couldn't see they had the next X-Files style cult hit in their hot little hands. Fox's mishandling of this show is now legendary (you can read about it on the internet and hear about it on this set's commentary tracks). Fortunately there is no cover-up taking place... the Firefly DVD set is here and stands like a monument on the shelf of all collectors of well-written sci-fi, well written western or just plain old well-written tv drama.Firefly is a different take on the future. It confidently tosses aside most of the fantasy elements that snuck into the sci-fi genre over the years: lasers that blast things apart; audible sound in the vacuum of space; bumpy headed aliens everywhere; space as someplace cozy and safe; the notion that old style weapons will simply disappear when new weapons are developed; Utopic governments... etc. etc. and shows us what life would probably actually be like when humans begin colonizing/terra-forming other worlds.The ensemble cast gelled almost instantly and it is this creative chemistry (and the writing staff's ability to write the characters FOR the actors) that is the real treat here. Many ensemble shows (the Star Treks particularly) take 2-3 seasons before the actors get truly comfy with the proceedings. Firefly clicked from the word go. There are no wasted moments or even wasted frames in this series.Buy it and enjoy!  :)  --mattro	5.0	Could have been the next X-Files-like cult phenom	2004-02-13	13	13	0

However all of the episodes that are in this collection WERE aired on the Sci-fi channel in the UK.  I don't know if this is true in the U.S.A., but this makes the cover statement at the very least misleadind.  There is even a reference to 'Objects in Space' in the special features section as having been aired.  It's possible that they mean the DVD versions are different to the ones that were aired, but if that's so WHY DON'T THEY JUST SAY THAT!	1.0	Firefly,  a word of caution	2004-04-10	236	14	222

After buying the DVD's and watching the enitre series in about a week, this show quickly became one of my all time favourites. The characters are all excellent, seeming to gell with each other right from the begining. The storylines are expertly written with each episode containing just the right mix of humour and serious drama. Infact, over the entire series there is not one poor episode (whcih from 14 is pretty amazing). The only annoying thing is the whole thing is over far too soon (thanks FOX), but at least the fantastic theatrical movie continuation Serenity provided some closure (and I would definitely recommend you buy the DVD of that as well).	5.0	Possibly the...

There's intrigue, romance, a character for everyone to love. There is no gleam in this spaceship, it's nothing like standard sci fi fare. It's more real and more believable.

These episodes contain top notch visuals, witty dialog, and excellent world building.

Given all the technology to get around, they only visit terraformed planets and things are still pretty primative on all the Earth-like planets. THERE ARE NO ALIENS (except reavers, but they are still ""human"")!  The series has well defined characters and for the most part very believeable. The oppotunity to watch them in order makes a a big difference, as there are often hints to situations that happened in previous episodes.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3V9QQMNQFUCNV	"M-Taliesin ""M-Taliesin"""	I was immensely pleased and overwhelmingly entertained by this marvelous television series that I had bought on DVD. FIREFLY, which aired on Fox, was not familiar to me as I had missed it when televised about a year ago. Ah, but when I started watching the DVD series, I was well rewarded with a purely pleasurable experience.The show was remarkably brilliant, with great humor throughout the series, and interesting new concepts included in this scifi space opera. Imagine a western set in space and one gets images of dusty frontier towns, low slung shooting irons, horses and saloon brawls, along with space ships and EVA suits, and that is just what Firefly delivers. It seemed to me like the story of Jesse James set 500 years in the future where the outlaws ride spaceships as well as horses, and space suits as well as dusters!The cast is excellent, headed up by Nathan Fillion as Capt. Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds. The ensemble cast includes Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin (who is amazingly beautiful), Jewel Staite, Adam Baldwin (primary source of comic relief) Sean Maher, Summer Glau, and Ron Glass.And as avidly as I rave about the Firefly series, I think it is simply terrible!It is terrible that Fox dropped this excellent series, which was a breath of fresh air to those weary of lawyer shows, reality programs, cop shows and medical dramas! Firefly was new, inventive and clever. It was also cancelled, and what a travesty!It is simply terrible that such an excellent program is no longer available to legions of fans who first realized its greatness, and the many who came afterward, long after network execs had made the blunder of dumping this show.It would be simply terrible if somebody else, like the SciFi channel perhaps, doesn't pick this up and run with it.I really hope they will come up with a feature length film, and kick-start renewed interest in this show, and that it will again find a network with sufficient dedication to artistic expression to run with this project.All in all, I give the thing 5 stars, as one of the most entertaining series I have ever seen in my life! And I think it is simply terrible that I cannot give it 10 stars! Well done, Crew!	5.0	Simply Terrible!	2003-12-10	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3OW3ZSCG8JZ6Z	mtlimber	"I remember skipping past this show once or twice when it was on the air, but now I'm sorry I didn't give it a chance. A friend loaned me the DVDs, and my wife and I delighted in them. There was humor, action, grit, character development, and so much potential.I think what most appealed to me was the diversity of viewpoints represented on the ship. For instance, Shepherd Book represented a Christian voice who was set among his ""den of thieves"" composed literal thieves as well as a respected, professional prostitute, a captain who had lost his faith after feeling abandoned by God, and a skeptical but fragile genius in River. The Shepherd had a complex past, and the tension was set for some meaningful spiritual conversation which appeared only in bits before the show was cancelled.I liked the fact that they were not guiding diplomats through negotiations or fighting for the Federation (as in Star Trek Next Gen). Rather, their concerns are very mundane (e.g., where can they find a job and get paid), and they float as ""losers"" on the out-skirts of the territory of the space Alliance (which seems more bureaucratic than innately evil, unlike, say, the Empire from Star Wars). I also like the fact that they use ""futuristic"" curse words (""gorram"" and ""ruttin'"") as well as Chinese expletives instead of the standard and hackneyed English vernacular.One reviewer complained of the sex in the show. I agree that there is some gratuitous sex to be found, but since the show is on DVD, a remote can be employed to get past that. As for the alleged ""nudity"", the only examples I recall are in the pilot episode where the prostitute's bare back is shown (again, the remote can skip it) and in the episode where the captain appears naked from the back, including his buttocks. The latter is used purely for comic effect and is not sexual in nature.In short, the show had more depth and well-roundedness than any sci-fi production that I have seen, and I've seen quite a few.  Don't hesitate to rent it, and after that, consider buying it if you're into collecting DVDs."	5.0	I'm sorry I missed it	2006-01-05	8	8	0

My love for the captain, born out of staring at my captain action figure, soon dissapated as I realised that this really was just a space western, only with worse special effects than an arcade game circa 1985. bip bip bip, oh no captain, the reevers are coming, at worst they will bum us, eat our flesh and tear our very eyes from the sockets, before grinding us up for their bovril, and if you're very lucky, they'll do it in that order.Dont worry though, because the simpering female mechanic with the bad teeth, despite having a bullet hole in her abdomen, will instruct the preacher to put Serenity on full darn throttle and blast those pesky reevers into space route 66.Well, perhaps I had expected way too much. My Stupid nerdy friends told me it rocked, and the guys were hot, and it was like star wars, but, without the force.No force, but certainly farce, as this bumbling crew of bad actors and tinny special effects, throw in a few horses, a bad tempered captain (who, incidently, despite sometimes bending the rules, always gets results) and a ship whore, who, for some reason, doesnt whore once despite getting my hopes up. (how DOES she pay the captain for the rent on her ship bordello if she has no johns.....? hmmmmmmm me wonders....ay ay captain honk honk)I hated it, don't buy it, unless of course you like being slowly bored to frikkin death, sandwiched between a bunch of people who wouldnt know hair serum if it jumped up and whacked them around the head.No force, no fun, I'm going home to play with my Red Dwarf action figures and rest my coffee on the Firefly DVD which is now a pretty expensive coaster.fin	1.0	The Force Was Certainly NOT with me	2005-10-11	351	39	312
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1UG0YH7CALVR5	"Mugwomp McGillicuddy ""rarrarjinx"""	"Where to start... Borrowing this set from a friend, I was skeptical, I had seen a trailer for Serenity, which looked like a bad, low budget Sci-Fi channel made for TV movie. Reading more about Serenity - it looks like it is just a push for DVD sales, though I believe they saved tons of money by using tv budget effects and actors.Easily the worst part of the show is the dialogue. Or wait, is it the actors? Or the mind numbing canned music? Or the painful intro song? Hard to choose. I'll say the dialogue since the last thing we need is a boring buffy western sci fi drenched in wittiness. Yes, everybody is very witty in this crew. You'll be up to your ears in wit, one-liners and creative sci-fi, techie speak. It was embarassing to watch. There was even an attempt at a western bar fight. So painful I had to skip to the next chapter. Even more lame were the ""bad guys"". Ouch.Then you're left with mediocre sci-fi, uninteresting characters and the most boring leading man in television history. One plus, a companion on the ship is one of the loveliest women you will ever see. Almost worth watching just for her.Most if not all of the plots will be familiar to any watcher of the A-Team, Sliders, Stargate SG-1, The Lost World, Lost in Space, etc."	1.0	So bad its funny!	2005-07-20	393	43	350
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2AKUNT7P3IJ6B	mule214	"I've been looking to upgrade from the standard def version for a while, and the time was right when Amazon offered it for 26.99. I'm happy to report that the blu-ray comes with all the special features that the standard def version had. In addition there are 2 new special features included on the blu-ray version. The first is a dinner discussion with Joss Whedon, Alan Tudyk, Nathan Fillion, and Ron Glass. They discuss some of their favorite Firefly moments and share some behind the scenes stories. They also provide a new commentary on the episode ""Our Mrs Reynolds"". My recommendation is to watch the dinner discussion first as the cast references it several times during the commentary. The blu-ray version also saves space over the standard def version as the entire series is condensed into 3 discs.I hope this information has helped anyone who is trying to decide whether an upgrade is appropriate. Do yourself a favor and buy the blu-ray, then make someone's day and give them the standard version."	5.0	Blu-ray Browncoats	2010-10-18	9	9	0

The first dvd arrived, and I watched the pilot episode...and I felt like I had nine new friends. The cast, the writing, the whole concept is just so unique and so amazingly good.How can a  Sci-Fi, Western, Comedy, Morality Tale Space show possibly work? Because of a very dedicated man and his crew of equally dedicated actors, directors, writers, set designers, etc. who all were able to see Joss Whedon's vision of this here 'Verse. After renting the first 3 dvds in the set, I knew I had to own it. I also knew that I would be morally obliged to convert as many friends and family to it as possible.I simply can't tell you how much I love this show. Since discovering it, I have been thinking about it constantly. Where will Captain Tightpants and his crew take us next? I don't know.

It has an insane amount of film-grain effect added to it. I am sure they thought it made it look grittier, but c'mon! This extra noise makes the compression look poor (because image noise kills compression algorithms.) Using an Oppo player on the original DVD's gives me a better viewing experience and only a bit less detail. If you want to squeeze every bit of detail out of the image, get them; if not, stick to the DVD set and use a good DVD player with HD scaler (like the amazing Oppo!)	2.0	Noisy as heck!!	2008-12-10	30	9	21

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1CKI55R3KMWT2	"myfieldnotes ""CathyL6"""	"This series is great. The characterization is very detailed and the relationships between each of them has real depth. Not unlike the series Farscape, these characters don't all start out liking eachother, but over time a sense of loyalty and friendship does grow until they're like a family. Plotwise-there are frequently moments where you think you know where the story is going, you know the good old tried and true Sci Fi storylines only to have them surprisingly hang an unexpected right hand turn down a different pathway. Firefly is also filled with great dialogue, classic Joss Whedon wit. Not to mention the DVD's are packed with extras.Favorite episodes? There are so many it's too hard to pick.  Out of Gas is amazingly well written--The Captain, Mal, is shot and he flashes back to his first meeting with many of the crew as he tries to save the ship. Safe and Ariel is where we see some of why Simon is so loyal to his sister, River, who was tortured by the cruel Alliance and what desperate lengths he will go to in order to protect her. Objects in Space, is where a mercenary hunts the crew, spouting humorous non-stop observations about them as he goes.  Shindig, is where Mal hints that he has feelings for Inara and challenges another man to a duel over her. Jaynestown--turns out there's a whole town that sings Jayne's praises...er...literally. War Stories, where Wash (Serenity's pilot) decides there's no time like the present to give Mal a piece of his mind course ""the present"" happens to be while they're being held prisoner by a ruthless interrogator. Then again there's always the 2 hour pilot, Serenity, where you first meet the characters and realize that not everyone is as they seem and that once you're apart of Mal's crew you're a member of his family.If you liked Farscape, Stargate, or Buffy with their sense of continuity, banter, and wonderful friendships you'll love this series.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AODRG73ABEIQP	"""myorangehat"""	I bought Firefly for myself recently because the box looked pretty and I remembered catching maybe 5 minutes of it while it was on TV.  Boy, am I glad I picked up that 'pretty box.'The reason Firefly is so good is good storytelling.  Now, that may sound like a simple enough thing to have, but few TV shows in recent memory can claim to tell their story well.Picture it like this, Firefly is what a show like X-Files could have been if X-Files' 'startling plot revelations' were actually going somewhere.  I DID like X-Files, it just went nowhere fast, which is something Firefly can never be accused of.  If there is a startling revelation on Firefly is actually does mean something and isn't just included to be shocking.  As a viewer I appreciate that.Firefly is well crafted with wonderfully deep characters you will care about, and a plot that has a definite direction but is NEVER predictable.  And THAT is the reason I love Firefly and eagerly share it with my friends and family. ^_^	5.0	Firefly is quality storytelling, and that's why it's good	2004-04-30	3	3	0

The quality of this tv series is truly amazing...The pilot episode leaves you hooked and the last episode makes you cry in utter anguish as to how this series ever got cancelled. Why oh why you'll ask...and would be perfectly justified in doing so...unfortunately we'll never know. It's a little bit of Star Wars, umm without the jedi, and a little bit of Cowboy Bebop, without Ein..unless Joss Whedon planned a lovable furry creature to join the crew eventually...And a whole lot of western, complete with brothels and of course all that goes with it. It is truly sad that it ended before it was allowed to play out a bit..I have only one thing to say..Does that seem right to you?

The show has been cancelled for years now, but after watching it-I'm left wondering why? Why would Fox be so stupid as to cancel such a well written, beautifully acted amazing show? Because Fox has idiots at the helm, that's why. Joss Whedon is a master story teller, I couldn't stop watching all the shows, and cried at the end of the movie sequel, Serenity. If you've seen it, you know why. As my husband said, it was like finishing a great book, but you're sad because there are no more adventures for your beloved characters to go on. These charactors and the writing had real staying power-Fox, you blew it royally. You had the makings of a phenomenon in your hands, but you let some stupid suit cancel it. I hope those decision makers got fired. Firefly has a rabid following of fans who would love to see it back on the air-extend the olive branch to Joss Whedon, and come to your senses!(Sorry for the rant to Fox, I know this is supposed to be just a review-and as a review-I LOVED IT!!!)	5.0	Firefly was the best!	2009-02-05	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IRRGVLARSV63	"Natasha S. Stephenson ""Selkie2283"""	I missed Firefly when it originally aired on Fox, and only gave it a try because it was Joss Whedon, and I was out of things to rent on Netflix. I was in love from the pilot episode on. This is science fiction for the rest of us: those sick of action driven, control-fantasy, politically-cliche SF. Firefly is character-drive science fiction. It is witty, and clever, and if you think the storylines are lacking, you're clearly missing the underlying character development.To Pancake Repairman, do some research into the history of 19th century (and earlier) courtesans. You will find that the notion of a specialized class of elite prositutes is neither confrontational, nor ridiculously juvenile, but historically grounded and viable. I'll also point out that the only people treating Inara with much respect are her customers: both Mal's and Shepard Book's interactions with her suggest that her profession is controversial and clearly not accepted by everyone. To C. Chow, who suggested the Inara's role was clearly only for sex appeal, and that she served no other purpose, I can wonder if you watched the series through. There is clearly a deeper, important storyline between she and Mal, each expanding the other's storyline in a specific way. If Inara seems unimportant, it was only because the series was cancelled before Joss had time to develop her story at a liesurely, natural pace. Each character on this show is designed to play up and play off some characteristic of another.This is space opera; this is character drama. If you're looking for another humanoid-alien-culture-of-the-week-in-need-of-human-aid series, flip back over to the Sci-Fi Channel. If you want something different, something fresh, and you dig romanticized action-adventure, rent/buy this DVD and be in awe!Firefly's value has nothing to do with Dark Angel, or its cancellation. No point posting negative reviews because of it. Obviously, good shows get cancelled all the time. Blame the network, not the other victims.	5.0	Science Fiction for the rest of us!	2005-07-31	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AAD3V7FQUXO2Z	Nathan Alderman	"If you're not a science fiction fan, you may be looking at the endless string of rapturous reviews for ""Firefly"" and rolling your eyes. While ""Firefly"" certainly doesn't lack in geek appeal, its sharp writing, excellent cast and often-striking visual style elevate it into the ranks of Just Plain Great Television. After a somewhat bumpy start, this series found its groove with remarkable speed, and began cranking out hour after hour of compelling drama as if it had been on the air for years.The Fox network employed a novel strategy to introduce Firefly to audiences in the fall of 2002-- sidelining its brilliant two-hour premiere in favor of a dumbed-down and hastily-written successor, airing the series out of order (with all its least compelling episodes up front), and frequently pre-empting the show in favor of the world series. Fox then proceeded to throw up its hands in feigned amazement when the series tanked in the ratings. While fans of writer/producer/creator Joss Whedon do tend toward fanaticism, in this case it's more a testament to the quality and intelligence of ""Firefly"" that the series has enjoyed eye-popping pre-orders on DVD and new life as a feature film.Standout episodes include ""Serenity,"" the series' haunting, dryly funny pilot; ""Our Mrs. Reynolds,"" a sly mix of screwball comedy and crime caper; and ""Objects In Space,"" a nail-biting, beautifully shot game of cat and mouse between the series' most mysterious heroine and one of the more memorably whacked-out villains in recent TV memory."	4.0	Top-notch television, grounded before its time.	2003-10-14	11	10	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A250AXLRBVYKB4	"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at..."	It's always ironic when the very values of a television show highlight some of the worst aspects of the shows own network, in this case FOX. Deciding to cancel this excellent, imaginative, well acted, intelligent, and decidedly awesome series smacks of the worst sort of incompetence at best, and heavy-handed draconian intolerance that The Alliance themselves would be proud of.What sets this show apart from virtually everything else currently on television is it's ability to create a powerful nostalgia for a time when living--and sometimes dying--free was an attainable reality. A sci-fi drama that aptly captures that quintessential Americanism: 'Give me liberty or give me death.'However, the show is not just a vehicle for advancing a political stance. It's epically entertaining. Even the movie that finalizes what the show's abrupt cancellation never allowed to develop, is lesser than the episodes that make up the first and last season of Serenity. Nathan Fillion is perfectly cast as the Serenity's captain, and gives the show the gravitas that only talented actor can.This one goes down in the record books as one of the stupidest cancellations in the history of TV. Very sad indeed, but as many others have said in their own reviews, 'The can't take the sky from me.'	5.0	The Alliance (FOX) can pry this one from my cold, dead hands	2009-04-11	4	3	1

I watched the movie first and honestly didn't know anything about Firefly other than I would occasionally here about Janes Hat or someone being a Brown Coat. Not that I had a clue what it was all about.After the movie I decided I had to see what the series was about and I have to say that it is really saying something when I sit in front of the TV, as I'm notoriously picky and more to the point, busy - I might manage about 4 hours of television a month if I'm lucky. That said, I sat down over the course of a week and watched all of these, and feel that this is possibly one of the best series that was ever on television and I can't possibly understand why they would cancel it.Serious oversight on someones part and hopefully they lost their job over that decision!It's a good series, my wife and kids liked it, safe for the family, plenty of humor and action and it was killed way before its time.Buy it, get it, love it.	5.0	Firefly - damn good!	2008-02-08	0	0	0

To say he was &quot;right&quot; would be something of an understatement.I recently finished a two day &quot;Firefly&quot; marathon, it was my first time watching the series at all, and I am hooked. It is a sci-fi western, which is an ungodly cool combination.The show has some of the best written characters on T.V. and thats only after some 13 odd episodes. I don't know the Simpsons as well as I know Wash or Zoe or Jayne and I've been watching that family since I was a small child. Each episode is different with something new to offer to the table, each memorable in every aspect.It really hit the ground running, sprinting even.

Like another short lived sci-fi series that had tons of potential, Space: Above and Beyond, Firefly was cut down before it's time.  I'd just about given up on televised sci-fi.  Trek had gone down the tubes, Babylon 5 had ended, and the rest of the Sci-fi TV landscape was filled with absolute dreck.  Then along comes this wonderful series that had style, humor, intellegence, and made me believe in it's setting.  Of course, it was completely mishandled by it's network, but thank goodness for DVD.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3UQWM5V3BCGSK	Nathan Road	"This is really a special show.  It's a grave travesty why Firefly would not get a second season while garbage like The Bachelor/Bachelorette would be in its 23rd season.Firefly is not cerebral techno-babble science fiction.  There are no razzle-dazzle laser battles, alien civilizations or vessels zapping away at warp speed.  But that's OK.  There's no reason why all TV and film depictions of space-faring humans should be a Star Trek wannabe.  Firefly has it's own defiant brand of originality.My only complaint about the series is, both pilot episodes (the actual pilot ""Serenity"" and the intended pilot ""The Train Job"") were the worst of the series.  The show didn't start off with a big bang, which may be one reason why it failed to gain a critical mass of TV audience in 2002.Still, after finishing the 14 episodes and Serenity, you'll probably be in mourning, scouring the internet to find any morsel of recent news on whether Firefly will return.I'm consoled in the fact that Firefly/Serenity still has a large dedicated fan base seven years after the show left the airwaves.  As of today, the Serenity Facebook page has almost 400,000 members.  And the number grows as a new generation of Browncoats discovers the series on DVD or Blu-ray.I highly doubt we'd ever see Firefly again.  Our only hope would be, somewhere in the future, someone does a ""reimagined"" version of the series, similar to what they did with V and Battlestar Galactica.Speaking of which, Battlestar Galactica (Syfy version) is still my favorite show, but Firefly has a bit more heart.  Firefly is like a once-in-a-lifetime love affair that ended too soon.Thank you Firefly for the short time you were with us."	5.0	Thank you Firefly for the short time you were with us	2011-05-28	2	1	1

I could kick myself for that. Like alot of people I was very confused about what it was. Due to the awful way FOX treated it. Now that I have seen the show in the way it was intended I am amazed. I have never seen a show this briliant and thoughtfully executed. It is awsome. The writting is Josh Weadon and his crew's finest work, the look of the show is very original, and some of the images alone from this show are masterpieces in their own right.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2CFU983NRZHEL	N. Clarke	Firefly was cancelled before it even made it to the UK, which made the experience of watching it this summer (and again, now, on DVD) all the more poignant... and frustrating. While I won't go the 'reasons' behind the cancellation here, it seems clear to me that it was wholly unjustified; to anyone with any discernment, it's clear this show simply gets better with every viewing and every episode.The cast is a joy; from captain of the ship Mal to endearingly crazy psychic River, every actor hits the note for their character time after time. Coupled with the great writing we've come to expect from Mutant Enemy, what we get is arguably the most perfect, and perfectly characterised, ensemble cast yet in a Whedon show. Sparky, believable dialogue (especially between Mal and Inara, but frankly every line sounds utterly natural - and often laugh-out-loud funny). Unforced character conflict (Jayne, for example, is a belligerent git, and as such a vital element of ongoing tension). Above all, a gradual, natural development of the ensemble's dynamic.The look and sound of the show is similarly lavish in detail and feel. The costumes are simultaneously eye-catching and 'lived-in'. The sets are a brilliant meld of Western and SF, all dusty canyons and technology that is functional and *used*, as opposed to _Trek_'s ultra-sleek waiting-room ambience. The dialogue and incidental music both add to the hybrid atmosphere, with their own dialect of Madarin and archaism.Overall, this is about the boundaries between genres being shaded in a quite ingenious manner - and it is mirrored in the genuinely hazy morality of the characters and their world.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Combining classic sci-fi elements with a touch of the western, Joss Whedon's Firefly was a sadly short lived show which Fox had the brilliant idea of cancelling before the season was even over.  Firefly's story revolves around the crew of the Serenity five hundred years into the future as they partake different mercenary jobs while on the run from the Alliance and other deadly forces.  Just like Whedon's other hit shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Firefly contained plenty of smarts and humor but also managed to keep the viewer riveted from beginning to end.  Rumor has it that Whedon is busy at making a Firefly film, which will be a must see for the show's surprising amount of dedicated followers.

Alot of small subplots are left dangling as the show was cancelled after just 14 episodes (actually less, but the set includes a few unaired episodes as well), but the new movie is the awesome series finale the show never got.

And I really wished that myself and many more made more of an impact on the ratings because this was, and IS still a great piece of television.I have really become a ""fanboy"" of Joss Whedon's work, kinda following the shows upward, though also joining them far too late to be able to grasp the storyline. But, I'm thankful for friends who happen to have like all of Angel and Buffy combined on DVD, and now have the Firefly series to let me get the whole picture.I had seen a few episodes randomly on SciFi, and now I have seen them all on DVD and already have the set on order. Serenity has also joined my rather small DVD collection of about 10 total DVD's, mostly a couple box sets of TV shows that I have loved and lost, lol.Anyway, if you like anything that Joss has done, you'll love this. You'll also notice many familiar faces from that of Buffy and Angel episodes which is kind of uplifting as most of them had minor parts in those series and really get to shine as the brightest stars in the verse in Firefly/Serenity."	5.0	Genius slips through the cracks again.	2005-12-27	8	8	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WHX322W258G3	"New Firefly Fan ""Cindy"""	When the series first aired, I watched one show and quit. By the time I was ready to give it another try, it was canceled. What a mistake that was. But not as big a mistake as Fox's idiotic decision to skip the pilot episode(s), Serenity, which introduced the characters and made you really care for them. That lack of insight played a big role in dooming the series to failure.The Fox execs should have stayed out of the way, and let Whedon tell his story the way he wanted to, in the order that he wanted to.I wish I had discovered it earlier in its proper context, because it's one of the best science-fiction series I've ever seen.	5.0	5 Stars is NOT enough!!	2005-12-24	8	6	2

In my defense it was on a bad night and I never got off work in time to see it. A friend told me it was awesome and I should set my VCR to record it but it was cancelled that week.A few months ago a friend showed me a preview of ""Serenity"", a feature length movie that will be released later this year based on the TV show with all the original cast back, that he had downloaded and he then loaned me his DVD set so I wouldn't be lost when we went to see the movie.Wow. I was blown away. The precept was awesome, the characters were brilliant, the special effects innovative and beautiful, and the cast was brilliant (they worked extremely well together and had unreal chemistry).The story is about an ex-rebel and his friend from the war who own and operate a spaceship called Serenity. The rest of the crew is a varied set of drifters, refugees, and searchers. The show has a feel that is a combination old west and Sci-Fi. It sounds strange but it works beautifully.There are three episodes included in the set that were never aired and the commentaries and other bonus material is great. After watching my friend's copy I ran out the next day and bought my own copy, mostly because I loved the show but also to show my support in the form of money to the new movie and the possibility of reviving the series.There is hope. The DVD sales have been massive and massive DVD sales caused the pinheads at Fox to realize what they had had with ""Family Guy"", maybe the same thing will happen here. Also, we have a feature film to look forward to and if it does well this might be a further push for fox to resurrect the series."	5.0	Wow, Simply Wow	2005-07-11	9	9	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3NX64C5IAPKUF	"Nick Mnemonic ""Nick"""	Firefly: how absolutely amazing.  This is one of my most favorite TV shows.  I never caught it while it was (sporadically) on the air, but I got the DVD set based on a friends recommendation.  And loved it.  I, of course, had to upgrade to Blu-Ray as soon as it was available.  This may be the most recommended TV show I make to people.  Everything about this show was golden.  The stories, the characters, the settings, everything.  It&#8217;s the type of show that has something for everyone.  I&#8217;ve literally never heard anyone who&#8217;s seen this series say anything negative about it, and that goes for men or women.  Which makes it one of those shows that you can plan to watch with your wife/girlfriend without getting in trouble!  The concept is like an old-west show, but based in outer-space, and with intricate character relationships.  Sounds kind of weird when I say it out load, but it works better than you can imagine.  Just be prepared that if you watch this you will forever be left with the pain that (with exception to the movie &#8220;Serenity&#8221;) there will most likely never be more.  That is probably the worst thing about this show: the fact that there isn&#8217;t more&#8230;	5.0	The best TV series you've probably missed.	2014-06-30	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A122D0CRDH13JM	N Lane	As stated over and over we had just a glimpse of what Firefly could have become. There was hardly any advertising and no nuturing by the Fox network to better the number of viewers. On top of that the introductory episodes were not shown until the &quot;end&quot; of the season. It's disheartening to see a good show go by the wayside. Even worse, it happened when the series was really coming together. This DVD collection changes all this by letting folks notice, for the first time or once again, the true originality of Firefly. The story- a seemingly ridiculous mixture of sci-fi and western genres worked well. There were a few bumps here and there but overall the episodes flowed nicely. The casting was different and inspired. Each actor portrayed depth and a reason for being part of the crew. Wisely, a since of mystery surrounded each character making them that much more interesting. The sets were not antiseptic (typical of most space operas) but lived in and dingy. The changes in locale from space to western countryside were seemless.This collection is fullfilling to watch. I hope that someday to see the rebirth of Firefly that is said to be in the works.

Then a co-worker lent me his DVD set of the series and I started watching the episodes during my lunch breaks.  After viewing his DVD set at least six times in full, I reluctantly gave it back to him and purchased one for myself via Amazon.Amazon's price was very fair, as I was able to take advantage of a 60% discount special, but I honestly would have paid the original price for this DVD set as the series is absolutely great.  If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it in it's entirety at least once before you judge.  Captain Malcom Reynolds doesn't appeal to everyone right away; he comes off at first as rather smarmy and arrogant.  After you've become a fan of the series you realize that his smarmy and arrogant nature is both necessary and integral to the core of his character.  He's not nearly as superficial as he seems at first.What can I possibly say about this series that hasn't all ready been said?  It is nearly perfect, and certainly Joss Whedon's masterpiece (sorry, Buffy fans, I prefer this series to that one).Buy the set and give it the chance it's due - you won't regret this purchase.	5.0	Shiny....	2009-02-22	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A9OK3J3P0W6NB	"Norris ""Daniel"""	This isn't a Firefly review, it's a review of the blu-ray release, with me wandering off subject now and then. Firefly is a 5 star show canceled before it's time. One of my favorite television series of all time. The purpose of this review is to let fans of the show know if the blu-ray release is worth picking up or not.I was lucky enough to catch Firefly when it debuted on television. It was just after a cross-country move from Florida to Colorado. I rushed to get cable hooked up in my new apartment so I could watch the first episode on its broadcast premiere. As the first commercial break began, I realized I was hooked, not since 'Babylon 5' had I felt so enthralled by a television show. Sadly, we all know my enjoyment was short with only 11 of 14 episode airing before cancellation, not to mention Fox doing it's regular thing of interfering and having the broadcast order changed. Anyway, it's a sad tale, but it's well in the past now. I must admit to owning 3 versions of Serenity including the Blu-ray.Before I get into the Blu, I'm going to give you a brief rundown of the theater system I use in my bedroom, where I am watching this blu-ray set. My television is a Sharp Aquos LC42D85U 42-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV. Blu-ray player is a Hewlett Packard HDX 18t running Cyberlink PowerDVD9(phenomenal fully high definition laptop). The center of my sound system is a Onkyo TX-SR706 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver, sporting a Klipsch Quintet SL Home Theater System, and a Klipsch Synergy SUB-10 Subwoofer for deep rumbling bass. I have a decent system, excellent picture and sound.Firefly Complete Series [Blu-ray]The series is packaged in a single case, only consisting of three discs, so if you're at the store looking for a box set like I was, you'll be looking for a while. It looks like a single disc release, yet there are three blu discs inside as well as a small fold out episode listing. I didnt say episode guide, since it is'nt, its just a listing.I've watched the sd-DVD release I own more than I care to admit. I honestly love this show; from the characters, to the ideas presented, and the CG. My first impression once I began watching the blu was just how clean, vivid, and crisp the picture was. This is a huge upgrade in picture quality over the standard definition DVDs. Those once forbidden, dark spaces which light seemed to not be able to penetrate, and which caused you to turn off every light source for 3 rooms, have been transformed. NOw there is a luxurious depth and texture to those dark spaces. No longer just black, now they are living shadow, now they breath as you watch, and ebb with the soundtrack. the overall picture is much brighter, much more vivid and rich of color. I saw much more than I ever have, and as I stated above, a bit more than I care to admit. Now I wouldnt be honest with you if I said the picture was flawless. There are artifacts in oblique areas of CG, and some occasional graininess during certain sequences. I'm not talking about the induced artifacts, or blurs that Whedon likes to employ. I'm just talking about some minor imperfections that no fan will mind, and only the sharpest eye will lock onto. Any scene with a CG 'Full Burn' is worth the price of admission.Now as good as the high def transfer is on this blu-ray release, the audio is what really shines when comparing the two releases. The DTS-HD Master 5.1 Audio track is phenomenal, earth-shattering on my a/v system; two big thumbs up! A huge upgrade over the original releases Dolby Surround soundtrack. Jaynestown was really, and I mean really fun with this new audio. Honestly, I heard things I had'nt heard before. Not so much dialogue, more inflection. I came to several new conclusions about what I thought before. The action sequences are really fun as well, the audio really comes alive, bringing you right into the action, all that is missing from the experience is smell-o-vision.The bottum line for this fan:For me, this is a huge upgrade over the original DVD release. The picture quality is vastly improved, and the audio is on a whole new level. If you're a fan like me, you can not go wrong by adding this release to your library, especially if you have a good home theater system.

An amazing cast, writing that is overflowing with wit, character development and excellent plot twists, and a simple idea that strong storylines are better than flashy action.  There's chemistry among the crew members with tangible tension. there's a great sense of humor and laugh-out-loud moments.  The only negative about the show is the fact that FOX in their infinite wisdom pulled the plug on it just as it was stretching its legs.The movie will serve another way to whet the appetite, but this show needs to continue.The only real comparison i can find for this show is the stellar Cowboy Bebop which was originally a japanese anime series of a similar space cowboy theme.Buy this DVD series and the Serenity movie and show Fox and Universal that people want more!!!!"	5.0	easily the one of the best tv shows in the last 10 years	2006-03-30	12	12	0

My first thought was Great Another Star Trek. I couldn't have been farther from the truth.  This series (in my opinion of course) is more entertaining than Star Trek.Firefly is funny,dark, clever, artistic, great characters, and unusual ideas of the future.  I loved it so much that I was extremely disappointed that Fox cancelled this show, and yet excited to hear they are making a movie.Rarely do you see unique TV shows in the days of reality TV, and I find it sickening that FOX probably replaced this one with another mindless show that is far from reality.I highly recommend.	5.0	Great Series Can't Understand Fox Cancelling It	2004-10-23	7	7	0

At least they saw the light and brought Family Guy back, maybe they should give Firefly another shot. On the other hand I think Whedon should stick it to them by make a few more movies.

I enjoyed the first episode I saw and continued watching and then suddenly I realized that I was head over heals in love with this show!  And then Fox in their infinite wisdom decided to cancel it...  Firefly is wonderfully written, the stories are exciting and smart and you care deeply about the characters.  I can't recommend this show highly enough.  I will always be grateful for having found this wonderful show, even though I will always be sad that it was pulled off the air *way* too early.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1GJ175X2NMIE0	"Oliasdoug ""Progressive Rock/Electronic New Ag..."	"OK, here's how it all started for me. About a month ago in the Kansas City Star, I read a review of this interesting-looking movie I'd seen previews to called SERENITY. (""How cool to see a sci-fi movie with a title named after our ultimate goal in my N.A. group,"" I thought.) The guy reviewing the movie is GUSHING over it, admitting out loud it's hard for him to give a completely unbiased review of the movie, since he's a die-hard fan of the TV series it was based on. Up to this point, I'd only heard the title ""Firefly"" bandied about on occasion...seeing it in TV Guide, hearing the occasional reference to it in my chat room, etc. About the only TV I watch on a regular basis are the classic series that are found on both HBO and FX--the other channels held little if any interest for me. So, after reading the KC Star reviewer ranting about the Firefly series, implying it was the sci-fi equivalent of the Second Coming of Christ, I thought I'd put it on my Netflix list and check it out. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's as good as STAR TREK and STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, I'll be impressed.God, was I ever impressed.The TV series box set all arrived in the space of one week, and I ended up watching them all in the space of 4 days. I couldn't put one disc in and just watch one episode...I was fished in like a spawning trout and had to watch the entire thing, start to finish. Hooked, hooked, HOOKED. I loved everything about this show from the get-go. The cast: It was cool to see the familiar faces of Ron Glass and Adam Baldwin, but even cooler to get acquainted with the others who were unfamiliar to me. 9 very, very gifted actors who, for all intents & purposes, appeared BORN to play these roles. I could rant about them all individually, but I'd be sitting here for another hour. You get the message. The acting: Matter of opinion here, but I think they pulled it off effortlessly. They BECAME their characters in the fashion of true method actors. When actors make their jobs look completely natural and effortless, they are achieving their goals magna cum laude. The stories: They pull you in immediately, the same way Stephen King and others like him pull you in right from the first few pages instead of taking forever with plot set-up and character study. Some of the more cynical among us would argue that the stories got a bit corny on occasion. To that I would argue, hey, even the best sci-fi TV shows and movies would occasionally tread into that territory (I have yet to forgive the NEXT GENERATION series for coming up with the episode where Data tried to become a stand-up comedian with the help of Joe Piscopo...or in the original STAR TREK where they took on the group of outer-space ""hippies""...) Sometimes corniness can be the right kind of comic relief at the right time within a story; whether it works or not is subject to anyone's opinion. Personally, I don't think they ever crossed the line where that was concerned. The humor in the stories was a godsend, and the vast majority of the time, very well-done and thought out...and as I stated in my review of the movie, it was even more pronounced throughout the movie.I could go on about other nuances of the series that grabbed me or tell you about my favorite episodes, but after 1835 previous reviews of this series, you've gotten the message. Allow me to share this with you, though: After spending 4 days last week watching the series non-stop on DVD, I was chomping at the bit to go see the movie. I checked the newspapers to see if it was still showing anywhere here, since it had been playing for about a month at the time. Thankfully, it was still showing at ONE THEATRE quite a distance from where I live, and it goes without saying that it was worth the time, distance & $$ to get to see a truly fantastic movie. (Thank YOU, Joss.) It was the 7:30 showing that evening, and just imagine my surprise when I walked into the theatre to find it nearly PACKED. I thought I'd actually walked into the Friday night premiere of JARHEAD or something. Walked up to the top row, found a seat and asked the girl next to me if this was the theatre for SERENITY, & she said it was. No way in hell was I expecting to see that many people in the theatre that night, considering the movie was on its last run before (hopefully) hitting the dollar houses. Hard to describe the feeling that went through me as the lights went down and the movie started up...""corny"" as this might sound to some, there was a real feeling of camaraderie, of family...like I was part of a large group of like-minded people of greater-than-average intelligence who know quality when they see it. I'm sure I don't have to tell any of you by now what a rush the movie was, or how it's one of the few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would pay to see again.As has been stated by other reviewers, we can hope that the suits at Fox have learned a lesson by pulling the plug on a series that deserved to survive. (Can't help wondering if the FX network might learn a similar lesson now that I've heard that OVER THERE has been cancelled...) I'd like to believe that this series will be remembered for ages to come for its quality, its humor, its depth, its humanity. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and I feel blessed to be a part of the Firefly/Serenity community."	5.0	This series deserves 10 STARS (gorram it)...	2005-11-06	27	25	2

I am in this group for the same reason as most: TV shows are formulaic to the extreme, bland, and generally lacking of what makes real life real.  It's just this ""realness"" that Firefly manages to capture.  The ""not every decision is black and white"" kind of thing.  The ""hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys"" kind of thing.  The characters that you can identify with because they remind you of your best friend or whatever.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3PJ9VE79VJ1AV	"Oscar 1 ""oscarko5"""	I had never heard about the show before. Western-style sci-fi with horses, pistols and all that? That sounded somehow cheesy, but I bought the DVD set anyway and I am glad I did.The DVD set offers one of the best values from any sci-fi shows. First the production - I watch DVD's in a light controlled room on 100 inch screen and I must say this is visually probably the best looking sci-fi show on DVD to this moment. The sets, camera and CGI is really top, film like and you have no visual clue that it actually is a TV show. The DVD transfer is also one of the best looking. No artifacts, crispy image.The story and characters are also top a TV can offer these days. They all are multi-dimensional and well acted. They do change, surprise and are generally fun to watch. There is a snappy humor in each episode driven by the dialogue between characters.The story is a good mix of humor, action and suspense. There is a little bit connection between episodes mostly when characters refers to previous situation but otherwise each episode carry one story.The show actually really starts to fly in about second half of the season, with the season premiere as the weakest episode.There is no second season and never will be. This may be the a serious flaw for some viewers. When you really get hooked on it it is over. Too fast and too soon. Especially that having a DVD you would really want to watch two or more episodes per evening.There is maybe a good point in having only one season - at least the show doesn't have to die of lack of imagination as many multi-year shows do. So now the writers are free to give us something new.I would recommend this not only for Sci-fi fans, but also for any other viewers. You can see it as western or sci-fi or simply a good show.	5.0	Guns, horses, fist-fights... and spaceships	2004-01-11	8	7	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3F25NCUIPV7LT	"Oscar Kramer ""Captain Cosmo"""	"It is a great plot with lots of potential, but the writers played it too safe. It started with an epic theme (the war), then slid into a comfortable petty-thief theme. They never took on the larger social and political issues that were presented at the beginning, and mentioned in every opening introductory narrative. They finally cut loose in the sequel ""Serenity"" movie. I wish the series would come back with that movie as the starting point. Had the network allowed the season to continue, then I would change my review to say that this first season had great character and plot development, leading to the beginning of the real story as presented in the sequel ""Serenity"".

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"It seems uncanny that one of the best sci-fi television serials since Star Trek would also be the downfall of sci-fi television which even ended up with Star Trek being cancelled.  The reason why we don't have anything new these past few years is apparently because of the low-ratings sci-fi television has been receiving. With 14 episodes produced, and only 11 aired, Firefly was cancelled by FOX in December 2002. However cult DVD box set followings (yeah this one) caused FOX to produce a movie version of the Firefly series called Serenity. Firefly is a cross between Star Wars and The Magnificent Seven. The shows creator, Josh Whedon (of Buffy the Vampire fame) had finished reading books about the Battle of Gettysburg and the American Civil War, combined the immigrant colonization elements with space pirates, a spice of Whedon whit in the script and a renegade crew on the ship Serenity with some state of the art special effects (Lucas could be forgiven for believing that his beloved ILM had been working early mornings without his knowledge) delivering on some cool stories for a show that deserves all the hype it has been receiving. In short if you own a DVD player, got the price for any box set, you will be getting value for content and then some more. This is like 10 hours worth of some of the best sci-fi you will ever see along with some of most hip characters to grace the television screen. The stories are all downright fab.

For starters the premise of prostitution being a highly regarded profession for which classy schools exist is such a ridiculously juvenile attempt at being confrontational. This show is more interesting than standard sci-fi fare (Star Trek, Stargate, Babylon 5), but that isn't saying much. It's not as good as Sliders, the plots aren't as well written, and the way they explore a new planet in each episode is a very similar premise. I would go as far as to call it shamelessly derivitive. Nathan Fillion was convincing as reluctantly responsible leader Malcolm, and River's psychological instability was interesting. The rest of the characters were predicable and one-dimensional. The show is worth watching, just not worth getting excited about.	3.0	Please enter a title for your review	2005-07-26	34	3	31

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2CPBGOW7O1VJR	Pankaj SAXENA	"I missed this show when it was broadcast on TV, and only bought the DVD set recently because it was recommended by a friend. This is a good sci-fi series, with great characters, interesting storylines, and good dialog. Joss Whedon certainly picked a talented crew - Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk and Jewel Staite are all perfect for their roles.The stories are an odd mix of sci-fi elements and westerns, set in a world which appropriately mixes high-tech (in the civilized central planets) with more primitive conditions along the frontier planets. Nathan Fillion (Captain of the cargo vessel ""Serenity"") and his crew carry out ""business"" along the frontier, hauling cargo, scavenging abandoned spaceships, the odd theft or two. Fillion makes a refreshing change from the usual run of self-important captains such as Luc ""Make It So"" Picard, or Kirk. There are no worlds in peril here, no important missions to save mankind. Just well-written stories about some interesting people, in interesting situations.Although the series was cancelled after 12 episodes were aired, it continues to enjoy a strong following among sci-fi fans. Pressure from fans, among other things, convinced Joss Whedon to make a movie based on the series (""Serenity"", release date 2005).I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who loves sci-fi, or who loves westerns."	5.0	A very good TV sci-fi series	2004-10-29	10	8	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKL38SGBVPQ1G	Par4dox	I didn't care for this series for a number of reasons which I'll try to articulate. In my opinion (and by the way everything I'm about to say is just my opinion, so I won't bother saying that in front of every sentence), this is one of the more lazy attempts at mashing two genres together. While the space western idea has potential (Star Wars can fit into this in many ways), Firefly literally takes standard western cliches and space cliches and clumsily glues them together without even trying to smooth the seams. Horses, spaceships, saloons and lasers all co-exist awkwardly in the same universe. The characters are one- or two-dimensional standard types: the lovable rogue, the quirky girl with a heart of gold, the conflicted but helpful preacher, etc. The lead character is ironically is lacking character; he's a good looking actor that could be replaced by any good looking actor. He brings nothing interesting to the role he plays. Some actors are fine (nothing remarkable) and are doing their best with the thin dialog and script. Imaging writing down as many space cliches and western cliches you can come up with, cutting them up, putting them in a hat, then pulling out a handful and pinning them to a board. Now fill in the rest to get from one cliche to the next. That's how it seems the writers came up with each episode. Lazy writing, uninspired casting, and a clunky concept make for a comparatively poor series.	2.0	Space Western?	2010-06-20	27	8	19
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ACVXDKCJUSAIZ	Paradocs	We saw 'Serenity' over the holidays, and promptly bought the 'Firefly' dvd boxed set.  What joy - to discover such a wonderful series now.  What heartbreak - to know that only these few episodes exist. We tried to ration them out to make them last longer, but couldn't stop ourselves from watching another and then another, and another. We just finished watching the last episode and are devastated - there is no more! It went way too fast. Yes, it could be classified as science fiction; and yes, there is occasionally, sexual content, but give it a try. The characters are diverse, yet each engaging in their own way, and the cast is superb. It is a series that is so enjoyable as to almost be addicting.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30IUH4AC21ISL	"Parrish A. Highley ""the_projectron"""	"As a general rule, I avoid television like the plague.  Were one to write a two hour movie for television, it would necessarily appear in the format of a seven act play.  Would that be because the seven act play is the reference point for a quality plot structure?  No, it's because on commercial television your story is going to be interrupted six times for the purpose of selling corn flakes and underarm deoderant.  That compelling storytelling could come forth from such limitations should make anyone pause and appreciate what he or she seeing.  Such is the nature of Joss Whedon'sFirefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray].The unifying premise of ""Firefly"" appears to have its roots in the American Civil War.  Having won a very similar war for very similar reasons decisively in the final battle in the Serenity Valley, The Alliance has forcibly united the whole of humanity.  The Captain of the firefly-class cargo ship, Malcolm Reynolds, was a separatist who fought on the losing side of said war, abandoned by his allies in that very last battle.  Unwilling to pledge his undying loyalty to The Alliance, he eeks out a meager existence smuggling contraband for hire or any other job he can manage to arrange with the shadowy figures with whom he is often forced to work.  Technological wonders do exist in this future vision of mankind but, as seems always the case, one must have the means to pay for such extravagance.When paying jobs become scarce, then Captain Malcolm Reynolds has to make due with ferrying passengers from one place to another.  Hence the growth of his crew aside from the core members to navigate, repair, or provide brute strength so the captain can get a little shut eye in relative peace.  In a lesser series, most of these characters would provide either plucky comic relief or function mostly as an archetype to bring the focus back onto the protagonist, but here every character is a protagonist, even the anti-hero Jayne Cobb who only barely qualifies as an anti-hero early on in the story arc.  The strength of this show is a great premise coupled with fantastic character development.It is a real shame that FOX could not find it in their cold-eyed bean counting hearts to let this run for a season or two, especially since Joss Whedon had already proved himself with two other successful series.  The filmSerenity [Blu-ray] was forced to tie every loose end of the unfinished series together in its somewhat rushed narrative.  While I do like the film, it should have been a trilogy given all the story arcs the series initiated.  If I had it to do all over again, I would film a trilogy that renders a definitive vision of the television series, but serves as a prequel to the film funded and distributed by Universal.  There were a lot of questions left unanswered by the series.  For instance, just how and why does Malcolm Reynolds lose his faith?  This is an interaction between Mal and the Shepherd that we never got to see, but should have.  Also, what if Inara chose men with whom she would not sleep out of a love for Mal?  The virgin she is hired to bed may have needed her kindness more than her body, why not explore THAT possibility?  But these questions linger primarily because the series never got the backing it both needed and deserved.  The untapped potential of this concept remains staggering!As a side note, the Blu-ray of the film is fantastic!  The series was intentionally filmed for a grainy look to coincide with the western genre, so that Blu-ray will hit the point of diminishing returns when those scenes appear.  I'll get the Blu-ray of the series just out of loyalty to the cast and crew, but it is not the stellar Blu-ray that the film is."	5.0	If More Television Were Like This, I Might Bother to Actually Watch	2010-05-29	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AW2GJONRCZKDS	Patrick J. Everett	To be honest, when I first heard of &quot;Firefly,&quot; I intended to ignore it.  Not because it wasn't a cool concept, (which it was,) it was because the majority of the advertisements and the like tended to focus on the fact that this show was created by the same guys who did &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel.&quot;  I hated those shows with a passion.  So, I didn't watch a single episode of it when Fox had it on the air, despite the good reviews and fan reaction it got.  Then, finally, it went away.  I stopped hearing about the show, and put it out of my mind.  I figured that if it got cancelled after one season, it wasn't worth it.  However, I kept hearing about angry fans, writing letters, even raising money to try to keep the show on the air.  Finally, I gave in.  I heard so much good things, I just went online (to this fabulous site, nonetheless,) and bought it right out.  No renting, no borrowing, just bought it.  I'm glad I did.&quot;Firefly&quot; is one of the best shows I've ever seen, and even more evidence (although there is an abundance of this already,) that the execs at Fox all have some kind of mental problems when it comes to keeping perfectly good shows.  &quot;Firefly&quot; is, essentially, sci-fi (spaceships, space battles and the like,) combined very effectively with old western-type style (gunfights, dialogue, and just an overall visual style.)  It doesn't sound quite right on paper, but in motion it is a wonder to behold.  It kept bringing me back to my younger days, watching old cowboy movies with my Dad, and then yanking me back with some nice sci-fi type action.  It blends these elements beautifully, and never seems to trade one side for the other(i.e., not more sci-fi than western, or vice-versa) at any given moment.  The writing is some of the best I've seen, the special effects are worth of any movie (this means YOU, Lucas,) and the characters are well acted and well crafted.The only problem with this 4 disc set is that it really does leave you wanting more, and it's not the show's fault.  Fox needs to seriously reconsider bringing back the show, or at least giving the rights to someone else.  (Sci-Fi Channel, anyone?)  The set comes with some nice special features, including commentary on a few episodes, a gag reel, some deleted scenes, and some behind-the-scenes features that were made after the sad cancellation of the series, so everyone (cast and crew) has an opinion about it, which is kinda nice  to know.If you consider yourslef a fan of sci-fi, and are looking for something really unique, pick this up.  The way I see it, the more people buy this, the more money Fox gets to consider reintroducing the show.  Suddenly, that forty bucks seems to be going towards a good cause, doesn't it?  We can only dream, I suppose, but with a movie rumored to be in development and a possibility for someone like Sci-Fi Channel to pick up the show, sometimes dreams don't seem that far-fetched.	5.0	The executives at Fox suck... this show is great!	2004-01-31	8	8	0

I was a bit leery of a series described as a cross between space opera and a western.  Fortunately she , my friend, was right in thinking that I would love this series.  It's a great mix of underdog heroes, humor, some non-cloying romantic tension, some great stories and action scenes that are plausible. I found this series thoroughly enjoyable and was most vexed by having to go to work and/or sleep as it interfered with my watching the episodes.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster"""	"I'm 56 years old and this program represents film art for the current generation of more youthful viewers.To me, the Firefly Series is sort of a three-way cross betweenStar Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series, (from a story standpoint);Doctor Who: The E-Space Trilogy - Full Circle/State of Decay/Warriors' Gate (Episodes 112-114), (for its ""soap opera-ish"" approach to film), and;C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete First Season, (from the perspective of ""production"".)I'm a traditionalist, always preferring older movies and TV series over the newer productions, but I heard so much about Firefly that I thought I'd give it a shot; however, I couldn't deal with the abrupt scene changes and camera sweeps, a film production technique that emerged from the 90s.But, in summary, it's still easy to see that this is quality programming, supported by terrific writers. So, in the end, just because I didn't personally enjoy Firefly does not mean that others won't appreciate a good show when they see it... thus my five-star rating."	5.0	Didn't care for it -- but quality programming nonetheless	2009-07-04	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1HVA7XMX7MB9X	Patrick W. Damiani	"I received the Blu-ray set for Christmas 2012. I put the DVD set in my Xbox 360 HDMI (TV recognized input as 1366x768 at 24 Hz) and put the Blu-ray set in my PS3 HDMI (TV recognized input as 1920x1080 at 120 Hz). A friend and I flipped back and forth between the two versions and saw maybe the absolute, most insignificant quality improvement on the Blu-ray side. Both of us had to convince ourselves that it was ""a little better."" It definitely wasn't a dramatic difference. The TV used was Samsung PN51D450 which is a plasma at 600 Hz with a native 1366x768 pixel field. No A/V receiver was used. If you have a TV that has a native pixel field with higher fidelity, then you may see a difference.Color, sound, etc. were all the same. No difference. One of the cameras used to film Firefly is always grainy. I never understood why that was, but during two camera shots, you can always pick out the grainy one, especially when the scene is very dark. Well, that effect, whether deliberate or not, is still present in the Blu-ray. CGI effects look identical; no molestation of the original content was made.I do enjoy the menu on the Blu-ray much better than the DVD. That sounds like an insignificant thing, but the DVD menu is horrible. I like being able to hit ""Play All"" and just walk away and let the audio of this fabulous show swell throughout the house, while I'm cleaning or whatnot. Can't do that with the DVD.Overall, if you have a functional DVD copy, I wouldn't rush out and drop $20 on the Blu-ray, and if you don't have a Blu-ray player, I wouldn't make Firefly your kill-app for one.Oh, and if you've never seen Firefly, you are missing out.

It really is a show you have to stick with for the first disk or two, but, it more then well pays itself off by the third disk. With its western like hold ups, futuristic setting, and cleverly plotted missions and tasks, this show is almost like a hybrid of Star Treck, Bonanza, and The A Team, except a whole lot better. Cancelling this show might have been Fox's worst mistake.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3S71SLB01GWX2	Paul Laska	Firefly provides a glimpse into a nitty-gritty future, where people have real motivations, and aren't always the most altruistic person they can be.  The cast of characters on the Firefly class star ship named Serenity have all been thrust into their predicament for different reasons, each hoping to achieve their own goals, but collectively most just wanting to stay a little further than the long-armed reach of the Alliance.  Relationships and friendships are formed, while they depend on each other to get them out of many different and exciting scrapes.The cinematography was progressive at the time, is still some of the best in the Sci-Fi genre, and holds up pretty well outside the genre.  For example, Joss Whedon, the creator and director, made a choice to use a shaky-cam for some of his shots, where the conventional wisdom of the day was to use a steady-cam; this added to the work-load of the CG-artists, but the effect gives a perfect perception of weight and action, and you can see the effect in popular use today in Sci-Fi movies like Star Trek: Into Darkness.The only bad thing I can say about the series is that it ended so early, due to some corporate decisions.  You end up caring about the characters, wondering if they make it.  Fortunately, Joss Whedon's crew and the fans were both persistent and dedicated enough to convince the powers that be to allow them to make a movie entitled, &#34;Serenity&#34; that wraps up many of the loose threads.  Make sure you watch the series, and then when you want more of this epic universe, watch the movie; it'll make much more sense, and you'll catch a lot of those little throw-backs to the series.&#34;No power in the 'verse can stop me.&#34; - River Tam	5.0	You can't stop the signal!	2013-05-22	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A15CW3M7V0A74M	Paul M. Harmon	"When people ask about my favorite TV shows this is always my first mention. Firefly succeeds on so may levels that it is hard to define why it's great. I believe much of it has to do with the fact that the entire cast has talked about how much they loved doing this show together and it really shows.Firefly was a true ensemble piece that was driven by amazing characters and brilliant writing. They were characters, and settings that almost felt familiar but were unique enough to make you pay attention. It was Sci-fi for everyone not just ""geeks"" and ""nerds"". It was Sci-fi about people trying to survive and stay together, humans with flaws and potential and baggage trying to leave their past and work together to survive in a universe they don't quite fit into. No aliens, no time travel, just people, and still a deal of action.Most people know the story of how Fox TV screwed with this show in every way possible before finding an excuse to cancel it, and for this and other reasons Fox has vilified itself to a great many people. Despite Fox's shortsightedness Firefly has a fan base that is still growing as new people discover it. In just 14 episodes Firefly managed to do what most shows will never do, grab you and never let go. The true reason to mourn it's loss is potential. You have to wonder if in just 14 episodes it could be this great what could have happened if it had built a mythology and its character's had followed their natural growth.Their are groups still trying to get it back on the air or even a sequel to it's big screen finale ""Serenity"" made but sadly this will probably never happen but if anyone out there in the verse can ask Joss Whedon one thing, just one favor, ask him to at least let the universe be continued in novels, it has great potential to be a hit in the literary world especially since Firefly and Serenity's demographic is definitely one that reads.Stay Shiny"	5.0	One of the reasons Joss Whedon is so loved.	2011-04-04	4	2	2

(Thank you, ""Serenity,"" which finally pushed me over the edge.) And now, like so many others, I'm evangelical on the subject of ""Firefly."" Even if it stretches my Christmas budget, everyone who might conceivably be interested is going to get a copy. Keep the chain going, reach critical mass, and the powers that be might bring it back!"	5.0	Yes, It Is That Good	2005-12-07	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3O0I3Y8G9EMWU	P. Eisenman	I don't know where I was when this came out on TV, but I never SAW it back in 2002!  I guess I was watching TGIF comedies on ABC (my mistake!).  I only discovered this series AFTER watching the SERENITY movie (also FIVE STAR entertainment!).So, to cut to the chase, I'll just throw my vote in with those reviewers who give this DVD box set FIVE STARS.  14 entertaining hours of action, adventure, humor and drama.  DVD extras are interesting and give some insight into the actors and directors thoughts on the show and characters.  QUALITY PACKAGING in FOUR slim line cases inside a slip-case box.  NOT the usual low grade, multi-set packaging which results in scratched discs!  Well worth the price of admission!	5.0	I'll join the mob and give it FIVE STARS, too!!!	2006-12-11	8	8	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1T16DG2WNMATJ	Penelope Widmore	When you try to explain the premise of this series to someone, inevitably their eyes glaze over... A SPACE WESTERN??? YES! And boy, is it GOOD and sooo FUNNY!This short lived series is a real gem. It is a delightful tale of a rag- tag group of free spirited pioneers out in the black, deep reaches of space, eking out a living on petty theft and scavenging escapades in an old Firefly class space ship. Most of the planets and moons they visit are reminiscent of the wild west on Earth, which makes sense considering they are the new outposts of human colonization.The acting, writing, and production of this series was first rate. This show could have evolved into a CLASSIC! It was prematurely cancelled before the plot lines could be fully developed and this is a CRYING SHAME!This is a series that deserves a second chance. Hopefully, it will one day be resurrected. Until then, this lone season of Firefly is worth it's weight in gold.	5.0	The Show That Shines ( like a firefly)	2007-09-03	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2V2UZ6MGUS8C7	Pen	I had never heard of this program until a friend told me the movie was being made.  I purchased the season on DVD and watched it knowing nothing of the show except for from the movie trailer.Both my wife and I really enjoyed the first (only?) season.  I only recognized one of the actors, the one from Knights Tale.  They all performed good, some exceptionally.The show rarely trys to explain the technology, which is great.  They don't have light speed or any of the other crazy technologies that Star Trek and the like have.  They do take months to go from one place to the next which they don't show and convientently ignor in character development.  But that is to be expected.  Ship weapons consist of hand held firearms.The show has a strange sense of humor.  Along the lines of Brisco County Jr., though this show pulls it off much better.  It is a western in space, such as the original Star Trek was.  Fresh and unique.  The show does cover adult subjects, it is not for kids.It does leave you wanting more at the end.  Hopefully the movie will do well and a second season will come of this.I had never even heard of Firefly, though I was an avid watcher of all the Star Treks, Star Wars, Space AAB, BSG, and many others.  I have to think the lack of promotion is what killed this show, not the show itself.Strongly recommend.	5.0	Great show	2005-08-18	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A11FBY6N0E75E2	Pen Name	Friends have been telling me for a while I would like this, but they were wrong... I absolutely LOVE it! Sure, they get around from planet to planet on a space ship, but on the ground it's horseback and rifles. How cool is that?It's a good premise to start with, but Joss Whedon takes it so much farther - Thank goodness. A cohesive ensemble cast that draws you in immediately and interesting enough story lines to keep you hooked. And I would compare the craftily drawn, ARCHETYPAL characters with those on Star Trek:TNG. Cleanly executed. And I meant &#34;archetypal,&#34; not &#34;stereotypical!&#34; The scripts give enough leeway to the actors that they can give unique, creative spins on their roles in meaningful ways. I can only imagine how much character development could have gone on, had the show been given the 2-3 more seasons (minimum) it deserved. A friend told me the network originally showed the episodes OUT OF ORDER. What's up with that?From the first scene at the helm: &#34;Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!&#34; - we are brought intimately into the lives of a world set five centuries in our future, but that seems to be inhabited by people with whom we are already familiar AND want to know better.So, watch the complete series, read the 3-part graphic novel from Dark Horse (if you like that sort of thing) that tells the next part of the story - and then watch the brilliantly executed film &#34;Serenity.&#34; You'll miss the crew of Serenity when you're done, but you'll be glad you got to enjoy as much of the ride with them as you could...	5.0	Strong character-driven Sci-Fi Western.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1TUKDEBTP4IC1	Pen Name	The background story of the Dissolution of Firefly is as interesting and heartbreaking as the pilot episode, and worth investigating.  Joss Whedon's Firefly series was abandoned by its network before completion, and ignored the developing fan base.  That population was strong enough to support and justify the development of the SERENITY movie, thanks to Joss, his backers, and their incredible team!  The loss of this great concept TV series is soothed by the success of its actors in other series,  e.g. CASTLE, V, NUMB3RS, CHUCK.This delightfully written, filmed, and acted Western is a believable and barely predictable tale of thieves whom we grow to admire for their tenacity in uncertain times.  Joss tips his hat to Shakespeare, Homer, Chaucer, Plato, Socrates, Xiang Yu and other Eastern philosophers, in wit and rationale.  Each episode is a well-considered gem, sufficient to admire alone, but is best viewed in their intended sequence, as a graduated string of pearls from which to admire the pendant, and last to be appreciated, full length film: SERENITY.  This series and movie alone are worth the $80 Amazon Prime fee, for the repeated enjoyment of their superb construction, psychology, lighting, and well-chosen special effects.	5.0	Firefly, Fox abandoned Epic	2013-06-20	1	1	0

The worst part about this set is the sadness that will come over you when you watch the last one knowing there are no more.This truly was the best science fiction series ever to grace television and not only had spectacular special effects (accurate no sound in space part), but splendid writing (injected with very real and witty humor) and fantastic acting (so comfortable in their characters it could have been season three) as well.  It was dark, raw, and real!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2KNWP8S1B4H8Q	"Pete Falina ""Pete F,"""	"It's not so much that there is anything highly original in concept about this series.  Gene Roddenberry pitched ""Star Trek"" as Wagon Train to the Stars.  I think he would have recognized and enjoyed ""Firefly.""What makes ""Firefly"" a standout, in my humble opinion, is a combination of factors.In the first place, the ensemble cast is nothing short of superb.  In fact, I'm a little annoyed with Mr. Whedon for killing off Wash and the Preacher in the ""Serenity"" full-length film.  However, here in the series, you can enjoy the whole bunch, each of whom contributes largely and directly to the success of this series.Second, the writing is really good.  You hear a lot about good writing, often in relation to indifferent work like ""The Sopranos.""  In this case, the accolade is deserved.  The writers give us some wit and some serious interaction along with each story.  You don't get that paint by the numbers feeling often, if at all.Third, the production values are top.  Remember, Roddenberry fussed over the design of the Enterprise, even though the network suits told him, ""Take a cigar shape, put some windows on it, end of case.""  The Serenity looks real, both inside and out.  The crew accepts and appreciates their ship (mechanic Kaylee maybe edging into Scotty-like obsession), but is always realistic about its shortcomings.OK, some hardcore hard-science fans may find aspects simplistic.  ""Star Trek"" stuck to 'Class M planets.'  In the ""Firefly"" universe, the habitable worlds have been terraformed.  So what?And as far as not having aliens, (a) see 'terraformed' above, and (b) the homicidal Reavers are alien enough.Like ""Star Trek"", ""Firefly"" the series was pushed off stage by a neglectful network that didn't recognize quality when they had it.  Like ""Star Trek"", ""Firefly""'s fans pushed hard enough to get a full-length motion picture.  I'm one of the ones who saw the ""Serenity"" movie first, and then backtracked to ""Firefly.""""Firefly - The Complete Series"" has got to be one of the best values in DVD that I've ever found."	5.0	A Leaf on the Wind	2007-09-09	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3BSRAFXWY7COC	Pete	"Over 1200 reviews, most with positive feedback. Joss Whedon. And the fact that the film, Serenity, will be out in November this year.This is evidence that this show is so damn good. I'm such a fan of it!No, it's not like Buffy. I'm glad for this-it would've paled in comparison. This is a show that can't be compared. It's a different kettle of fish. The only comparison buffy shares with firefly is creator, Joss Whedon's notion of the importance of the created family. And that's a good theme to run with.Being a buffy fan I bought the dvds on a risk. I'd only read one review (which gave it three stars because it ""isn't enough like Buffy""). The show didn't air in australia until months after the dvds were released (and it was treated as badly as Fox here too - with timeslots ranging from 11.30pm-1.30am at night once every three weeks with inconsistent changes) so I bought em as soon as I could. I'm so glad I did. I lent the dvds to a friend and one disc came back cracked so I bought it again and it's a good thing I did cause I still watch the episodes a lot.When I first sat down to Firefly I liked it but wasn't sure if I'd love it. It was quite fast and I missed a lot of dialogue. But by the end of the pilot I was hooked and watched the entire season in one sitting (missing all my classes I had at uni that day).The fans seem few and far between but this show has a strong cult following. There's more of us around that I thought. One day I was talking to a friend about firefly and a complete stranger from Canada overheard me and told us she thought the show was excellent.I'm excited to see the film. The official release date is September 29th but you can probably catch an advanced screening, if it's not sold out.It's not necessary but worth checking out the series first. So make sure you persist through the speedy start cause it's very rewarding. You won't be disappointed and you can join the masses in protesting the cancelling of the show, eagerly awaiting the film and the possible re-establishment of the show on a better network."	5.0	Bring it back!	2005-04-13	5	4	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A112CTX2ZZ8NFT	Peter Benjamin Parker	"Not many shows can claim a meager 14 episode run and yet have a large and loyal fan base. So large that they got a movie made, years after the show's demise. And after watching the show in it's entirety I realize for good reason! I'll admit the show does have it's weak spots most notably the camera does seem to be a little to shaky and quick, for lack of a better word, in the early episodes but around ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" the editing and camera team really seems to have found there footing, which is really astounding since it usually takes a show it's entire first season to really found it's comfort zone. The pilot feels like a big budget movie and it introduces us to the main characters in a natural way and a way that we instantly connect with the main characters, the six minute ""prolouge"" to the show as a whole which shows the end of the battle of Serenity Valley is a powerful scene both on an action and emotional front. Nathan Fillon is a talented actor and this scene is where he really gets a chance to shine, and he countinues to do so for the rest of the series.The weakest episodes of the series are ""The Train Job"" (although it is followed up on very well in ""War Stories"") and ""Safe"" which is a mediocre wast of an episode.The strongest episode of the whole series is ""Out of Gas"" which is great from start to finish and has a really fun great twist at the end. Other great episodes are the pilot ""Serenity"" and ""Bushwhacked"" is another episode with a good twist. ""Jaynestown"" is a real fun episode, and ""Shindig"" is also fun.You guys should definetly check out this fun series."	5.0	Inventive, fun, creative show is sci-fi at it's best!!!	2010-08-13	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A15ALUU7NT5D8B	Peter Francisco	I gave &quot;Firefly - The Complete Series&quot; to my wife for Christmas because I remembered how much she raved about the show, although I never had the chance to watch it myself before.  By New Years we watched all 14 episodes.  So much for spacing them out over time.  :)It turned out to be not only a gift to her, but a gift to us both.  To say we loved the shows is an understatement.  I'm a 26 year old guy... I guess that makes me the &quot;shadow demographic&quot;.  Let me explain this, FOX... I don't watch TV because there aren't shows like Firefly on TV.The characters are excellent.  Captain Mal, the disciplined yet independent skipper of a &quot;free lance cargo transport&quot; (read &quot;smuggler&quot;) keeps the crew and passengers united through words and the proper application of force.  He is the pivotal character of the series, aside from the ship itself, which on the DVD package, the ship Serenity is referred to as the &quot;10th Character&quot;.  This is due to the depth of detail given to the vessel and the way the characters interact with the various aspects of the ship.  As someone who has spent years on ships, there is a feeling of authenticity in Firefly about life aboard ship.  I always thought it was strange on Star Trek how you have this ship of thousands of people, yet we only saw the same 12 people or so.  But in Firefly aboard Serenity, they keep it simple:  Small ship... Small crew.There is enough material presented in the 14 episodes filmed that would justify seasons of episodes.  I can't think of a show that had so much clarity in the first season.  It was just extremely entertaining.  There were plenty of leads planted.  And there were plenty of questions that were just left unanswered (the show never completed its first season).  Indeed, don't expect a nice season finale to wrap things up.  The last episode is just another episode, and there's no &quot;closure&quot;... at least not yet. (Movie?)  But don't blame Joss Whedon... Blame Fox for axing it before its time.I have a few comments to FOX... If you can't spare an extra hour for a pilot and follow through with at least one complete season for someone as accomplished and successful as Joss Whedon, how do you expect any show to catch steam?  I can't think of a show I've ever watched in its first season, except Angel (and that's a Buffy spinoff) and Smallville.Why Firefly couldn't find a home on the WB is perplexing.  It seems a natural fit among Angel, Smallville, Charmed, etc...  And a lot of the displaced Buffy fans probably would have watched, as well.  Why would anyone watch a new good show on Fox now when, as history would suggest, there's a good chance it'll be cancelled, even if it's good?Firefly is an excellent show that will take you to the past and future at the same time, I reckon'.  And you'll like the trip.  Very highly recommended, despite ending with long-term plot questions unanswered.  As for the future, keep your eye out for the movie, and depending on its success, maybe a return to the small screen... but I'm betting it won't be on FOX.	5.0	To join the chorus in praise of Firefly and contempt of FOX	2004-01-01	5	5	0

From fans to those of you who have never heard of it. Just about anyone can relate to at least ONE of the characters in this story. It's writing is simplistic in its complexity, it uses little words to accomplish so much, and the ship itself becomes one of the most influential characters in the entire series. If there was ONE show that another network should pick up and run with...it should be this one.Everyone that can...should watch this dvd set and find out for themselves what they've been missing out on...the THEME song is enough to go and watch this set.

There's little I can add to what other people have written so specifically about how excellent this show is, except the following:From the reviews of Firefly here it is clear that this show has had a significant impact despite its short exposure on TV.  What you can do if you like the show, and are an Amazon.com customer, is go to other products and recommend Firefly in addition to/instead of that other product, as long as there is some relevancy.  You'll need Firefly's ASIN#, which is B0000AQS0F.And if you've already bought the DVD and want to support the show further, buy the DVD set as a gift to others, or as a gift to your local library, etc...  There's even one internet site, fireflymovie, raising money to buy copies to send to U.S. troops around the world.

Reynolds	I'm not a sci-fi fan, per se, but my wife got me hooked on Firefly since the re-running of the series began on the Sci-Fi Channel. The best thing about this show is the producers put the characters (all human, a big plus), plot and a sense of humor way ahead of the sci-fi aspect of the story. In doing so, the sci-fi elements are much more realistic and believable. You might call it low-tech sci fi. Whatever you call it, it works.Possibly,if the feature film, Serenity, does well, a smart network exec will get this show back in production.	5.0	A Great television show	2005-09-30	3	3	0

Ok, jet lag was a factor.  Even so, Joss Whedon has put together a fresh approach to Sci-Fi and has assembled resonant characters along with some very VERY talented people to play them.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A39FTCBOY6L37W	Peter W. LaNore	When this series aired, it showed instant promise.Based on the premise that outlaying planets would have a rudimentary technology while those that plied the paths between them would necessarily need something more advanced the show blends the old frontier with the last frontier.The cast was interesting and diverse.  The interrelationships had the promise of developing fully.  The writing was ecclectic and shied away from the formulaic preachy writing that too often characterizes (imperils?) popular science fiction.  (Science Fiction serves best as a way of getting people to think in new ways, rather than as a propagandistic tool for the right or left.)  It also shied away from the blaster-blazing non-stop string of explosions that undermines most low-budget sci-fi.It should have been a bullseye or at least in the first ring.And it wasnt.The writers couldn't seem to keep themselves from interrupting the plot lines to snipe at religion by characterizing it as something to make others feel bad, hate crazed witch burners, and hypocritical phonies.  If the show had been about the struggle against a religious oligarchy this would have been fitting and appropriate.  As it was, it interrupted what might have been good writing with propagandistic sophomoric interpretations.  The prejudices of the writers undermined the show with an irrelevancy.A show might survive if the networks are convinced of its appeal (even if it has none).  It might survive if the viewership ratings are high enough to overcome the network convictions.  But it won't survive when it goes counter to the grain of the network while alienating the viewers and by doing this the arrow hit two rings off center.	3.0	Two rings off-center	2004-04-02	74	12	62

The show had the great elements of all Joss Whedon shows - imagination, quirk, wit, intriguing & well-drawn characters, and unexpected storylines.  I don't like Westerns and am picky about my SciFi, but Firefly isn't pigeonholed into either category.  Give the series a few shows to hook you in and enjoy the ride.Recommend for: 18 to 45 year olds that like the unexpected series; or, any fan of other Joss Whedon showsWord to the Wise:  If your TV watching consist mainly of30-min sitcoms on mainstream stations, this series may not be for you.My favorite TV series: Alias, Six Feet Under, 24, Sex & The City, and now Firefly	5.0	Mesmerizing...	2005-07-27	6	6	0

Unlike how Fox aired it, needs to be watched in order to understand.  The depth of character development is unusual for television, and the humor is sophisticated, even when it isn't.  There is a decidedly western theme, which *does* make sense given the totality of the circumstances.  No aliens, no theatrics, just interesting stories about interesting people in an interesting time.  The best TV series that shouldn't have been cancelled.  If you are a true scifi fan, you've already seen it.

Stargate Atlantis blows this show away and doesn't have near the sex and violence of firefly.The idea of a futuristic Western is good but I thought Joss Whedon should of had more ""Western"" in the series.

Gaines	Many people see Firefly as a space-faring drama that is cavorting as a western, but it's probably more useful to see it as the opposite.  Joss Whedon seems to care not a whit about science fiction in the usual sense, but what he does care about is the characters and the myriad of decisions that they must make alone, on the spot, and with real risks to life, diginity, and liberty.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1YHYJJ6IUE1G4	"Philip Hamzik ""teenager"""	"From the creators of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Firefly was  TV at it's best, until FOX cancelled it. The show was/is outstanding, but I'm afraid the competition was too tough in it's Friday time slot. One of the most anticipated ahows of the new season back in fall 2002, Firefly was a strong show that had great plots, great acting, and directing that will blow any show out of the water. Taking a step away from Vampires and Demos, Joss decided to take on a different task...making a show about people in space, with a twist. This show isn't your Star Trek rip off or Stargate SG-1 double, but this show is very unique. Set 500 years into the future, Firefly deals with a group of intergalactic westerners that all took refuge on a gigantic ship called ""Serenity"". These 7 people were all there for different reasons: money, protection, shelter, power, religion, etc. These people work together to pull off jobs that will earn then money and status within the universe that they live in.- With these interesting blend of charcters, the show not only had tons of great action and cool special effects, it has drama pouring out of every scene. This show is everything you must see, so I would recommend this DVD to anyone. It includes All of the first season that was aired on TV plus 3 more unaired (never before seen) episodes that continue the Firely saga. With a Firely movie being written right now by Joss Whedon (Toy Story, Buffy, Angel), it is even more important that you own this set.

As you watch each episode, you see more out of each of the characters as they grow throughout the series.  It's so hard to find that in any series.  I may sound like a crazed fan (and I am), but just watch this series in order and you'll see what I mean.  By the final episode, you care about these characters so much that you hate to see them go.  There was so much potential.  It was so sad to see them go.  It's nice that a movie is being made to possibly answer all those questions about the series, but (at least) another few more seasons is what this show deserved.

I had never seen the original Firefly show, so I bought the box set.What an interesting, quirky, genius show. A perfect cast, an ingenious universe. Action, adventure, humor, surprises. Off axis camera work, jerky focused CGI shots. Breathtaking music. This show could easily be the basis for a semester of film appreciation class.The chemistry between the characters/actors is amazing, especially the delightful interaction between Mal and Inara. Their communication is as much in what is NOT said as what is said, through facial expressions and knowing glances. The Ron Glass' Shepherd and the River characters are also extremely complex. Unfortunately, their stories are never fully told. And with Shepherd Book now dead in the movie, we will never know. I have not cared about TV characters this much in a very long time.And yet...the show always seems to be fighting for its life. You can feel the urgency and futility as the show's creators struggled with the network, ultimately doomed for cancellation. If only the Sci-Fi channel could have taken on the show back in 2002 when it was cancelled by Fox. We can look forward to a movie franchise, but an opportunity was definitely missed. The movie was great, but the ""mood"" was different. Besides, I need my fix now!Favorite episodes: Serenity, The Shindig, War Stories."	5.0	...since I found Serenity	2005-10-30	18	17	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A33TXOBERAPUGE	"Pitch Pocket ""Tool junkie"""	"Completely missed this series when it was on TV.  Only ordered the series after reading previous reviews.  Generally like science fiction and special effects type movies so thought would give it a try.  Very pleasantly surprised.  The special effects are fine but that isn't what makes this series special. It's the character development and the writing.  Characters are all interesting and have such different personalities but they all work together and it is this blending of personalities that makes this series special.  The dialogue, particularly Mal's is witty, sharp and fun.  The Trash episode was one of my favorites.  Never having watched it on TV and as new viewer it took couple of episodes to begin to understand the characters so if you're new to this hang in there you won't be disappointed.  Also rent the movie Serenity which you'll also want to see as it gives some additional background on show and the Reavers.  Biggest negative is there are no more shows.  Think most of this series was made 4 to 5 years ago and haven't heard of any new ones being made.  And even if there were plans to do so the cast probably has long since moved on to other projects.  Buy this series and watch it and bet you'll feel as disappointed as I do that there just ""ain't no more""."	5.0	Excellent series, Great Characters	2008-08-09	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3IUW081KXD3PE	pixels and bits	"A few years ago I was bored and browsing Amazon's top 25 DVD list for something new to watch and Firefly caught my eye.  At that time it already had thousands of 5 star reviews to its name and I'd never even heard of the series!  Being a Science Fiction and Fantasy fan, I promptly ordered it because if I hated it I could obviously get rid of it pretty easily.  Since then, I've re-sold or traded the vast majority of the DVDs that I've purchased over the years but Firefly (and its full length companion film ""Serenity"") still occupies a permanent place in my private collection.  What's more, I've actually watched the entire series (as well as the film) at least 3 times in its entirety.  That's a first!Seems that I wasn't the only person who missed this fabulous series when it was part of the Fox lineup.  Created by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) it enjoys an original premise, extremely smart writing and a cast of talented regulars with great chemistry.  Given the boot after only 14 episodes (some of which were never aired as part of the original series) by some brainiac executive at Fox, it lives on in perpetuity as a cult classic.  SciFi channel (now SyFy or some such nonsense)often airs the series as a special weekend marathon.Give it a whirl.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2QTQD4XFRX20	pjmandanm	The Firefly series is great no matter the format, but the Blu-ray edition provides an incredible visual experience. If you are a fan, the Blu-ray is worth it.  If you are new to the series, it is worth the venture.  The futuristic setting ingeniously intertwines the Wild West, heroic outlaws and all, with the technology and advancements one would expect to find in a science fiction series.  The characters have depth, and the plots of individual episodes seem woven seamlessly together.  It's a shame the series was cut short.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2SRBXWIAQYCZQ	planetclark	I saw the first aired episode of this show two years ago and dismissed it: characters enjoying a camaraderie that hadn't been fully established yet, and a bizarre Wild West in Space setting that struck me as derivative and gimmicky. So I tuned out -- as I suspect a lot of viewers did. And Fox probably used me as a statistic to justify cancelling the show. Little did I know this episode wasn't the pilot, which did a great job of easing viewers into the universe. Little did I know Fox showed the pilot just before cancelling the show, effectively screwing any continuity they could've built for viewers. And little did I know how damn good this show was, until its release on DVD. Not since BABYLON 5 has something this fresh and exciting come down the sci-fi airwaves. Intelligence, humor, action, emotion, great F/X -- FIRELY has it all. Aside from their right-wing wacko news channel, the cancellation of FIREFLY is yet another reason to hate Fox. Do yourself a favor and watch these 13 episodes. Then let's keep our fingers crossed for next year's movie. Stay shiny!	5.0	Here's another big thumbs-up for FIREFLY!	2004-05-01	5	5	0

It was one of the few movies I have seen in my lifetime that comes close to the magnificent character chemistry and science fiction intrigue that was provided by the original Star Wars trilogy.  Matching up to Star Wars is certainly a tall order, but I honestly feel that this is as close as you can get.Having watched Serenity I quickly borrowed my friend's copy of the Firefly boxed set.

Halfway through watching her copies, we decided we had to have our own.  And yes, I am an original Star Trek fan-saw the first episode the first time it was shown!  Also saw the original Star Wars the first week it was shown, so you can see how ancient we are!The stories are both heartrending and funny-sometimes at the same time.  Even though it may seem strange to have Western elements like leather vests and revolvers mixed in with space ships and psychics, in the context of the frontier where they live (aka ""edge of the Black""), it is very believable and appealing.  These are the real people the Enterprise only met on occasion and the people Han, Luke and Anakin would have been if they had not encountered the Force.  Also, like the Enterprise and the Millenium Falcon, the ship, Serenity, is also a character in the show.  She is truly a Firefly, generating all the excitement a child experiences trying to catch one on a midsummer's night.Cancelling this show, after messing around with it like Fox did, deprived all of us of a wonderful experience.

As a result the planets on the fringe of the central governmental control tend to be open to more lawlessness and &#8216;creative&#8217; with regard to making a living.  Firefly is the space ship that travels in this world of turmoil, picking up odd jobs with a very unlikely crew; the captain (a defeated leader of the independents), a navigator, the navigator&#8217;s wife, a somewhat crude deckhand with the propensity to violence, a young female engineer, a &#8216;companion&#8217; (prostitute), a preacher with somewhat of a checkered past, and a brother (a doctor) and sister (somewhat psycho) who are on the lamb after escaping from a central government facility where the sister was under some sort of examination.  In essence it is a western played out in a future time; well written with plenty of action with realistic graphics.

Firefly is a masterful work, it pretty much has everything in well proportioned amounts;  good and funny dialogue, interesting characters played by good actors, an interesting take on the future with good backstory, good fights of all kinds, palpable sexual tension, interesting juxtapositions of different moral values, with just an all around good balance of storytelling.  I was left wanting more at the end of the series, since its premature cancellation, but also a great sense of satisfaction that is only felt after watching a great movie or reading a great book. I am looking forward to the movies and hoping that they can maintain the same high quality, but the story really lent itself to the weekly series format.	5.0	Masterful work	2005-09-02	10	9	1

White	"I won't bother reviewing Firefly itself because you're all shiny enough to know what's happening in the 'verse, instead I'll concentrate on the Blu-Ray factor.This IS a better release than the DVDs, no question. The scenes that were filmed look definitively high definition and show details such as fabric weaves and monitor displays. The low light areas are also much improved and the detail is more obvious. Some scenes, primarily SFX clips, were not created with HD in mind and remain stubbornly standard definition. To my surprise this is not as grating as I'd expected. I run a 52"" 1080 TV and therefore I'd presumed the SD clips would stand out like the proverbial sore thumb but no ... they integrate quite well. Bear in mind that even the SD clips will look slightly better on Blu-Ray because DVD is not quite broadcast resolution and so Blu-Ray can add those extra few lines that the DVD was missing.The audio is very good. The DTS Master track sounds great and really reveals the subtlety in the string driven music that accompanies the series. The surround efficiency has been improved to with the 3D soundscape seeming much more coherent.As I said, I'm surprised by how much I like this Blu-Ray release and for any Firefly appreciator with a reasonably good HD system then don't even think about not buying it!Oh, nice menus too."	4.0	Almost there ....	2009-01-06	54	49	5
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1A9F0ONC0JKKY	Pylon 1	When this show was in production and airing for the first time I missed it, in fact, I didn't even know about it.  After it ran for its one and only season, years later as a sci-fi buff myself, I would hear some grumblings here and there about what a great show Firefly was and what a shame it was that it was only made for one season.  I was intrigued.Fortunately for me, the Science Channel started running the old episodes a while back and I caught a few of them, and instantly this bacame one of my favorites.  The show is absolutely brilliant, and unique.  The characters are very likeable (my favorites are Jayne, Book, and Kaylee), the acting is solid, and the plots are well thought-out.  They could have done so much more, but it wasn't to be.  So unfortunate because there was so much room for story and character development.  After only catching a few of the episodes on the Science Channel, I was excited to get this DVD set as a Christmas gift from my wife, so I could watch the episodes I had not yet seen, and also, watch all my favorite episodes over and over again.This set is a highly recommended buy whether you are a fan, or someone new to the series who likes sci-fi, or just anything unique and interesting.	5.0	The only negative is it will leave you longing for more...a wish that can never be fullfilled	2013-05-21	0	0	0

Joss Wheadon at his conceptual and writing best! An exciting, smart, funny, serious-issue-confronting masterpiece. Each and every cast member fit their roles like a glove and seamlessly worked together as an ensemble--from day one. Even the music was a perfect fit. My ONLY complaint about &#34;Firefly&#34; is that it was allowed to end with only a brief goodbye in the form of &#34;Serenity&#34; (the big damn movie). Buy both and savor them slowly... if you can. Once you are hooked you'll also want to get the &#34;Done the Impossible&#34; dvd/download a tribute from and to the fans. Unlike other franchises (I won't name names but you know who you are) Firefly has never fogotten its fans and its products are reasonably priced and of high quality. So help support that stalwart business model, buy the downloads, shirts, decals, keychains, dvds and blue rays, 'cause trust me you'll want to experience &#34;Firefly&#34; again and again and again.	5.0	Alais poor Firefly we hardly knew ye!	2013-04-13	1	1	0

But once past the 3/4 episode, I really started appreciating the small quips between characters which add another dimension of fun to the whole thing. The thing feels fresh, fast and fluid, easy to watch yet lets you reflect on things far deeper. The effects, performances and action is top notch, and Whedon and he gang carved out and highlighted each character with very subtle but powerful moments- the did for character development in the first 10 episodes what most series spend entire seasons at attempting and still failing.The sequel Serenity carries that tradition.

It is, perhaps, unexplainable, the only way to truly understand is to watch it for yourself, watch them all, (the way I made the show seem longer is by watching one episode like three times a month). But seriously watch them and then watch the movie because its essentially a season two in two hours. Once you see it, you'll understand.	5.0	perfection of sci-fi	2010-06-19	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A14902EQLZCB2X	"raasnio ""raasnio"""	I watched a few episodes after having seen the film and now, even later, have seen four more. To preface this, I absolutely love the film Serenity. I've owned it on DVD and Blu-ray and is one of my go-to films when people ask to watch something from my collection. That said, this TV series that is so beloved is somewhat lost on me. Out of the 7 episodes that I've seen, I've enjoyed two of them. The biggest problem I have is with the acting. Some of these actors are just plain bad. Difficult to watch. A few are solid. Gina Torres and Nathan Fillion make this show as watchable as it can be, but so many others, especially supporting cast members, have seemingly no experience in front of a camera. Good editing could have helped, but that, too, seems to be a weak spot for Firefly.I'm a fan of most of Whedon's films, but he has yet to make something for television that I could really get into. The film Serenity shows me that his concepts, characters, and stories are worth watching. Hopefully he will stick to making films where he seems not to suffer from the problems I've seen with Firefly. For those who wonder how this series could have been cancelled after just one season, I would say that were I in charge of making that decision I likely would have cancelled it as well. A lot of promise, but not executed very well as a whole.	2.0	Rough Start	2013-08-21	7	3	4

I'm an engineer and am critical of 'water running uphill' - physically impossible plot and story lines cause they're insulting.  I found nothing like that here.  For my money (as a novice to the series) - i'd take this series over star trek.  It is more plausible (less 'magic') and to me (imho) more entertaining.  Despite the one star rating critic lambasting 'fanatics' for packing the reviews - i'd not classify myself as a fanatic - i don't care for ""Buffy"" - too much implasible magic and a 'star' who once remarked ""I can't believe i have to work with these people!!"" after showing up hours late for an appointment.

I love science fiction, I grew up on Westerns, so the combination sounded interesting and I ordered.  Now I'm hooked.  This series is superb.  It has good character development, a good premise (a rough-and-tumble space frontier 500 years in the future) and succeeds very well in combining the action and style of a Western with survival on an old ship in outer space.  The premise -- a band of renegades struggling to survive while avoiding the oppressive new Alliance government -- makes for good conflict, along with cannibalistic Reavers and gangs of nefarious bad guys.  (Sure, the Serenity crew are a bunch of outlaws, but they are really the good guys.)  The design of the ""Firefly class"" ship is very creative, too -- it does resemble a firefly when the engines light up the stern, which gave me my ""aha!"" moment as to why a science fiction series would be named after a bug.  My only complaint about ""Firefly"" is that there wasn't enough of it.  Fox really blew it when they canceled this before the end of the first season!

After you stick through the first five minutes of war on the outer planets (which I think turned a lot of viewers away) you get to the current time in Firefly with Mal as captain and all of his crew members. The writing in the series is wonderful- full of witty comments and fantastic characters that are well developed.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A24MNCB8GVL6ND	Rachel Kershenbaum	As a Buffy fan, I considered the premiere of Firefly on network TV something of a consolation prize for the post-slayer era, and I approached it with caution, but not without hope, because I have faith in Joss Whedon's vision. I watched the premiere on TV and couldn't figure out what had gone wrong - had I missed three episodes? Was I just in a confused funk because Buffy was over? I just didn't get it and I couldn't believe Joss would introduce a series in such a user-unfriendly way.I gave up quickly and it wasn't until a friend and fellow-Joss fan suggested I try again that I gave it any thought at all. We rented the entire series on DVD and lo and behold! A different pilot! A two-hour introduction to the characters and universe! What a good idea! Turns out Joss had planned it this way but the network took issue and had him air a later episode first. Silly network execs. What's the point of running a Joss Whedon series, whose main audience is likely going to be Joss Whedon and Buffy fans and then not listening to what he has to say?Anyway, I LOVED the series - it's smart, deep, funny, well-written, well-played - the cast has  chemistry and comraderie and the stories have multi-cultural/multi-historical references and timeless lessons with metaphors that work and language that works overtime. Brilliant idea to use Chinese to curse on network TV, too.Recently I purchased the whole series (one box) for my boyfriend, so he could get up to speed before Serenity was out. He only had to watch the pilot to enjoy the film, which was also wonderful. There are contradictions in plot between the series and the movie, but nothing so egregious that you can't chalk it up to a different retelling of the same story. It has a mythical quality, grounded in a mix of future and history that, as I said, gives it a timeless quality. We are what we are, and we probably always will be.I guess it's not surprising that something of such high quality didn't survive on the air. Firefly can now take it's place alongside Freaks and Geeks, Sports Night and other short-lived but outstanding television series.	5.0	Why Oh Why didn't they listen to Joss?	2005-10-15	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GFNSQEFYL0AB	"Raelee May Carpenter ""Infinity's child"""	FOX killed this show.  They put it on in the worst timeslot a t.v. week can offer. They aired the episodes out of order; they didn't play the pilot first, which would've hooked everyone who tuned in.  They pre-empted it several times.  Then they cancelled before it had half a chance to recover from the blows they dealt it.  They took a sure thing and murdered it.Joss Whedon isn't responsible for the failure of Firefly.  He's never put out anything bad, and this show is amazing.  The writer's aren't responsible; the writing was incredible.  The actors aren't responsible; they did a wonderful job.This was one of the only original shows to come over the waves in a long time, and it was killed by a network that had no idea what it had been given.If you watch this show, you will not be disappointed.

It's at turns humorous, suspenseful, action packed, serious, and sad. All the science fiction parts just add to and enrich the story, but they aren't the main story.  If you enjoy character driven shows, I think you will like this, whether your a big science fiction/fantasy fan or not.	5.0	Not your typical scifi entry	2014-03-18	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3A96NX58FJ8I6	Ralph M Waugh	Outstanding Sci-Fi Adventure.  If you are a science-fiction fan, you have to see this single-season series of FireFly.  Original, creative, compelling.  It may make you wonder why no channel paid the crew for more seasons.  Also, see the movie, Serenity.  This was the crew's chance to bring some closure & tie up loose ends.  It is equally fascinating.	5.0	Outstanding Sci-Fi Adventure	2010-07-13	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3BK6IBGGAWHXN	Ralph T. Beaudin III	I am a self-professed movie-holic.  I have over 600 Laserdiscs, unknown number of VHS, and over 800 DVDs.I am an avid collector and presently have all the available seasons of all the shows on DVD that catch my interest:  Firefly, MASH, Cheers, All In The Family, Highlander, Dilbert, Millenium, Kung Fu, Soap, Home Improvement, Green Acres, Hogans Heroes, Gilligans Island, and probably others I am presently forgetting about.I am also a SF and Fantasy devotee.  Not only in movies and TV, but also in books.Having been overseas serving with the US Military since 1/79, except for 8/96-10/97, I haven't watched much US TV recently.  I saw this TV DVD Box Set on sale and asked a couple friends about it.  They recommended it so I purchased it.The show was fantastic.  Not only did I watch the shows almost continously, I re-watched all of them that had commentary.  I then loaned the DVDs to two friends who also instantly fell in love with the series.The writing, acting, sets, storyline, plot, etc. was fantastic.  Even though I have been a SF and Fantasy fan since the '70s, I would still have enjoyed this series because of the acting and writing if it was set in the 'Wild West' or modern day Chicago.Since the VHS format came out back in the 80s I have only gone to the theaters 3 times; once when I was in a new location with nothing else to do, once for a new release my wife wanted to see, and the last time when I took my 7 year old to the SpongeBob movie.  However, I think I will make an exception to my normal boycott of the expensive theaters to see Serenity when it comes out in late 2005.In the last 2 years I have seen some of the current US TV shows via what is available to us on US Military bases overseas.  The brief glimpses I have seen have shown nothing comparable to the quality of Firefly.Regards, Ralph	5.0	Well Written & Well Acted	2005-06-15	17	15	2
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQWZYNDSUOVC5	ramirez98	Leave it to studio executives to screw up the best thing to hit sci-fi in decades.Firefly is a fantastic story-oriented, character driven sci-fi western - YES, sci-fi western.  Sounds odd, and the pilot is a bit slow to get going, but once you hit episode 3 it's your new addiction.  When my wife and I got through the last episode, we were really sad that there weren't any more to watch.We did watch the 'Serenity' movie, which was a good follow-up.I strongly, fully, totally, absolutely, whole-heartedly recommend  this show.	5.0	perhaps the best sci-fi show ever produced	2006-02-06	13	12	1

Nagy	"After reading the insane number of 5-Star reviews here on Amazon, we purchased this series thinking that we could watch it with the kids. We turned it off after our kids spent more time hiding their eyes, than watching the screen. Only after we wasted our money did we learn that the ludicrous number of positive reviews here was due to fan-spam.Even for those who have grown up enough to discover that life is not about what is between their legs, shows like this are just plain embarrassing. From worrying about inappropriate or random flashbacks from whores (a.k.a. ""ambassadors?"" OMG!), partial nudity, testosterone rage, and null-value sex scenes... unless you are hormonally about 23, then Firefly is a sad excuse for science fiction. (Intergalactic social disease, anyone?)Indeed, why waste time televising support for sustainable, tax-free, extended family values? The Chinese have family networks. They will give U.S plenty of loans. Today, rather than rewarding happy families the very President got into office by promising handouts to EVERY dysfunctional family. --Just like HIS mom wanted! (LOL)You go Hollywood, go... Just - please - as our supply of effective antibiotics dwindle, do not forget to broadcast the reason why this type of ""science fiction"" was ""good"" during the plagues!In short, we could not believe that this type of intergalactic garbage was ever allowed on television.

Don't they do audience followups any more?  Do they just use a dartboard to determine what airs when and for how long?  I'd rant some more, but others have said it better.  Fun series.  Fun fun fun.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3KWS73I8X59GW	Randall Carruthers	I, like many others learned about Firefly after it was canceled. I have yet to see every episode since I'm intentionally dragging my feet. The movie was one of the best I've seen in 25 years. Well written, great characters and super acting. Entertaining, fun, cool, thought-provoking. What else could you ask for in a series.Having been around a while, I can't help but compare this with the original Star Trek series, since Firefly is much, much better than you'd expect a TV series to be and consequently, a bit slow to catch on nationwide. The difference is that Firefly is a much higher quality production. Each episode was very well written, the plots were entertaining and thought provoking. Acting was spot-on and makes you a fan of the characters.What a loss I've felt having just become a fan and learned the series is no more. There is the series on DVD and the movie which I still watch with family on a regular basis.Check out the re-runs before you buy the series to see if you like it. I'll bet you become a fan like I did!	5.0	No Brainer. Excellent	2008-06-10	2	1	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AG8WCQ9B92LSV	"R. Anderson ""genius_robby"""	I'm not one for TV much - my wife and I DVR a few shows each week, and ignore most of the trash that dominates the cable and airwaves. Sadly, this means we probably miss a few good shows out there.Like this one.I'm not a big Buffy or Angel fan (not one of the many Whedon devotees), so when this show came out, we kind of glossed over it. However, at the urging of a friend, we watched Disk 1 of this DVD. I was surprised at how good it was, at the depth of characterization, the richness of the universe and backstory, the interplay of the characters, the attention to detail, and the how uncontrived the various plot points are. As we watched further discs, I came to two conclusions about Firefly: 1) the storytelling is as masterful as anything I have ever seen and 2) the writers, producers and directors actually respect their audience.To date, I've already hooked a few other friends on the show. It has been a pretty standard recipe - get them to watch the first DVD, and the magic just happens. Even my wife (a fantasy genre fan, but not big on Sci Fi) loves the show.As to the genre. This isn't the PC future of Star Trek. Its not the glitz and mysticism of Star Wars. Its not the doom and gloom view of new Battlestar Galatica. In many ways, it reaches far above and beyond the sci-fi genre, in a manner I have not seen before. It is not about space, it just takes place there.So, if you like intelligent, well-acted, well-directed, thought provoking television, you'll like this show. If not, you might want to look elsewhere.	5.0	Startlingly good television	2005-06-21	16	16	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1M849NZWOVWM7	Raskle	"My first exposure to this Joss Whedon series was through the movie ""Serenity,"" and I thoroughly enjoyed watching that movie. At the time, I was unaware of who Wheden was, or what other works he had on his resume. Admittedly, I've never been a fan of Whedon's previous forays into television, such as ""Buffy"" and ""Angel,"" believing them to be directed mainly at pre-pubescent teenagers and bored housewives. Luckily for me, I was ignorant of the connection to Firefly, and was able to keep an open mind when watching.Firefly completely blew me away with how captivating and engrossing each episode was. From the writing, to the camerawork, to the direction of its quirky and loveable cast, there was not one thing I could find fault with or look at harshly. Well, the fact that this was the only season produced is a big gripe, but that's directed at the network that foolishly cancelled it. You will love it, I can assure you.I will give one important warning to anyone thinking of buying this DVD collection though: Make sure you have ample, and I mean ample, amounts of free time before starting the first episode. You will NOT want to stop for anything once you get started, and it will be hard not to go back and rewatch the whole series once you've finished it. It really is that good!!5 out of 5 stars, in my opinion. Enjoy!"	5.0	Witty, humorous, and a terrific cast	2008-09-01	1	1	0

If it had ran longer one can only think that it would of spawned a star trek type following. the characters grow and evolve in the season.When I finished the last disk I was left wondering that's it how could they stop.Checking the actors after the shows untimely ending,I was gratified to see they all kept working.

I have to agree.  What Whedon was able to accomplish was a whole new kind of science fiction.  Being able to mix a little of the old west with sci-fi as well as mixing a little western with eastern philosophy.  Truly brilliant in my opinion.

And when Serenity came in the theaters, I thought it was just another ""super female weapon"" movie like the other two coming out about that time (Ultraviolet and Aeon Flux).  Boy was I wrong.Upon the recommendation of a friend I ""borrowed"" the first episode and thought ""this isn't bad.""  Then by the time I watched episode 3 I had to watch all of the episodes.  I proceeded to watch the entire series in 2 days then watch Serenity.  Now I am a huge fan of the series. I then went and bought Firefox the complete series and Serenity so I can watch it all over again.  This is the first series that it pains me to know I'll never see another episode...like the previous review, this is on the level of reading a good book.  Keeps you coming back for more.Why oh why must we watch crap on TV that comes back season after season when a show with such depth is removed before it can finish an entire season?  I am disgusted by the networks and production companies because of this.  Fox mismarketed this series and the production company did the same with the movie.  I never remember hearing about it before my friend told me to watch it.  I would wager to guess that the fan base has grown far larger since the series was cancelled than it was while it aired.  This show had it all.  The only hope of fans everywhere is that if two cartoons can be brought back because of fan support, then maybe we'll see some more of Firefly in the future"	5.0	New comer to the verse	2006-08-15	11	10	1

This show should still be in production; it makes you wonder what kind of idiots make decisions about what to keep and what not to  keep.  One word of advice: the first couple of episodes are somewhat confusing, but by the third episode, you will be able to relate to the characters, you will ""get"" the premise, and you will be hooked.

It's also no wonder that those few people who saw this show fell in love with it.  If you like well written plots with irony, snappy comebacks, well developed characters, actors and actresess worth drooling over and caring about, buy this series.Mankind has expanded to the stars (actually just one star with about 200 planets and moons) and have brought all of their humanity with them.  The inner worlds are ordered, technologically advanced and DULL.  Big Brother watches averybody just enough that most people feel safe and not controlled.

It's not too expensive and almost no one saw it.  Everyone I have shown it to have all said the same thing, ""Why did they cancell this show?""  This was the best sci/fi show to come along in decades.  One of the best things about giving this as a gift is that you can follow it up later with gift #2...The movie ""SERENITY"".

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2S6VMJSMXIAC9	"R. Dean ""Mom, teacher, smart shopper"""	"I was introduced to Firefly by my cousin and we often have the same taste (Some of our favorites are Star Trek:TNG, the new Battlestar Galactica, Sharpe, Hornblower).  So I am a sci-fi fan and I also like historical fiction.  If this sounds like you, you will probably LOVE Firefly.  It is funny, interesting, and different.  I found myself caring about the characters a lot and caring what would happen.  Some people may be leary of some of the sexual content (it is not explicit--I was a Rome fan--that was EXPLICIT) but I have watched it with my teenage sister and feel no embarrassment or guilt.  There are a few scenes of two women together and a few scenes of sex but there is no real nudity--but you do get to see Nathan Fillion's butt in one episode:)Sometimes in the show, the characters will just start spewing out Chinese. ( Often when they are upset.)  I LOVE THIS!!!  I just think it is awesome.  If you're a Battlestar Galactica fan, you probably find yourself saying ""frakkin"" in place of swearing.  If you become hooked on Firefly, you may slip in some Chinese swears everyone once in awhile!Yes, there is some violence and yes, the ""heroes"" of the show are actually criminals (smugglers and thieves mostly).  But they are also good people who care about each other.  And there is a prostitute who is also a good person.  I think the reason I didn't watch this when  it was on TV was because of the prostitute character.  But you can dislike what she does and still like her.  It is the idea of a sci-fi western.  Sometimes the good guys are the bad guys.Someone wrote in a review on this site that the Inara character (companion/prostitute) served no purpose.  But she and Mal (the captain) have an ongoing tension between them and you wonder if they will ever admit their feelings for each other.I love the opening song, I love the way the show is filmed  (with handheld cameras to make it look less clean and more chaotic).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2SQ0HYFSZ7V1L	R Donovan	Firefly is still one of my favorite shows. Interesting and well-acted characters, and great writing too - dramatic, funny (every episode has something laugh-out-loud hilarious), and, at times, poignant. I love the juxtaposition of wild west and space-based technology. I still think that someone at the top of production food chain made a lousy business decision when they cancelled Firefly. This show is made for adults, and NOT for children under 16 -  at times there's nudity, sex, and realistic physical and psychological violence. But those elements are not the point. There's complexity and mystery in the storyline that makes Firefly a gem you'll enjoy watching more than once.	5.0	Firefly is Unique and Fun to Watch	2014-01-18	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A235F2EEONXN2W	Rebecca E. Daly	despite the poor treatment this show recieved from fox (broadcast in the worst possible time-slot for its demographic, episodes aired out of order), it was still a quality production from start to finish.  the setting was unusual, and one of the better conceived on tv, ESPECIALLY in that all of the details were not given exposition, they were simply presented and left, as in a real world history would not be explained to people who should, presumably, already know it.  the characters were developing nicely, to the extent that, as with whedon's other shows, a line written for one character and given to another was apparent.  when watching the episodes in order on the dvd, all of this becomes more apparent, as do the skills of the actors.  while firefly was not yet the best show on television, that was simply because it was not allowed the time to mature: when a show begins with this degree of writing, acting, and innovation, where can it not go?  of course, sadly for all those viewers who loved firefly, and all the unfortunates who would have loved it had they been able to watch it, we may never know (unless the movie does get made).  still, the dvd is one of the best out there, with interesting commentaries, extra scenes, and a gag reel.	5.0	the triumph of hope over adversity?	2004-02-02	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A16I4GTSSF11O1	"""rebelflyer"""	To my knowledge, possibly the greatest injustice in TV history was the handling of Firefly, the finest Sci-Fi series ever produced, bar none. Having carefully developed a large ensemble cast of incredibly strong characters with colourful yet secretive pasts, using witty &amp; sharp dialogue and gripping storylines, as well as excellent and realistic sets, special effects and costumes, the show was canned just as it was promising so much.For those of us across the Atlantic, it was hard to imagine when this series reached our shores, how it had been cancelled Stateside, without even all the episodes being aired. A western in space, surely this should have gone down a storm! Fortunately on our side of the pond, we did get all the episodes screened and were quite bemused how shows like Andromeda or Farscape could survive so long, while a show of this calibre, couldn't get picked up beyond half a season. Word has filtered through and apparently despite Joss Whedon's track record of success with Buffy and Angel, Fox decided to screen the series with no promotion, in a Friday nite death slot, up against the baseball. Surprise, surprise ratings weren't exactly great. If I was American I'd never even have heard of this show (I'd have been watching the sport).Anyway thank God for the DVD release and excellently done it is too. Great commentaries and bonus material on top of the fact that this is a show you can just watch again and again, make this DVD excellent value for money. The only problem with this DVD is that having watched it and enjoyed it so much, you are left with an unfinished masterpiece. The thought that all the questions that this now cancelled series posed may never be answered, is rather depressing. Here's hoping Joss' plans for a movie or encouraging DVD sales are enough to resurrect Firefly.Fair dues to you Americans, you sure do know how to put together top quality entertainment. Pity this one, which should of been a flagship example, got canned at infancy.BTW, to those who recommended Farscape over Firefly is tantamount to recommending Denis Leary as a better stand up comedian than Bill Hicks, no disrespect it's a fine show but we're talking different leagues here.	5.0	Praying for the Second Coming.	2003-12-30	7	7	0

If you can believe it I bought the series Firefly on a whim, not knowing the connection between Buffy, Josh, and Serenity. I learned after watching the special features on the movie. While I didnt like the series as much as the movie ( I believe I was spoiled by seeing the movie first)I believe it is one of the best series that I have stumbled upon. I can not believe that those in charge of what stays or goes on T V didnt give the creator of Buffy more than one season.(what idiots) They didnt give Josh fans time to find it, I hope whoever cancled it at least got demoted ( I cant hope for some to lose their job)( probably someones nephew or son) This was such an error in judgement, this could have evolved into such a very entertaining series.	5.0	Fire fly the series/ serenity the movie	2012-05-07	3	2	1

So I decided to rent the series and check it out.I wasn't sure if I liked it at the beginning but as the episodes went on I started to care about the characters and enjoy their freshness. Something I can't say anymore about predictable Star Trek.What ranks it for me as wonderful is the sense of humour. It's so difficult for scifi to get humour right. It's so geeky at times(Worf saying, ""Assimilate this"").Also, THE WOMEN!!!

No I'm not a cult follower but in a time in television when all we get are cop dramas and medical shows (no offense to those dramas that are actually good) their comes a time where a originality should be taking precedence. Firefly was a unique show with that sense of adventure that lacks in many series today. I kind of wish it was still on.

I saw one show, and I liked it, but I never really got a chance to watch the rest since I had to work mostly nights, and then Fox did a horrible job at promoting it.Well now its on DVD, and I have watched it all. And I am very pleased.  The whole show is worth its weight in gold.  Alot of very catchy lines and some memorable scenes.The main theme song is very good (writen by Joss himself).  The characters can be slap-stick funny when they need to be, and serious when they have to be.  The cast was well selected, and every one plays off the other very well.Many un-answered questions, but hopefully the Movie (When it comes out) will answer a good deal, but leave us with more.So if you are bored with some of the other space-action stuff, need something new, give this a try.  Find a friend who has a copy and watch at least the first episode (the Pilot is Kind of slow for some), and if you enjoy it, grab it!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1AF8GGNQ6LTBK	Revelation Magazine	"What can be said about Firefly that has not been said already? Joss Whedon's short-lived science fiction series seizes the most successful qualities from a half-dozen distinctive genres and recombines them to create an inventive episodic drama that is nothing short of brilliant. The post-apocalyptic spaceways traveled by the Serenity and her diverse crew--with ""Earth-That-Was"" left far behind--contain an inspired melding of cultures, lifestyles, personalities, and ideas. Whedon has crafted a unique and unforgettable universe, one that is so believable and engaging that it seems comforting and instantly familiar. There may be something for everyone in this DVD collection. Firefly's highflying adventures are much more than standard space opera. The show's amusing, emotional, and sometimes contemplative stories call upon viewers not only to look to the future of mankind but also to re-examine our shared past, to consider history and heritage in meaningful new ways. The series is almost always believable, thanks in part to some impressive production values. The visual effects, sets, costumes, direction, and music are perfectly executed. More importantly, both the cast and the show's sharp scripts are superb. Firefly is endlessly amusing, it's true, and damned witty too. What's most involving about the show, however, is its undeniable heart. As they laugh and cry together you can see that it would be difficult to watch these episodes without becoming emotionally attached to such a charismatic cast. The only unfortunate aspect of this collection is that it contains so few installments; truly, it's a crime the series was brought to such an early end. Firefly encapsulates the excitement and adventure of science fiction, the soul and humor of a character-driven drama, and all of the down-to-earth charms of a traditional western. Ultimately, however, like all great works of art, the series is much more than the sum of its parts. Firefly delivers on almost every level of expectation and maintains the strength of its spirit throughout. The series has earned its audience accolades and has already become an unforgettable classic.--Brian A. DixonRevelation Magazine"	5.0	Firefly: You Can't Take the Sky	2010-07-17	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	APRH04AXI7Q4D	Reviewer	Okay, I may get beaten up for what I am about to say, but I must say it. I hate Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and many other sci-fi shows. When my friends spoke highly of the canceled show 'Firefly', I refused to see it. I thought it was a rip-off of the anime 'Outlaw Star' when I saw the commercial with River in the box (Melfina, the android of the anime, also was found curled up in a similar box). But then one friend really made my ears perk up. One of my favorite actresses, Jewel Staite, was one of the nine main characters on the show! I chuckled at that because I first fell in love with her when she played Catalina on 'Space Cases' which Billy Mummy also helped create and Catalina was an engineering genius, much like Kaylee which Jewel plays wonderfully in 'Firefly'.When I bought the boxset, my heart was troubled. What was I thinking?! I hate sci-fi shows! But it was all for Jewel, I reminded myself. Lo-and-behold, 'Firefly' is now my favorite show on Earth! I need more!!! *Twitches* It has enjoyable characters, lots of humor, drama, a little dash of sex and violence plus a plot line that can be followed pretty easily! All the characters are well-played and I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the main character (usually I like one of the minor characters more then the boring hero seen in many different shows) and understood his struggles with himself, his past and his faith. I was also very surprised at how cheery Jewel's character was. She usually plays the stubborn but nice girls who sometimes turn their noses up at the world. I also liked how the writers made us like Kaylee in the first episode right away before she was...well, you have to find out!If you like space drama/action adventures, don't hesitate to buy it. If you don't, I say buy it when you get some extra cash like I did. Believe me, you won't regret it!I can't wait until the movie comes out...

The cast and crew chosen to put this awesome achievement together have put larger scale productions to shame.The growing fan struggle to bring this series back to television is a testiment to it's greatness.

What a find this show is - witty, action-packed and dramatic, a rare combination. The DVD extras are few, but a wonderful interview with cast and crew, who were truly heartbroken when it was cancelled. It also adds another layer knowing the fans rallied to resurrect the show as a movie. Though this is a great collection for those who are just finding the show, I'm leaving off one star for myself, and the fact that I did not buy the newest, expanded DVD.	4.0	Firefly still flying	2008-07-03	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3N7HHBZNUJ6D6	R. Hedges	First, I've watched a few of Joss Whedon's other franchises on an irregular basis, so I wasn't a fan of his per se, before watching Serenity.  Then I watched Serenity, and found it to be a great film with very strong characters-which is the most important factor in a good story anyway.Naturally when I found out that Serenity basically was the epilogue of Firefly, I just had to see Firefly.  It was like watching 14 more one hour movies of Serenity!  Or perhaps Serenity is just Firefly #15?  What makes Firefly special to me is that all the episodes have a very, very strong story and a consistency that you simply don't find in Babylon 5 or the first two Star Trek shows (TOS, TNG).  I'm not talking characters referening previous episodes here either-it's simply the intensity and quality of the writing that is noteworthy.  With other TV shows, you typically get some or a lot of good stories during a season intermixed by some average and maybe even a bad episode (see Grey 17 Is Missing from Bablyon 5 for example), but never all of the episodes are good.  Firefly is the exception here.While the chances of Firefly being resurrected are quasi-null, I hope more Serenity films are made and I'd like to see Mal admit he has feelings for Inara-to her, that is, before Joss Whedon decides to actually, formally end this great sci-fi show (supposedly a Serenity Trilogy could happen based on various interviews with the cast and crew).  The unresolved romantic tension is exciting, but killing me at the same time...Mal seems harder, and colder, in Serenity than he does in Firefly, but that seemed like the only change I found as far as character behavior goes.This is a show-and a movie (Serenity), not to be underestimated.  If you love good science fiction with a unique western style, this is it.	5.0	Unbelievably good sci-fi show	2006-05-28	11	10	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AASFVVXM0I5UG	Rhett Redelings	"Being a Joss Whedon fan, I was probably one of the 10 people who didn't find out about Firefly by accident.  I was waiting, because I knew that Joss Whedon and his Mutant Enemy crew turn out consistently high quality, if largely misunderstood, products and I was intrigued by the claim that Firefly was to be Whedon's ""anti-star trek"".  I enjoyed the Star Trek universe until the producers watered down their own product into the promising but disappointingly bland and predictable 'Enterprise'.  So, when 'Firefly' aired the first time, I was clean, refreshed, recently fed and I'd even put on new socks for the occasion (I'm kidding about the socks, actually).I'm not a fan of the TV Western genre, so the notion that this was a Sci-Fi/Western didn't do much to win my heart, but I remembered that Gene Roddenberry had sold Star Trek to the networks by billing it as ""wagon train to the stars"", so I gave it a chance.  I really enjoyed the first episode ""The Train Job"", but it wasn't love.  In fact, it wasn't until about episode 3 ('Shindig', I think) when I realized that I was completely in love with these characters.  They were as vibrant, flawed, and genuine as any I'd ever encountered, with a complexity usually found only in good books.  I found myself thinking about them when I was driving to and from work. The plot twists, and production values too, were just as impressive.  Finally a sci-fi show where they remembered that there's no sound in space!  Finally a show that films the action in a way that makes your heart pound with excitement!  And that's when I realized that Firefly wasn't the product of some bad joke (""What do you get when you cross the Millenium Falcon with Little House on the Prairy?""), it was a brilliant science fiction experience doing what sci-fi does best: It explores the human condition in a fresh and exciting way, by showing us circus-mirror reflections of ourselves.  It entertains but also gives us a safe way to ask ourselves the hard questions.  And unlike Star Trek, Firefly never attempted to answer those questions or preach to us.  Firefly was a high water mark for the Television medium.  I'd finally found a show that would take TV to a new level.So what did the Fox network do?  They bungled the whole thing up from the beginning and then cancelled it after 11 episodes!  I was outraged!  I wrote letters, posted to internet forums, I sent post cards, told as many people about the show as possible and tried to do my part to keep it on the air.  But Fox threw it away in favor of more predictable, forgettable and, ultimately, unwatchable television.  Do you need more evidence that big corporations are out of step with their audiences than millions of people petitioning to keep a show alive, filling out demographic surveys to empower the advertisers with more effective market research, sending in letters, taking out full page adverts in major magazines and they still turn a deaf ear?When the DVD set looked like it might actually happen, I went to Amazon.com and pre-ordered it, hoping that the commitment of my dollars would encourage the Fox people to actually produce the set.  When it finally arrived, I suddenly had this cold fear that maybe it wasn't going to be as good as I'd remembered.  Maybe the excitement I felt was misplaced.  After all, it's only a TV show, right?Well, I'm happy (and deeply grieved) to report that after watching the entire Firefly run again, (on DVD which looks much better than the original broadcast) plus the 3 never before aired episodes, that this show isn't just as good as I'd remembered, it's even better!There are no bumpy headed English speaking aliens in Firefly or big morality tales telling us how to be better people.  There are just life sized folks doing what life sized folks do.  We settle new frontiers, we strive to build lives for ourselves, keep food on the table, stay free, take care of our loved ones, and we keep going.  Fiction often allows us to delude ourselves into believing that human history has lead us to one singular defining moment, but the reality is that life just endures and there never is an end to justify the means.  There is only the means, the journey.  Firefly is true and real and gritty in that way that the best book you've ever read is true and real.  It doesn't fit comfortably into the narrow expectations of TV. It's not a western, or a space show, a drama or a comedy.  Like real life, Firefly is all of those things.  Of course, there's still the space ships, the action, the romance, the beautiful people, terrific special effects, great music, unexpectedly funny hi-jinks and movie-quality production values if all that effete mumbo jumbo about the human condition doesn't get you excited!This is the best television ever produced, bar none!  You owe it to yourself to buy this DVD set and then take a couple days off to watch it all.  Especially since there are a few million of us nagging at Universal and Mutant Enemy to make us a Firefly major motion picture which you will want to be hip enough to enjoy.  Fox may have interrupted the run of Firefly, but believe me when I tell you that no power in the 'verse can stop us.Serenity will fly again.Cheers."	5.0	High water mark for Television	2003-12-30	4	4	0

For example I'm one of those rare viewers who chose not to give G.Lucas money for the new SW films (because I was so unhappy with the third movie).  I rarely watch television any more because I've given up hope that anything good will ever be allowed to air.My sister-in-law sent us these Firefly DVDs - we had never seen the series when it originally aired.  They are fantastic from the first moment to the last.  Commentary and extra features are mere cream on top of the real product, which is the series itself, seen here as it was intended to be seen, not reordered and ruined by soulless movie executives who wouldn't know great human work if it fell in their lap, as Firefly did.WARNING:  If you watch this series you will want more!  (fortunately, Universal just started production on a movie!  see Firefly fan sites on the web for news)I have purchased seven sets as gifts already and will probably continue to do so.

Well, actually, I remember when the series began on Fox but I never bothered to give it a chance. But now, intrigued because of the film coming out soon, I decided to give it a try now that it's on television again, and now I feel like such a dunce for missing out on this show the first time around. First off, Firefly is a space western, and if I had known that before by giving the show a chance, I would've loved it much sooner. Firefly was not meant to be like Buffy, or Angel. It's a completely different show except the humor is quite reminiscent of Joss Whedon's other shows. I never really liked Buffy, or Angel, but Firefly was right up my alley. The western influences are much more prevalent than I thought (the characters actually sound like cowboys), and combined with its sci-fi counterpart, Firefly sort of reminds me of ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.,"" but more sci-fi and with a much more serious tone.Anyway, I really liked what I saw. It was funny, it was western, it was sci-fi (kind of like Star Wars), and, most importantly, had compelling characters.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Y317UG7PVM9M	R. Hunt	I seldom review movies or DVDs, however this one deserved my praise.  Let me start by saying that I only saw one show on fox (The Train Job) and thought it was a one-shot fill in.  I thought it was great and hoped that they would make it a permenant series. Since it appeared to be pre-empted by sporting events several times and moved to different timeslots, one could come to the conclusion that fox for some reason, possibly the quick advertising buck of sports events, chose to go the economic route rather than allow the fan base to develop for this show. I believe this to be the case based on the overall sucess of the series and the film. (in my opinion)Now in saying it had something for everone, I shall now elaborate (Spoiler alert)1.  This show had genuine character chemistry. You did get the feeling that the characters really did care about each other. They had disagreements, they had fights, one hit another over the head with a big wrench when a betrayal took place. In short, you could see where this group of people could be like a close knit family. Ron Glass (Preacher) said in one of the extra features that when the group came together on the set it was like one big family, and it showed.2. This show was FUNNY. I found myself laughing at the characters and what they did, said, or did'nt do. I watched the episode over again and was still laughing.  What made it great is that I could see myself  doing the exact same thing in the situation.  It was not unrealistically funny, but funny in a way that most people probably would do the same thing.  For example the doctors reaction in Jaynestown.3. Romance - (Spoiler) - Ok the Captain and the Companion, and the mechanic and the doctor, the near misses, the ovious attractions, the crushing disappointments, the endless possibilites.  Is there anything more that can be said ?4. Culture - The combination of English and Chinese laungauges was first rate and possible profetic. The current demographic studies show that Chinese will eventually be spoken by more people in the world then any other launguage.  The blending of cultures over time is a historical fact, this show gives up a possible looking into our culture future.5. Action, Drama - The crew of the Serenity are basically mercenaries with hearts willing to do almost anything to survive in a world not of there chosing (like we all are). This brings them into confict with both the elements of criminal organizations and goverment groups. You can use your imagination on this one, however not all problems are settled with guns.So what it comes down to is that this has something for everyone, I have even hooked my collegues at work on this series. It is a series worth watching and owning, it has all the appeals that make a true classic.  My hope is that future movies or another TV series will be produced after the phenominal sucess of the DVDs and movie.	5.0	A Series that had something for everyone	2005-10-16	15	14	1

I watched the movie first and then the series.  Should have done this the other way around.  The third disc in the series had some digital breakup but Amazon, with amazing speed, replaced it with a new set that worked just fine.  In any case, this series was truly fantastic.  When I say that, I mean it was fantastic in every aspect.  The writing, language, acting, photography, sound effects and music came completely together.  Each of the fourteen episodes were a pleasure to watch and left one wanting more.  When you watch this series it gets you to think about what the series means.  It also leaves you to wonder how anyone could have considered cancelling a series that could easily have run for four to five more seasons.  Perhaps the series was ahead of it's time, in that television still had a lot of growing up to do.  There aren't many tv series that contain a message without damaging or limiting the entertainment value of the product.  This is a series that leaves you wanting more.

This show was so unique and different then ""regular"" space shows that it has to be truely witnessed to understand and truely appreciate it.  I think the following is even larger now because of the movie.  People wanted to bone up on it to fully follow the movie, (but even the movie could pretty much stand up on it's own) so when others ""discovered"" the 13 episodes, I think that created an even bigger cult following.  However, I think even the movie was only half-heartedly promoted by the corporate execs, and hence the even lower ROI then coulda/shoulda been made.I don't think there is enough juice in the system to do another extension to the series, but with such a large and growing following, I'm hoping, one day, there will at least be another movie.Again, such a crying shame that this show, as well as one of my other favorites, Farscape, just didn't last longer."	5.0	One of the best sci-fi series, every!	2007-06-24	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1LJ00X1ZNMIUZ	Richard F. Quinn	"I only caught a fraction of one episode on TV (""War Stories"") by accident but it was enough to get me to look up the show (I had never even heard of it) on TV Tome which, in turn, lead me to Amazon where I read the many gushing reviews. They were enough to convince me to go out and buy the boxed set.I found I watched the entire series (plus the extras) over the last weekend and was eager to watch the entire thing in one sitting (which circumstances did not allow alas). The show has certain unmistakeable Whedon elements most notably in evidence is his skill at rapidly developing well drawn, sympathetic, deep and intriguingly flawed central characters who all have a sense of humor.When watching these episodes I had the most amazing sense of reliving some of the sensations I felt as a 13 year old watching the original Star Wars in 1977. The two are completely different, of course, but there was something about the inhospitable western landscapes and the grittiness of planets on the edge of the populated universe that was as compelling and attractive as anything depicted in the first Star Wars flick (and this was achieved with nary an alien or android in sight!).In Firefly in every episode there is a real sense of a wide, complex universe, a place of wild undiscovered frontiers and of  turbulent and interesting times throbbing away just beneath the surface as our protagonists go about their adventures trying to keep their heads down and avoid a run in with the dreaded ""Alliance"" (an entity with nice echoes (right down to the funky uniforms) of the ""Empire"" from the first Star Wars film - but without the cheesy self parody that infected Mr Lucas's subsequent take on it).Also unlike the simplistic evil empire versus good rebels scenario conjured up in Star Wars we get an empire that is more ambiguous (ie much more credible and interesting) in Firefly.  The Alliance is painted as somewhat benign and possibly even a force for good but which harbors within its huge girth some sinister and hidden elements outside the apparent control of the Alliance (not unlike that which exists in real bodies politic in the actual universe we live in). Even the main characters are morally ambiguous at times through necessity.  There is great resonance in the real world. This conveying of social and political depth in a future universe, of the ""grey"" areas where actions are played out by flawed and desperate humans against a complex and morally amiguous backdrop is almost never successfully captured in Sci-Fi (compare with the simplistic and largerly one dimensional ""federation"" of the Star Trek Universe). That Whedon could achieve what Star Trek has not and to do that in only a handful of episodes gives a glimpse of where this show could have gone had it been given a chance).The CGI effects in Firefly are effective and used when needed to advance the story. They look good (and I love the fact that everything depicted in space is silent - just as it would be in reality in a vacumn). The effects are always used intelligently and subtly (a lesson Mr Lucas seems to have forgotten in all his cinematic efforts after Star Wars Ep 4).It is, of course, to Fox's great discredit that the bean counters axed this show before anybody even knew it was there let alone before a following was allowed to build as it inevitably would have over time. You would have thought with Whedon's track record he would have been allowed at least an entire series before the axe came down. I seem to recall Buffy wasn't an instant hit either.Part of the reason for my adding this otherwise redundant review to the plethora of other favourable reviews is to stick it to Fox. As I understand it the boxed set has sold gangbusters since going on sale.  Glad to hear it although it cheeses me to think Fox is cashing in on a project they killed off prematurely.  I hope the movie version does go ahead as the gossip seems to suggest.  It is even a remote possibility the series might be revived if the movie is a success although I suspect the actors have probably moved onto other things by now - they have to eat after all.We can but hope because this is surely one of the best conceived and best executed series (Sci-Fi or otherwise) ever to have been trashed before even ending its first season.  A travesty which leaves me scratching my head and longing for the day when all TV programs will be aired and viewed on a pay-per-view basis over the internet. Imagine a time in the not too distant future when shows like Firefly can be streamed to tens of millions of aficionados world wide who each pay a few cents for the privilege thus ensuring such a show a future.  No question of premature axings based on suspect ratings figures when that eventually is reality.I hope my addition to this avalanche of positive reviews encourages a couple more people to risk shelling out to buy this very enjoyable series because that might just be enough to influence those Fox bean counters to resurrect this tremendous show.  This set is a definite keeper in my book."	5.0	Buy this DVD - and do your bit to revive this show	2005-01-22	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3LSCJYQD6W8P0	"Richard G. Higgins ""lostboyblue"""	"What a great series this is... as stated in so many reviews before me... this series, now only available on DVD is one of the most original, well written, most thought out, attention to detail having shows I have seen on mainstream television in a long time.I was not a huge fan of either Buffy or Angel either, and not to say that I didnt't enjoy them when I caught them being aired: only to say I was not a fan of religiously watching every week. (I enjoyed maybe 4 epsiodes total of each.)FIREFLY, I never saw at all when it WAS being aired on t.v. Agian I say, this is an amazingling well created series. The detail, and originality of this show caught me off gaurd. Without employing so many of the sci-fi cliches... this show accomplishes a level of greatness. It brings a fresh look to the sci-fi genre infusing the ideas of a frontier style attiude. I am aware that sci-fi and 'western' storylines have been fused together in previous attempts, this is the most seamless version of the idea, that I have seen.I am a science fiction genre fan, and this is a welcome, and valuable addition to my collection. Get your copy now!As many know by now there will be a feature length film released soon, and as one contributor to the series said... we can only hope that someone will go...""why haven't we made a t.v. show out of this, and then SERENITY will be resurrected. LET'S HOPE! EVERYONE FOCUS ON THAT FOR A SECOND..READY..... NOW!"	5.0	SERENITY NOW! :)	2005-06-09	11	10	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A32EHYALM0LADV	Richard	I saw this when this aired on FOX back in 2002. For some reason FOX thought it was a good idea to air Episode 2 - &quot;The Train Job&quot; first, followed by pre-empting every other episode whenever the baseball playoffs felt like going into overtime, and then ending the season with Episode 1 - &quot;Serenity&quot; and then kicking it into the uprights for not doing well. Oh and they forgot to air 3 episodes somewhere along the way. I stuck with it throughout and managed to watch about 8 of the 13 episodes that are on this DVD without being too confused and I could still see that something great was being created. I was severely disappointed at the way this show was treated. I mean what the eff is FOX thinking? It's like Disney hiring Johnny Depp for &quot;Pirates Of The Caribbean&quot;, but telling Johnny to not be Johnny (that scenario ended up okay as we all know after Johnny told them he's doing it his way or he's out there, and they are raking in the cash because of him). Or Nickelodeon hiring Jhonen Vasquez to create a cartoon, which ended up being &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, and then canceling it (but for some reason Nick still airs in on their secondary channel while the merchandise flies off the shelves at Hot Topic, a DVD is in the works, folks!!). Why do these studios hire these people and then they don't support them? Why bother hiring them, if you are just going to try and turn them into something they are not? I digress. Anyway, in short, buy this DVD, watch every episode in their correct order, even the 3 missing episodes, and prepare to be a fan. If you like stuff like Star Trek (but with more of an edge), Cowboy Bebop (without the noir) or just sci-fi and westerns in general, you'll love Firefly. This DVD is a god send, it's liking watching the director's cut of the series, it's so damn good. Joss if you are reading this, keep the faith, my brother. I hope the film version works out not only for you, but for fans of your show like me who want to see more of the crew of the Serenity. As of this writing, Amazon has this sales ranked at #15 on their DVD chart. Shiny!	5.0	FOX effed this show up/Joss Whedon rocks/Buy This DVD now!!!	2003-12-15	1	1	0

I didn't get to see this show when it was on the air, but was passed the DVD's by a friend. After seeing the first 3 episodes I was hooked. I enjoyed the episodes so much I immediately went out and bought my own set of this collection.This show never should have been canceled. I'm a fan for life. I hope to see a follow up movie soon. If anyone in the TV industry has half a brain they will get this show back up and running fast. This show had a minimum of a 7 year run in it.If you like Star Trek, Babylon 5, Farscape, Buffy and Angel you will certainly enjoy this show.	5.0	Buy it or borrow it.

I can tell everything that the other 500+ reviewers have said but that would be redundant.I am not a Buffy or Angel fan and Firefly has beat out anything I have ever seen in Science Fiction thus far.

I guarantee you won't be sorry.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A30O9L8EZ1JC64	Richard Lane	I think this is one of the best shows ever on US television.  I know, that's a big statement.I find most television boring.  Monk was cute, but I'd solve the crime in the first 10 minutes.  Buffy was good, for about the first 3, maybe 4th season.  I love british mysteries, Morse, Foyle, Life on Mars, etc.  Last really great US series was Northern Exposure.Okay, so you see my background.  Not a sci fi fan, did like Trek NG, but hated all the others.  Didn't like Battlestar, Angel, Far whatever or that stupid step thru thing.Firefly, though, I loved.  Only complaint I have about the series is Josh's opinion of what a christian would say in response to objections etc.  Sounds typical thinking of someone who doesn't believe in God trying to sound like they are reasonable in explaining God.  I yelled at the screen first time I saw Jaynesville when the Shepard responded to River.I felt the show has the wit that made early Buffy episodes so good, the action is good, I love the way the captain always gets his butt kicked in fights, (yes, typical unrealistic hollywood fighting), and the relationship between characters.  How wonderful this show might have developed if given a chance (yea, I know there are comic books, but jeez, if you are an adult and reading comic books, get an L tatooed on your forehead).So, in closing, I rank this has a Top Ten All Time Show.  Not quite ahead of Rockford, Taxi or WKRP, but it might be 4th or 5th on the list, in my humble opinion.	5.0	Love this show!	2010-04-14	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AED17R2G8LYC7	Richard M. Warnick	I confess when I watched the first &quot;Firefly&quot; episode that Fox put on the air (&quot;The Train Job&quot;), I didn't totally get it.  An Old West-style train robbery in the future?  Later I realized that tweaking genres is Joss Whedon's trademark, and it's great fun.  Why did this show get cancelled???Even if you saw all the shows when they were broadcast, this DVD set is well worth the price.  The three unaired episodes are every bit as good as the rest.  Not to mention the &quot;making of&quot; feature and the deleted scenes (now I know why the ship is named Serenity).  Die-hard fans (I am one now) will want to listen to the commentaries and get a kick out of the gag reel.The &quot;Firefly&quot; DVD release is a chance to appreciate the terrific writing, appealing cast of characters, clever cinematography and musical score-- whether you've ever seen the show or not.

(Can't say why without spoiling it for any who haven't seen it.)  This SHOULD have been their A-list vehicle.  FOX not only COULD but SHOULD have had another Star Trek-caliber franchise on their hands but they were FAR too STUPID to grasp that.Aside from that, I don't know, but does ANYONE else think that spaceships should have LOCKS on the doors, or at least ones that are harder for invaders to access?

This disk has 14 great episodes that was slowly leading up to a clarity of what the whole series was about to become.....and then wham, it was cancelled by the FOX network, idiots!!  The last episode will basically leave you hanging for more episodes, but after watching all of these and then purchasing the movie afterwards called &#34;Serenity&#34; it will all come together, which I believe was the purpose of the movie.....to bring Firefly to its sad closure.  The music score of Firefly is IMO horrible, which is what probably brought the series to its demise.  I firmly believe if the Firefly music score was the same as the Serenity movie music score, the series would have survived.

Despite not initially airing the pilot episode which properly introduced the ensemble of 9 main characters, despite airing the engrossing continuing storyline out of order, despite frequent preemption for sports events, despite unfairly characterizing the show as ""cowboys in space"", despite cutting the series off before its three best episodes were left unaired, the twelve aired episodes are now an international fan-favorite classic TV series.  The series revolves around the hi-larious, heartbreaking adventures of the crew of the tramp freighter Serenity in the 2500s as they struggle to find their place in the (uni-)'verse after an interstellar civil war.  All fifteen filmed Firefly episodes, including three never aired in the U.S., are on this DVD along with a gag reel and many cast and crew provided interviews and extras.Despite Fox's unfortunate decision to cancel Firefly, the series lives on now in DVD, perhaps in a big-screen movie that is under serious development for 2004, and hopefully someday in additional Season Two future TV episodes.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A23ZK9JLWUO8JZ	Riot.Doll.Vomit.Heart.	"Firefly is yet another wondrous show created by the genius that is Joss Whedon and it's really a pity that it was canceled so early in its infancy.This program takes place in outer space during the year 2517 at a time when only two superpowers, The United States and China, have survived over the years. The plot focuses on a Firefly-class spaceship called Serenity and its crew, which consists of Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, Zoe Washburne, an old war buddy of Mal's, Hoban ""Wash"" Washburne, the ship's pilot and Zoe's husband, Inara Serra, a renowned Companion, Jayne Cobb, Kaylee Frye, the ship's mechanic, Shepherd Book, a pastor with a murky past, Dr. Simon Tam, and his sister, the mysterious River Tam. In order to survive they must do jobs, often illegal ones, for people all while hiding from a government agency looking to capture a certain passenger on board. Each action-packed heist will leave you begging for more. Not only are the episodes comedic and exciting, but the writing is top-notch and the characters are interesting and well-developed.Firefly was truly nothing short of brilliant. I own the complete series on DVD and have watched the episodes so often that I could probably quote every line back to you but it seems no matter how many times I see them I'm still on the edge of my seat.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AMLO7OVNCF68Q	R. Ivan Ross	The thing that separate's Joss Whedon's stuff from most other writers is the characters.Whether you are talking about Buffy, Toy Story or Firefly, the quality and the depth of the characters is what makes the material captivating.  Its certainly what separates the truly great TV series from the merely good.With Buffy, Joss got 7 seasons to develop his characters.  And they developed and evolved over time in response to their experiences - as they would if they were real.  He is never lazy - never resorts to radical shifts in personality to support a story line.  Witness the transformation of Willow over 7 seasons from nervous nerd to confident witch.And therein lies the greatest disappointment - our lost opportunity to get to know these great Firefly characters better.

We had no idea what it was, so we were in no hurry to watch it and it sat on the shelf a while. When we finally got to it, we watched it all in like two days. Each episode just sped on by, seemed like it lasted like five minutes. It was simply a crime to cancel this show and even more so not to even air all the episodes that were made. Of course, I had to have it for myself so it could be watched on a whim and repeatedly. Bought it on Amazon coz the price was shiny!	5.0	All TV should be done by Joss Whedon	2011-03-04	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1DZI34NWRPXWK	"R. Kaufman ""fonixmunkee"""	Ahh Firefly.  My favorite Josh Whedon series.  Something about it just grabs me...maybe the Western music, combined with sci-fi gun fights, in the melting pot of the new universe is just new and fresh.  Or maybe it's the comic relief sprinkled in between dramatic scenes.  Either way, I've been tracking this visually cool series for a BluRay release for months and months, and now I'm not let down.  I used to watch this series in standard definition, and now I know what I was missing with the BluRay version...there's a whole lot more in the frame than just the actors, and there's a lot more sound, too, with the BluRay version.

They claimed the series was not ""popular"" enough. HOOEY.Ratings and popularity are relative, considering it had a built-in insanely loyal fan base, thanks to Wheadon's previous series.The reasons it didn't get the (absurd) ratings FOX was demanding of it have NOTHING to do with the writing (which was excellent) the acting (nuanced and supurb), the directing (boundry-pushing and intriguging) or the storyline (absorbing). No. Instead, it had to do with FOX's *terrible* promotion (make it look incredibly juvinile...which isn't an easy thing to do) and placement in the Friday Night slot-of-death.The rapid sales of Firefly on DVD speak for themselves I think.Buy this series! Watch it! Love it!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3BJDFGSLXFB36	R. Legendre	"To be honest, I never watched Firefly when it aired on TV. I really don't watch network TV. In my humble opinion, television programming is dead (there are some exceptions). The trash the networks spout out these days seems to be nothing more than crude, rude, mindless ""entertainment"" (again, there are a few exceptions).A friend of mine recommended Firefly when it was first released on DVD. I was hesitant. I had tried other ""popular"" sci-fi shows on TV and I came away disappointed every time. I realize that many of these shows have a large fan base and I mean no disrespect to these people, but I just felt that these shows were garbage.Well, I finally rented disc one of the Firefly DVD set. After watching the first disc, I immediately returned it and didn't bother renting the second one. I simply ordered the entire boxed set.This is a thoughful, intelligent, entertaining, and character-driven show. The special effects are very good, the casting is superb, the dialougue is witty and intelligent, the stories are unique and fun, and even the costumes are brilliantly conceived!I instantly fell in love with the crew of Serenity and eagerly looked forward to each episode.This is a brilliant show!So, what does that mean?Well, the network executives will have to cancel it, of course!Yes, the series did suffer from low ratings, but after doing a bit of research, I found out that the network insisted on airing the episodes out of order. This lead to viewers not fully understanding what was going on since they were not aware of some of the ""back story"" and previous events that had happened to the characters.Well, that's a network executive all over; paid a rediculous salary to make really bad decisions for the general public. Where can I sign up for a job like that? (just kidding; I would never stoop so low).The DVD sales of the Firefly series speak for themselves. Had this show really been given a chance, it would still be on the air today regularly pulling in a sizable portion of ratings and the executives I bad-mouthed a moment ago would be lining their pockets with oodles of cash.....BUT AT LEAST THE VIEWING PUBLIC WOULD BE HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you like sci-fi, PLEASE check this show out. You will NOT be disappointed. The show itself is great, but so are the extra features (the gag reel is HILARIOUS!).If you LOVE sci-fi, just spend the money on the boxed set now and don't bother renting.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3MU5O1170B3LB	R. L. Frank	A lot of people say a movie or series is good or bad.  I'll just say I like it.  It is enjoyable and fun, while actually dealing with some serious issues.  I had never seen the series when it was on TV, but someone we knew told us it was really good, so when Amazon had the blu ray version as a deal of the day, I looked at the other reviews and figured, why not.  I'm glad I did.  I never expected to enjoy a space-western, but you can sit back, turn your brain off and just enjoy the unusual situations, the banter and action.  If I had to describe the series, I'd say it was Star Trek meets Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy meets Bonanza, but with a light, breezy feel to it.  The combination of characters is unique, as are the situations they find themselves in.  As I said in the title, it's fun!!!Considering that things filmed for TV don't always lend themselves to the the quality blu ray is capable of, this version has very good, but not necessarily great video characteristics.  The audio is extremely good.	5.0	It's Fun!!!	2011-05-23	3	2	1

But some were given the chance to succeed. Cheers was one. Star Trek tanked in the first season and only caught on only because the network gave it a chance to succeed, giving it two more seasons -- now it's a 'franchise.' Firefly is right up there with the best television that I've ever seen and I have to wonder what the suits at Fox were thinking or smoking (or not) to pull the plug on this one. This is some of the best writing and near-perfect ensemble casting that you will find. Edgey, witty, funny, very cool and all I can say is I am glad that Fox at least had the good sense to put this on DVD. This is brilliant stuff and all I'd say to its writer/director Joss Whedon is that Police Squad tanked on TV and went on to be a film monster with Leslie Nielsen bringing life to David Zucker's writing and directing. I hope the same fate awaits Joss Whedon -- he certainly deserves that kind of success.	5.0	C'mon Fox, you can't have missed what a great show this was.	2004-01-19	7	6	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AO7H7RBQXYHIQ	"R. Mark Munson ""javelinco"""	Firefly is just plain the best television show ever aired.  It's not a western, it's not sci-fi, it's not a drama, it's not a comedy.  It has elements of all of those, and more, but it is MORE, and therefore, hard to explain.So I ask you this - if you don't have this, if you never saw the series while it was on TV (or didn't like it when you did): beg, borrow or steal the PREMIERE (not the one called &quot;The Train Job&quot; - the two hour premiere that got aired as the last show), and WATCH IT.  I've had ten friends watch the premiere who either did not watch the show, or did and did not really care for it, and they are all now addicted to the show.If you think that is unfair since the show will never have any more episodes, I'll let you in on a not-so-secret: there is a script being written for a movie.  It'll be made if the DVD sells well enough.  And if the movie sells well enough?  Well, maybe they'll make a TV show out of it!WATCH THIS SHOW!	5.0	Best Television Show Ever Aired	2004-01-05	5	5	0

Sci-Fi seems a logical place for it) should do a simple poll.1) Have you seen Firefly?2) If yes, rate it 1 to 5 (1-ATROCIOUS, should have never been AIRED in the first place.....5-SPECIAL, should have never been CANCELED in the first place)I'm thinking....1) 90% What, you mean like a bug?10% God don't talk about that, it just breaks my.. wait, are they bringing it back??

I love Sci-Fi but am also very picky about what I watch with the limited time I have.  On a slow shift at work someone put in Firefly.  I noticed it was a ""Western Sci-Fi"" and after a couple minutes thought it was pretty mediocre.  Someone later brought in the movie, Serenity.  They ranted and raved about it...of course, they were Firefly fans so what do you expect?  I watched it.  Meh.  Not bad, just not very memorable, either.  ""Oh, but you need to watch the series to really appreciate it!""  I left it at that.Fast forward to over a year later.  I share things with my sig. other all the time, and she said it was time to share something with me. Firefly.  Firefly?  God no, anything but that!  She's even pickier about Sci-Fi than I am, and at this point I didn't have much of a choice but to sit down with an open mind.  She put in the episode ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" and said it was a great intro episode to get to know the characters, good story and some really classic moments.  The credits roll and I have to admit I was intrigued.  I really enjoyed it.  Was this the same series I wanted to blow off so many times before?  I still wasn't hooked, though.  Then we watch the first 3 episodes.We finished the series in a week.  I was the show's newest initiate, equally angry that Fox cancelled such a brilliant show.  Unfortunately it was probably because of those like me who never gave it a chance in the beginning.Oh I almost forgot.  Needless to say, after watching the series I wanted to see Serenity the movie again.  It was so forgettable to me the first time I hardly remembered any of it.  It was nothing like I remembered.  I loved it!  There are those who say to watch the movie first to get an idea of the show.  Do NOT watch the movie first.  Trust me, you'll be watching it with very different eyes.  It's not about the quality of the movie or seeing it with a fan's bias.  There's so much backstory, so much character development that you need to be aware of before going into the movie, that without watching the series first you're just skimming the surface and not seeing how much depth the movie really has.Off my personal experience, I would recommend showing ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" first if you want someone to get a really good impression of the characters, humor, devlopment, and just a fun story to start out with.Take a chance, and you'll be kicking yourself for not having watched it sooner."	5.0	Have to see to believe	2007-07-20	6	6	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25BYNY3CLEJ3G	Rob Chang	Joss Whedon is something of a living legend. He's got a career that makes a lot of people envious, including me. He gets to create compelling worlds inhabited by characters we care about, and he gets to do it on his terms (relatively speaking). On top of that, he's very gifted storyteller, and he keeps getting better.Firefly is the culmination of all of the knowledge, tricks, experience, and skill that he's learned in his career at that point, and it really shows. Firefly has an impeccable ensemble cast, tight writing and directing, and a very creative premise. The chemistry and dynamics between the ensemble cast is what makes Firefly shine. The kind of magic Firefly radiates transcends its science-fiction roots, and secures a place in the history of television as one of the finest TV shows ever created. It's not a surprise that such a fine show got canceled so quickly; we've seen this kind of thing happen before (remember My So-Called Life?). Idiotic shows that appeal to the lowest common denominator stay on the air for years, while a masterpiece like Firefly gets canceled before reaching the end of one season.

The chemistry between the cast within the first few episodes rivals any of the Star Trek casts' even several seasons in.  Joss Whedon and the other writers did a wonderful job of blending a heroic western action-show with a futuristic sci-fi show while still making the characters realistic, flawed, yet likeable and easy to relate to.

Joss Whedon tells about the changes the network was always pushing for with the show and despite his efforts to appease them, they cancel it anyway. How come all the good shows die young? About a decade ago, about the only show I would watch on TV was the wonderfully entertaining Brisco County, Jr. (also quickly cancelled by Fox). Like Firefly, it had stand alone episodes, but a steadily advancing plot with reoccurring characters, and was marvelous.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	Well,I may have missed the initial party,but it's never too late to become a Browncoat.I am proudly displaying my Browncoat beside the suits of The Federation,Earth Alliance and the Commonwealth(I will let you savvy TV Sci Fi fans figure out which show belongs to what suit!).This Joss Whedon treasure is as surefire winner,from the brilliant writing to the direction to the wonderful ensemble cast,as any of the aforementioned shows were.The only difference between those and this show is this one was cut off in its prime.After only 11 eps(including the 2 hour pilot) the show faded to black.Three shows were filmed and left unaired,but have thankfully found a home in this set.Star Trek was originally compared to being a Wagon Train-like show set in the future.Well Firefly takes the Wagon Train element and brings it more literally to life than Star trek ever did.There are horses,wagons,six shooters,rifles,cattle,cowboys;all the things a good western needs and more.The shows premise harkens back to the US Civil War where the Union fought the Confederacy,here referred to as the Alliance against the Independents.The lead characters consider themselves all members of the latter.The Firefly class ship(it actually is reminiscent of said insect)is called Serenity,so named after the famous battle of Serenity Valley which two of the lead characters fought through and barely survived.It was the battle that ended the war between the two factions.The ship and crew now do odd jobs for odd characters,going where the pay takes them and generally trying to steer clear of the Alliance.What sets this Sci Fi series apart from its competitors is the decided lack of aliens.This series focuses more on the human factor;that is our own progression out into the galaxy and our colonization of it.Goodness knows there is enough writing fodder to be had concentrating solely on humans,without having to add the alien dynamic into the mix.And Joss Whedon successfully does just that.The cast was a dream cast.Everything gelled perfectly.They were:Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds,Gina Torres as Zoe,Alan Tudyk as Wash,Morena Baccarin as Innara,Adam Baldwin as Jayne,Jewel Staite as Kaylee,Sean Maher as the Dr Tam,Summer Glau as River and finally Ron Glass as Book.Glass is well known from Barney Miller and Gina Torres is one of my fave kick butt-type characters from Xena,Hercules and Cleopatra 2020.The characters were brought vividly to life by each actor,and each had their own back story to tell,which fleshed out the entire feel of the show.The entire set of eps in this DVD set are in w/s format,clear and crisp for the most part,and there are oodles of extras for all those dedicated Browncoats out there such as:a featurette on the making of the series,the ship,deleted scenes,a gag reel,and more.I never saw the original series in its original airing(the only one out of the aforementioned others-if you have successfully guessed by now which ones they are-I didn't).But I heard alot about it and its' premature demise.The first thing I ever saw of Firefly was the movie Serenity(see my review on that)and loved it.I did not know then about the back story but now having viewed the original series,it all comes beautifully into focus.This set of four single sided discs is da bomb,believe me.This series will show you what intelligent TV writing can do and Whedon is to commended for his vision on this project.Whedon killed off some of the shows characters in the movie but there is no reason a renewed series couldn't just pick up where the original left off,with all the same people and have the movie as the final fade out of the series once it is done.But that takes vision and guts on the part of TV execs,which unfortunately is sadly lacking when they see shows that don't neatly fit within their prescribed parameters.Well,the ever swelling ranks of Browncoats just added one more enthusiastic member.I urge you to buy this set and guarantee after you watch it,you will be joining up too!	5.0	Am I too late for the party?	2012-09-15	3	3	0

We're 59 years old and not great fans of Sci-fi, or westerns either for that matter.  He instructed us to watch the background information (&quot;The way it was&quot;) on disc 4 first, then start with &quot;Serenity&quot;, as that was the way the creators had intended it to be, not the inside out, backwards way it was aired on Fox.I was blown away!!!This series has it all:  great stories, great screenplays, great sets, great photography, great music, great actors, great effects (not done just for the sake of effects), and, last but certainly not least, a sense of humor.Fox didn't deserve this series.  The series deserves much better!  I hope soneone in Media will recognize that this is a gem and bring it back.My wife and I have enjoyed every episode so far.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3N4L472F8E2WP	"Robert Cardinalli ""cosmically-psychic-bob"""	Tired plots, over-acting, and a story arc that never got off the ground consigned this western to the TV graveyard in record time.I watched the first two heavy-handed episodes and I was not impressed. The story-lines were predictable--if not recycled. The action was sparse. The characters were trying so hard to be mysterious that they were uninteresting. What did impress me was how slow paced this show was. It was boring. Very little happened and when something did, it was not pulled off in an exciting way.This show wasn't canceled out-of-hand. It was canceled because it couldn't generate interest.I did like the cast though, and the production values, so I'm giving it two stars.	2.0	Probably the slowest western I've ever seen...	2004-09-25	126	17	109
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38HPOA0XAAA2T	Robert C Capps	There's little I could say that hasn't already been said by the growing legion of fans of this network war-orphan, this crazy genre-hybrid of Sci-Fi, Western, hour-long action-drama and sit-com. It's got a little of everything, an appeal to everyone.I gave it full marks, even tho it's not perfect. It is rather a diamond in the rough, whose polishing and cutting were ended prematurely. At its worst, it was still better written, acted, and produced than most anything else I've EVER seen on network TV.At its best, it became (in only 11 aired episodes) a world and a family you'll want to revisit again and again.Buy it. Watch it (in the right order).

I think it has a lot to do with the pilot &quot;Origins&quot; episode coming first, rather that at the end of the season on TV.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3LEQTK4C44RN8	Robert E. Woodham	This show is something that will simultaneously stretch and engage your mind. There are many scenes of aesthetic beauty, heroism, and a gripping plot that guides this odd space family along on their journeys through barely travelled frontier of space. Whereas Buffy and to a lesser degree Angel were tied down to the moribund, overly familiar specifics of everyday life on earth, Firefly has no such artistic shackles and is able to fly as independent and freely as Captain Malcom Reynolds, its soaring voyages only restricted by the depths of the writers&#8217; imagination.Prepare for one of the shortest, sweetest, and tragically curtailed epics of the 21st century. And don&#8217;t forget to watch Serenity for the final act of this dramatic, genre-breaking show.	5.0	Aestethically Beautiful, Strikingly Original Television	2013-08-15	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2HB2TU6OQE2PJ	"Robert Hoover ""Art Lover"""	I had become rather bored with TV space opera ever since the originasl Star Trek left the air. Over the years Space Opera on TV  had turned into a kind of Soap Trek from my perspective - boring stuff --I didn't want to live there.It seemed like the future of endless possibilities that the original series had opened up had evolved into a kind of a soap opera: tied, duck taped and bound  by all the previous plots -- nothing new and too much starch and stretch in the uniforms. Then along comes Firefly to the rescue and opens up a whole new view and bunch of realistic possibilities on what our future could be like - why not horses, cattle and settlers - makes perfect sense -- don't it?It's a beautiful work of art tain't no use in complaining about there only being 14 episodes - better to praise what's been done. When your eating an ice cream cone don't complain the whole time that is is disappearing- just enjoy it.	5.0	A Sci Fi future I could live in at last	2007-05-11	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2WCS90KU2NFQB	Robert Hughes	"What's Good:- If you like sci-fi, you should love this.  My wife is not a sci-fi fan and while she probably won't admit to liking it, everytime I watch it and she happens to be watching too, she seems engrossed in the story, asks questions and I catch her laughing at times as well.- The characters are very interesting, each of them are believable and each have their own secrets waiting to be known.  You learn more with each episode.- It's story best if watched in order.  There is an overall story being told as well as a seperate story for each episode.  You are left with a feeling of accomplishment, that something happened and something was resolved with each episode while the larger story continues.- A space adventure mixed with old western flair... not sure how they did it, but they did and it works very well.- No sound in space.  Yes, I deem this a good thing.  There is no sound in space.  A ship flying by doesn't whine, you can't hear rockets from space because sound can't travel in space.  This is the first show that I have ever seen on TV (2001: A Space Odyssey I believe also didn't play sounds which gave it that creepy eerie feeling) where you don't hear any sounds.  Instead they play background music gives it a real sense of openess, endlessness... space.- I'm actually looking foward to watching the DVD from start to finish again when it arrives and I'll probably put together a ""shindig"" of my own at my work to show other people this great series.What's not so good:First and foremost, the series was cancelled before it was fully aired by Fox.  The story is incomplete.  Hopefully, the movie will fix that but I'm interested in knowing how they're going to pull off the movie with all the background information we already know from the series and draw in people that never watched the series.Last but not least, the series was cancelled before it was fully aired by Fox.More information if you care to read further:Will you believe that I never heard of this show before about 1 month ago (July '05) when I saw an add for the pilot on the SciFi channel?  It's not too surprising, as I have 3 young children and really didn't watch much TV.  But thanks to DVR I've been opened up to a new world of TV shows that I love, such as Lost, 24, Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis and the new Battlestar Galactica.The last few mentioned are aired on the Sci-Fi channel which is how I noticed a commercial for the pilot of Firefly.  At first I didn't know it was a 3 year old show and it looked interesting.  I tried watching some of the other shows on the sci-fi channel but I guess I'm just not a true enough fanatatic as most of the other ""original"" shows are just plain painful for me to watch... bad acting, bad plot, bad everything...  So I didn't have high hopes for Firefly at first.  But then I learned it was going to be a series so that probably means it must be decent or they wouldn't be able to get past the first show.  So I gave it a try.Serenity Part 1 - I thought it was decent.  I wasn't in love with it and wasn't sure I was going to add it to my DVR recordings but I'd give Serenity Part 2 a shot.Serenity Part 2 - Holy Smokes that was good.  I figured out that part 1 was just kind of like an introduction to the characters... it really is 1 show split into 2 on the sci-fi channel.  The 2nd part blew me away.  But could it sustain that?I watched the next episode called ""Train Job"" and I was hooked for good.  But a sad thing happened.  My DVR for some reason didn't record the show called Bushwacked and I missed it.  I was very upset.  But then I found out that it was being re-aired from Fox from a few years ago... could it be available on DVD to rent?  YES!  I was a happy man.  Not to mention the picture was much better on my plasma screen.  Now, I've watched all but the final DVD which I'll remedy immediately.I'm so impressed with this show, that this was the very first TV series on DVD that I have ever purchased and the first thing on Amazon that I have ever reviewed.  It's probably one of the only shows (including all of those I mentioned above) that I would be willing to watch over and over again.And now I find out they're making a movie!  I thought I was happy before, this is just down-right amazing.  But did I heard sounds (not just music) in the space scenes in the movie trailer?I have no idea how this series was ever cancelled after just 1 year (or was it less than 1 year) of shows.  It just doesn't make sense.  Fox must have really screwed something up to allow that to happen."	5.0	Amazingingly Brilliant and Refreshing	2005-08-30	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2WKBUQUL5K6OD	Robert J. Anderson	This is the series that made me stop watching television programming. When Firefly debuted, I watched it with interest, then amusement, then revelation, then awe. This is what t.v could be. This is respect for the audience that could be prevalent in the genre. As everyone is aware, however, what we (the American Public) actually receive over the airwaves is trivial pap, trite and predictable garbage.Firefly was different. Breathtaking, whimsical, honest and raw, it offered itself up as entertainment without apologies for its excellence.When it was cancelled, I refused to be gulled by the networks again. I refused to form an attachment for a t.v. product only to have it snatched away because the chewing-gum-popping, vapid, American Idol-and-Survivor-adoring lunks (that apparently comprise the Neilsen audience) don't understand that there is no sound in a vacuum. That don't understand what it means to have a show about PEOPLE and not whoosh-and-bang special effects.I'm done. Buy this DVD.

The creators made this series futuristic while still holding onto present day roots. People carried guns, with metal bullets, there was crime in the streets, and a crew had to do whatever they could to work to the next paycheck. Picking up a few interesting characters along the way made this a great series that was cut short.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"If one ever had cause to doubt the wisdom of those in charge at FOX and are unfamiliar with the absurdly short-lived series FIREFLY, just watch these CDs and have your worst fears confirmed.  There seems to be an ongoing and massive disconnect between what is great on TV and what is fopped off to the public in primetime.  FIREFLY never really got a chance, though based on the few episodes that made it onto the airways, it most probably was going to go down as the finest Sci-fi series since STAR TREK: NEXT GENERATION.  It had a depth and complexity and potential for development that never really got developed.  One can only speculate about how good the series would have gotten, but some idea might be derived by considering producer Joss Whedon's two other series:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL.  Neither of those shows, as great as they were, was especially great in their first season.  BUFFY was short budgeted, and Whedon was still learning how to make a TV series after a lifetime of working strictly as a writer.  ANGEL was trying to find its own identify after breaking Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley out of Sunnydale, but by the second season it managed to find its own magnificent, if quite dark, identity.  FIREFLY was excellent from the get-go, but how much better might it have become had Whedon and Tim Minear had time to develop it?Nearly everything about this series stands out.  The special effects are without much competition the most outstanding I have ever seen on TV, most of it the result of CGI scripting rather than modeling, though models are used as well.  Just how spectacular the effects could be could be seen early on, in the episode ""The Train.""  The Serenity, the space freighter used by the show's protagonists, soars down over a hyper speed freight train and hovers over it while one of the crew is lowered on a rope to one of the cars, where two other crewmembers have extracted cargo for the purposes of theft.  The sequence is simply stunning, even by feature film standards.  Luckily, there is more to FIREFLY than special effects.  One can't conceive a Joss Whedon show without great writing and a complete eschewal of the hackneyed and stereotypical.  Whedon is the finest chain puller in the history of TV writing, and just when you think a show is becoming predictable, the entire storyline will shift into completely original and sometimes shocking terrain.  Whedon is also a master at both short and long-range story arcs, and thanks to the brain trust at FOX, we didn't get to experience the long-range story arcs.The cast is absolutely first rate, and one of the great tragedies in the show ending as quickly as it did was losing the opportunity to get to know these folks better.  Just as the relations between the cast members were getting really interesting (another hallmark of a Whedon production), FOX pulled the plug.  Nathan Fillion showed that he had the presence to be a charismatic lead character as Captain Mal Reynolds, former fighter against the federation on the side of the Independents, now a rogue who takes on all kinds of odd jobs, as long as it never hurts everyday folk.  Gina Torres is a familiar face from movies like THE MATRIX RELOADED and guesting on TV shows like ANGEL, HERCULES, and ALIAS, and was great here as the ship's number two, with Alan Tudyk playing her slightly under-her-thumb (in a cute way) husband and ship pilot.  Adam Baldwin is great as Cobb, the ship's resident tough guy and muscle.  The incredibly stunning Marena Baccarin plays Inara Serra, a registered Companion (i.e., a very high-class prostitute along the lines of accomplished, educated, sophisticated courtesans) who is clearly in love with Reynolds despite her coolness.  Her role is remarkable in that she is not portrayed as being at all sleazy.  In fact, she is the ship's most respected passenger, being treated with inordinate deference wherever they travel.  Jewel Staite is Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, and Ron Glass the ship's chaplain.  He describes his role as that of giving guidance in an area where things are often confused and lacking in moral order.  Finally, the crew is rounded out by Sean Maher, who plays the ship's doctor, and Summer Glau, who plays his mysteriously gifted sister River, who is desperately sought by the Alliance.  Clearly River was the character who would have caused some of the most interesting plot developments had the series continued.Fans of FIREFLY have had in recent months two great pieces of good news.  The first is that not only the episodes originally shown on FOX will be shown on these DVDs, but three previously unseen episodes.  The latter along would justify the cost of the discs.  But recently we have had what is potentially an even greater piece of news:  Joss Whedon's next major project is going to be a full length feature film of FIREFLY, and he hopes to bring the entire cast of the TV show into the film.  Of course, this creates fantasies of the show being revived on a different television network.  But at the very least, it means that we have the DVDs of this great, great series and a forthcoming film to help us over our hurt."	5.0	Monument to one of the FOX's worst decisions ever	2003-09-21	36	27	9

""Firefly"" combined the best elements of the Western and science fiction shows--creative story-telling, wonderful, believable characters, and a sense of humor! Add to that one of the best ensemble casts since ""Hill Street Blues"" (Note: when is that show going to make it to DVD??) and you have a really terrific series. It certainly should have gotten better treatment from the Fox network--evidently Rupert Murdoch and his merry band thought that ""Joe Millionaire"" was more intellectually stimulating entertainment! Well, this is the same group that sued Al Franken over ""fair and balanced"", so what else could we expect? At any rate, it's great to be able to enjoy ""Firefly"" again--especially, the ""lost"" episodes and the interesting audio commentary.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2SW9VPZM1H00H	"Roger Curry ""SRC"""	Firefly is a wonderful show, unique in many ways. It blends sci-fi with old west themes in a way that really works. While the frontier planets have some technology, they still depend on riding horses and such. The character ensemble is a perfect blend of unique and often conflicting personalities, well developed, and each one makes the viewer care for them, despite their flaws. All the rich character development is revealed as the stories unfold, very organically and naturally. Even people who aren't sci-fi fans will tell you that Firefly is a great viewing experience. By the time you've seen all the episodes, you will wish there was more to watch. While there is the Serenity film to follow up this series, it only provides a bittersweet goodbye to a show that deserved more than one season.	5.0	Gone too soon!	2014-02-09	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38SU3AYL8IBYH	Rolandus	When I first watched this show a few years back, I was annoyed by some of the acting, but I loved the premise of the &#34;Space Western&#34; and I thought it was handled very well by the creators. Still, at the time, I would have given it 3.5 stars because it can definitely be a little hokey, though seldom recycled. Since then, I've realized that I get more out of the show every time I watch it, due mostly to the excellent writing and the novelty of the reverse-steampunk setting.In my opinion, the final episode (Objects in Space) is a standalone science fiction classic capable of holding up against any sci-fi short story I've ever read, due to its emphasis on existential topics and its introspective, slightly creepy and very claustrophobic presentation.It's such a shame that Firefly had to be so short lived, but I believe the short run makes it that much sweeter and is a good compliment to the poignant atmosphere of the story.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AR563YB2QH5VT	Ron22	If I were about to pan a series here and give it one star as a few have done (in contrast to overwhelming evidence to the contrary), I might want to humbly re-examine my view.Although Firefly didn't even run a complete season, it generated a fan base like no other TV series. (500,000 boxed sets from Amazon, 10 books, and a fan base that kept growing for more than two years after the series was abruptly canceled by FOX).Low ratings?  Yes, but clearly a great case can be made that FOX intentionally sabotaged the series (a long story).The people here are pretty sophisticated in general.  But I wonder about some of the people that panned the series, especially when at the same time they lauded a TV series featuring puppets and apparently targeting kids. I also wonder if many of the people that panned Firefly didn't have hidden puritanical motivations that they didn't want to admit.No, Firefly is not _War and Peace_, it wasn't meant to be.  It is simply light, engaging entertainment that was very well done.  For that I give it 5 stars.	5.0	500,000 copies, 99% 5-stars, 10 books!	2010-05-15	6	3	3
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2N2GAB8P9830L	Ronald Belton	"Like alot of people I came to the ""Firefly"" universe by way of the movie ""Senerity"". I read a glowing review of the movie by sci-fi author Orson Scott Card, and when I realized it was a Joss Whedon project I had to see it. I loved the movie so much I started watching ""Firefly"" reruns on the Sci-Fi network when I could. Of course I was already a huge fan of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" so I thought ""Firefly"" couldn't be too bad. It was Great! It's like a great western but in space. However, since I'm reviewing the dvd and not just the series I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5. The dvd is supposed to contain optional audio commentary by Joss Whedon and the cast on certain episodes. My copy did not contain the audio commentary despite the fact it said so on the box.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A39V0XDYGNS3X4	Ronald Clark	Look, I bought the complete series after seeing two episodes for about $30 - it was some of the best money I ever spent.  My wife and I are hooked. Knowing what I know now I would have paid six times that.  Ounce for ounce this is some of the best writing I have seen in years.  The stories are deep and immersive.  The characters bring so many levels to the series there just no place to start.  Hearing of the shows cancelation was a very sad moment indeed. Lately, it seems that studios just slap a new paint job on the same old sci-fi or worse it's some stupid reality show. I hope the studios will at least read all the feedback here and take notice - people want quality with their Sci-Fi.p.s. saw the movie  - also pure gold.  Beat the hell out of that last Star Wars movie.	5.0	Pure Gold	2005-11-21	7	7	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ACNKTKZ1YYN3S	Ronald Claypool	&quot;Firefly&quot; is simply the best, most entertaining sci-fi series I have ever seen! (And I've seen a lot of them.) Get it - watch it - love it!The only thing wrong with it was its extremely short life, thanks to Fox, who scheduled an expensive show in a timeslot (Fridays at 8) that couldn't hope to pay for it.	5.0	I'll keep it simple...	2003-12-16	2	1	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1U7ULFMM0PR6H	Ronald Cruz	I've only seen 9 episodes on this DVD set so far, and I must now join the chorus of hisses and boos at FOX for cancelling this brilliant show.This has Whedon doing what he did with Buffy: set up an imaginative, exciting world (magic and monsters with Buffy, the far future with Firefly) and populate it with three-dimensional characters with real-world feelings you can relate with, and set up complex, evolving, and surprising plot arcs.Just saw &quot;Out of Gas&quot; and it uses a clever story structure and plays with time to simultaneously create a real sense of doom, horror, AND mystery, all while narrating the current story, describing the history of how Serenity's crew formed, deepening our sense of each member of the ship, and showing the captain's love for his ship and crew... AMAZING!Like Buffy, this show is exciting to watch because it experiments, all while still remaining entertaining and staying true to its characters. This show will appeal to non-sci fi fans, and though I love other sci fi, Firefly makes other sci-fi shows relatively contrived and amateurish.I will watch the movie in 2005 and join the rabid fans demanding this get picked up on TV again!

Countless reviews have been posted on what a great show this is, and let me say that it's all true. I was worried at first because so many reviewers were Buffy fans. A show I could not stand. Thankfully I went ahead and bought it anyway! Here are a few things that I thought elevated this show to the next level...Special Effects- The best I've seen on TV. The effects are used sparingly but to great effect and realism. Characters- This series proves that Sci-Fi can be entertaining using human characters while not having to rely on aliens for interesting interactions. Sexual tension and human greed create more than enough drama when written well. The Firefly universe- Brings a mix of many styles together creating a unique look and feel. The old west, Asian influences and futuristic backdrops are all interwoven for a rich visual palette. If your on the fence about getting this dvd, just get it. It's smart, funny and at times shocking! It's such a refreshing change from the Sci-Fi mainstream.	4.0	Simply sweet...	2003-12-28	1	1	0

I bought the series after seeing the movie ""Serenity"", and came to appreciate how truly good it was. I'm not a fan of Buffy, and maybe saw most of an episode of Angle; I'm still not particularly impressed with either. But Josh Whedon and crew hit a homer with this series. It has interesting, engaging and well developed characters, as well as well developed stories.As far as comparing the movie Serenity with the TV series, it depends on what you like.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1RSVJWLI1BBIS	Roy Batty	After 190 or so reviews, this one is most likely redundant. However consider another my vote for the excellent quality of the show and its eventual continuation as a TV series.  I have never seen an aired episode, (don't watch broadcast or cable).  I just received the DVD set and watched all 4 disks set over the last 3 days - it was that good.Joss Whedon has clearly captured the sense of &quot;being there&quot; which he set out to accomplish.  The dialog is smartly written, relevant to the episode and rarely fails to please.  Comic relief, usually in the form of trademark one liners, is sparingly applied.  The cast works well together, is believable  and is very attractive.The blend of sets and CGI is effective and the camerawork, especially the jerky handheld feel that characterizes the CGI shots, works to create added realism.I imagine the special features will please even the die hard fans.  The gag reel is a rare gift that is too often left on the editing room floor.Word's out that a Firefly feature film is in the works.  Let us hope it spawns the continuation of the series.RoyPS.

Fox has made and then canceled more popular TV shows then any other network that has ever, or will ever exist on this planet!Firefly in my opinion is one of the best television shows ever made.

The next thing that I knew , &quot;Oh look, it's canceled!&quot;, which is something that  I have said way to many times!I don't think it was really given a full chance.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3SEBD6PQTWN1C	RR	"There are times when you see a movie or tv show or read a book and you just know - just know - that you've enjoyed an experience that you don't want to end.  You don't want to leave the theater or you rush back to the book store hoping that there are other volumes on the shelf.  And on occasion, a TV show grabs you and makes you look forward to the next show. ""Firefly"" is such a tv show.Fox has been praised for its creativity, its determination to bring different programming to the small screen and quite often, it's ability to see greatness even if the audience takes a little while to come around. Then, there are the times that they act just like the other big networks and pull the plug when the ratings haven't been the best.Firefly grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  From the haunting theme song to the characters that were so complex and had so much promise, I just knew that once the audience was found, the show would last for several seasons.  Alas, Fox was nearsighted and cancelled what should have been one of the greatest Sci-Fi shows in TV history.  Am I over the top in my praise?  No.  The show had a humanity and a depth that was far better than anything else on the screen.  There were so many future stories to tell and so many ways Serenity and her crew could have travelled the stars.Buy this DVD set.  Show it to your friends and family.  Within the first few episodes you'll be hooked.  You'll care about each one of the characters and wonder how their stories will evolve.  You'll enjoy the humor and wit along with the twists and turns in the plotlines.  And then, when you put the final disk on your player, you'll feel a little bit sad and angry that nearsighted executives took this wonderful, wonderful drama away from you.Lastly, this series is one that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.

Fox, as usual, had something wonderful on their hands, and managed to scew things up, which is a trademark of theirs. Even this single season is able to stand on it's own, with remarkable visuals and an outstanding cast. Give Joss Whedon credit, he always finds amazing actors, even for background and single-line guest stars. His direction is, as always, brilliant, and right on the money.

Yes, I am a serious science fiction aficionado (mostly books), but I don't watch broadcast television.  So Serenity was a new story to me.  Great movie!  But then I learned that it was based on... Firefly?""What's that?"" I asked.""Serenity,"" was the reply.So I finally got around to experiencing Firefly, the complete ""incomplete"" collection.  The show was canceled during its first season, so this collection even has three episodes that weren't broadcast.  Now I know what ""Serenity"" means.  As far as the ""American space western television series,"" you don't get this flavor in Serenity, but it is there in Firefly.So I've watched Serenity, the movie.  Now I've finished Firefly, the series.  And next?  What else?  Serenity, the movie, again!Ah, anticipation...Firefly is not an ""in your face"" series that makes everything clear in the first episode.  What WAS Shepherd's story?  How was River going to be ""outed"" in the series?  Does Jayne ever think of a person other than himself?

It seamlessly blends Western and Science Fiction elements into one cohesive whole, adding into the mix deep characters and more wit than your average sitcom - in an hour long drama series.One of the problems leading to its demise was the difficulty of marketing such a show; most who enjoy Westerns do not enjoy Science Fiction, and vice-versa.  But in this case, it just works, for both parties.  It's a shame neither gave it enough of the chance for it to survive FOX's mishandling of the series.But now we have the DVD set.  All 14 episodes including those never aired are contained within this package.  Not only that, but this set is cram-packed with enough special features to last you almost as long as the episodes themselves.  With this and a full theatrical motion picture on the horizon, Firefly is far from over.And even if you're not a fan of the show, now is the time to give it a try.  It was, plain and simple, one of the best shows aired on TV in recent times.  It, in this reviewer's humble opinion, surpassed even Joss Whedon's other creations, with higher believability, better characters, and wittier dialogue.  The dialogue, in fact, has not yet been matched by any show I have ever seen - and I've seen a few.If you're a Firefly fan, buy this box set.

While Nathan Fillion makes this show great, he is supported by a fantastic cast including Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin and Jewel Staite all giving stellar performances. You will notice not just the quality of dialog and acting, but also the set design and musical score. Joss Whedon has created a beautiful believable world, with good and bad. This isn't a dsytopian or utopian future, but rather a future that feels natural. The Alliance, while portrayed as essentially as 'the enemy' isn't all bad: it's a group of people who genuinely believe in what they're fighting for, and try to do the right thing (see first episode and the third episode. This just adds to the believability of the world Firefly is set in. Lastly, the attention to detail is fantastic. For example, notice how Mal (Fillion) loses the crucifix pendant after saying that God won't let them die because they're too pretty. Watch this show.	5.0	The best written TV show I have seen	2012-07-18	0	0	0

I went to the first panel and along with 3,000 others Q&A;'d with the Cast and got to watch a preview of the movie.  I was hooked then and there.Firefly is THE most unique, and I mean that in a great way, tv show to come to the small screen in many years.  All I can say that hasn't already been said, or maybe it has, is you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD set!  If you own no other, this is the one you need.Watch the episodes, the way they were meant to be seen, many times.

When I see the mindless junk on TV today, it seems insane for Fox to have treated Joss Whedon's Firefly the way they did. It seems that the Fox executive who made the decision to reject the original pilot, show the episodes out of order, and then cancel the series was a Hwoon dahn. Firefly has grown to be unstoppable. The show is simply awesome. After watching the last episode on the fourth disc, I wanted more. I now have this empty space in me that only more of the Firefly verse can fill. This show could easily have made 7 seasons worth of great episodes. Fans of Firefly see the awesome potential that this show had and still has. I love Firefly and Serenity the movie.Here's my plea to Joss and any network or studio:Please bring Firefly back! Or at least make another movie. Personally I would rather have the TV show back. What would it take to bring it back?""May not have been the winning side. Still not convinced it was the wrong one."""	5.0	"""We've done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."""	2007-03-11	3	3	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1RC7W0ZHJIJZW	R. Sundquist	"I've given it some thought, and after rewatching the pilot episode recently I've decided exactly what it is that I dislike about this show. Apparently it's a hugely popular show, despite only lasting for a single short season, and I think it's necessary to provide a counterpoint to all the glowing reviews hailing it as the best show ever.First, genre. ""Firefly"" is squarely an action-adventure series. Despite being set in the future, there is nothing particularly futuristic about any of the technology. There is also very little science fiction besides the arbitrary inclusion of a spaceship. Conflicts are generally resolved with gunfights, and the main ship itself is so comfy that one never really gets the idea that the crew are living in it. This approach avoids both the technical/scientific tropes common to the SF genre (time travel, aliens, black holes, etc) as well as the character-driven conflicts of mainstream drama (to which one can add ""Battlestar Galactica"", essentially a drama in space). Instead, ""Firefly"" is a Western, wholly content to live by the restrictions of that genre. Replace the spaceship with a riverboat, covered wagon, or Winnebago, and you'd have basically the same result. If there's no good reason for it to be set in space, then it shouldn't be set in space.Second, characters. Joss Whedon created and wrote the classic ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"", a clever genre show about teenagers. Perhaps it's because he's so accustomed to writing for teenagers that he doesn't really know how to write for adults, and as a result none of the characters in ""Firefly"" act their age. The relationships among the cast, as well as their behavior and emotions, are all appropriate for teenagers, who are no doubt the target audience. They tend to be selfish, sulky, and snarky, like your average sixteen-year-old. I'll admit that most SF shows have only simple characterization at the best of times, but this is just another example of ""Firefly"" aiming low. Rather than complex, dynamic and sympathetic characters, its cast consists of shallow stereotypes, all carefully distinguished by their various pulpy eccentricities.Third, setting. ""Firefly"" is a Space Western, or a Western (In Space!), and that gimmick drives the design, the dialogue, and most of the plotting. It is also totally contrived and silly. The supposedly witty and clever dialogue is delivered in a made-up dialect that renders it stilted and artificial. Planets look like Southern California, weapons look like Colt revolvers and Winchester rifles, and the captain wears suspenders. Therefore any attempt to make the show realistic or believable on any level is completely undermined. To top it off, the theme song is incredibly irritating (the singer even has a lisp), and the incidental music consists solely of steel guitar. Moreover, the whole show is presented to us with a sort of smug aura about it, as if the producers were really proud of themselves for coming up with this hackneyed old idea.At only thirteen episodes or so, ""Firefly"" never really had a chance to take off and develop anything. Maybe by the third season it could have been good; obviously it never got that far. But it never really tries anyway, and even the pilot episode fails to create any sort of excitement or tension. After watching it, I felt no desire to continue with the rest of the episodes to find out what happens. The only thing to recommend it are the visual effects, but the studio that created them moved on to ""Battlestar"", which was a more successful show in every way."	2.0	See You, Space Cowboy...	2010-01-08	50	22	28

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A25FMU5DW9HZVR	"rueyeet ""rueyeet"""	"I've never found it in me to care much about Buffy or Angel, so when my neighbor invited me to watch Firefly, a cancelled sci-fi/western series by the same guy, I wasn't enthused.  By the first ten minutes, though, I was hooked....and after seeing the whole series only twice, I want to own it.I've read through the few negative reviews posted here.  A few people just seem to hate Joss Whedon and anything he's ever made;  others seem to suffer from the preconception that sci-fi has to look and behave like the other series they've seen.A major beef seems to be the Old West look of much of Firefly.  Personally, I find the mix of low- and high-tech completely believable.  It IS noted in the series, however briefly, that the Alliance is prone to dumping settlers on new planets with only the barest minimum of supplies.  When the series visits the Core worlds of the Alliance, though, the technology is everything you'd expect of a futuristic society.  In the Core, you have the clean, fancy cities and laser guns and whatever else;  and out in the colonies, you have whatever spare parts and table scraps people were left with...and that's where the crew of the Serenity happen to be spending most of their time.  It's very much a haves/have-nots situation, which I don't see the passage of a few centuries doing much to alter, honestly.Some of the other reviewers object to the lack of aliens in the series (one even goes so far as to list this as one of the ways Firefly takes the ""science"" out of sci-fi....I wasn't aware the existence of alien life was scientifically proven).  To me, this is utterly refreshing.  Come on, look at any of the Star Treks, or Farscape, or Babylon 5:  most of the ""aliens"" are mostly humanoid types with lots of latex molds and paint.  I mean, sure, I like Farscape and B5 as much as the next fan, but really--what are the odds that the universe could generate that many species who look SO much like us?  In a way, the prevalence of aliens in every other series makes Firefly very original for asking the question:  What if we ARE alone in the universe?In the end, the reason that Firefly doesn't set up a society that's all that much different from our current one, and stays away from the latex-headed aliens, is that it's about people.  Specifically, about a group of people who couldn't have more different backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences, all of whom are crammed into one tiny little ship and asked to live together--or maybe just put up with each other--for a long, long time.  The interplay between the characters, and the effects their adventures have on them, are the real story here.If you can't get past the intrusion of Old West archetypes into your sci-fi, or the lack of the same old genre conventions that every other sci-fi show does to death, then....well, I'll let Mal and Zoe say it for me.Mal : You are very much lacking in imagination.Zo : I imagine that's so, sir.As for the rest of you....see you at the movie!  :)"	5.0	No, it's not Star Trek/Farscape/Bab5/Buffy/Angel.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3AGPECN7USEDA	Rusir-10	Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this show was going to be a little silly and cheesy.  I didn't even watch it when Fox briefly aired it.  Of course, that's not surprising since Fox decided that Friday at 8 or 9 pm (I can't remember which) would be the best time to launch the series (somehow I don't think the prime demographic for this show is home watching TV on Friday nights!)Enough complaining about Fox, I'm just bitter because there won't be a second season.  Which is a real shame because this is a fun show.  I'm assuming you have a passing interest in Sci Fi or you wouldn't even be considering this series, and given that interest I think you'll really like this show.The characters are varied with each of them having a significant role.  There are some stereotypical characters - the Captain for instance, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  There's a certain comfort in watching the outwardly surly and mercenary Captain stick by his honor and show that he really cares about his crew.The creators didn't cut any corners either.  The special effects are great and probably not too cheap (another reason Fox probably cancelled it).The other thing great about this set is that the shows are formatted for widescreen (it looks great on a 16:9 TV).So give this one a chance - reasonably priced and well worth your time.	5.0	It's a live action Cowboy Bebop	2004-01-16	9	9	0

Joss Whedon's space western introduced us to one of the most talented and compelling ensemble casts ever put together for a TV series, and while not every episode was briliant, the vast majority were thoughtful, humorous, suspenseful and - as usual for a Joss Whedon show - wonderfully written.This DVD set is a must-own for fans of literate science fiction (and open-minded fans of Westerns as well), and contains every episode that aired along with three that did not (one, entitled ""Trash,"" is among the most hilarious of the entire series). The themes of ""Firefly"" - family, loyalty, the search for a home that feels safe and the desire to live in freedom - are universal and resonate more than ever today. My fondest wish is the same as that expressed by one of the show's producers in the bonus feature about the making of the show. He ponders how wonderful it would be if someone at one of the networks saw the film ""Serenity"" (another must-own, by the way) and thought, ""Hey, why don't we make a TV series out of this?""At a time when so many mediocre (or worse) TV series seem able to stay on the air for years even though no one is watching, it's inconceivable to me that network execs think there's no place on television for a high-quality series like this.

I discovered it a year or two ago on the sci-fi channel and then went to see Serenity (Firefly's movie sequel) and Joss Whedon is a genius.  This show is one of those perfect little gems that become cult hits.Like Whedon's other series, it manages to be light and dark at the same time, dealing with some pretty deep and terrifying subjects but managing to be light-hearted and funny at the same time.  Much of the dialog is very humorous and joking, even when discussing very serious things and this manages to prevent it from becoming too depressing.The characters, with all their quirks, are all lovable, despite their differences.  The sci-fi aspects of it are actually fairly minimal, as most of the plots have more to do with things that could be set in any time line.  The fact that all of these occur in space is just a coincidence (or so it seems).Anyone who likes sci-fi should give Firefly a chance, and even those who don't might find it to be a show they like.	5.0	What A Great Sci-fi Show	2006-11-09	4	3	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1D0AXD04GPPC8	ryan n gatto	I watched this show on Fox when it was on,  and couldn't resist buying it when it was released.It's some of Wheddon's best work.  The cast &amp; crew are incredible,  and the premise is impressive.IMO,  the only reason this show isn't still on the air is because Fox kept airing episodes out of order,  and pre-empting them without warning.This show is easily some of the best TV in years,  ranking up there with Buffy,  Angel,  and Joan of Arcadia.  It needs to be brought back,  it's obvious to me that it would succeed.	5.0	Bring it back!	2003-12-24	3	2	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3RY95CIYMJMGN	"Ryan Patridge ""Rogue Borg Reviewer"""	When I saw the &quot;pilot&quot; episode on Fox a year and a half ago, I thought it was incoherent, indulgent, and I wrote the series off as a waste of time.  As it turns out, Fox apparently maimed the series with out-of-order airings and horrific editing.Honestly, this series reminded me of Cowboy Bebop (with each episode treated like a short film), Trigun (spaceships, pistols, and frontier life), and Outlaw Star more than of any of its live action counterparts like Babylon 5 or Farscape (there were also specific scenes that were obviously inspired by these anime).  I really hope Sci-Fi resurrects this series, like they did for Farscape (or perhaps, more like TNT did for Babylon 5).  It is awesome!	5.0	Saw it on Fox and wrote it off...my mistake!	2004-04-02	8	6	2
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3BFBZHFE3SEQ0	Ryan Paul	I had watched Serenity a few years ago and was told by all my friends Firefly is a must watch. They were correct. This may be the greatest combination of acting, writing and execution yet.Firefly has the most compelling character development I have ever witnessed. The space-cowboy theme is excitingly different and well captured. The acting is phenomenal; each character has great depth and history. Relationships between the characters are masterfully expressed allowing a connection greater then any other film or series I have watched.I am grateful for being able to experience the raw, tense, comical, mysterious, riveting, nail-biting, heart-breaking, heart-warming situations encountered throughout journeys with their space vessel, Firefly. Knowing that such incredibly captivating adventures will suddenly come to an end breaks my heart. I am two episodes from the end; yet cannot bring myself to watching these remaining episodes.When I muster the will to continue and finish off Firefly there will be tears, and will definitely be watching Serenity immediately after. I cannot see this series suddenly sparking back to life considering Serenity's coverage of how the series was supposed to play out and the amount of time passed since the initial release. However I, and the rest of the world, do wish it so. There is much left to be explained and explored.Be warned: This series is powerful, expertly crafted and I expect it to leave a massive emptiness once finished. A truly bittersweet experience; Firefly.	5.0	Stunning, Riveting, Compelling.	2014-04-28	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2DSV7S6T5VDME	S. Adams	Of all the shows I've seen in recent memory, none is as truly imaginative or memorable as Firefly. I didn't get a chance to see the show when it first aired due to living outside of the U.S. at the time, but discovered it through the trailer for 'Serenity', which is the theatrical continuation of the story coming out now. I'm so glad I took a chance and bought the dvds. The characters, the storylines, the atmosphere, the unique world that unfolds before you on the screen leave you wanting more. It's intelligent, thought-provoking, at times hysterically funny, and has a large dose of good drama. So if you're into shows that draw you in, make you care about the characters and the world they inhabit, and engage you on many different levels, this is the show for you.	5.0	A truly great and imaginative show	2005-09-29	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A143PCECEG9M11	SadieKay	Firefly was an amazing show that never really had a chance to shine. It was aired out of order, had little to no advertising, and had it's time-slot changed partway through it's run. This caused the series to be cancelled without all of it's already filmed episodes being aired. But this didn't stop it from developing an enormous cult following, whose lobbying efforts contributed to the release of the follow-up film, Serenity. These loyal fans, dubbed Browncoats, have risen again to demand that Firefly take flight again! So we ask you, PLEASE bring back Firefly!!	5.0	Bring Back Firefly!!	2011-03-02	0	0	0

That it has wonderful characters that are beautifully developed?  That it has an original setting for a sci-fi show, but a setting that still makes sense?  That all the big things (stories, characters, etc) & all the little things (no sound in space, for example) about it combine & make it a great series?  I think all of this has been pretty well covered by everyone else.If you're a fan of Joss's other shows, you know that his writing can waiver from serious to witty & still keep you captivated.  If you're not a fan of Buffy & Angel, though, Firefly is a completely different type of show, & I know both people who loved the Buffyverse shows & people who hated them, who love this series.

I disagree with negative feedback that says that there is too much disbelief to suspend.  At first the anachronistic quality of bullet firearms and the juxtaposition of cowboy/pioneer frontierism seems overwhelming and odd, not to mention the peppering of Chinese in the speech and Eastern clothing popping up, but this discomfort passes quickly when one realizes that it is genius.  The actors, the writing--especially the dialogue, the graphics, the music and the story arcs are all so good and compelling.  It was a travesty that this show was cancelled.

Altis ""nemo434"""	"I'm just going to be another clump of kelp in a sea of adoration, but I still gotta throw my five stars into the ring on this one!All I have to say about ""Firefly"" is that the series' 14 episode run came as close to perfect artistic expression as any television series ever has and probably ever will. Every camera angle, every lighting detail, every line of dialogue seems to have been the outcome of hours and hours of careful planning and obsessive love for the craft. A more action-packed, screamingly funny and throat-tighteningly heart touching a thing has never been commited to film. A single episode of this series kicks the tar out of 99.9% of anything else shown on t.v. in a given season. Even the audio commentaries on this DVD set are a hoot! I'd recommed that Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion start up a comedy act and hit the vaudeville circuit except that vaudeville's been kinda on the dead side for the past fifty years or so.Anyone who doesn't like this show is obviously flawed, self-loathing, and a heavy drinker. If there is a ""Firefly"" hater somewhere in your life I urge you to sever all ties with them! They are of an inferior ilk (i.e. Fox executives) and obviously not to be trusted! Leave them to rot in their smelly puddles of ""Ugly Duckling"" and ""Shallow Joe"" and ""The Simpleton's Life"" while the rest of us sit back and await the coming ""Serenity"" to take us away!"	5.0	What more could I add?	2004-08-21	8	8	0

Yes, I enjoyed Star Wars, as did everyone else, but that's the extent of my sci-fi exposure.Firefly is no ordinary sci-fi show.  In fact, it's not really sci-fi at all.  This is a story of a bunch of regular people who live together on a spaceship called ""Serenity.""  The neat thing is that, unlike traditional sci-fi show, there are no aliens, there is no warp drive or hyperdrive, or anything fanciful like that.  This is a future that is believable, and these are believable characters.  This show is funny, sad, exciting and everything in-between.You really should check this show out.  I think most everyone will enjoy it.  I have heard that it appeals to a large number of women TV viewers, probably because of the interesting and strong female characters (evidently, this is something that the show's creator, Joss Whedon, is famous for -- see Buffy the Vampire Slayer).I think it's a real testament to the show's quality that it continues to rank very high in sales here at amazon and that it has averaged a 5 star review after more than 2500 reviews.  Not many shows can show those numbers.It's a real shame that Fox messed up and cancelled this show.

Others, cleary are low resolution aka regular definition2) Pixelation, A LOT of scenes on the DVD have pixelation (where the image gets broken up into squares),it is terrible in some scenes, Bluray does NOT have this problemSimilarities:1) Everything else...Is it worth it to own on Bluray? Yes, but wait for a sale.

And I cannot understand what the allure of Firefly is, but I absolutely cannot get enough of it. I guess I've lost it, because I watch those 3 disc's over and over and over. I long to be a member of the crew and I have NEVER had anything in the movie world affect me like Firefly has. Saying that Fox was premature in their closing the doors on the greatest series ever, is the most gargantuan understatement ever made. And as many fans as the series has, I don't understand why someone is not picking up on the vibe. Even though two of the crewman were lost in the Serenity movie, somehow, someone needs to have the foresight (or hindsight) to reestablish this series. Just reincarnate Book and Wash and get the thing rolling again. I am aching for more and more. Personally, I would like to see the series run FOREVER. I guess all this probably sounds pretty dumb and stupid, unless your a real fan. But to me, Firefly is the epitome of all TV series, no matter what the genre.	5.0	Firefly Forever	2011-04-13	8	7	1

The writing is great, the production design is fantastic and Joss' skill as a director has come along in leaps and bounds.From the first episode you can tell that this show was destined to be cancelled - it just has an air to it that you can tell (or maybe you just know already) but this air of desperation just to keep going just adds to the character of Mal in particular and the beauty, grace and humanity of the show as a whole.I can't recommend this highly enough - buy it and fall in love for yourself!	5.0	Mesmerising!	2003-12-16	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ASTPAIUYNES0	Samuel J. Shoemaker	"A fan of Joss Whedon's other work, it comes as no small statement that I say Firefly surpasses the years of his other work in just a few episodes.  The show presents another side of the science fiction genre.  It questions the idealism of star trek using the historical reframing of the American civil war and constant referencing of other well known sci-fi works.  Captain Mal's ship of loners and refugees are among those not within the Star Trek federation/Star Wars empire/ US Civil War North, trying to live by their own code and ideology.  The show asks and may have one day finished answering, ""in the predicted trend of consolidation of power, what if you don't like what one power wins out?""Unlike many other pulp sci-fi shows, it presents its audience with an ensemble of rich and engrossing characters able to walk that line between earnest performance and self-aware, post-modern mockery.  In so few episodes the show leads its audience to care deeply for what becomes a traveling family.  There is a moment in the Cowboy Bebop Movie (Firefly's aesthetic, if not other aspects seems influenced by this film's series) when the character Jet Black makes a comment that his bounty hunting ""crew"" is not cohesive.  That film's characters are like those of so much mediocre fiction these days, cool, perhaps, but lacking the sort of warmth that makes them successful ensembles and accessible to audiences.  When I finished Firefly I was saddened deeply by my inability to see its crew grow and develop, and even just my inability to see them further.  Of course the film (Serenity) will be another chance, but the tragedy is that something so good would start and die out all but unnoticed.Oh yes, and it was well written, acted, and pretty f-in funny. I suppose that's all I needed to say before you moved on to the next review.

Well-written, witty, with stories you want to keep following, it's a winner all around.  Felt the same way about Stargate's first few seasons.  Battlestar Gallactica?  We watch it because there's nothing else to watch.  But this is LIGHTYEARS better entertainment. Constantly losing, dying out, never getting any closer to any reasonable hope of survival, Gallactica can get really aggravating.  You'd think they'd all get bored enough to just run into a fracking star or something equally final.  Never got that loser mentality on Firefly!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1E8FH76YFQ31Z	Sarah Allen	"I was introduced to Firefly a few episodes after it originally began airing, by a friend of mine who intially tried to sell it to me as ""a new show by Joss Whedon."" ""Who?"" I replied -- I'd never seen an episode of Buffy or Angel in my life, although I knew that a lot of people liked them. After a bit more explanation, I decided to watch the next week.The first episode I saw intrigued me. By the end of the next one, I was hooked. And then, of course, the show was cancelled a few weeks later.When the DVDs were finally released, I think I watched them 3 times all the way through over that following week -- once for me, a second time to show one of my roommates who was curious after having wandered through during my first runthrough, and a third time to show my sister and one of my other roommates who had both come in in the middle of the second runthrough. (Both of the roommates ended up borrowing my set to show their families, who I believe later bought the DVDs for themselves.)As for the show itself? Amazing. I haven't seen enough TV to call it the best show ever, but it's certainly my favorite, and from what I've seen, it's extremely rare that shows deliver as well and as consistently as these 14 episodes do. Effects, score, lighting, costumes, sets, acting, story, and characterization are all top-notch.The extras are also well-done and demonstrate the obvious love that the cast and crew have for the show. The commentaries are full of information (such as that one of my few caveats with the show -- that at the end of some of the episodes, everything's wrapped up a bit too neatly and happily -- was actually Fox's insistence), as well as stories from the set and lots of joking around.Go see Serenity in September. It's really, really good. And you'll be able to enjoy it whether or not you've seen Firefly.But if you'd like to get to know the characters a bit better beforehand, or if you'd just like to watch 15 hours of great television, check out Firefly.If you want to see it before taking the plunge, it'll be airing on SciFi Channel on Fridays at 7 Eastern starting July 22. You might also check your local library or video store.Now's a good time to buy the DVDs though since their price has dropped somewhere between 5 and 10 dollars from what it was before.Enjoy the show, curse its premature ending, and have fun on September 30th at the movie!"	5.0	Still flying...	2005-07-14	13	13	0

""Why in the heck was this cancelled?""  Although I think I might have an answer.  Fear.  This show is smart, funny and tragic at the same time, and full of subtleties of detail that could be missed in a single watching.  And as we all know, television executives assume we are all stupid, dull, and don't want comedy mixed in with our drama.  Well, guess what.  Some of us do.  A great many of us, if these reviews are any indication.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AMVFNP1XWEK6K	Sarah	So if you're reading this, you've already seen the reviews of other fans saying how greatthis series is. I won't repeat that. It was simply put one of the best shows of the last dozenyears and I'm not easily impressed.I wanted to post a defense of the stronger Western aspect that some people havecommented on. The reason for so many of the worlds looking Old Westernish is well andproperly explained in the series. The storyline Firefly is set in is two sided, the wealthycore planets with ultra high tech and the dirt poor colony worlds that start off withnothing. The two are blended well and since our heroes move about doing whatever workthey can find, they move from tech to poor and back again. It works, it blends well andmore importantly, it's a load of fun.Firefly moves in a world far more realistic than we normally see in a series. The charactersare human and complex and I agree totally, the theme song kicked major backside!Can not wait for the DVD and I WILL be first in line when the movie is out!!	5.0	Speaking up for the Western	2003-11-08	12	11	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3BRVQ5J0LAUU2	Sarah	...but I just want to pitch in my bit and say, really, this is my favorite things in the world series.  I'm not a fan of television, and I really only watch series on DVD these days, after meticulous researching a show. But I can't quite remember how I decided to watch Firefly. I know it was after I saw Serenity in theaters -- before that, I had never heard of it. But I do remember the movie blew me away, and eventually I got the series from the library.Now, when I fall for things (particularly movies and books), I fall HARD. I mean, I glow and rave and go on and on about the stuff. And eventually, I get around to buying 'em, and look on proudly as they sits on my shelves. Unfortunately, that's all they do for years. Sit on the shelves. Being admired and remembered, but never watched. That is, until Firefly.I just cannot watch these 14 episodes enough. Since I got the series last Christmas, I've watched them all the way through 3 times (which is a lot for me) and I often put one on as background noise while I multi-task, but that never works because I just end up mesmerized by the crew of Serenity once again.It's hard to explain what it is that casts this spell, because I'm not drawn to either the sci-fi or western genres as a rule. But all the elements works so well together, and just pull you along like a perfect song.	5.0	Not that it will make much difference...	2008-08-10	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3EK9XOOM7FUFN	Sarah Helsom	After only watching one episode of this show on the website Hulu, I was ready to buy the set and immerse myself in this incredible 'Verse.The idea is more realistic than most sci-fi shows.  Yes, they have a ship capable of space travel.  But it doesn't look shiny and it isn't perfect.  The universe has loads of problems (and no aliens, which is a unique decision for the genre), many of which we see in our everyday lives.  It's truly a relatable sci-fi show.The crew of Serenity seems like the kind of people you could meet in the real world.  They have their own sets of problems, their own very unique personalities, and are never stereotypes or copies of characters we've seen millions of times.  The acting is fantastic, complimenting each amazing character that comes our way.To all of you who have not yet experienced Firefly, I ask you to give it a chance.  Don't like sci-fi?  That's fine, it's not your typical science fiction.  Don't like westerns?  That's fine too - neither do I!  Firefly is a show for anybody and everybody.  Take a peek and you might be surprised.

Both are considered sci-fi cult classics, and for good reason. The characters are engaging (the casting is, in my opinion, exceptional) and the action and plot are equally good. If you have not seen either of these works, I would recommend them very highly. The world that this show takes place in is both futuristic and not at the same time. The story takes place in space, primarily on a space ship in fact. Even so, there is more of a ""western"" feeling to everything than ""space-alien"". There are also Asian overtones to everything in the more populated areas. Somehow, this Space Opera-Western-Asian-style amalgamation is both endearing and strongly entertaining."	5.0	This Show Was Gone Far Too Soon	2011-05-04	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2NZDF1UEUQGOD	Sasja Frahm Olesen	I had my doubts about the wisdom of blending western (a genre I don't particularly fancy) with sci-fi, but as this show had Joss Whedon (of Toy Story, Angel and Buffy fame) at the helm I had to check it out - and I'm almost sorry I did. You get drawn into this series incredibly fast, it's over far too soon and you're left with an insatiable hunger for more. And not just me - this is one show (the only, I think) my husband and I are equally fascinated by.There are too many aspects I love about this show to list them all, but let me highlight a few:The SettingFirefly is a small space ship, smuggling and doing odd jobs under the radar of the Alliance, the rulers of this fulture world. That's how the Firefly crew get to meet high and low in the different worlds. But most of the time, the ship is just travelling in the empty space between worlds, just a tiny fleck in the void. This solitude yet beauty of space is conveyed better here than in any other sci-fi series where the usual impression is that you can't turn your ship in a new direction without bumping into other space crafts or inhabited planets. It also puts the focus solidly on the interaction between the characters, which brings me to the next point.The CharacterisationThe people aboard Firefly are real people, with their strong and weak points, hopes and fears, world views and difficult decisions. Instead of self-important archetypes in colourful suits trying to save humanity from extinction, you get complex and realistic characters with very present and understandable issues.  The way they're disclosed to the viewer through their reactions to the different worlds Firefly visits, the problems they face and even more to each other is the show's strongest attraction, puntuated by the sparkling dialogue. This is really what makes you weep for Fox's foolish decision to kill this beauty before it was fully matured. I miss the people!The LookFirefly's world spans from the high tech you expect from a science fiction to the grit you know from a western and both are equally engaging and real to the watcher. The judicious use of handheld camera draws you into the world, but doesn't distract. Colours are used to great effect to signal the different worlds the crew move in - the yellow of the high noon prairie, the blue of high tech facilities and the deep empty blackness of space.Firefly is an awesome show. I can't wait to see the movie, and my dearest hope is that the movie will spawn a series. Firefly is a thoroughly adult show with all the best things from Whedon's other shows - Buffy and Angel: The witty yet poignant dialogue, the way the characters' inner life is brought out in the main plot, the unexpected twists and turns of a great story arc. Get it at your own risk - you'll be sorry when it's over!	5.0	Drama, action and wit - a show can't get better than this	2004-03-21	4	4	0

I also like sci-fi and westerns so merging the two not only delighted me but made this dvd set a must have for my collection.  I did not get to see Firefly on television because the network kept changing the schedule so I missed all but one episode.  I was very disappointed when the show was canceled before I had a chance to really get to know the characters and almost didn't buy the dvd set because I wasn't emotionally invested in the idea.  But because I am a fan of Wedon's work I did and I am glad I did.  I would recommend this set to anyone who has enjoyed Buffy The Vampire Slayer and/or Angel.	4.0	Biased Opinion	2007-07-02	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A314YG58UZBYF1	S. B. Greenwood	I confess, I never really liked Star Trek.  The reason: they all just seemed so goody-goody.  There they were, cruising around the galaxy, helping people, and they always were cast as the good guys.  As a decidedly anti-establishment type, I couldn't help but see shades of Big Brother in the Federation.  That's why Firefly hooked me immediately.  The crew members of Serenity weren't part of the establishment, they weren't always the good guys, and they actually seemed to be fighting against the larger Federation-like social structure.  Firefly is the Un-Star Trek, perhaps even the Anti-Star Trek, and for that reason is a lot more charming and likeable than Star Trek ever was.  The characters are more real, more fun, and the story lines are more original and more intellectually stimulating.	5.0	Un-Star Trek	2003-12-29	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1UIJASY6Q764H	"S. Botti ""dawnsthekey"""	I have to admit, when I first heard of this show I just dismissed it because of its premise: A western-type series set in space 500 years from now. I HATE WESTERNS and the only entertainment I enjoyed that dealt with space was Star Wars. I was the anti-trekkie. Then one day I saw Roswell here on amazon.com and went to buy it and saw that there was a discounted price if I bought these two shows at the same time.I then figured &quot;Hey, it's a Joss Whedon show, it can't be too bad, and if I don't like it I'll just resell it.&quot; Well, two months later I still hadn't watched it and I was sorta bored so I put it in my DVD player and started watching it. I immediately fell in love with the show and was so upset when I finished it and there was no more episodes left.Now, a month later I was searching through imdb.com and came across the name Gina Torres, whom I had seen before in Angel - Season Four, Cleopatra 2525, and recently, Firefly, I clicked onto her bio and read her other films/appearances and was shocked when I saw the name &quot;Zoe&quot; twice, I looked at both titles and was elated to find out that Joss Whedon is now filming a movie entitled &quot;Serenity&quot;, which is a movie based upon this TV show, and he is having ALL of the original actors in this show portray the same characters again. THERE IS JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD!!!I know I got off task, so back to the show, this show transcends the generalization people give to it, it is a drama, comedy and space show all in one. But this does not state how easy it is to love this show even if you do not like these genres.

The characters are all well rounded with strenghts and weaknesses, the humor is well placed and truly funny, the plot is deep and intriguing. By episode 14 you really just want to see more and more. A wonderful show, great plots, great characters. Naturally, Fox would have none of it and canceled the show at episode 14. Thankfully a feature film is due out this Sept. 30.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2YJ00DAK0VZ2B	Scififan	Firefly is, simply put, a very intelligent show. If you like science fiction that challenges your head, heart, mid, soul while taking you on amazing adventures, try this. Firefly is for you. it appeals to so many people because it causes one to think to get through Firefly.Even the fans have to agree that the terraforming theory is quite simply old. It first appeared in 1967 and the theory has been touted as utter rubbish by modern science but this is SCIENCE FICTION. If we colonize other worlds it is MAY happen by terraforming, who knows what will happen in 500 years.The dialogue is far from hollow. There is pathos or ethos for the sympathetic characters. Like Farscape or Mutant X --both highly orinal series -- it is extremely easy to care about the characters.Suffice to say, Fox showed terrible jusgement in cancelling a show that was cancelled for no good reason. No one saw it the first time because Fox juggled show times, pre-empted episodes and ran shows out of order but now that it's made it to the big screen everybody is suddenly interested because it is finally getting the recognition it deserves.Truly an excellent show!	5.0	excellent at best - believe the hype	2006-06-10	11	10	1

Once again, you've got to wonder what those ""gorram"" network exec's are doing when they pull an inventive series like this in favor of people getting covered in rats or jumping out of airplanes... The scripts are clever and surprising, the mix of western and Asian cultures is colorful, and the cast is dead on perfect.

And lo and behold, at about the same time I heard about Serenity coming out, Sci-Fi started airing reruns of the series, in chronological order, something Fox seemed unable to accomplish back in 2002.  I was hooked from the first episode, and had to own the set.  Finally, a science-fiction show where good and bad was simply based on your individual perspective, the machines were dirty -- basically it had more of a realistic feel to it.The cast has a remarkable chemistry -- you believe that these people have a history together.  One thing I will say about Joss Whedon -- the man can write.  To this day, I cannot stand Buffy or Angel, but Firefly has become one of my favorites from the first episode.  If you're into solid storytelling, then I recommend this DVD set.	5.0	Great sci-fi with solid storytelling	2005-10-17	5	5	0

To this day I itch to see more back stories, character interactions and what Serenity's crew would've done in upcoming episodes.At this point Firefly will never return, but the immense amount of fans prove that Fox cancelled this show PRE-MATURELY.  All the characters are memorable, and contribute to the humor and synergy of the show.Even though there are no more seasons to look forward to I hope some of you read this review and buy this copy just to experience the revelation that is Firefly.

With great characters, excellent writing, and stunning visuals, life on the frontier of space is presented as both exciting and ordinary making that life seem real and truly accessible. The story revolves around the captain and crew of Serentity, a small cargo vessel, that works on the fringes of civilization occassionally smuggling and theiving to make ends meet. The only downside is that just as I was starting to love the characters and better understand each person's story the series seems cut short. Watch the DVD version to get the backstory on how the series was canceled and fans revolted creating momentum for a follow up feature movie ""Serentiy"".Be prepared to ache that more were made, although you won't want to miss it. This Movie ""Serenity"" is an excellent complement to the series, ""Firefly"" and explains more of the backstory.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3RUQO10JKY9NT	Scott Cameron	Firefly was a show that was broadcasted on the FOX Network in the fall of 2002 that sadly was canceled after only airing 11 of 14 episodes. I, sadly, missed the magic that was Firefly at the time as I was involved in the conflict in Afghanistan at the time.In 2005 I went to the dollar movie theater with a date to see a movie titled Serenity. I had not seen the television show and did not realize this movie was based on that show.When the movie began, I realized I was jumping into an already established story line yet never felt lost for one moment. I was instantly drawn into this strange new world of characters and their side stories. I have to say I tremendously enjoyed the interactions between all the main characters and their conflicting personalities. The story line was rich and detailed and kept my attention the entire length of the movie.Star Trek has action yet lacks it. It is too technical and the characters feel flat and emotionless. Stars Wars is too kiddie friendly. Serenity/Firefly fits the bill of being that Adult drama based in the future in the outer reaches of space. It feels like how I believe the future really will be for man-kind.The CGI was not what is expected of a big budget film but were passable and got the job done in Serenity. It is perfect in the small screen, though, in its television run as Firefly. It is eerie seeing scenes of other space and external shots of the ship without any sound which is realistically what would probably happen.The movie motivated me to see the entire run of FireFly. I realized that, going back to the movie, there were many jokes or references I had missed the first time due to not seeing the series prior yet,  it did not detract from my film watching experience. I was saddened watching the movie then the television series. This is a rich world Joss Whedon, the creator of Angel, Buffy, & director of the new upcoming Avengers movie, Introduced us to.I wish that the storyline would continue. I wish that there would be a sequel but there will be no more adventures of Serenity. The movie was not successful enough to warrant a sequel and the cast of the show have gone on to other projects since then.If you have not seen the  movie or the television series, I highly recommend you order both the movie and television series, pull up a blanket and bowl of popcorn and make a weekend of it.	5.0	Must See & Buy for Sci-Fi/Drama/Comedy fans	2012-02-07	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1KFCZF2V2FS62	"Scott C. Locklin ""Selectos nisi das mihi libe..."	"First off, Firefly is a sort of derivative of of a Gene Rodenberry show called Andromeda which in turn, took a lot of its ideas from Babylon-5. For some reason, everybody has heard of Firefly, despite the fact that it died after 13 episodes, but nobody has heard of Andromeda, which ran for 5 years. This is unfortunate, as from what I remember, Andromeda was more interesting (so was Farscape, which I also mostly didn't see).Still, Firefly wasn't bad. Like many modern TV shows, it has only a little bit of plot (think; freaks in a cowboy space truck), but it makes up for it with strong characterization and back story. It's not about anything, but the characters are sort of interesting. There is a cowboy captain, whose main purpose is to serve as a heart throb for the sexbomb prostitute. Sexbomb hooker is actually pretty convincing; I've known women like her. They weren't hookers though (hookers tend to be a lot less sensitive and sentimental, and they're usually not that clean looking), and they were all from L.A. -which I guess is sort of like being from outer space. There is a beefy tough black lady who looks like Tina Turner, who always calls the Captain, ""sir"" like Peppermint Patty called Charlie Brown, and her laughably unlikely surfer-weasel husband. There is a nerd girl for an engineer, a wimpy upper class doctor and his psychotic teenage sister. There is also an Orc called Shane, who is, of course, my favorite character, and some kind of preacher dude who was good at acting wise and benign, and who appeared to have interesting secrets. The villains are amusing sadistic bastards, and the characters all had enough back story and depth to them (well, the psycho chick had no depth, but she was supposed to look deep), that it would have made an entertaining series if it had not gone straight to the DVD bin.One of the things which made Firefly unique is it is the first science fiction program made exclusively from a female perspective. The leading men in the show are all completely harmless, benevolent-to-women characters, except for Shane, who is made the butt of jokes when he's not actively playing the role of a cut-rate villain. Women drive most of the plot, and catering to female emotional needs is the purpose of the non-villainous male characters. Many of the situations were nerd girl obsessions, like the idea that dudes might fight over her, or that some redneck would want to own her uterus for breeding purposes. Personally, I have never even met an unmarried man who got a woman pregnant on purpose. They might exist somewhere, but the idea of a guy wanting to keep some broad captive for breeding purposes .... well, let's just call that a peculiarly female fantasy, probably brought on by reading silly bodice-ripping books by Margaret Atwood. It's pretty weird watching a TV show that so blatantly caters to the nerd girl mindset, but there you have it. I think the guy who made it also had something to do with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so, no big surprise there. I don't really mind it, though I occasionally wished they'd land their dumb bumble bee looking space ship someplace where they'd have to deal with real trouble. Also, the tough black chick needed to dump her surf bum husband and shack up with Shane or the hot prostitute.Ratings: one blast from a 45-70 mare's leg gun, and a right cross from a tough black chick."	3.0	OK, but somewhat overrated	2008-08-07	20	7	13
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ASCBFXFZXV4ME	"Scott C ""stches"""	"Killed off long before it was given a chance to get its space-legs, this is one of the most original and engaging sci-fi series to come down the pipe in years, if not decades.  Taking place in a remote future in the wake of an interstellar civil war, the show chronicles and adventures and misadventures of the crew of the transport ship Firefly.  That crew includes Capt. Malcom Reynolds, the embittered captain who fought on the losing side (Independents) of the civil war against the Sino-American Alliance; Zoe, the warrior-woman who fought with him and now is his second-in-command; Wash, the ship's pilot and Zoe's constantly wisecracking husband; Kaylee, the ship's engineer and eternally optomistic bright light; Jayne, the ne'er do well mercenary who's loyalty is always in question; Inara, a ""companion"" and the ship's most respectable member; Shepherd Book, the preacher with ambiguous Alliance ties; River Tam, a psychic prodigy who fled the clutches of Alliance scientists who were experimenting on her brain; and Simon Tam, her physician brother who gave up his life of luxury on the core plants to rescue her.  Like most people, the show took an episode or two to grow on me, and the frequent western settings and dialogue took some time getting used to.  But in no time at all it became obvious that in terms of dialogue, humor, effects, characters, storylines, and the internal consistency and vibrancy of this future universe as envisioned by the mind of Joss Whedon, there's just nothing out there, especially in the world of sci-fi, that's come close to this show in years.  And to top it off, you get to hear characters swear in Chinese!  The DVD set also includes three episodes that were never aired on the States (only in the UK) as well as tons of commentary, making it a must for any completist."	5.0	Joss Whedon's Firefly	2003-07-23	31	27	4

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A337Z6JVI7QG2R	Scott	I'm the kind of person who is very cynical about television shows. In fact I have not watched any shows regularly for many years, which is why I had never heard of Firefly until a friend loaned it to me a few days ago.So I find it a little ironic that I was introduced to this truly wonderful show only to discover that it was cancelled after a few months.Looking back, my all time favorite show would have to be Star Trek:The Next Generation. Firefly is easily as good. I won't say it's better because they are completely different, but it's on the same level in terms of quality.The cast and characters are perfect. The dialogue is smart and funny. The stories are fun and exciting. I just wish there was more of it. Only 14 episodes? What a cruel joke, but it's better than nothing.If you are thinking about picking up this series, I recommend that you do it now before the movie comes out in Sept 2005 so that you can be sure to appreciate all the nuances. But don't make plans for a couple days because you won't be able to resist watching all the episodes one after another.

Almost same events as where the tv show left off. If this show had stayed on the air though it would have rivaled and possibly outshined stargate.

I rented it through a popular online movie site and after watching the first disk I said, &#34;I gotta have this series!&#34; This 4-disc set allows the viewer to see every episode in order, without commercials or having to wait until next week for the next.  I've watched it numerous times and have shown it to others who had never heard of it; they've become fans as well.  Apparently &#34;Firefly&#34; fans are legion, and after watching just the pilot episode I could see why. Has a lot of &#34;steampunk&#34; elements to it; and all of the characters are wonderful in their own individual way--there won't be any of them that you don't like, and it will be hard to choose a favorite.

I have to say that it might be the best $35 I've ever spent.The premise of the show is essentially Star Trek + Wild Wild West (the original TV series, not the terrible movie). Sound like it sucks? Well, if you can get over that, you get to partake in one of the best science fiction series I've ever seen. The show was cut short due to Fox's itchy trigger finger with cancelling shows, but these fourteen episodes alone are spectacular enough as it is.I don't typically buy things like ""The Complete Season of..."", but I did here, and I'm very glad I did. You have to buy this, and you have to buy Serenity, the movie that caps the whole thing off, and although it may seem like quite a bit to purchase, after you watch the 14 episodes you will be demanding to see the movie immediately."	5.0	Great Science Fiction Cut Short	2006-02-26	8	8	0

I WANTED to see it (Joss Whedon is an amazing amazing creator of stories), but never got around to.  Then a friend of mine showed me an episode.  Then a second..  long story short, I own the DVDs now.We all know the storyline and how well the writers crafted a space western, but it's the characters of Firefly that make this show as top notch as it is.  Every actor has developed a person who is unique, who breathes on the screen, who brings life to the stories.  And, really, isn't that what we want in our TV and movies - characters whose stories and their endings are important to us because we care?  Someone else mentioned ""Star Wars"" and how the prequels sucked.  Why?  Because no one cared about the characters.The writers of Firefly have also created a unique culture of the future, even down the nuances of language.  The intermittent use of Chinese which flows naturally into conversations (watch it with the CC on, there are NO translations..  everyone has to use context to figure out what's being said.  Brilliant!) and the vocabulary - ""a reader"" for ""psychic"", ""sly"" for ""gay"", ""shepherd"" for ""priest"" - create an environment that is alien and yet familiar.  We are disoriented because we are forced to wade through their culture and make a place for oureselves there.  Luckily, there are enough welcoming images that it's easy to get comfoprtable and start enjoying.Joss Whedon and his team made a product that I shamefully ignored, and that got cancelled before its time.Hopefully, we'll get that movie soon."	5.0	Wow.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3026ENZBW95GO	"Sebastin Escobar ""Sebastian @ Per"""	The series is indoubtedly one of the best Sci-Fi series of this past decade.  Fox canceled it for no clear reason, because it has become kind of a cult Sci-fi tv show for all geeks (and brown-coats) out there, and it is well deserved.But, besides the series, the product its quite good.  The case is standar Blueray, and it has only 3 BD Disks, unlike the DVD Version with 5 disks (if I can recall, I also have the DVD version of this series).  The Image quality is not that much BD Quality, I don't know exactly why, but it is nevertheless a little better than DVD quality, and that is good enough for us fans of the tv show.If you like the series and have the DVDs, maybe you can skip this Blueray version, unless your DVD package takes too much space and you need to reclaim some of that space at home.  If you don't have the DVDs, and are fan of the series (or fan of Starwars, Star trek, Farscape or anything in between) you should rather buy this Blueray version.Hope this helps.	4.0	Excelent scripts and series, not that good Blueray Image quality	2011-12-15	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1SPZ50ZL9QKSO	S. E. Denney	"This show is groundbreaking in its conception for three reasons:1.  The combination of genres was surprisingly effective.  Honestly, I cringed the first time I heard about the then soon-to-premeier ""science fiction western.""  But I watched it anyway, and it worked.2.  The inclusion of a main character who is a prostitute is adventurous.  But even more, this is a society in which prostitutes are held in the highest esteem and treated like honored dignitaries.  That's daring and thought provoking.3.  Most impressive (to me) was the fact that the show mixed Mandarin Chinese words and phrases in with the dialogue, smoothly, and without subtitled translation.  The Mandarin was always included in such a way that you could figure out what the essential meaning was from the context (a guy walks up to a bar, says something in Mandarin, and then gets handed a drink, for example).Mandarin provided a unique flavor to the show and a bit of socio-political background:  clearly, in this future, Chinese culture has remained powerful, so much so that the language pervades the society and is spoken by pretty much everyone.  Chinese culture, too, keeps subtly appearing.  The prostitute does Chinese caligraphy in her spare time.Too bad the show didn't last long enough for us to uncover much of the backstory of this future vision.  It was certainly an intriguing one."	5.0	Groundbreaking	2003-09-09	50	45	5

Basically, it's like if Han Solo had been the a leader in the resistance against the empire. . .but then lost. All his dreams of freedom. . gone. So he's forced to keep smuggling stuff and trying to avoid the big, bad empire, just trying to make a living. His crew consists of a beautiful cortisan/geisha-type lady who has feelings for him and who he has feelings for as well, but they can't/won't admit it, a sweet, adorable female mechanic, the most kick ass female first mate ever, her husband-the comic relief pilot-and the other comic relief, the big dumb guy who loves guns and can't always be trusted. They pick up a few other characters that add much more to the story as well, but I don't want to spoil too much. The cast is amazing, the writing is amazing, the directing is amazing, the special effects are amazing. . .it's like a western more than a science fiction, in that it carries a simple charm about it, and there are no aliens. It's probably the most realistic future-set show I've ever seen. Oh, and it's done my Joss Whedon of &#34;The Avengers&#34; and &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&#34; so you know it's got to be good. This show is the reason I will never like Fox again. All the stupid shows that get played out to death, and &#34;Firefly&#34; only got 14 episodes.

It's simply different. It doesn't take itself so seriously. I found myself laughing many times over the funny dialogue.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1X3GEZOWZFQAV	"S. Gilmore ""Seeker"""	I never saw this gem of a series until it hit the Sci-Fi network, discovering it there by a combination of advertising (something Fox never tried, apparently) and word-of-mouth. I've since become a fan and have turned several others on to the Firefly phenomena by giving this DVD set as a (well-received) gift. To enjoy Firefly, you don't have to love Sci-Fi, you just have to love Quality.And if Serenity is indeed the end of the Firefly story (at least, filmed), then so be it, sadly. The many enigmas will forever remain a mystery, not the least of which is why a low-brow outfit like Fox Television ever green-lighted this short-lived masterpiece in the first place.	5.0	Brilliant, Funny, Thrilling, Sad...Just like Life Itself	2005-12-24	9	7	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZKTHJULZQWB1	"""shadesiren"""	"I watch a lot of TV.  It's true, though I like to think I limit myself to only the truly good stuff - no reality TV, no stupid sit-coms.I always liked westerns, and science fiction.  That meant so nothing when I found Firefly.  I never imagined anything this wonderful could be taken away from me.  I am ashamed to say I think of Firefly everyday.  EVERY day.  I have never CONNECTED with a Television show as I did with Firefly.  I was enthralled.  Fascinated.  Amused.  Shocked.Television is often mocked, ridiculed, and Belittled.  I see ""Kill Your TV"" bumperstickers.  But I have seen Firefly, and I know that TV can be amazing - it can be better than a movie, better than a book (and for ME, that's REALLY saying something).  It can be Art and Literature, together.  Firefly is, to me, the height of the best that TV can bring.  So different, so beautiful, and ugly, and funny, and so fascinating.  The people were so REAL - with myriad facets, unlike any I'd seen before.  Just when I thought I knew - oh, he's the fighter-type-guy, who beats people over the head and picks on everyone, and only cares about money - I see Jayne, hugging his knees while little Kaylee's life is hanging by a thread.  And an married bouple with a REAL relationship - love, jealousy, arguing, teasing - hey, it's just like me and my OWN husband!I used to say I needed to find ONE character, at least, that I REALLY cared about - that touched that part of me that made me HAVE to know what happened to them next.  I have never, ever, seen a show that didn't have a character I kinda wished would just go away - that I found stupid, annoying, or too 1- or 2- dimensional to feel anything for.  I loved Capn'n Mal - the tragic Hero, man who lost his faith and drops a wry ""Huh."" like no man I've heard before.  Kaylee - sweet Kaylee, the tomboy engineer who loves a frilly dress, and who'll do anything (even a loser engineer) to get close to a REAL starship engine.  Jayne - the man with a girl's name, who loves his gun, and knows the value of the all-mighty credit.  Simon - a genius willing to risk all for love of his sister, River.  River - mysterious, funny, scary - I SO want to know her secrets!!  Zoey and Wash - the married couple, she the amazon who has a relationship with the captain rarely seen on TV, except in the likes of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (REAL friends, and no romantic interest), and Wash, the pilot who plays with plastic dinosaurs, and quips like no other.  Inara - beautiful, sexy, exotic, the Companion, fascinating, with secrets barely hinted at. Book - preacher-man who recognizes the gun used by the bullet hole left behind (!wow!), who's secrets I am the most baffled and intrigued by.  No other show ever managed to hook me with EVERY character's stories - each one as fascinating as the last.Firefly is the ONLY show I have found myself able to watch over and over and over and OVER - and I only managed to save three episodes!  It's like my favorite movie - but 15 hours long, instead of 1 and a half.  Continuing on and on, yet still maintaining a basic story - with many, many smaller stories, entwined with the long story of the entire show.We can all go on and on, those of us who saw and know, we can share it with those who have not seen.  If you haven't seen this, and you like action, comedy, drama, science fiction, westerns, horror or mysteries, you must see this DVD.I know I must have gone on and on, but all I can say is wow, sorry.  I guess this really shows how deeply I feel about this, and I can't say anything more to reccomend it than that."	5.0	Browncoat Forevermore - We will Fly Again.	2003-07-27	41	36	5
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NC6WWEY047A4	Shadesiren	There has never been a Television show that has so consumed me.  Not in a &quot;rabid fan&quot; way, but in a way I have never known.  The acting, the writing, the special effects, everything about this show is over the top amazing.  Never have I seen a show that appeals to so wide an audience, and I've yet to meet anyone who has seen it and can honestly say what they didn't like about it.  Of course, thanks to Fox's advertising, It's rare to MEET, face to face, anyone who actually SAW the show.  I've reccomended it to friends, they've bought this, and they've all become loyal fans.When the movie comes out, I think Fox is going to be very, very disappointed in themselves.	5.0	Best of the Best	2004-03-10	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A31DZI953CSUF5	Shadowhawk	Everyone should be given the chance to experience Joss Whedon's truly unique series `Firefly'. It isn't often in the entertainment industry that two very dissimilar genres can be melded together into one highly entertaining package. But where others may have failed Joss Whedon succeeds. Many have heard of his other works such as `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and `Angel', and both of those shows stand on their own popularity, as evidenced by their huge fan base. But it seems only a select few have ever heard of `Firefly' and even fewer yet have ever actually experienced it. Unlike his other previously mentioned TV series, `Firefly' has no roots in magic or the supernatural. `Firefly' is a unique combination of science fiction and western. Two genres that are generally, for the most part, considered absolute opposites by many. Aside from being such a unique work, just by the combination of the two genres, it has many qualities that will entertain even those who generally avoid science fiction and westerns. And when the series ends Joss keeps it coming with the movie `Serenity'. `Serenity' answers many of the questions the TV series leaves unanswered, but it also, purposefully, leaves some of the biggest questions as mysteries.`Firefly' takes place in a science fiction rich environment. And for the first few minutes of the pilot episode you almost accept that this is what `Firefly' will be. But then Joss brings you fully into their universe. A universe where science fiction is the driver and western is the strong shotgun sitting next to it on a dusty horse driven coach. A universe where vessels can easily travel through space, and yet many still ride horses. A universe where some marvel at the wonders of the technology of the inner planets and where yet others struggle just to find food on desert-like moons.The `Firefly' universe exists in a post-Earth era. An era some time after man has left Earth's solar system, and found a new place to live. In this new solar system man has terra-formed many planets and moons. The inner planets and moons were the first and are the more civilized of the planets. The farther out from the core you go the more `wild' the planets are. The inner planets might be considered your `industrial' worlds and the outer planets might be considered your `western' worlds. When we first enter the `Firefly' universe we find war. That war, which is a strong part of the overall storyline, is between the inner and outer planets. The inner planets are fighting for `unification' of all the planets under one government. The outer planets are fighting to remain free. By the time we meet the crew of Firefly the war has long since ended, but the war still gives Joss a lot of material to turn into interesting storylines and plots which will keep you watching.The story is centered around a group of individuals who are thrown together, by chance in some cases, by design in other cases, but learn to become almost family to one another. The series shows a sense of camaraderie that isn't forced, but grown. Joss gives you the sense of them growing together rather than just blindly accepting each other. Even those amongst them who dislike each other the most are often likely to make sacrifices for each other. And the interaction between them is always entertaining even when it's emotionally tense.The character development for all of them is so well written and convincing that you can almost feel you know them. You know how they behave, you know generally what to expect of them. And yet Joss keeps them far enough from predictable that you never know just exactly what they are going to do. He keeps them interesting even after he teaches you everything there is to know about them.And for those who are die hard effects people, Joss doesn't disappoint. He has given the whole thing a very science fiction feel as far as the effects go, but has kept it believable. Even the weapons used between ships are to some degree believable and yet fantastic. And the method with which he shot scenes where space vessels are in `atmosphere' makes the scenes truly unique. A lot of the effects seem based more about what environment the characters are in rather than what ship will blow up first, unlike most science fiction shows. You won't see a lot of `photons' or `phasers' but you will get your fill of good effects. And sometimes the most interesting effects are the ones he has completely excluded. Sound being the shining example of this. In Joss' `Firefly' universe the lack of atmosphere in space prevents any sounds. It makes the effect very realistic but after years of science fiction `space' being full of sounds it feels somehow other-worldly.Not wanting to leave you stranded in this universe with no background and no idea how man came to this point, many episodes give you glimpses of the past. Sometimes these glimpses are literally `flashbacks' of the crew members. Sometimes the glimpses come in the dialog, people speaking of `Earth that was'. In other dialogs you sometimes catch just the briefest hints at underlying history. And sometimes the glimpse comes in the form of the characters telling a story. Joss uses many methods to paint the history of his `Firefly' universe. Every method is precise; every glimpse is colorful and alluring. Joss brilliantly fills the void of this universe so you aren't stuck within the confines of a single vessel.Even those who generally do not like either of the genres covered in `Firefly' should have a chance to experience this unique series. Want strong storylines? Want characters you can believe in? Want visually pleasing effects? Want a series with enough content and background to fill a universe? Then you owe it to yourself to experience `Firefly'. It is one of the most unique TV series' of our time and Joss isn't in the habit of disappointing. So go rent or buy a copy today, go home, and allow Joss to fully submerse you in the universe that is... Firefly.	5.0	Everyone should be given the chance to experience Joss Whedon's truly unique series `Firefly'.	2007-09-16	7	6	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1C0APSYM9H709	Shadow Raven	Firefly is a very good sci fi show, if you don't let the mixture of Western and Sci Fi genres bother you. I don't believe it was made to be taken too seriously as some other shows are. The characters are very well written and acted. It is a series that is imaginative and intelligent. It's misunderstood. Once a person watches a couple of episodes they will probably become addicted. The cancellation of the show was due to the anti-sci fi bias that is still prevalent on television. Although, ratings and sponsorship are very important, it simply takes some shows to gain an audience. I'm hoping that Firefly is popular enough on streaming services like Amazon to have a come back.	5.0	Cancellation of this show was one of the worst decisions made by a network	2013-09-07	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AOYGPHW4YMYEO	Shaide	Fox really dropped the ball when the cancelled this fantastic Sci-fi show by Joss Wheadon(Of Buffy and Avengers fame) and starring cult TV personality Nathan Fillion(of Castle fame). It merges westerns with sci-fi, and while many people are turned off by the idea of cowboys in space, it's actually really well blended!The series centers around Malcom Reynolds(Nathan Fillion) Smuggler extraordinaire, his ship Serenity, and his crew that is more like a family, as they fly through the stars, performing odd jobs to put bread on the table all the while staying one step ahead of the alliance.If given a second season, I am sure this show would have been a massive hit, but alas, fox did what it usually does, and cancelled it quickly before it could find it's niche. Thankfully Wheadon brought his fanbase a conclusion in the form of a bigscreen finale called Serenity.	5.0	A perfect blend of Sci-Fi and wild wild west.	2013-12-04	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1SVGS3TBYPEJ2	Shamima	Okay, another reviewer here suggests that if you don't believe the almost ONE THOUSAND positive reviews on amazon for this show, rent it first. you'll come back to purchase it. i am here to tell you he was right. i rented the 1st 2 discs (1st 8 episodes) from my local video store on a whim. I watched them in a single weekend, then decided to just purchase the whole set instead of renting the last 2 discs, even though i would have saved $40 by doing that.This show is so excellent it makes me sad there are only 14 episodes. i am now counting the days to the movie premiere in september (2005). the acting, the writing, the effects are all so excellent. the humour just kills me. when was the last time you didn't know whether to laugh or gasp while watching a torture scene? that's right -- laugh! a comic torture scene! one of so many excellent scenes that i am delighted i splurged on this DVD set.The characters are so well developed, and i love how little things in latter episodes connect to former ones. i hope the movie is so successful the series comes back to TV. someone else wrote that Firefly seems like a love letter from Joss Whedon. I'm inclined to agree. This whole series is a love letter to storytelling. And don't you jus twonder why 999 people took the time to write reviews for this show on amazon? And it keeps the 4.5 star rating. that's impressive. i love this show so much this is my 1st review for amazon.	5.0	rented 1st 2 discs, then bought the whole set online	2005-04-14	13	12	1

Once I had I was hooked - and had to buy the series. And I am glad I did. Deep multilayered storylines, characters that are inherently flawed and human, but ones you truly care about. Drama and action in a universe that is so achingly familiar yet alien (without ""aliens"") - everyone knows a little mandarin (to curse at least) and the ""frontier"" planets are just like they would be - a mixture of the old and the new. The mixed cultures shine through brilliantly and show us a world where the various religions and faiths obviously co-exist. It also shows us a flipside to the shiny, polished universe we have been fed from Star Trek, which we all know isn't how it is going to be.Now that the film is due out in September, I am now eagerly looking forward to it... this DVD series has given me alot of stories that I am sure they will gloss over or not go into in depth in the film.I recommend this series to anybody that likes good story, plot, characterizations and a depth that can only be truly realised by multiple viewings."	5.0	Truly great television series - more please?	2005-08-12	10	10	0

Loving the movie, I had extremely high expectations of what this show could be going in to this series. And I was not even slightly disappointed by anything except for the fact that there wasn't a second season. But perhaps the best things in life really don't have to be long lasting.The writing is endlessly witty, intriguing, heartfelt, and full of surprises. And this is one of the few shows that doesn't overdo any particular thing which makes it great. And I would also add that there isn't a single character, among the main set of them, that I found myself not liking. Even Jane, as terrible as his personality often proves to be, provides plenty of comic relief and is impossible to hate.Plan on the title track getting stuck in your head and refusing to leave.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2WWTAM6EFT72	Sharbysyd	A couple of weeks ago, I was looking for something different to watch and found Firefly in the top 10 dvd sellers on Amazon.  I had never heard of the show before.  I noticed there were over 1300 customer reviews.  I was really surprised because I've never seen that many reviews for any dvd or tv show.  After reading some of the reviews, I was very intrigued and thought of purchasing the show, but I was skeptical because I never really cared for Westerns - although I do like Sci-fi. I decided that for under $40, it was worth a shot and I purchased the set.  I was pretty well hooked after the first couple of episodes and have watched the whole set.  This is a really good show and I'm surprised that it was cancelled.  Many say that FOX didn't give Firefly a proper chance and after having watched it and seeing how good it was, I can see how that may be true.  If you like sci-fi and would like something different, I'd recommend buying this dvd set.  If you like Westerns and Sci-fi, you will probably LOVE this show.  I introduced my boyfriend to it and he said it's one of the best shows he has ever watched.  I'm sorry that this show didn't get a better chance on TV and I hope that it can return in some form.  I was thrilled to find out that the movie Serenity which is in theatres now is a continuation of this series.  I am going to see it today and plan to add it to my dvd collection when it comes out.	5.0	I'm not into Westerns but I really liked this show	2005-10-17	5	5	0

The combination of drama, humour, adventure, romance, is blended in just the right doses, and the characters are written, and portrayed so perfectly, that one can almost class this as the perfect tv series. The only negative is that Fox pulled the plug to quickly to give us a complete taste if what this show could give us. Oh well, at least it gives me more reason to watch this dvd set over again (and maybe in a few years, I will have the massive tv and quality surround sound to truly benefit from the bluray)	5.0	Shiny	2012-01-06	1	0	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3TOSOH4UMILRL	"Sharon Blackburn ""Super Phan"""	I watched this when it was actually on tv and was devastated when they took it off before even showing the entire season, or giving it half a chance. I was attracted to it because first I was already a fan of Joss Whedon't great writing and characterizations and second because I love sci-fi. I have watched the complete series on DVD several times and each time I laugh out loud and cry and am moved and want to be part of that wonderful, flawed crew. If you like great writing with humor and pathos and wonderfully real characters that are not one-dimensional then this is the DVD to buy.

I don't know. Maybe that the shows hooker has a deep sense of morality. Maybe that the ships captain (a smuggler) has an unyielding sense of loyalty to his rag-tag crew. Maybe that even the 'in it for myself' mercenary begins to grow a heart.Maybe all of the above. Maybe we just want to see people, from all walks of life, while far from perfect, live by a code of ethics that is somehow missing from television today.Maybe it's our way of saying, we ARE good people. We're all different, but we're good. Deep down inside. Maybe this show reminds us of how good we really are, and despite our differences; despite our weaknesses; we have the capacity to be honorable.I guess it goes to show, that if Television Execs had the authority, they'd probably cancel us, too.An amazing look at decency....told from the eyes of those you'd least expect to find it.	5.0	Uhh...Wow....and...WOW....with a side of ...DAMM thass good!	2004-05-21	11	10	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A37OML95FW08PS	sherman-nyc	"Wow...I am utterly and completely blown away by the Firefly series! It is one of the greatest TV productions ever made, and my level of respect for Joss Whedon has risen to astronomic proportions. Having never seen any episodes from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or the ""Angel"" series (also written by Joss), I was initially extremely skeptical, especially after hearing about the science-fiction Western theme. Like many others, I totally missed it on TV in 2002 (it aired on Fox from September 02 to December 02, when it got canceled), and the first time I had even heard of the series was when I was surfing Amazon reading reviews for new movies. The DVD box set, launched in December 03, looked interesting enough and was priced inexpensively, and with several hundred positive reviews, I figured there was no harm giving it a go. Little did I expect that I would get such immense enjoyment from a brilliantly crafted story filled with rich character development...I was under whelmed with the first 15 minutes of the 2-hour pilot episode, ""Serenity"". I was still skeptical and thinking to myself, ""What's the big deal?"" Then, as each minute passed, I was gradually hooked in and by the end of the episode, the only thing I could think about was playing the next episode! ""Serenity"" provides a great introduction into a world that resides in Whedon's wonderful imagination, and the characters are all intriguing and three-dimensional. Rather than describe the story, which you can find out for yourself by watching the DVD and reading other reviews, I will instead detail my own personal experiences with the series and some of the circumstances surrounding its production.Once you get to the end of the fourteen episodes, which still represents an incomplete first season, you are literally begging for more. Your heart is filled with sorrow as you realize that there is no more to come. Although modern day DVD's are usually packed with special features, I am typically not a person who utilizes these features. But not in this case - I proceeded to watch all the extras on the DVD. In the interview with Joss on the making of the movie, it was painful to see how he talks about his passion and inspiration behind Firefly, only to have it canceled prematurely by impatient Fox executives. Every TV series needs a grace period to ramp up and attract viewers, and it is a tragedy that Firefly was never allowed a chance to do so. Otherwise, it would have surely been one of TV's greatest series, and would probably be up to Season 4 or 5 by now!!!During the interview with Joss, it is evident he frequently struggled with the self-absorbed Fox executives. In their bid for high ratings and their self-assured knowledge that action sells, they even forced Joss to air the episodes out of order, showing ones that had more action first, and not allowing the proper introduction that the first episode ""Serenity"" would have provided. When will they learn? Those executives should stop tinkering with a brilliant man such as Joss' vision and imagination, and simply let him get on with what he does best.Another thing that emerges from the interviews is how tightly-knitted the whole cast were. The casting was done extraordinarily well, and you can really see the individuals displaying a huge amount of camaraderie, caring for one another immensely, both on-screen as well as off-screen. The chemistry between all the various characters is subtle yet noticeable, and that is pure brilliance at work. In the interview, Ron Glass (Shepherd Book) talks about how everyone bursted into tears at the end of the final episode they filmed, and your heart totally goes out to them.After watching all 14 episodes (three of which were never aired on TV) and all the extras on the DVD (including an Easter egg of Jayne singing!), I was relentless in my quest to resurrect this series. Upon surfing the web, I realized I wasn't alone - there were legions of fans out there, all wanting to keep the magic alive. In fact, it was so touching to witness their dedication - after the show was canceled, they even took out a full page ad in Daily Variety, proclaiming, ""You keep flying. We'll keep watching."" Truly inspiring, and obvious proof that if this series was anything less than extraordinary, you wouldn't get this sort of outstanding reaction.Well, the good news is that after the DVD was released last December, sales rocketed through the roof and Universal sat up and took notice. They have since bought the rights and Joss has just finished filming a movie titled ""Serenity"" (incidentally, this is the name of the ship, also known as the tenth character), scheduled to hit theatres on April 22, 2005. While the movie won't make up for the continuity of the series, it is great to see a positive step in the right direction and I will keep supporting this series in hopes of a revival on TV. I have already gone round spreading the word, and to date, I have bought over 10 copies of the DVD from Amazon just to give away to friends and family. It is amazing how under-publicized the series was - none of my friends have even heard of it. The challenge to broaden awareness is steep, but I won't rest till the word is out - that Joss has truly created something special, a series worthy of residing in the halls of TV legacy. Now, go purchase a copy and spread the word too...!"	5.0	Truly outstanding! Go forth and spread the word!	2004-09-27	10	10	0

I'm a bit disappointed, as that's AT LEAST what any DVD or BD set should have is an episode guide, hopefully one with a short summary, but at least one with titles.  That's why I'm giving it 3 stars.  Apparently, whoever set this up assumed that the viewers would only throw the discs in one by one and push ""play all"".  Not good.  I'm very ticked off right now, because I'm having trouble finding episodes for my wife and me to watch, and I'm throwing in one disc after another to find them.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJ9V5W4WTAZQZ	"Shooter ""rico fardan"""	I love Western. I dont really love sciene fiction. But the idea of a combination seemed like a great idea to me when I heard about Firefly. And yes, it's a good show. And yes, it was wrongfully cancelled by Fox. With another season to go the show would have probably gotten rid of some of its problems.Because there are a few. A couple of episodes are really slow (and that theme song adds to it, nothing wrong with country music but even the credit sequence seems slow thanks to that song), some feel clumsily directed (Shindig for example with its seemingly neverending dance sequence). Sometimes there isnt really much story in an episode and it shows, things kinda crawl along, nice but not really engaging. Also the show never manages to make anything out of it guest stars, they are mostly in for only a few scenes and hardly have any roles to fill with life.And even though after wachting a couple of episodes you really get to like the characters on good ol Serentiy they oftentimes  have a very artificial feeling to them. Okay, I buy Nathan Fillion as Captain Mal, good old fashioned tough guy with a heart. But cute Jewel Straite as mechanic Kaylee - sorry, just because you smeer some grease in a pretty actress face and have her fumble around with some screws doesnt make her a believable mechanic. Same goes for Alan Tudyk as the Pilot. He pushes some buttons, but you never for a second buy that he's the capable pilot of a spaceship. Of course its science fiction, but when you create your own world you gotta make it believable and in Firefly very often I feel things are existing just because Whedon and his folks want them to exist and too often they fail in making us believe.Plus there is, similar to Buffy, an uneven balance of the right dialogue at the right time. Often you get funny oneliners that just feel wrong, that feel written, because the writer thinks there funny (and they are), but they are just wrong for the character and the things that happen in the story at that moment. Adam Baldwins character Jayne is good example: sometimes he's a real mean dude, someone you fear, because you never know what he's gonna do next or which side he's on, then the next time he's played for laughs and comes across as a bulky idiot.But all these flaws aside its a good show to watch and to recommend, not perfect, but I would have loved to see things evolving in another season. I would have loved to see what happened in the classic love-hate-relationship of Mel and Inora, I would have loved to see who the preacher really is (because for now he's a rather boring character which the writers never made much use of - but you get hints, he might be a real badass). I would have loved to see the show pick up speed and make use of its strenghs. Too bad televison nowadays hardly gives a show a second chance. But in the case of Firefly we at least have the feature film to look forward too. I cant wait to see in which ways Whedon takes his show to the big screen.	4.0	good show, but not without flaws	2004-06-23	13	6	7

This said, the blu-ray looks very grainy and all of the space scenes looked out of focus. I don't really think one have to blame the lenses on this one: when you are selling High Definition, you're expected to give High Definition, not low-def rendering of the CGI's and ultra compressed episodes cramped in the smallest set of blu-rays.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1CAFC6O2H3YNM	siloute	So this is where me and the girlfriend are coming from. We are not big Sci-Fi people but people kept on saying you have to check out Battlestar Galactica. So I was able to convince the GF to watch (she is  not a fan of Sci-Fi) and we watched five hours the first night.  So we loved BSG (though thought the ending for BSG was lacking - but that is another discussion ) We were recommending BSG to our friends, and they said they had already watched it, and if we liked BSG that we might like Firefly.  So we instantly picked it up.Well, it took a few episodes of firefly to get used to the mix of western and space genres. But it was very entertaining and brought some real new orginal stuff to the screen. (though, I kept getting reminded of the star wars character, Hans-solo with the mix of space and western outlaw) Its an interesting ensemble cast and some good storylines.So if you are a fan of BSG and haven't gotten to firefly I would recommend it. It really is a pity it was only on for one season because I think the stories and acting would have only gotten better with more chemistry and actors and writers getting a feel for the roles.all that said, its still a mix of space and western which could be a turnoff to people.  It reminds me of fusion food, where they combine two different genres of food. theres a sushi fusion place that serves hispanic inspired sushi rolls.  its that type of combination , that you will either love or it might turn you off, but definetly worth trying.	4.0	coming off of battlestar galactica	2010-12-27	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AI0KXH1O95X0H	"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles"""	"I first came to learn of ""Firefly"" after seeing ""Serenity."" About a month ago, HBO Signature Asia began advertising the feature film ""Serenity"" in most cable channels here. I found it odd that HBO would advertise in a channel other than its own. Initially, I felt that there must be some kind of buzz for HBO to do this. I do know from a year before that Mr. Roger Ebert gave ""Serenity"" some good marks but I just wasn't able to see it, either because it didn't show here, or maybe I just missed it. So by HBO's recommendations, I watched it. ""Serenity"" did leave some good impressions on me. Who says that Science Fiction movies need to be high- budgeted in order to work?So how do I describe Firefly?? Truly, it is unlike anything I've ever seen. While it is undoubtedly a science fiction, the feel of the Western Frontier past and some cultural mixture of East and West have been thrown into the lot. It's like...... well, it's like throwing the carrots, celery, spinach and the squash all together into the blender. While this fruit and vegetable concoction may not be so good, ""Firefly"" on the other hand, is. Despite its flaws, this show has a high amount of likeability.Okay, sorry to you Browncoats for saying that the show has some faults, but here are two or three that I must point out:1.) First off, I think the actors need to improve their Chinese. 95% of the time when they speak Chinese, I can't understand a GORRAM! thing they're saying. And, I'm supposed to understand it, living in Taiwan and all. So instead of being serious about a scene, I sometimes find myself guffawing after they've said their Chinese lines. However, this misfire will mostly go unnoticed to Western viewers.2.) Second, since ""Firefly"" is a mixture of the future and the past, it sometimes suffers heavily from present day mentality. I really do not know how to explain this well. It's like the Future but with the Present Day mentality imposed on it. For example, one would think that in the future, security technology would have made it hard for crooks to find a loophole in the system. But right there during the episode ""Trash,"" we see our heroes hack the garbage disposal system IN BROAD DAYLIGHT and in a place that was supposed to be crawling with Feds!! Maybe the feds were sleeping or the tracking computer malfunctioned when our heroes were performing their heist. Hmmm, the police sleeping and computers malfunctioning........... sounds like the present.3.) There are other flaws, but these are mostly minor. Things like budgetary constraints and some of the CGI that could have used improvement (like the canyon chase in the episode ""The Message."")Far from downgrading the show, I point the above because I really wish that ""Firefly"" gets a second season soon. To Mr. Joss Whedon: I hope my suggestions are helpful. ""Firefly"" has a lot of potential in it. Frankly, I'd rather choose this show than the new ""Battlestar Galactica."" (Although, I must point out that ""B.G."" is a good show itself. It's just that it sometimes feels like it goes on and on in a circle that we get tired of the supposed character development. And, it has somewhat become obvious who the Ceylons masquerading as humans are. Really, most of the time, I get this feeling that no actual human have been left alive and that all those on board Galactica and Pegasus are actually Ceylons just waiting for their programs to start up!!)""Firefly"" has a lot going for it. The characters, while these are essentially space thieves and smugglers, are likeable enough and never stereotyped. It's the relationships between the characters that make it work. As the show progressed on, there's almost no contention between the crew members. Captain Reynolds has one very loyal crew there! This is the magic formula that gets them through all their dangerous adventures (especially in the episode ""War Stories."" Anyway, I guess I'm just tired of shows that have mutinous crews in them.)Another thing that ""Firefly"" has in its advantage is its lack of pretension. This is the Layman's Science Fiction. It totally lacks the technical lingo that is the trademark of the Star Trek Series. And, while there are no aliens about or any presentation of how aliens live on other planets, it does give us a view of what human life on the frontier planets might be like. Sadly though, there aren't enough episodes to really give us a larger picture of this.....The cultural mishmash in this Whedonesque `verse help make it all fresh; as do the script and the witty dialogues. There's a good dose of humor thrown in to make things fun. And, it's not dumb as some purport it to be, but quite intelligent (except when it shows that Present Day Mentality.) I like the character Mr. Nathan Fillion plays, as the Captain Malcolm Reynolds and this relationship he has with Inara (Morena Baccarin.) Both of them have trememdous sex appeal. There's electricity there between them but kept wisely in check.Overall, ""Firefly"" entertains. But to be fair to you REAVERS out there, I must say that it may not please everyone's tastes. Except ice cream, what does anyway?? (GASP!!! Did I just say Reavers?? *Shocked* I mean to say `Readers.' Apologies!!)  If you watch the show, just go along for the ride, suppress the Critic in you, then put it under the sofa and sit on it if you have to. Eventually, there's a good chance that the ""Firefly"" glow will get into you, because it really has that quality.Not since ""Brisco County,"" ""Star Trek Voyager"" and ""Friends"" have I been entertained like this. Of course, this is my opinion. It's up to you REAVERS to find out for yourself. GASP!!! I did it again!!!!!"	5.0	Fresh Concept With A Highly Likeable Cast, And I'm Not Even A Browncoat	2006-12-31	3	3	0

These are not flawless white-hat heroes; they're not even flawed but superhuman and Automatically On the Side of Good, like Buffy or Angel.  Moral issues are addressed but always in deep shades of grey, and legality and morality are firmly separated.  The crew of ""Serenity"" is made of regular people in difficult circumstances, doing what they need to, trying to make a buck, stay alive, maybe get a little ahead, and - above all - keep flying.The show is violent, sometimes graphically so; frequently emotionally intense; and most of all, side-splittingly funny.  There are deeply satisfying moments, some unanswered questions, and an impressive level of depth and characterization in the brief space Whedon was given to work.  The only downside to watching ""Firefly"" is the agonizing disappointment to realizing that it's only fourteen episodes, and over all too soon."	5.0	Cowboys, pirates, and spaceships, the Joss way	2005-09-24	10	10	0

I love Buffy, Angel and Firefly for different reasons, and my mood ultimately picks which DVD to pop it.  Most of the time, it's Firefly.The people are real, and they do what they must to survive in a world that isn't always easy to survive in.  The bonds on the ship are that of a family who take care of their own.I enjoy a lot of different types of shows.  I love Friends, Veronica Mars rocks my socks, N3mbers is fantasic, and I enjoy the occasional Dawson's Creek(for Pacey).

People didn't not watch Firefly when it first aired on a Friday night time slot because, of course, they were out and about. Fox, clearly unable to see the potential, did move it to a different night or air commercials announcing the VCR or TiVO to these people and suggest they record it for later viewing.However, now we all have a chance to own all 14 glorious episode on DVD (and we have a movie to boot!) all because of the rave reviews given by so many loyal fans. The fans of Firefly gave off such a strong response to the show that Joss was finally able to get something done with the project.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2IMOB5P6C15GA	Slobodan Milosevic	"You'll like this show. Why is there slavery on Firefly? It's a cool way to show how very nasty the Alliance is. But there is the question, ""Once slavery ends, why would it ever return again in the distant future?"" In Russian history, serfdom ended only to return because of technological change. What kind of technological change brings back serfdom to Firefly's universe? First, a little history from economist Paul Krugman and then a quick comparison with Firefly: Serfdom in Russia wasn't an institution that dated back to the Dark Ages. Instead, it was mainly a 16th-century creation, contemporaneous with the beginning of the great Russian expansion into the Ukraine. There's no point in enslaving or enserfing a man unless the wage you would have to pay him if he was free is substantially above the cost of feeding, housing, and clothing him.Imagine a pre-industrial society where population is pressing on limited land supplies, and the marginal product of labor - and hence the real wage rate under competitive conditions - is barely at subsistence. In that case, why bother with establishing property rights in human beings? It costs no more to hire a free worker than to feed a slave. Indeed, by 1300 - with Europe very much a Malthusian society - serfdom had withered away from lack of interest.But now suppose that for some reason land becomes abundant [new planets terraformed], and labor scarce. Then competition among landowners will tend to push up wages of free workers, and the ruling class will try, IF ALLOWED, to pin peasants down and prevent them from bargaining for a higher standard of living. In Russia, it was all about gunpowder: suddenly steppe nomads were no longer so formidable, and the rich lands of the Ukraine were open for settlement. Serfdom was an effort to keep peasants from taking advantage of this situation. Those who were venturesome enough to run away and set up outside the system became Cossacks.And now for the analogues between history and Firefly:(1) Russia is the Core Worlds, industrial center of the Universe.(2) Gunpowder is terraforming of planets and moons to make land in the Outer Worlds.(3) Ukraine is the pre-industrial Outer Worlds; its peasants are being enslaved.(4) Cossacks gone mad are Reavers, the scariest villains in the Universe.In a universe ruled by money, not morals, slavery is a real possibility. And there is worse than slavery: the Alliance has a 'gray' market in human organs for transplantation. Serfs become spare parts for ailing Capitalists.Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Fox TV network that cancelled Firefly, put two cheap ""reality"" video shows 'Totally Outrageous Behavior' and 'World's Craziest Videos' into Firefly's Friday night timeslot. Why does America not deport him for tastelessness? He'd own slaves if it were legal. And sell their hearts for profit. He's already sold his own."	5.0	The KILLER ANGELS: Slavery and Worse	2004-11-03	9	0	9
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A226T629DV1GNB	Slobodan Milosevic	"Best TV show I have ever seen and I am 63 years old. But these reviews from America are so earnest and sincere. Lighten up, Fans; it is only a TV show, not a religion. Or is Firefly the opiate of the masses? By watching our Firefly DVDs over and over again, we fans escape our pathetic lives enslaved to our jobs and fears. We can only dream of the camaraderie, freedom, and courage of the Serenity crew. I have a lot of time in jail to watch Firefly. I dream of freedom. And I can sing all the words to ""The Ballad of Jayne.""When humanity left Earth, it left behind its 'shiny' ethics and took its corroded antiques: a ruling class, fascism, religious fanaticism, slavery, piracy, torture, cannibalism! It is a corrupt Capitalist Universe. The Core worlds of the Alliance are rich and the exploited colonies are poor. Captain Mal has the brains to keep flying and trading between the planets and not become a victim. And he has the guns, lots of guns. The firefly crew and passengers know how to use guns. The firefly people can shoot, charm, or trade with anyone except those damn cannibals, who want meat, not money. These angelic-looking firefly people are ""killer angels"" killing the bad guys. Each one is smart and charming in their own way, even that thug Jayne Cobb. What a jerk-off, Jayne is! Zo and Mal are fighting a part-time guerrilla war against the Alliance. Both want revenge, Mal even more than Zo. He hates the Alliance more than I hate the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal. To spite the Alliance, Mal will go to enormous trouble to keep crazy Miss River Tam out of Alliance prison.  Mal, rescue me from prison! I want out so I can see your movie ""Serenity"" in 2005.Why do the outer worlds live in the 19th century and the Core worlds live in the 26th century?  Karl Marx explained that when government does not regulate Capitalists, they will always use their power to impoverish the workers. If there is no stortage of workers, wages will fall to the subsistence level, barely enough to keep a worker alive. Automobiles, good food, and indoor plumbing are luxuries that most workers on the outer worlds can not afford. A Pure Capitalist like Fox Network owner Rupert Murdock is without mercy toward workers; he is a Reaver without the cannibalism. Firefly was cancelled because it was a devastating critique of Murdock's Pure Capitalism. The evil executives at FOX Network are NOT idiots; Murdock would have fired the executives unless they canceled Firefly. Oh, and Kaylee looks Serbian to me. She is perfectly ripe fruit. She is hot. Hot! _HOT!!_  It is good to dream that Serbian women will go to the stars. Keep flying everyone and sing-a-long:...

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A912C7977MO6O	Smallchief	"I just finished watching the last episode on the last DVD of the now-cancelled TV series ""Firefly."" This was a show that deserved to last a while. Instead we got 14 episodes and a good movie, ""Serenity.""Firefly"" is a space Western set 500 years in the future. Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the eight persons in his crew -- each of them individualistic and finely crafted -- are petty crooks and gunmen, including a mechanic, a pilot, a beautiful ""companion"", a preacher, a doctor, and a mysterious weird child. They skulk around the inhabited planets in their decrepit spaceship ""Serenity"" looking for work and plunder. Behind this simple outline are deep and dark stories.The Serenity crew is a diverse, close-knit, mutually-supportive group we'd all like to belong too. They have their warts and they fight and argue -- but the come together when it matters. The set is wonderful; the interior of a space ship that looks like it works, not a tin foil mock up. The soundtrack music is appropriately creepy; the camera work is oddly-angled; the lighting goes from the brightest of bright to dark and menacing. The script is clever and amusing. Homey scenes alternate with quick violence, brutality, and a fair amount of sex.""Firefly"" reminds me of the old TV Western ""Maverick"" with James Garner. ""Maverick"" was a Western like you had never seen before with everything just a bit off-kilter. ""Firefly"" is like this. Watch one episode and you'll be shaking your head and saying ""Kinda strange -- but not bad."" Watch two or three episodes and you'll be hooked. The story is told at a leisurely pace but plot lines are shooting off in every direction.Smallchief"	5.0	Why does a cancelled show have 2,482 reviews?	2006-05-15	10	9	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A7BASC4KJQ2XF	S. McClenning	This series is so great because it is so close to reality.  No warp drive, no beaming, no shields or phasers.  Just people on a ship, trying to stay free from government control.At first I didn't get the series completely, but the more I watched it, the more I began to understand all the different plots and levels of the characters.  (Personally, I want to know Shepard Book's story.)This series has a lot of leg room to continue.  I hope they make a season in the time frame after season 1 and before the movieSerenity (Widescreen Edition).There are some great lines in the series and unbelievably funny.  A must have for any Sci-Fi fan.	5.0	Wild West meets space - Awesome!!!	2007-07-15	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AR1NP84PU84D4	S. Melvin	"...and Fox and the general public let him down. Yes, the show ended before its time due to lack of interest by the general public, FOX's bad decision making, and even - at least in my view - poor marketing to begin with. Heck, I didn't know this show even existed until after it went off the air (yes, I am part of that general public that let this fantastic show die - I am ashamed). You will likely read countless reviews here on Amazon describing the excellent story, the detailed worlds, the fine acting (okay, not 100%, but better than most we see on TV these days), and the ability to capture ones imagination and make you want to watch the next episode and the entire series (over and over again). That is the gift that Joss brought to us with this series and the movie. Is this show for everyone? No - but that's like asking if Star Wars, Avengers, or Family Guy is for everyone. There is a market for this show and it saddens me that it wasn't ""big"" enough for the bean counters. It also saddens me that no one else has picked this up (and that Joss himself seems to have moved on to other projects). But alas, you can read about this epic adventure all you like - I simply ask that you give it a try and rate it yourself.Amazon helps in that endeavor by making the entire series available via Amazon Prime streaming. Not only do you get great, fast free 2-day shipping, but you get the ability to watch series like this and many others at no additional cost. If not here, then try your local video store or that big red box or that streaming/DVD company that rhymes with ""wetmix"" (okay, not my most creative, but you get the idea). I can safely promise that this series is like no other you've likely seen. It brings together Sci-Fi, Western, Action, and Adventure into one fantastic 1-season series. I've purchased this numerous times already (for myself, for a gift, as a replacement for myself when someone close asked for my copy, etc) and now even watch it on occasion via Amazon Prime, even though I have the discs. As you can tell, my review is likely biased by the fact that this series changed my opinion of a good TV series, like Matrix did in the 90s and Star Wars did in the 70s for Sci-Fi viewing audiences. But again, don't take my word for it - just check it out yourself."	5.0	Joss at his finest...	2012-11-01	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1YUY0XEUYSOHS	"SolidStateMind ""avid reader"""	Long before he received the widespread attention that he deserved for 'The Avengers', Joss Whedon has been creating original properties, both in the wasteland of network programming as well as for the big screen.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and (later) Dollhouse infused the small screen with a breath of fresh air.  'Cabin In The Woods' was a refreshing take on the Horror genre and the associated tropes.But.If I were going to pick one of Mr. Whedon's works, it would be 'Firefly' and the associated movie 'Serenity'.  Perhaps the idea of a Western set in space isn't entirely new, but 'Firefly' certainly is the first iteration to reach a mass audience.  Complex characters, a very well developed setting, intriguing stories, and even a good sense of humor all contribute not just to an excellent Sci-Fi tale, but a show that is engaging and entertaining regardless of what genre one in which one would classify it.  You could literally put on any episode and I will sit, enraptured, for it in its entirety, regardless of the fact that I have seen all of the content many times.'Firefly' is the absolute first on my list of recommendations.

Had it been allowed a decent televised run, I could easily have seen this becoming the best of Whedon's creations. I think that even in its short 14-episode run, it had much more potential for suspense and plot twistage, and the casting was the best I've seen outside of HBO's dramas.

If you have never watched an episode, or only saw a few back in 2002 when it was being broadcast, then you have missed out.  To truly appreciate the concept you have to watch the episodes as they are ordered on the DVD boxed set.  I have hooked more than 20 of my family and friends just by asking them to sit down and watch the pilot (none of these people consider themselves sci-fi or western fans).  Every time we have ended up in an extended binge session watching episode after episode.  This experience left them very entertained, but also irritated that the show was cancelled.  The writing is excellent and the acting is perfect so that by the time you finish the boxed set you have come to know and love these nine characters (ten if you count the ship Serenity) and you really want to learn more about how their stories play out.  The extras on the DVD, and there are a lot, provide many more hours of entertainment and there is tremendous replay value to the episodes.

I have watched it twice now, and I am stunned by how powerful these characters and their stories are.The Firefly universe is rich and tangible. The characters are complex and real. They grow on you. By the third episode I felt I had made some good friends, and by the last episode I never wanted them to leave. I cried when it was over, then went back and watched the series all over again. I love these guys.The best episode is Objects in Space, the last episode. It was shocking, suspenseful, and had one of the best villians I have ever seen (though I think the best villians of the show are the ones we never get to see).This series had me falling in love. I fell in love with the characters, with Serenity, and with the show. This series broke my heart because it ended. I hope the Firefly movie is produced, I hope it does well, and I hope Firefly is brought back to TV where I can see what happens to the characters of a world I love so much.I recommend this series to anyone who likes action, romance, suspense, and rich character development.

Most of the planets and towns they visit are frontier type towns.  Of course there is higher technology than we have now but most people can't afford it.  Also, there is not a single known alien race in the entire galaxy.  The cast is great and they really mesh.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves science fiction.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHZFJ1Z2A3FKQ	"Spare-Time Critic ""Deb"""	This series was practically unadvertised, shown out of order, pre-empted frequently and finally canceled before completing its first season. Why? Because the network execs had their heads firmly wedged in very dark, uncomfortable places.Ever since it got canceled, I've been hoping against hope for some kind of miracle. This DVD set was the first part of that miracle. The upcoming movie, &quot;Serenity,&quot; due in the Summer of 2005, is the second. If you don't see this series before that movie comes out, you are going to miss out on one of the best sci-fi adventures to hit the big or small screens. You can't EVEN be planning to shell out your hard-earned money for the next Star Wars ripoff and not see &quot;Serenity&quot; . . . can you? No, I'll answer that: You can't.&quot;What's the big deal,&quot; you ask? Ok, look, I'll tell you straight up -- this is a space western. Yes. There are spaceships in the skies and cattle rustlers on the ground. Does that sound cheesy? Well, it did to me, but then I saw the first episode and I was hooked. The characters are so fascinating, the dialogue so witty, the situations so interesting, I just can't get enough of this show. Literally. It could be about space turnip farmers and I would love it. The reason for the rustic living conditions is kind of explained, and you do get used to it. Really!And now for the good stuff: There are no regulations-spouting goody-goodies here. Sometimes the crew does the noble thing, sometimes not. Bad guys usually get what's coming to them, whether it's &quot;the right thing to do&quot; or not. Some of the characters are mostly good, some you're not sure about, and &quot;Jayne&quot; in particular (Adam Baldwin's character) is so thoroughly rotten and untrustworthy, you want to kill him, but he's so annoyingly FUNNY you'd hate it if he were gone. I came to love EVERY character, even Jayne, and yet there is always the real possibility a main character will bite the dust. The dialogue is so good, every episode is like a favorite book you regret finishing. That's Good Writing.But hey, who am I? If I can't convince you to buy the DVD set, at least borrow someone else's and watch one episode. That should do it. If you do get hooked, like I did, do your part to spread the word. I've turned two people on to Firefly, and maybe they'll tell others. Most people I mention it to NEVER heard of it. That's a crying shame. (My fingers are crossed for the third part of the miracle -- a revival of the series on a smarter network. It COULD happen.)	5.0	10 Stars.

Maybe I wouldn't be as emphatic in my opinion if I had paid 50% more.  That's probably the right price point to buy this if you already own the SD set.  I would not have paid $50+.  This way I get the added benefit of being able to give the other set to someone who should already have seen it.I've only watched the pilot Serenity but I think the special effects scenes look improved.  The scavenger scene early in the episode looked great.  I always had a hard time picking serenity out of the flotsam in the standard definition, now it's crystal clear.Maybe wait until you can grab it for &lt;$40 and you've found someone you want to give your old copy to.

Perhaps it is Firefly's limited run that makes it so damn amazing, because you have no choice but to be left wanting more.  Joss is best with his comedic timing, and quirky, yet compelling characters.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A7OVAB9PEZXP	SPIKE JAMES	In my last review I stated that I was angry FOX took off 'Dark Angel' to air Firefly. Then another reviewer gives this big long explanation on why it was cancelled. Let me tell you something KAD, Dark Angel could have lasted at least 5 seasons. If FOX was serious about Firefly they should have aired the episodes in the correct order. FOX should have known Firefly wouldn't last if the story arch was out of order. So basically they took off a show that would have lasted to put a shown on that would be aired out of order. I think maybe if FOX aired Firefly in order it might have lasted 3 seasons, but since they didn't the world will never know. I'm sorry that I'm a hard core Dark Angel fan, but I don't know hy Firefly wasn't aired on SCIFI in the first place. It would have saved DARK ANGEL fan a loss of a great show.The only reason why I gave this show 2 stars is because it was very creative of Joss to think of a Space Western	2.0	Firefly	2005-07-30	86	3	83

But what really makes this show work is the clever, witty writing and the suberb ensemble cast - interesting characters that interact in interesting ways.

I would call it cowboys in space, but very well done. The combination of humor, action and sci-fi is addictive. The humor in all his work is so sly - it has a feel of real-worldness to it - that there are many truths and more depth than most realize to Whedon's work. I recommend it just for the humor, not to mention the action and adventure. I would also recommend buying the movie Serenity to go with this series. It ties up all the loose ends and gives more of a feeling of closure.	5.0	Joss Whedon fan here	2007-08-06	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AMNJJ9VAQEA86	Spunk Monkey	You love Buffy and Angel, and you have heard of this show, which was also helmed by Joss Whedon, and you heard it was canceled, and that its Sci Fi. Not really being too excited about wasting your money, but curious about the show, you've meandered over to the customer review section at Amazon.com. Now you've met me (Hello!)and I say, &quot;Firefly is the show that was too good to live.&quot; You wonder what I mean by this, and, to your excitment (OK, I'm being melodramatic) you discover that I am now about to explain. And I say...I was just being ironic. I don't believe there was a conspiracy to kill Firefly because it was too good, it's just that Firefly WAS so good, it figures that it would only last fourteen episodes and then be axed.Firefly, as I imagine it, was the imaginative playground of an extraorinarily creative team of artists who give free rein to their every latent productive urge that could not be expressed on Buffy/Angel. Firefly seems to have been designed in such a way that almost any genre or theme could be explored in a variety of strange and fascinating combinations that would have been impossible in any other format.The show combines its thematic twists, genre busting, and stylistic conventions into a postmodern brew that comments on the contemporary while projecting it into the future and past.With nine fascinating and charasmatic characters introduced in this series, the possibilities would have been endless for a show such as this. One can only imagine where Whedon and crew would have taken this show, but faint glimmers are hinted at by a variety of nestled clues and hints.It is very depressing that it was canceled, but its unfinished nature does not make it to unworthwhile to watch, for we have fourteen existing episodes. And what makes them so great to watch is the obvious love the artists put into the show, and how much fun it obviously was to make.I cannot recommend this show highly enough. The show was not designed to be a cash cow, but as an outlet for the expression of the artisic potentials of some very talented individuals for whom this show was obviously no joke (though frequently hilarious). The show was created by some very intelligent minds, and it does not stupify its content; like Hitchcock, it functions wonderfully on two levels, entertaiment and intellectual. No matter how short this star burned, its light was bright, and it leaves an afterburn in the mind, which inspires both heartfelt gratitude and the grief of dashed potential.	5.0	Firefly to good to live	2003-12-30	3	2	1

And they are wonderful, particularly three of them. The last one I watched made me scream that the show had been canceled. And here's a quick prayer for the hoped-for movie.Fans of the show will love this DVD, especially being able to view the shows in the order Whedon would have liked. The behind-the-scenes featurettes really show how much the show meant to the cast and crew. In fact, I'd recommend viewing at least one of those before beginning the series if you're new to Firefly. The gag reel is fun, especially the ending(!).For those new to Firefly, yes, even these few episodes are worth watching. This was a show aired by those who did not understand it, and TV land is sorrier for its loss. The characters and their situations and interactions are engaging. The ensemble cast excels at making the viewer immediately care about these people. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this show; in fact, fans of westerns may like it just as much. Watch at least 2-3 episodes; give yourself a chance to catch on to the show's unique qualities. It's a gem.This may have been my best present this year.	5.0	Finally -- at least we have the DVD	2004-01-12	9	8	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	"I was one of the people who loved Dark Angel. Fox in their infinite wisdom rescheduled that show to its death apparently to make room for this new sci-fi series by the creator of Buffy. So I was a bit put off by this ""Firefly"" show replacing one of my favorite programs at the time. I'm still a sci-fi fan so I watched Firefly. By the end of that premier episode (which ironically wasn't the first episode... more of Fox's infinite wisdom) I realize I'm looking at an innovative and well presented program. I still miss Dark Angel and wished it had a longer lifespan, but I in no way fault Joss Whedon and his excellent show Firefly for that.Firefly is a beautiful blend of old west and outer space. Sounds strange, right? Well take it from me. The concept works. It works better than it might sound outright. The reason it works is because of two things: The backdrop universe they created and the well-written stories in front of it. The back-story is rich with history and this show takes a life of its own because of it. When the program is over you really get the feel that these people in this futuristic/western society is going. Kudos to Joss for sticking strong with that continuity.The writing for this show is nothing short of excellent and reaches the level of gifted more than once. I think what really makes the show fresh is that you can never really know what the characters will do next. You know their disposition and who they are, but just about every episode has some scene where someone does something unexpected yet still in character. After seeing tons of shows where people actions are so predictable you wonder why you bother watching Firely gives you that extra effort.This is not a family show in case some of you are thinking Firefly is Star Wars-esque. Every episode has elements of violence and sexual situations at one level or another. At the same time the complicated moral delimas the characters deal with can be considered a good thing for a thinking teen to watch. While Firefly isn't a ""parents strongly cautioned"" kind of show I would assume it a PG-13 (TV-14, whatever) if you are screening for your kids.The DVD set is a must buy. Not only do you get every episode that aired, but also episodes that didn't. The ones we missed are well worth seeing. Actually some of the best episodes can be found there. The documentaries are pretty cool too. The production method is a bit different than what most television producers would decide, and I think that makes a difference. There is an outtakes or blooper reel in the DVD too. It's not that amazing, but you get a chance to see the actors have a bit of fun. The other extras are short, but nice enough. Nothing I would consider dead weight. Haven't heard the commentiary. When I do I'll update the review.Considering the price and the quality of the show this DVD set is a steal. The DVD quality is top notch too (sharp picture, crisp and clear audio). If you are a sci-fi fan and missed this show you REALLY need to check this out. It's top notch storytelling with top notch effects, sets and acting. Fox has never been good with their sci-fi shows. Only X-Files got proper treatment from them in spite of the fact they had some other high quality programs (which were all treated like dirt). Firefly should have had a longer lifespan. Maybe with the Serenity movie and the Sci-Fi Channel's interest there will be more to see in the future. Here's hoping."	5.0	Fantastic sci-fi adventure series	2005-06-21	11	11	0

Scott	This is without doubt one of the best made television series of all time, and that it was cancelled after only one season is unfathomable.  The production value is excellent.  The writing is uniformly top-notch.  The direction is superb.  The acting is world-class.  This is one of only a few series where the cast hits the ground running, as if the viewer is truly dropping in on the middle of a longer-running story.  In my experience this only happens rarely.  I'm a huge star trek fan and I'll be the first to admit the early episodes in virtually every series show evidence of characters who are still finding their place in relation to others.I didn't see Firefly when it aired - I first heard about it after the new Battlestar Galactica mini-series came out, and a friend said, &#34;did you notice Serenity in the opening scenes?&#34;  After &#34;What's Serenity?&#34; I learned about this series, that my friend said &#34;I have three copies of the DVD's.  One for myself, one to loan out, and one 'just in case'.&#34;  Well, now I've owned five of these sets, two of which have gone to new homes after loaning out to people who fell in love with it.The packaging has greatly improved.  The first several sets I bought had a separate plastic case for each of the four DVD's.  Now it comes in one box with multiple disc holders.Bottom line:  if you like science fiction, shows that are well written, and characters with depth, I guarantee you will love this show.

It's inhuman.Speaking of FOX bastards, if the series Hero's can get &#34;Reborn&#34; by NBC, why can't FOX reboot this series or sell it's rights to another studio that actually would want to produce more episodes?  Most of the cast seems to be available and down to do something like that.Oh, and you 1-Star voters: You have no soul.	5.0	Short-Lived Brilliance	2014-03-29	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2HH46NQZZ1ZB7	starlit_one	Let me explain to you something about Firefly.  This is not for the fans, or for anyone who's seen a couple of the episodes.This is for the people who have had no chance to know just how good this show is.  And to them I say:This is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen grace the small screen.  This is the show that was so good that, while it was airing, the fans raised thousands of dollars to take out a full page newspaper add thanking the creators and asking Fox to keep the show on the air.  That didn't happen.  Not everyone can understand, or want to.This is the show that makes me laugh, and alternately cry.  It is realistic, and beautiful in the way that only things that are real and honest are.Joss Whedon said it was about nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things.  It is also about the right to be free and independent.The story is that a doctor breaks his sister out of a top secret government institution that has been torturing her.  They take refuge and run from the law on one Serenity, firefly class spaceship captained by Mal Reynolds, a verteran on the losing side (the independents) of a galactic civil war.  There are no aliens in this space western.  The reason that there are no aliens is because this show is about humanity, and all its problems, trials and tribulations.  Joss Whedon didn't see the need to throw aliens into the mix to 'create problems'.The characters are standard fare: a preacher, hardass butt-kicking woman, pilot, captain, mechanic, burly ill-mannered hardass guy, crazy genuis butt-kicking girl (more of a Whedon thing), and companion (well-educated member of the world's olderst known profession, though more of a geisha).  The actors were exemplarily cast, and there is excellent chemistry between them.  And each gets their 'moment to shine' in which they become more than cliches.It's a damn shame that this wasn't given more of a chance to be a success like it could have been.  Like it should have been.  Even with the movie, there is so much untold story.  But I the avoidant of cliffhangers, who went into catatonic shock at the end of Gone With the Wind...I tell you that Firefly as it is, uncompleted, is more complete than a great many things, that just because it didn't get its proper run, is no reason not to watch.  If I valued gold, I would say that Firefly is like gold.  Instead I shall say that it is like books :)	5.0	More Complete than a Great Many Things.	2006-01-12	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHNAQ5H7CKK9N	"""stealthhawk21"""	It's disheartening when one of the best shows ever to hit the small screen suddenly gets cancelled. But that's Fox for ya. How many series have they cancelled now? Far too many.From the day it started I was hooked on this series. I've always like sci-fi but never considered that a space western was even possible. Joss Whedon totally pulls it off. As the summary mentions, It's about a group of rag-tag off in space and around the Outer planet all aboard this one ship, Serenity. Each character is there for a different reason, and each one has a story to trheir character that goes way beyond what was show before the show was cancelled.In terms of plot and character developement, it is the best I've seen in a TV show in quite a while. Most character you see out there are flakes with not much substance to them, but with all of the characters in Firefly, you can tell that there are things that they are just not sharing. Especially Shepard Book. How is it possible that a preacher knows so much and work his way around the Alliance? Besides what was revealed in Ariel, what really happened to River? Such questions will never be answered, unless the movie Joss is working on makes it to the big screenSo, for those who have no idea what Firefly is, check it out. And if you do know, then there's no sense in saying it, you'd be buying the DVDs.	5.0	You can't take they sky from me	2003-12-09	7	7	0

You fall for the cast and want more.  I happily became aware of Firefly after watching Serenity. After being smitten by Serenity, I was thrilled to learn there was more and happily lapped it up.  And then, after the one and only short season came to an end, I was sad and hoped that some day there will be more in some shape or form.If not, oh well. At least there was what there was.Buy it not once, nor twice, but Thrice.  Give it out as gifts.  With sales like that, maybe there'll be more.Shiny!	5.0	Me Likey!!	2007-06-28	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A23SP5HQPTJNOH	Stella K	After 10 years of hearing nothing but great things about this show, I finally took the plunge.  The plunge being a one weekend marathon leaving me feeling somehow accomplished and sad that it could not continue.  I would advise that you space out your viewing a bit more than I did, but view it you must!  Like many shows canceled before their time, Firefly has garnered a cult following to rival any and the reasons are clear.The plot follows the spaceship, Firefly, captained by Malcom Reynolds and packed with a crew of disparate characters who form a sort of dysfunctional family.  You've got everything from a lofty doctor to a shepherd (what would now be called a preacher or something similar) to some muscle that can hardly put a sentence together.  The crew cobles together a living by doing odd jobs for various factions from planets throughout the galaxy.  As is stated in the introduction, Earth could no longer handle her population so man went out and created new Earths by terraforming other planets.  The Alliance was formed in an attempt to govern the central planets leaving the outer ones to more closely resemble the Wild West than a futuristic utopia.  The concepts are unique and somehow real, the characters are wonderfully flawed and the writing is fantastic.  A gem among vapid, adrenalin dependent sci-fi blockbusters.	5.0	Do Not Hesitate!	2013-09-30	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A33BQEUBBKN4DO	Stephanie Chun	Warning: Contains Spoilers---For the past five years, our TV has been used 99% of the time to watch DVDs and play videogames. So of course I missed Firefly when it first aired. Thank god for Netflix! My husband and I rented the first disc and before I even returned it, we bought the boxed set. Because we knew this was it, no more Firefly after these four discs, we watched the rest of series sloooowly, one a week, savoring each episode. And when it was over, I felt satisfied (great last episode!)---yet empty. I NEED to know what's going to happen: Can Mal and Inara put aside their Elizabeth-and-Darcy act and get together? Will Zoe and Wash have a baby? (A baby on Serenity? Hmm, might work, might not.) Will Jayne be tempted to betray his shipmates again? Who exactly is Shepherd Book? Will Simon loosen up and will Kaylee be the one to help him do it? When will River stop crying?! And these are just the little questions! Ok, quite a few of these get answered in the movie, which is some consolation, but it's not enough. The cast, crew, and writers of Firefly deserve hour-long shows and plenty of them (well at least as many as, oh, Star Trek Next Gen): FOX, MAKE IT SO.	5.0	I want my Firefly	2005-11-30	2	0	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A31N0XY2UTB25C	Stephanie Sullivan	Firefly was one of the best series that didn't make it. Not because of the quality of but because of narrow network programming priorities or lack of imagination.I've watched the whole series dozens of times and it has never gotten old. I know there has been a great deal said about the acting, plot, actors, Joss Wheadon, Tim Minear, brown coats and lots more. I'm sure I feel as positive about that as the thousands of other 5 star reviewers.What speaks to me from Firefly that I think may be under appreciated is the music. It's easy to see how. The music is so integrated into the episodes the skillful work of Greg Edmonson in composing and arranging the music is extraordinary. If you love the firefly complete series consider picking up the sound track:Firefly (Original Television Soundtrack)and the musical contribution can be heard and then better appreciated with the series.Firefly is great for a lot of reasons.

This was certainly no exception. It was clever, witty and sophisticated. It was, sadly too say, too &quot;intellectual&quot; for the Fox executives to appreciate, what with the ever increasing &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the popular culture. And a tale with such promise was just getting started.It is my impression that Fox wanted Joss to &quot;simplify&quot; the plot so the average moron out there could comprehend it. But Joss stayed with his vision and the show was dropped. A loss for all of us. But bravo Joss! Stick with excellence and you will be remembered long after these Fox executives are clipping coupons in their condos.You have created in me, and in millions of others, a devoted fan of your &quot;thinking man's&quot; brand of fiction.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A5VOJYXAJGHSH	"Stephen DeVore ""Songwriter / Composer / Singe..."	It only lasted one season, but it was a decent season.I liked how it started.Though it was set in Space, it was sort-of down-to-Earth, with the people interacting not only with questionable trader-types but with locals who seemed very much like some bygone eras on Earth. To make it feel even more homey, some of the actors added a bit of a country-western accent, which seemed to get heavier as the season progressed.Acting was decent. Characters were interesting. Writing was good at times. The series typically has both a fun seriousness to it, and some humor. Special effects weren't bad for the time period.Alternative lifestyles (for its time) were explored a bit (PG-13ish at times). Cussing was sort of euphemized (using alternative words instead, almost like an edited-for-TV film is). Sex was at a minimum (only a couple of PG-13+ scenes). Ethics were stretched. Morality was off in the Galaxy elsewhere, set in the future. It is one of the higher-rated TV shows, with a sort of cult following (in the gentle sense).And finishing the entire season made me want more episodes! (After this, there was a sort of movie, called, I think, Serenity.)There are 14 episodes from 2002-2003, in either HD or Standard Definition.I watched the series on Amazon Instant Video, in mid-2013. During that time it was free for Amazon Prime members.Enjoy Firefly!	5.0	This was a fun, futuristic Sci-Fi show!	2013-08-09	0	0	0

But what's important is that this show is now on DVD as well as 2 other mediums : )!  First off, the show takes place in the distant future, one 6 years after a galatic civil war.  On the losing side, Captain Malcom Reynolds, a former Seargent and famed veteran of that war, who only has his pride left.... and a  Firefly class transport ship called Serenity, which is loaded with a crew as odd as the show being called Firefly rather then Serenity.  With a crew of 9, you would be hard pressed to find someone you couldn't like.  I rather not go into who is who and all that stuff, due to the fact that I... am lazy.  Unlike other Joss Whedon shows, this one has very little camp, but makes up for it in excellent special effects, and great dialog that makes the show funny beyond belief.  A show for sci fi fans as well as Buffy/Angel fans.Now to clear up a few things, their is this show, a movie and a small series of comics.  The 3 Comics, produced by darkhorse, tell the story of what happens between the end of the series and the movie, so fans of this DVD, I encourage you to go out and get the comics.  Though many questions are still unanswered, I know I had plenty, they do set the stage for the Movie.  They do explain more of the infamous ""hands of blue"".

Thankfully, the movie ""Serenity"" gave us some kind of conlusion, yet I can't help but miss all the great stories that could-have-been between the TV series and the movie.

While it is a SciFi show, like all great SciFi, it transcended the genre.  Tight writing, solid acting, and beautiful camerawork made this show a standout.  Flawed human characters thrown together in extreme situations made it a show that could have become a classic.I'm still bitter over FOX's poor treatment and rapid cancellation of this show.  It's no wonder that TV is a wasteland with dumb decisions like this one.Now, let's get that feature movie deal going...	5.0	This show deserved so much better...	2003-10-17	103	92	11

My wife and I, who rarely agree on anything,  both enjoyed this gem of a show and were very upset when it was cancelled.  The episodes are immensely engaging and you find yourself pulled in with the crew of the Serenity as they attempt to make their way in a future that contains eerie echos of the past.A soulful existential captain, a strong and silent female ex-soldier, a broken damsel in distress and her brilliant protective brother, a greedy thug with a gun fetish, a stunning courtesan, a girl who can fix anything and is so wholesome it hurts, a preacher who dabbled in non-religious things in a previous life, a wise-cracking pilot, this show has it all.The DVD comes with tons of extra goodies like un-aired episodes, behind the scenes interviews with the actors and creator Joss Whedon.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	I spent most of this week watching the 14 episodes of Firefly for the second time in my life, and I think I appreciated it even more this time around. The TV show was cancelled before all of the Season 1 episodes were shown, although they ultimately aired on The Science Channel.The series failed for a number of reasons; the main one being that the episodes were not shown in the correct order, which was a stupid decision because the feature-length opening episode introduces all of the characters.So why do I like it?Firefly is a mix of action, drama, romance, and adventure. Although it's science fiction, the characters often talk like cowboys. Josh Whedon (Buffy, The Avengers) created the series, as well as directing three episodes and being involved as a writer.The characters have real depth, but the development isn't rushed. The origin of the relationships and character traits are explained gradually as the series progresses. Many of the characters are mysterious, and will make you question their true motivations. But, through it all, each character always seems real. You'll meet a married couple, war veterans, a preacher, a doctor, a psychologically damaged girl, a genius engineer, an apparently dumb mercenary, and a high-class prostitute. It's fascinating to see the existing bonds between some of the characters, and the development of new bonds.Episodes often show the crew taking on a task of some kind to earn their living. These assignments are often illegal, but can also become somewhat noble. If you are a fan of Whedon, you'll know that he uses humor regularly, and it's often present in Firefly. It can be pretty campy at times, but the writing is strong and it never comes across as stupid. Jaynestown is probably the funniest episode, and you'll understand why if you watch the episodes in the correct sequence.I would have to say that I like every character, and that's rare for me with a cast of this size. The biggest mystery in the series surrounds River (Summer Glau), who plays the sister of the ship's doctor, Simon (Sean Maher). Their relationship is arguably the strongest within the group, and there's always a sense that River's story drives the entire series.The Blu-ray includes all of the episodes, and the picture quality is good for the most part. Some of the darker images have lower quality, but the series is so good that you won't sit there criticizing the image. The special features include plenty of commentaries, as well as a making of feature, deleted scenes, and other assorted goodies.If you do become hooked on the series, you'll need to watch Serenity (2005), which was a two-hour movie wrapping up the main story. That's a fantastic science fiction movie, but you'll appreciate it more if you know the characters well. Firefly runs for almost 11 hours, and you'll end up wishing for more. The movie gives the show a proper ending, and won't leave you hanging.At the time of writing, it's available on Amazon.com for less than $20. Buy it if you like Whedon, science fiction, or well-written characters. Incidentally, the set is housed in a regular Blu-ray case with room for the three discs, so it won't look out of place on your shelf.	4.0	Characters with depth, and a fun ride with plenty of secrets	2013-05-11	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2N1H4K1NU4HQG	Steven Brandt	If you're even reading this review, you're probably looking at reviews associated with my name, rather than reviews associated with the Firefly DVD series.  This is because there are already nearly 2000 reviews for Firefly, which has an average review rating of five stars.  I can't invent praise higher than that... but I feel it's worth a try.The action is startling and well-choreographed.  The dialogue is funny, clever, and moving.  The characters are compelling and likeable, despite their all-too-human flaws.  The stories are imaginative and unpredictable, despite their frequent nods to the genre of classic westerns.  There is no aspect of this series that disappoints; every scene ranges from interesting to brilliant.I am not a fan of the western, and most science fiction series have low expectations.  I didn't expect to like it.  Most of its first-time viewers didn't expect to like it, which is the most probable cause of its premature cancellation.  But Firefly can't be judged as a western, nor even as science fiction; it's just damn good television.  It is the most entertaining action series I have ever watched.	5.0	If television is art, Firefly is a masterpiece	2005-12-21	19	17	2

Watching these DVDs I enjoy them 150% as Joss Whedon does it again creating a team of unique individuals.  If you like the X-Men, give Firefly a try!  The only disappointment is that after you watch them all, you are craving more.  I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who is a fan of Buffy and Angel, as well as anyone that has an appreciation for creative writing.	5.0	Makes a Great Companion	2004-01-13	1	1	0

I am a SF fan, but did not catch Firefly when it orginially aired. Space/cowboy show? Sounded corny. This week a friend bought me the DVD set. Wow, I am a new convert. I watched all the episodes in about 2 days. I am starting to watch my favorite ones over again. I would not discribe it as SF. It is a unique fictional entertainment that is adult fun at a very high level. It does have enough technology/science to get the charactors from one planet to another, but tech/sci does not get in the way of the story. Magic tech/sci tricks don't get our charactors out of trouble. They get into trouble because of actions driven by human nature, they get out of trouble through thoughtful decisions, strong will and luck.  The 9 central charactors work together as a team, but have conflicts and known and unknown motives for their actions. I cared about the charactors. Tears sometimes came to my eyes for short term charactors that were only in one episode. The series had fun, humor and danger and mystery and just enough good space scenes to keep an old SF fan like myself dazzled. I promise you if you buy this DVD set, you will not be sorry. I expect this will be a classic in fiction for decades to come.	5.0	Unique TV Show - Worth owning	2005-02-23	10	9	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3HHGCM4L7XEDU	Steve Thompson	First off, I don't watch tv.  Because of the constant garbage put out by cable and the networks, I have disconnected my home from cable and satelite.  Up until a few months ago I had never heard of Firefly - until I took my wife to see Serenity.  It was an instant hit with both of us.  As a result, I bought my wife the Firefly season for Christmas, and we sat down and watched every episode within a couple of days.  It is incredibly entertaining; every episode left us wanting for more.  We'd often tell each other that we need to go to bed, but we'd foolishly begin the next episode and get sucked back into the adventure for another hour, and another and another...I would like to offer one caveat particularly for parents, or for folks that are sensitive to the explicit sexuality.  I am usually fairly prudish when it comes to entertainment, so I am also a bit disappointed by the amount of sex that is injected into this show.  For example, one of the main characters on the ship is a high-class prostitute, and there are times when little is left to the imagination.  There are also many very explicit sex scenes with most of the characters that border on pornography in several of the episodes - including lesbian scenes.  This is definitely not a show for children.  In my opinion, this show would be even better if they took out the unnecessary explicitity.But be that as it may, I still can not help myself.  The storylines, characters and the whole premise of this show just makes me want to plant myself on the couch (after the kids go to bed) for a couple of hours.  It's alot of fun.  If the execs don't bring this show back, then they're just confirming that they're as stupid as I've always thought.	5.0	The best show in a long, long time	2006-01-01	6	4	2

Episodes ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Objects in space"" are both equally craptastic. It makes me wonder if they did not continue the series because they ran out of good ideas.The bad:-River never develops in to anything. I thought she was more of an annoyance than anything.Of all the cool guilds you could be part of, the companions guild is not one of them. The worst aspect of being a companion is that they seem to be highly respected.Inara is easily disposable as a character. She brings nothing to the table besides the sword fighting conflict in episode ""Shindig"".Neutral:-Shepherd Book is another character that lacks development. He's better developed than River but he still remains a mystery. Is he really a shepherd and what does it matter anyway?In one episode he receives medical attention from the alliance. And in another episode, ""Objects in space"" it is bluntly said that he is not a shepherd.My guess is that he may be a fellow soldier for the alliance. Yet, he does seem to lack military training.Whatever the case, he seems to follow his own path.Zoe is a Xena Warrior prototype.Positive:Jayne is one of the best characters in the show. He is greedy. He walks a fine line of morality. When Jayne does choose the wrong path I think it pushes him in the opposite direction. He becomes stronger as a result. An unlikely ""hero"". I can't remember exactly what he said in episode, ""Jaynestown"". But I think he said something like, ""A living legends needs eggs and milk (women)"".If every woman smiled as much as Kaylee the world would be a better place. She's a very likeable character.Simeon has a big heart. He is trustworthy and brave. I enjoy characters who are willing to give up everything that they have to fight for what they believe in. Because he is a fugitive it pushes him to unexpected conflict.Mrs. Reynolds only appears in two episodes but I like her character much better than Inara. Shes more greedy than Jane and will back stab anyone to get what she wants. She has companion training and she uses that training for seduction\manipulation. She has a deadly combination of skills.Mal is one of the most developed characters. So I won't comment about him."	3.0	Good but let's be honest...	2013-10-09	3	1	2

Toy ""Augoeides"""	Looking through the various reviews of the Firefly DVD set I now own, I see a couple of recurrent patterns.People (out of currently 188) who gave the DVD set 1 star either:A.  Maybe saw one or two episodes of the show,orB.  Are from CaliforniaorC.  BothThere seem to be several reasons for the failure of the show on TV.  First and foremost, it was on FOX.  Secondly, it was on Friday night (on FOX).  Thirdly, the pilot episode was shown last (!!!)The pilot was brilliant, and the show kept getting better.Could it be Fox execs can't count (which is first, episode one or episode two...)?So instead of introducing the show to the world in a two hour premiere in a decent time slot, and allowing people to see the absolute genius of the show, and also allowing us to get to know the characters in a timely fashion, Fox shows us the second episode, which though still good, is substandard to the pilot.  If all the other shows were a ten, the Train Heist would be a nine.Why does Fox routinely get rid of actual programming in favor of one cloned, nonsensical, idiotic piece of trash reality show after another?I think I know, and you may agree:  the people who dream up the reality shows are all stoned, all the time.[Dude, okay, this time, we put a bunch of people up in a ranger tower in Canada, we make them get naked, and the first to be voted out of the tower gets cannibalized...and...whoa...what was I sayin'?  Hey don't bogart that bong man, that is not cool...]My second theory is just as plausible:  Appeal to the lowest common denominator in society and they'll watch, and keep watching, and keep those ratings up and the sponsors happy, otherwise they're taking a risk of losing their largest portion of the audience:  The ones who don't have to think.  Just watch Temptation Island, buy Pepsi, eat Cheetos, go back to sleep, America.If the movie pans out, I'll be ecstatic.  Until then, buy Firefly, rent it, but watch it because you're not going to get any better than this.  Don't pay attention to anyone who hasn't watched the DVD set or are from California, or both...Unless of course you don't want thought provoking, interesting and ultimately different from everything on TV (or off TV, as it currently is).If you don't want or need that, just keep watchin' Fox, I think the OC's still on...	5.0	Looking through	2003-12-14	9	6	3

Early this year I was selling some of my DVDs in order to help pay some overdue bills.  I contacted my nephew, who is a big Firefly fan like me, and sold him my DVD set of the series for $20.  I did this because I promised myself to someday own the Blu-ray of the show.  Until yesterday, I had not yet bought it, since $60 to $80 is still a little steep for me (currently $62.99).  But yesterday Amazon ran the one day deal for $18.99 for the Blu-ray set!  I awoke to the email notification and immediately grabbed the deal.  Now I own the Blu-ray set for a dollar LESS than I sold the DVDs for!!Ya gotta love those deals of the day!!!FYI for the poor deprived people who don't know the show - DO NOT miss this!  It is one of the best shows EVER!!  Don't take my word for it - look at the over 3,000 5-star votes!	5.0	I had to laugh yesterday!	2011-11-14	0	0	0

I was very impressed with the quality -- easily as good as the other two formats (although my DVD player is NOT Blue Ray, so don't rule out the possibility of better quality there).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3ACX9P8ZPHCLT	Sun Lee	This television series is special because of one thing: it is just so easy to fall in love with the characters. The credits go to Joss for being the genius writer, and to the actors/actresses for making the characteristics possible and realistic. You see, Firefly isn't about heroes. It is really not so. It's all about desire, trust, death, life, whores, pain, and mean old men. Did I mention whores?Firefly is packed with genius ideas about society and how people affect people; how people hurt people; how people love people. By the way, there are sexy ladies everywhere.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2G3X0PRRJKITC	Susan Alexander	My husband and I only recently learned about Firefly with the release of the movie, Serenity.  We saw the movie first and loved it.  We were hooked from when we walked out of the theater the first time.  We went out and bought the show on DVD and began watching it.  About halfway through the series, we couldn't resist and went back to the movie.  We loved it even more the second time.  After finishing the series on DVD, we went back to the movie a third time.  If we hadn't been in the middle of a move, we would've seen it more and we aren't the types to see movies over and over in the theater.  Firefly and Serenity are just that good.  Since the movie has left theaters, we've just been watching the tv show over and over again.  To anyone thinking about getting this - do it.  And to any network execs thinking about bringing back Firefly - do it!  There's a built-in fan-base now, take advantage of it!

Funny, but a heroic type?  Yes!!!!  He is a great actor!  In an ensemble cast of nine he is the lead and he pulls it off!The scripts are stellar.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1OC972JQ97EGI	Suyong Min	From the very first episode to its last, Firefly kept me glued to the screen. And I mean glued to the screen from episode 1 to episode 12 in one sitting. The story begins with a scene from the war that leaves enough things unsaid without that useless hanging dissatisfaction, and each episode provided additional layers to characters that continued to develop until the very last episode. Special effects combined with outer-border scenes, and actors working so well together made for a very quirky, funny and hold-your-seats sci-fi western.

This is a quality show with adventure and good stories.  Its a shame that the show was cancelled when there was much left to learn about the characters.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1O1B7Y8YFHAZH	suzirelli	Yes, I am a browncoat.  I am a Firefly fan, after you watch it, you will understand the browncoat thing.  Cowboys in space, or is it Space Pirates, Loads of misbehaving, crime and excitement. All without Aliens. &#34;Captain Malcom Reynolds aka Mal&#34; is played by Nathan Fillion.  Excellent role for him, and the rest of the characters are wonderful as well.  If you have never watched Firefly, you need to, it's a wonderful show and it was a crime that they cancelled the series so early in its developement.  There are 13 episodes.  Make sure to pick up the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; after watching this season, it is the final &#34;Big Episode&#34; and it helps to pull the story together with some history as to why things are the way they are. I have seen this series many times, and enjoy it everytime.  &#34;Kaylee&#34; is my favorite character played by Jewel Staite, she is the ships mechanic, so fun and sweet.  Then there is &#34;Jayne&#34;, played by Adam Baldwin, the tough guy, so funny and full of mischief. &#34;Zoe&#34;, played by Gina Torres is Mal's 2nd in charge, definitely an amazon woman, very strong and Beautiful. Then there is &#34;Inara&#34;, played by the beautiful Morena Baccarin, is the ships Bonafide Companion/prostitute. Zoe's husband is &#34;Wash&#34;, the pilot, played by Alan Tudyk, so funny! &#34;Simon and River Tam&#34; are brother and sister on the show played by Sean Maher and River Glau, &#34;Shepperd Book&#34;, played by Ron Glass..  Oh I could go on and on, but just watch it! You won't be disappointed.  One thing I'd like to add:  When the series aired for the first time on tv, they aired the episode &#34;Train Job&#34; first, then they changed days on the show, and times, skipped a week here or there, no wonder the show didn't do well, people were having a hard time finding it.  And then they cancelled it, only after airing 11 episodes, so 2 of the episodes in this series were not originally aired.  Ok, enough of my rambling.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1UFZ6TC5V37NW	S. Whitlock	I'll toss in a 5 star review along with everyone elses.  It's not a perfect show, but compared to everything else on TV - it's a 5.  The reason for that is the character development is done so well.  This is a show you can't help but end up caring about the people, their lives, their stories.  Once you get pulled in it makes the show that much better - and worth a second viewing.  Unfortunately, it takes a bit to get invested and because of that slow start, I think that caused the executives of FOX to be impatient and pull it before it had a chance.  It's sad really that shows today have to have instant pay out.  I'd suggest that is one of the contributing factors towards shallow, slappy, and superficial shows.  Don't settle for that, buy Firefly.	5.0	It's about the characters	2008-12-16	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A13GQELR7231K6	SwiftDeath	At first glance, Firefly might just seem like a rather unique idea for a scifi show in space. While I would love to go in depth as to the elements of the story and world that Firefly occupies and why they are superb, that would be spoiling the fun. Suffice it to say, the back stories for every character (Captain Reynolds especially), the way in which the world is slowly shown to you, and the story in general are miles above the mediocrity that is modern TV writing.But that is not even the best part...The characters and the way the characters interact are so well done that you can really start to see the relationships between them. This show has the best written dialogue I have ever seen (well technically heard...).All in all, this is my favorite TV show of all time.Also looks awesome in 1080p, really brings out all the details.	5.0	So much more depth than just cowboys in space	2011-04-05	3	2	1

I hope there is a sequel in the making!  It is really ashame the series didn't last, but I had never heard any advertising about it during the time it was on. (I'm not a Buffy or Angel fan and didn't know who Joss Wheadon was before FireFly).	5.0	Awsome Space Cowboys!	2005-11-15	8	8	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A7LIDIIVS537P	Tabitha	I didn't sit down to watch Firefly when it first aired on television.  I love scifi, but can't stand westerns.  So when Firefly aired with that western feel, I changed the channel, then promptly forgot about it.Years later, a friend of mine badgered me into borrowing his DVDs, and made me promise to watch at least four episodes.  I grudgingly agreed.  I was hooked after the first.  I kicked myself, hard, for not giving the show a try when it was on television, for not lending my voice to the fans who tried to keep the show on the air, and for not trusting that Joss Whedon can spin an amazing story no matter the setting.The characters felt real, some episodes had me clutching my sides with laughter, and the subtle plot clues promised many enjoyable seasons.  It's a shame they didn't happen.After watching all the episodes on my friend's DVD set, I went out and bought my own.  :)	5.0	a late, but avid, fan	2007-07-13	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AF45NBQGK78YA	T. A. Clark	I am blown away by this series. This is among the best science fiction stories that I have seen committed to film, with some of the best characters creating it. It's one of the rare stories that blends science fiction with realistic characters, and doesn't weight itself down with heavy handed technical jargon or scenarios only the hardcore sci-fi geek in us goes for; I heartily recommend it even to people who are not generally fans of science fiction.The acting is good enough for a wide-release movie, as are the special effects. The writing is brilliant; the dialog between characters can be everything from hilarious to grave and heavy in the same episodes. There is a noticeable growth of character with each show.The only problem with this set is that it isn't long enough at 14 shows.... it wouldn't be long enough at 100. There's an empty feeling at the end knowing there aren't more on the way.As a life-long Star Wars fan, I think it's worth noting that I am more excited about seeing Serenity next year than Episode 3, and I'd trade that entirely for another year of Firefly. Someone really blew it cancelling this show and failing to get the word out and marketing it.	5.0	One of the best sci-fi stories ever told.	2004-11-04	17	16	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NNWMOCHOCH9I	"Taliesn Jones ""Taliesn"""	"Had to add my ringing praise for this series for the central reason not yet given mention ; namely ""the writing"". The idea of blending cultures , making this appraoch to Sci-fi a ""Space Western"" , works as solidly unique as what I always called the 1st ""Eastern-Western"" in David Carradine's ""Kung Fu"". And it even has a biting wit  to it , that can be howlingly funny if just for the surprise of it , that it just makes its characters and their world just so much more fully rendered and from its very 1st episode. The matter-of-fact perceptions and comments ,as well as the relationship,  just between the Capt. and the mercenary Jayne  alone is a diamond in the rough.  Yet anyone of this crew has that other-worldly aura about them perhaps summed up best in the final scene in ""Bladerunner"" when the dying Replicant Rutger Hauer reveals to Harrison Ford's Dekkard  that  ""I ve seen things you people wouldn't believe...""Well with this Boxed DVD set release we fans are saved from being oh so very close to seeing ""Firefly"" become "" ...all those monents being lost ...like teardrops .....in the rain. ....Time to die "".( forgive the ""Bladerunner "" melodrama , but I thought it apt and , well , I plain just couldn't resist )But the first episode that finally hooked me for always was the one entitled "" Out of Gas"" which was the 1st episode to offer the viewers some insight into each member of the crew from the flashbacks of a slowly dying Capt. remembering the signature moments when and how he'd met and brought aboard each member while holding on to what he felt would be his last moments abord an ""absandoned"" Serenity. Most poignant to me was how this episode brought out the depth of what Serenity meant to this Capt. and , thus ,showed the depth of the Capt's love for ""his ship"" on a ""live free or die"" level. It was just beautifully written and portrayed.In fact I felt that it was ""so"" well-written that I never bothered to v-tape any of the episoides because I felt that FOX ""knew"" it had another hit and that "" Firefly"" wasn't going anywhere but up. I mean we ""all"" felt it would atleast be allowed to finish out the season....right?Well the crass marketeers at FOX will get their come-uppence when they see the success of the sales of this DVD Set if just because their collosal narrow-mindedness actually helped inflame & magnify this fierce loyalty that is about to have its numbers shown in units sold and all this is a foretaste for ""the Movie"" which is being produced by Universal and ""not"" FOX.Somehow ""20th Centiury FOX"" takes on new meaning in what is now already the 21st Century.This series is such a winner and , with the eventual sales and box office numbers, the people will have spoken louder and clearer than any of the mindless manufactured audience pandered to through""American Idol"".What else is there to say but  ""Rupert Murdock 's loss is our gain."""	5.0	"This DVD Set was ""Inevitable"" , in spite of FOX"	2003-09-20	6	5	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1BCO5XZL8XJPB	Tallas	I managed to stumble into this show more interested in the better-advertised John Doe, and didn't get hooked because my schedule didn't allow me to be free on Friday evenings.  I saw the first, second, and last episodes in the series, and while I enjoyed it, I largely forgot about the show.Turns out I was wandering around Mediaplay looking for Christmas gifts just when the Firefly box set had reached stores (and was not on the new shelf).  I decided to give myself an early present and gamble the $35 on a hunch that it'd be worth it.I watched the series with my roommates, and got them hooked, then went home and watched it with my brother and got him hooked, and all in all, got a couple of people to buy the series.  Every one loves it, and after several pages of Amazon reviews, I have yet to see one of less than 5 stars, or any with less than the highest praise for Joss Whedon's creation.  Anyone who mentioned Fox has the same contempt for them I do.  Thankfully, Joss *is* making the movie - supposed to be out in 2005, for Universal Studios (which may or may not have merchandising and TV rights as well), and the scoop on that right now is that the contractual stuff is being taken care of.Best TV show ever.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3SQQL4IHSNNGR	Tamar	Firefly is a wonderful trip 500 years into the future.  A terrific and entertaining combination of humor, action, wit, love, and of course, science fiction, I couldn't love the series more. The show follows a group of nine people aboard a spaceship named Serenity of the firefly class, named because of shape of the ship. The people aboard all have their own interesting history, which didn't get to be fleshed out because the show was cut short so abruptly.Firefly is my new not-so-secret obsession. The unique thing about this show is that it makes the future real and acessible, not far-fetched.  All of the characters are engaging, the stories are gripping, the sets and lighting are some of the best I've ever seen in a TV show, and of course the acting/writing/directing is wonderful.  If you want something totally entertaining of which you don't have to buy ten seasons, get this show, even if you've never seen it before.My only complaint is that there are only 14 episodes and it leaves you wanting more. So stick it to FOX for cancelling the show and buy this DVD!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1NUIPLTRT7I8K	"TaoChi ""Stranger in a strange land"""	At the risk of sounding cliche, I will start by saying that I consider most television programs to be of excrement 'quality'. Once in a while comes a show that makes it worthwhile to have purchased a box and justifies spending precious minutes staring at moving images. 'Firefly' is one such program. The setting, while not completely new, is very interesting (think post civil war America transferred into space). Characters are treated with depth and always show new facets of their persona. Plots are a very unique mix of western movies and space operas, which will probably please fans of both 'genres'. The fact that the show was cancelled is a testimony to the fact that television programs do not last due to their quality but rather live or die by the whim of managers for whom money is the ONLY bottom line. Buy this show and enjoy every second of it, then go online and participate in the effort to revive it.	5.0	Firefly - Complete series	2006-01-28	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKU53KFHZU93T	"Tara OShea ""Tara O'Shea"""	"A lot of science fiction series bill themselves as ""space westerns."" From ""Star Trek"" on down, the parallels have been drawn between cowboys exploring the American frontier, and starships exploring the new frontiers of the galaxy. However, ""Firefly"" may be the first series to successfully merge the two genres so completely, and in such an innovative way.Creator Joss Whedon (""Buffy"", ""Angel""), along with producers Ben Edlund (""The Tick"") and Tim Minear (""Angel"") have created a world full of both space ships and cowboys that co-exist in perfect logic, if not always harmony. Audiences are drawn into the lives of a group of nine men and women aboard a small smuggling ship called Serenity.""Firefly"" has a lived in feel. The audience joins the story in progress, six years after the war, and gets introduced to the universe bit by bit in a very natural way. The production design is a lot more ""Star Wars"" than ""Star Trek,"" with grime and miss-matched parts, from the dining room chairs to the occasionally jury-rigged engines. The characters speak English peppered with Mandarin (mostly swear words and slang), with voices that from episode one are distinct and unique. Each character is perfectly drawn, full of quirks and depth. With scripts that effortlessly segue from humour to drama to romance, the series' life was cut short by FOX after a fall season full of pre-emptions and poor advertising. However, this highly-anticipated extra-laden box set which not only includes all 14 episodes (including 3 unaired episodes) with cast and creator commentaries, interviews, promises to be a huge hit with both fans and folks who may have missed this ground-breaking series first time around.It may no longer be on the air in the States, but recently airing in the UK and Mexico and South America, and with rumours of a big screen movie in the future, ""Firefly"" is still flying so far as its millions of fans are concerned."	5.0	Landmark series from the man who gave us	2003-07-22	19	18	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A357NXMPQOXJNG	"Ted A. Fisher ""Nazgul"""	I opened the case for the first disk, and there, in the jacket, floating quietly above Serenity, was a familiar planet.  It is Venus in reds and oranges, thanks to the Magellan spacecraft radar data.  Real data from a NASA probe.  Then the big moment, I lifted the first disk out of the jewel case.  Under the disc, basking in glory, is Mars, Valles Marinaris hemisphere, likely Viking or MGS data.

The first episode gets you acquainted with the characters and has a weird pace IMO but after that the series takes off. It's kind of sad knowing there is only one season. It makes every episode seem like your getting closer to killing an endangered species.

Loved to watch the Firefly 10 year reunion at Comic Com on You Tube.  Firefly is a once in a lifetime show.  The whole crew was amazing and that is what made it so special.  I have watched Castle last few years and feel that Nathan is an amazing multi faceted actor.  Everything he does is great.My favorite episode is Out of Gas as this was a good way to see how the Capt teamed up with his crew.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38ZDJ8T1WDCZX	Tessa Grasel	I find myself telling people about this series all the time. The writing, the humor, the acting, the drama, the action, female leads that are uncanny and unshrinking--even the effects are pretty good all things considered. Unfortunately, explaining that it's a scifi show with kind of a space cowboy theme doesn't seem to resonate with too many people. And yet, this series, more than most of popular television, has the potential to appeal to such a wide audience.I sat down for a marathon as soon as I got this box set. Pretty soon, both my brother and my mom were watching it right along with me. Let me just clarify as well that we all have very different tastes in movies and television. My brother likes FIFA and Entourage. My mom likes America's Next Top Model and pretty much whatever is on BBC. I like Madmen and Merlin. My other friends that like it watch CSI and Adventure Time. Firefly isn't comparable to any one of these series in particular, but it balances different elements of different genres in the way that most things that are written well seem to do. if you find yourself doubting that a science fiction show could appeal to you just watch the first two episodes. I bet you'll end up watching the whole first season, and then start shaking your fist when you come up short against the fact that there is no second season. There really is no second season and the reasons for why this series got cancelled continue to baffle people to this day.	5.0	This is simply one of the best shows ever.	2013-01-20	1	1	0

Firelfy has action, adventure, humor, silliness, drama and touchingly romantic tension that a lot of series try for, but miss badly. Firefly has everything that would keep an audience glued to the TV for hours.  Fox's shortsighted treatment of the show was a crime.

Joss Whedon's spaghetti western space opera did not find its audience fast enough to avoid Fox axing it in its maiden season, but the series found its fan base and rose from the grave as the feature film &#34;Serenity&#34;. Unheard of. The fans are passionate and vocal in their love for these characters, these stories, and the 'verse they inhabit. 10 years in the fan base continues to grow. These actors have never had a better ensemble or spoken better words.

I was watching Buffy & Angel and loved 'em. So why not Firefly? I think mostly because I never really heard much about it and never knew when it was on...It seemed like the network DIDN'T want me to see it...Well, the Sci-Fi Channel fixed that.  With the impending release of the movie ""Serenity"" (An excellent film adaptation!! I'm pre-ordering the DVD) the episodes were rebroadcast by SF Channel. My wife and I caught them and we were hooked.This show is pure Joss. The great characters, intriguing situations, and of course witty dialogue. You can feel the love of the material in the craftsmanship of everyone involved - writers, directors and actors.The show is accessible to everyone. Not just Joss fans. Not just Sci-Fi fans or Western aficionados. It's a great shame that the show never got the chance to really come in to its own.

So in interest, i took a chance, dished out the cash and bought the DVD set.All i can say is that I'm very impressed and saddened that this show didn't go on as long as it should have. The storylines were mesmerizing, the characters are great, and just the whole 'verse made by Whedon is spectacular! Although I wasnt able to see Serenity while it was out, I already have a pre-order in for the DVD in December.All i can say, as a new Browncoat, to all those still deciding whether to purchase this or not - take a chance. Buy the DVD. And before u know it, even you can find peace on Serenity~Shame on FOX for canning this rare and wondrous gem for a media world full of monotnous reality tv shows.	5.0	Another great and shiny sci-fi show lost, thanks to FOX	2005-11-08	9	6	3
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3SFUMEABVVD7O	TheGiantSquirrel	Only caught the series AFTER it was canceled, and have become a browncoat, to the point that, yes, I actually do wear a brown coat I bought when Serenity came out. It's a series worth checking out. The chances you'll become that much of a nerd are very low, so don't be afraid. :)Picture quality is high compared to the original DVDs, detailed and clearer, though since the series is fairly dark at points, there's some definite noise (looks like film grain, actually) in the black backgrounds (at least on my set, a Mitsubishi). Despite initial rumors, special effects sequences remain at 480i (upconverted) instead of being re-rendered to 1080p. That's occasionally annoying if you're looking for it, but otherwise not. Sound is greatly improved.As others have pointed out, the set is shy on new extras, which is too bad. Enjoyed the extra commentary and the partial reunion, would have appreciated more.Packaging seems decent for a blu-ray multipack. One review complains about the packaging, but I found it efficient and not problematic (case opens with one middle piece. Middle piece has a disc on each side, third disc is on the back of the open case.  I've seen worse: some mass-DVD multipacks with two dvds overlapping each other so you have to remove one to get at the other...)Worth the money if you have a good HD set. If you're not sure, rent the first episodes from Netflix or Blockbuster.	4.0	Better, still some grain, special effects in SD res	2008-11-13	71	66	5
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AH5V5JJUYD5JK	"thehailo ""MI-80: Musings of a Skeptical Super..."	"I've never written  review before this one, though I've been a member of Amazon for years. I hope this conveys some sense of Firefly's attraction.Hundreds of thousands of fans, if not millions, have fallen in love with Firefly for a reason. It's simply stated the best Sci-Fi series in existence. Putting together the best of all previous works, with a very unique style, cast, and story the overall product is just amazing.The cast is extremely well put together, featuring talented actors that express an amazing amount of on screen chemistry.The CGI is outstanding by big budget movie standards, much less TV standards. All of the especial effects are done in such a way that they never pull you out, but only bring you more into the world. There are a few ""wow"" moments, but done so well that they manage to awe without distracting you.The story is convincing, plausible, and well written. The unique dialog is not only attractive but allows for the casts chemistry to play off each other in ways that bring some incredibly moving scenes to the series. They also play off in some incredibly humorous instances. This combination not only puts Firefly in the genre of Sci-Fi, but also features the best elements of comedies, westerns, dramas, romances, and several other areas. These all present an incredibly engaging universe.Besides the series itself being outstanding, the box set is extremely well done. First off for fans of the original broadcasted episodes, these are in order. That alone is a major plus since they were originally shown out of order which lead to a lot of confusion. Also three episodes originally not aired are included, which are all excellent and help move the story along and present some of the series most moving moments.The extras included while rather few, are well done. You get the sense that no one really wanted Firefly to end when it did. The interviews also show some humorous moments and show some interesting aspects of how Firefly was put together. Physically the box set is well done, both attractive and sturdy.To sum it up, this box set is well worth the asking price. I also recommend anyone reading this check out Serenity (...), the movie based off of Firefly coming out this fall. The trailer and sneak previews have left us fans only craving more."	5.0	Simply Stated the Best Sci-Fi Series in Existence	2005-06-25	12	12	0

Even the first part of Serenity (the battle of Serenity Valley) looks better, and that is saying something as the source wasn't too great to begin with.I will happily give away another set of DVDs to some lucky friend (who isn't hooked yet *evil grin*) knowing I have this edition.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JHVB10SFK1LL	"The Last Mind Crusader ""The Last Mind Crusader"""	"I recently rented ""Serenity"" on a tip from a friend who knows I like both a good story and science fiction.  I saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the characters.  (As a writer and marketing consultant, a good story and good characters that you care about are the name of the game, not blowing up sound stages.)What a shock when I saw some of the special features and learned that there was actually a SERIES, called ""Firefly.""  I had never heard of it.  I ran to the video store, got the whole series, and paced myself to watch just one a night -- I knew I only had 14 shots at it, and that would be that.What a terrible thing to happen:  One of the most enjoyable, clever, intelligent, realistic programs to hit television in decades -- and what a most plausible feel for the future! -- and the short-sighted desk-squatters at Fox give Joss a hard time from the get-go and then cancel it.I only hope that there is a way to get the series -- and all the characters (Joss, you'll have to work on bringing back Wash) -- back on a network interested in quality and entertainment as well as profit.  In Star Trek's day, that was impossible, and the best that true believers in that series could do was push hard, and publicly, to get numerous movies made.I realize Serenity-The Movie only broke even, although I hope the DVD sales will add to the ROI.  But as much as I hope for a series of movies, it is very important to bring back this series to that incredibly expanding wasteland known as television.  You can tell from the sincerity in the cast, senior executives and Joss that this was a labor of love and something very special.For once, can television go for creativity and a true portrayal of relationships and good story-telling, over the formulaic frappuccino's audiences must swallow each night?I call for one brave television executive to call one brave and talented creative mind -- Joss -- to tell him that a wonderful, important TV series is a terrible thing to waste."	5.0	IF ONLY FOX HAD SPENT SOME MONEY MARKETING FIREFLY	2006-02-02	8	8	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ASYKUKD5MW46V	T	Season starts out quite interesting. The theme is plausible (with the Federation and all) - independent crew trying to make a hussle. It seems that each characters of the ship's crew does not seem to fit in anywhere - they are all so different from one another. And I guess that's the point. I started to lose interest in the series when i could not figure out what the role of the sister of the Dr. was. She mumbled most of her part. She was supposed to be some genius or something, but later she wonders off. I think I have a few episodes - not itching to finish it.	4.0	Good sci fi	2014-06-18	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1S4NMO34CBCMJ	"The Mandrew ""Coop"""	Then again, a few of us out there knew just what we had, and were overjoyed to learn of the Serenity movie, yes, as a chance to expand upon the 14 episode universe we all have grown to cherish, but also as perhaps a vehicle to serve as catalyst for a SECOND SEASON.  Are you reading this Fox?  Anyone with a production company?In my mind, this show is the stuff of legends, which I will watch and rewatch until it is time to purchase another set.  Like the Next Generation, not every episode is perfect....in fact, several times I found myself rolling my eyes at what I was seeing before me (how much of this is Whedon's fault and how much an overzealous Fox's fault it is, I can probably guess).  Still, like TNG, at the close of the final episode, you feel genuine loss that its done.  You've grown to love these people, good or bad, for the ocean-bottom depth that Whedon produced in just 14 episodes.  You learn more about these characters and grow to be a part of it so fast, you really lament it ending.I can't say that about any other show in recent memory.  That it no longer exists is testament to the horrific nature of television today.  I just cannot f'in believe we have another season of Laguna Beach, yet this didn't make a full run.Shame on you Fox, redeem yourself by making a second season.  Heck, finish the first, but give us fans (of the masses growing daily thanks to Serenity) some closure, darnit.Buy these DVDs, but be warned you will painfully miss its magic at the close of disc 4.	5.0	Don't know what you've got. until...	2005-10-02	0	0	0

Watching this again after missing it for a few years, I can easily see why the show still has such avid fans, and why the actors still talk about the show as if they would hope it could come back.From the technical side, it streamed seamlessly, the HD quality was good, and there were only a couple hiccups for buffering, which could easily have been from my own personal internet.Highly recommended for anyone (even the non-sci-fi fan!)	5.0	Classic	2013-02-26	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1QRXEM0WSLGT5	The Man With No Name	I am not a hard-core 'Firefly' fan.  I've caught re-runs on tv when I can find them, and I can honestly say that this is from my amateur opinion a GOOD show.I personally see a lot of references to the anime 'Trigun', the premise seems very similar.  The artistic choice of combining space exploration and the old west is a neat concept by it's creators.Sci-Fi element wise this is a little on the light side.  There are no laser pistals, or anything of that nature.  Like Trigun, the weapons of choice still seem to be bullets.  Also I don't recall ever seeing any aliens.  I could be wrong about this though...I then saw 'Serenity' when it was released.  This confirmed for me that this franchise really was good and also sadly did not get the justice it was due.  I was not blown away by the movie, but at the same time could see the merit in it.  Now years later I would like to completely submerge myself in it and really give it my undivided attention.  The fact that fan-boys are still adament about this series further drives the point home that the networks and studios made a grave mistake canceling it.  Unfortunately that's life.  We live in a society where people care more about what some degenerates are doing down by the Jersey Shore.  Thought provoking, plausible Sci-Fi shows and movies with great actors are just not in demand anymore, for the most part...It's a shame really.  Nathan Fillion, (who SHOULD have been the Green Lantern), is a charming but tuff when necessary captain.  Adam Baldwin is a bad ass who also seemed a bit clumsey to me at times.  In my opinion the whole cast was good.As I said I've never seen the entire series, but now that it's so cheap, I will buy this series and 'Serenity' and watch it back to back.  Then I can call myself a true Fan-Boy of 'Firefly.'  For me the DVD release will be just fine.  I've seen no major posts about any defects or anything of that nature, so I'm fairly confident this will be a good purchase.For those of you who are still sad this went off the air, I feel your pain.  I loved 'Spider-Man the 1994 series.'  It was canceled and NEVER released completely on DVD in America.  'Mantis' was good as well, along with the 2002 'He-Man'.  And let us not forget how great Toonami and Adult Swim used to be.  One of my biggest regrets is that I didn't watch Anime back then when it was so easily available.  OH REGRETS...Good shows leave television, and all we can do is move on and try to find NEW entertaining things to watch.  Good luck in your search, most nights I strike out...	5.0	From What I've Seen, Seems Like A Good Series...	2012-04-19	2	2	0

There are at this writing 957 reviews of this DVD set, and the overall rating is still at 5 stars.  I was going to write one back when there were reviews only in the double digits.  But, I don't think I have to.  Nearly one thousand people have.  Look at some of your other favorite shows...how many reviews written?  Most people don't bother writing reviews, and if you take a gander at the...ahem, 950 something reviews you will find that if there was ever any doubt that you should own this show, it should be taken out, beaten by the people who canned this show and then both flown into the sea.Like most people who love this show have done , once I showed a few episodes to people...they became hooked...and then apprehensive (They CANCELLED THIS?!!BUT WHY! why??)...then bought the show for themselves.Yes, it's from Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel.  Yes, it is as good as, dare I even say at times...better than those in it's infancy of only a handful of episodes before Fox pulled the plug ( Foolish...absolutely foolish).  Every actor in this show shines, and knows their part(and with a main cast of NINE, they better)...they come together like this show has been running for a couple years already.  Though the show did get cancelled, many of you already know that the crew of Serenity will fly again as a major motion picture.  Perhaps the show will live on in the movies as a success, playing the reverse of Buffy (unsuccessful movie turned amazing TV show).  If things are going the way they are, I'm positive it will.In short, don't bother asking.  Buy it. Watch it. Love it. Curse Fox for cancelling it. Praise the fact there will be movies.

Firefly was intelligent, portrayed a unique, realistic final frontier, had a great cast, and was one of the rare series that actually had no sound in space. It tackled issues in a mature way and had characters who were very human. It was funny, creative, twisted, and always engaging. Firefly had the potential to be better than anything on TV.It also had a Friday night death slot and a bunch of executives who didn't love it nearly as much as us fans.Now, instead of Mal and his crew, we have &quot;reality TV&quot; and the forlorn hope of someday getting a DVD of the show. If we're lucky, it will have the four episodes of the show that were filmed but never released after the series' cancellation. Please do right by us, O Powers That Be, and give us our show back, even if it's just on DVD. What we don't want is more reality dreck.	5.0	They Did	2003-09-06	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AUSFYZ8KRXS27	The Seeker	I fell in love with Firefly from the very first scene when it was briefly on the air on Fox (idiots).  Fox did every thing they possibly could to doom this show to failure.  They refused to air a perfect pilot until several episodes later.  Instead they made the creators write an episode (The Train Job) over a weekend to air first.  The episode worked but there were too many people that were missing the necessary exposition that the pilot provided.  Then they stuck it in a terrible timeslot.  Congrats Fox you ruined the best original television series I have ever seen.Whether you are a fan of the brilliant Joss Whedon's other projects (the fantastic Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel) or not, I wager you will still love Firefly.  The direction, writing, and performances from a brilliant ensemble cast are flawless.  Joss Whedon is the only person I know of that can effectively entertain fans of drama, action, and comedy simultaneously in the same one hour episode.  You will laugh out loud, shed tears, and be on the edge of your seat in any given episode of Firefly.The creators have put the episodes of Firefly back in the order they were meant to air.  There are also three great episodes included that fox never aired.  Anyone that watched the series when it aired will see what a mistake fox made in refusing to air the episodes the way that Joss and Tim intended.Many reviewers have suggested that Firefly The Movie is a done deal to come out in 2004.  This is not true.  It is possible, but by no means a certainty.  The best thing people can do to help get the movie made or (like in the case of another brilliant but doomed fox series Family Guy) get the series back on tv is to buy this box set.  You will not regret it.And be on the lookout for Tim Minear's new series (oh god it's on fox too, it will never make it) Wonderfalls.	5.0	Best DVD Set Of The Year!!!!!	2003-12-15	2	2	0

The storytelling here is subtle, character-driven, full of humour and mystery.  Most importantly, it's rarely predictable -- and when it is, it's only to lull you into a false sense of security so that you fall for the next twist in the tale!A few characters wear their hearts on their sleeves but most have secrets and ulterior motives that were only beginning to be revealed when the show was axed.  What did the preacher do before he found religion and why does he know so much about crime? What's so special about the contents of River's head that the most powerful corporation in the universe wants her captured?It seems like everything about this production just gelled from day 1, and the stories here rate alongisde the strongest Buffys and Angels -- and far outstrip what both those series acheived in their first years.It seems Fox doesn't have the patience or know-how to turn an original series into a hit.  Here's hoping someone in TV Land sees sense following the upcoming movie and picks up this extraordinary show for a second series.Don't be put off by the blending of Westerns with science fiction, or the links to Buffy if you're not a fan of that show.

The fact that it was cancelled in the middle of season one is just another example of how idiotic Hollywood executives can be. Bean counters and greedy suits should not have the power to pass judgement over things they do not understand. One of the tragedies of TV these days is that no one has any patience. The show got axed early because it wasn't 'hitting the numbers' to be kept around. Sometimes it takes more than four months to build an audience, but the brainless idiots at Fox could not understand that! You should have seen the heaping pile of dung they replaced Firefly with, not impressive at all.What really got me though was why the Sci-Fi channel did not pick it up after it was cancelled. Sci-Fi network seems to prefer the cheesy B- garbage that they play most of the time.Watch this DVD, but I warn you it will be bitter sweet.

Hudson ""THudPHud"""	"Ever so much more realistic than scifi shows with gleaming, spotlessly clean spaceships that seem to magically run themselves, Firefly portrayed a spaceship and crew considerably less than gleaming and clean. And, sometimes less than fully functional. And... although the ""heroes"" in this case, not quite on the right side of the local laws. In many major TV markets, Fox affiliates broadcast baseball local baseball games. Evidently their deals with the MLB call for them to preempt network shows. That happened here in the San Francisco area. Even Firefly's premere episode got delayed by about 18 minutes (9 of which were commercials!) so those of us recording the program missed a lot of that episode as well as entire other episodes. There are people at Fox who should be punished, but that is another story. Firefly is one of those shows so well written that even people who shun SciFi (my wife) enjoyed it. Instead of being written to a formula, Joss W took the high road with a great mix of the verbal and the visual. I'm not sure what the budget was, but the money was well spent on sets and guest stars. Favorite episode? ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" by a hair. After seeing it, you tell yourelf that ""I should have seen that coming"" but you didn't. Now I/we can enjoy all of the episodes without interruption. Do you think that if enough people buy this DVD set that the SciFi channel might consider reviving the series?

In its short time of being on the air ""Firefly"" proved to be one of the greatest science fiction shows television has seen.  It's a terrible shame it was cancelled after only fourteen episodes.In the few episodes that were made each of the nine passengers on board the spaceship Serenity is developed and shown to have an interesting history, though the most compelling may be that of River, the genius experimented upon by the government, and her brother Simon, who sacrifices his career as a doctor to save her.Each episode is exciting and serves to advance the story, avoiding the cliches of so many other science fiction series.  In the end, it left us with many tantalizing mysteries, some which were answered by the great follow-up film ""Serenity,"" and some which were not.I've since found a few highly entertaining and intelligent series such as ""Lost,"" ""Veronica Mars,"" and ""Arrested Development"" - but they'll never be able to take the place of ""Firefly."""	5.0	Fantastic television	2005-11-27	2	2	0

I was so spellbound by the film that I rented the first disk of the series. After the pilot episode, I knew I had to buy the whole thing.  Absolutely amazing show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AHAI51ODZTVPQ	Thomas R. Manning	"We stumbled across this series on Netflix, and after just 2 episodes decided we needed to own it! We absolutely love this series (and wish it had gone beyond one season). It takes a unique perspective on the future of space travel and what it is like to be struggling to make ends meet as odd-jobs outsiders that are almost always on the run and willing to do anything (legal or otherwise) to make ends meet! It is unique, it combines drama with humor with a bit of sci-fi and some really great characters! If you enjoy the series you need to check out ""Serenity"" the feature film created at the completion of the series, which is now one of my top 5 movies! It wraps things in the series up, and has some awesome action mixed with surprising twists! Must see!!"	5.0	LOVE THIS SERIES!!	2011-03-20	5	4	1

The only reason I wrote this review was because of the greatness that this show could have achieved.  Tsk...tsk...tsk... Fox did it once again... Keen Eddie, The Tick...and now, my favorite show on TV.I have watched the DVD set over and over again... each time guessing and searching for clues to the Preacher's identity, the Blue Sun's hedious plan, Inara's reason for running, what power in the 'verse will stop River, more on the Reevers, and of course many other questions.  This show slowly unfolds showing all its characters, plot points, and of course clever humor.  Every time I reach the end of Episode 14, I shake my head and incert disc 1 into the dvd player and ening it all over again.PS. Cancelled to make room for a lovely reality show... great joice no?  And yes, I sing the theme song every single time.	5.0	First time review, and for a perfect reason.	2004-02-18	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZOIGQHW7FPT2	Thorvald	"3200+ other reviews have already said it: This is best science fiction television series ever made.Firefly, which I didn't see until it was off the air, was originally recommended to me by a group of serious Heinlein fans whose opinion I value. They weren't wrong. Firefly achieved in three episodes the level of world creation and characters that took original Star Trek nearly three seasons to reach. Firefly has strong shades of Heinlein in it, in all the best ways. Read Heinlein's ""Between Planets"" to see what a young Mal Reynolds fighting his revolution might be like. Heinlein's great novel about slavery, ""Citizen of the Galaxy"" will show you the Alliance worlds with their rich and powerful enslaving those beneath. And, of course, you'll see Inara in Heinlein's character Tamara, in ""Time Enough for Love."" Cowboys, horses, and spaceships all mixed together? Heinlein was there long since. If you're a Firefly fan who hasn't yet read Heinlein, I envy you. You have a wondrous reading adventure awaiting you. And I dare say Heinlein, who was a big Star Trek fan, would love Firefly, too.This richness of world creation, with Joss Whedon's brilliance in casting, dialog, and directing, all go in to making Firefly the wonderful story and show it is. If you like Heinlein, if you like Star Trek, if you like good science fiction in any form, you will almost certainly fall in love with Firefly and, with the rest of us, mourn that it ended far too soon.As for whether you should get the DVDs versus the Blu-Rays...I have had both and watched both on big screen high def televisions. I am a little sad to say the Blu-rays weren't worth the upgrade. If you already have the DVD set, it's not, in my opinion, worth getting the Blu-rays expecting a major improvement in the look of the video. With ""Lord of the Rings"" the difference was stunning. The Blu-ray video was gorgeous, a substantial step up from the DVDs. With Firefly, it's more hit-and-miss. Some of the video is better with the Blu-rays, but not all of it, and some of the video flaws are more apparent with the Blu-rays than with the DVDs. It's not a consistent improvement in quality."	5.0	Firefly Like Heinlein	2012-05-12	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3DZCNEU21MB6L	"THowerton ""SHowT"""	"""Firefly"" the television series is many things: western space opera; political action adventure; pure escapism entertainment.  While all of these things make this series a huge blast to watch the center pole of the series is Nathan Fillion's (of ""Castle"" fame) Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds.  As captain of the eponymous ship he crews eight other significant members who are each very well developed over the series and, as important, are a reflection of the different sides of the man who is Mal.First officer Zoe Washburne (played by Gina Torres) is a confederate of Mal's, a fellow browncoat, who fought the good rebel fight along with him and lost the battle but the fight lives on.  She represents Mal's fighting spirit and his notion that, no matter how bleak the future looks, you look it right square in the eyes and stare it down.  She also represents his idealism.Pilot extraordinaire Hoban ""Wash"" Washburne (played by underrated actor Alan Tudyk) is a lighter slice of life, married to Zoe and always ready to see the world through a ""this is sorta ridiculous"" lense.  He represents Mal's muted ability and desire to relax, to rest.Courtesan Inara Serra (played by dropdead gorgeous Morena Baccarin of recent ""V"" fame) is a complicated love interest of Mal's.  He's torn by her work (a high class space prostitute essentially) and she's torn by his stoicism and his love for his ship and crew versus herself.  She's a worldly, politically savvy individual and she represents Mal's eroticism and his philanthropic love.  He would go to the ends of the universe for Inara though he would rarely admit this to her.Jayne Cobb (played by the Baldwin known as Adam--check him out in the old classic ""My Bodyguard""--he looks virtually the same 20 years later!) is the immoral, selfish, and brutish grunt of the crew.  He just might sell any or all of them out for a big enough paycheck...or to save his own hide.  He represents Mal's raw aggression and desire to overcome his obstacles by virtue of force, if not by will.Firefly's technical and mechanical expertise is found in Kaylee Frye (played by youthful Jewel Staite), who is practically at one with her ship and can fix just about any of its maladies.  She is also a wide-eyed innocent, a newly blooming flower, taking in the world around her as it comes and believing the best about people.  She represents Mal's purity.The enigmatic Shepherd Book (played by character actor Ron Glass) brings a little >ahem&lt; color to the all-white cast in more ways than one.  He is the saint among the sinners but the more we know the more we know that he hasn't always been a saint.  He is also the sage, able to dispense wordly and spiritual advice, and he repeatedly challenges Mal to look outside of himself to the bigger picture and to Firefly's version of ""God"" (not well developed but seemingly close to a Judeo-Christian representation).  Shepherd represents Mal's godly qualities, of being a Moses/ shepherd to his crew, and also to his spiritual nature (tamped down and ground into the dirt as it is) and even doing God's work in spite of himself.Dr. Simon Tam (played by Sean Maher) comes aboard with his sister, River Tam (played by balletic Summer Glau), in his bid to help his brain-scrambled living-weapon sister away from the intergalactic ruling authority of ""The Alliance"" who has been experimenting on her and turning her into some sort of super weapon.  Simon is fierce, righteously opinionated, and loyal to a fault toward his sister.  River is a glyph, a human key to the masked potentials of human feats (both mental and physical) as well as a fractured, tortured soul.  (Her storyline is the most distressing and maudlin of the series and threatens to bring the series down a notch at times unfortunately.)  As a family unit they represent Mal's sense of family and as him being a father figure.  Individually, Dr. Tam represents Mal's single-minded determination.  River represents Mal's untapped potential and belief (along with Shepherd Book) in things greater than himself.It is quite the compelling character study and this cast of seemingly disparate characters all resonate and coalesce within the centrifuge that is Mal.  Great, dynamic, excitinga and well-written series.

However, when ""Serenity"" closed the circle arc, I realized that the show's early demise actually strengthened the story loop, forcing Joss to focus. Otherwise, it would have gone through several 'trumped-up' endings, like we were subjected to in ""Buffy.""First of all, I love the that ""Firefly"", unlike most SF, he focuses on the losers in a high-tech war. Mostly, though, the characters continue to draw me back.To me, the complex mother/ father love dynamic underpinning the relationship between Mal and Inara, and its unexpressed sexual love, is key to the show. That both feel it is undeniable. And their ""parental"" love towards the crew saves them from seeming to be just a collection of people. And it seems real to me.The biggest weakness of ""Firefly"", as a work speculative world front, is the ""old west"" feel on the terraformed worlds. Even though I love westerns, it seems a touch unbelievable here. I understand that the worlds were backwaters. But horses and six shooters? This seems a stretch.But, again, the characters save me. They act much like real human beings, I keep coming back to watch the series again and again."	5.0	Character is everything	2012-03-18	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1997C46112EKH	Tiffany Bell	Firefly is a great scifi series that sadly only lasted one season. The thing that really makes this show is the great characterization that Joss Weadon seems to put into everything he works on--from TV to comics.I greatly enjoyed this series. The DVDs, cases, and box are standard. They get the job done, and are what I'd expect for any DVDs, really. The thing that gets me is the enormous load times I have on the menus. It might just be my DVD player, but it will load the background and do some animations, stop for a second, then load some foreground animation of the actual episode, and then load the menu's text. It's not a huge issue, but it's kind of annoying to have to wait.I also would have liked an option to 'Play All'. But that's very minor.Over all, this is a great set to buy.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2QSN9JTY9CLDW	Tim Bare	"Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a genius. In his various efforts in television and comic books, he has become a favorite of mine. So when i heard, a couple years back that is, that he was investing his formidable creative prowess in a science fiction series, I was breathless with anticipation. And of course, Whedon and his long-time partner Tim Minear did not disappoint, nor did their well-chosen, very talented cast.Firefly is a science fiction western, where 500 years in the future humanity has spread across the galaxy, united under the totalitarian Alliance and its corporate arm, Blue Sun. In the future, cultures have been melded together to come up with intriguing art, fashion, and even language (the characters swear in Chinese). Our heroes are the crew of the Firefly-class transport, Serenity. They are Malcolm Reynolds, the captain and veteran of the war between his Independent faction and the Alliance; Zoe, his first mate and fellow soldier in the war; Wash, Zoe's husband and the pilot; Jayne, an amoral thief who acts as the muscle of the group; Kaylee, the mechanic, with the ability to telepathically communicate with machines; and Inara, the resident ""companion"" (similar to courtesans or geishas) and the ship's ""ambassador"". They're renegades and thieves, taking any job that pays, but things get complicated when they pick up three interesting passengers: Shepherd Book, a preacher, Simon Tam, a former doctor, and his insane sister River, who is wanted by the Alliance.The show is very well-written and well-directed, especially with Whedon behind the camera. The cast are all incredible, but the highlight is Nathan Fillion as Reynolds, who is truly incredible on screen. But unfortunately, by the time one watches all the episodes, the arc of the season is just unfolding, and is cut short by the fat cats at fox. The good news is Whedon's doing a movie. So after watching these 14 episodes, go see the movie so you can see the story unfold."	5.0	One of the best sci-fi series ever to grace television	2004-08-09	5	4	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AWWCPVKV6NRQF	Tim Curry's Chin	"If you're not a science fiction fan, don't dismiss this so quickly.  (Let's ignore the fact that it owes at least as much to the Western genre.)  True sci-fi cannot be told without the science.  Firefly, on the other hand, features themes, characters, storylines and humour that would be at home in any dramatic genre.  Think of it as a brilliant story that just happens to be set on a spaceship.Firefly has genuine warmth.  You can't help but care for each of the nine main characters, all of whom have interesting personalities, interactions and backstories.  It's both solid drama and solid comedy.  (Happily, these two areas mesh well.  Most of the laughs come from character interaction, so they doesn't distract from the more serious moments.  If anything, they add to them.)On top of that, Joss Whedon's writing is PAINFULLY sharp.As the film adaptation ""Serenity"" proves, the pen is mightier than the sword.If you're after some ingelligently written, mature, humorous, engaging and ultimately uplifting entertainment, you owe it to yourself to buy this boxset.  (Or check out the two-hour pilot, also titled ""Serenity"", THEN buy it.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2JP0URFHXP6DO	Tim Janson	"Sure...UPN can let a mediocre Star Trek Enterprise run for several years, but you get a new, smart Sci-Fi show and the stuffed shirts at Fox pull it after only episodes.  Way to give it a chance Fox, I guess they needed more air-time for Man Vs. Beast or When Animals Attack # 175.  What made this sci-fi Western unique was that this was still a human show.  There were no aliens.  The Crew of the Firefly was led by Captain Mal Reynolds played by Nathan Fillion who Buffy fans will remember as the evil priest on the last few episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Other cast members included: Adam Baldwin as the mercenary Jayne Cobb, and Ron Glass of Barney Miller fame as ""Book"" a mysterious minister.  They make up the crew of the ship Serenity as the group of rogues struggles to make their way taking whatever jobs they can, which often make then less than your stereotypical heroes.  Characters is what makes a great show and Whedon knows great characters and delivers again with a fantastic ensemble cast, all perfectly suited for the varying roles they are portraying.  Not only did Fox cancel the show early, but they showed the episodes out of order from what Whedon wanted.  But hey, thank God for DVD as you get all 14 episodes in all their glory.Among my favorite episodes are:""Out of Gas""  A flashback episode that details how mal acquired the Serenity and how each of the members joined the crew.""Ariel""  The crew visit a planet called Ariel where tehy attempt to get simon into a hospital to use a machine to help River.  They pose as dead bodies and are eventually captured by the Alliance.""War Stories""  Mal and Walsh are kidnapped by Niska who wants payback for the botched train robbery in the first episode.""Serenity parts 1 & 2""  is great as well.  Given Whedon's track record it's just incredible that Fox didn't allow the show to develop.  This was really a sci-fi show for people who are not necessarily Sci-fi fans.  The backdrop was the future but this was a very human drama much the way that Buffy was and sucked in many people who were not horror fans or who were older.  I feel about Firefly much the way I feel about another Fox show that got a raw deal, Brimstone.  Stupid Fox!"	5.0	FOX NITWITS DROP THE BALL	2005-06-22	10	9	1

I figured since it was filmed for TV a few years ago that the BLURAY wasn't really required. It looked great on my 32"" LCD and I'll lend it to my friends who haven't gone to bluray anyway.... The ""Firefly"" series was great. The western (cowboy frontier) influence and 9 characters each with very human complications, makes this a refreshing venture into space and not just a SCI-FI cookie cutter show. It has good initial character development and enough to be satisfied even though they didn't get to make a 2nd season. Make sure to watch the extras and commentaries when your done. I'm kinda techy, work in the aviation industry, and love the ship design and layout.I haven't seen the movie ""Serenity"", but episode 1 is 2 parts and named 'serenity'.FOX started with episode 3 or 4 to grab viewers with a couple of the action episodes, and didn't air the first. So, I don't think I'll need to get the movie.There are some 'adult situations' so I won't let my pre-teen daughters watch. But I highly recommend this for several hours of enjoyment.

It's funny, it's poignant, original, well-written, well-directed, and the cast is superb. It's a rarity in television - something you can truly watch over and over, and never grow tired of. I knew very little about Joss Whedon before being exposed to this series, but now I respect him as one of the best writer-directors in the business today.When you watch 'Firefly,' if you feel the same way I do - and hundreds of thousands of fans have - you'll understand why helping it live on is a labor of love.  When it's done, you can't believe there's not more, and thank God that 'Serenity' was made.It has elements for everyone to love - quirky characters, action, space, romance, mystery - it's all there.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3LI8BP8V6D0QG	"Timothy Jay Cagle ""Sundiver"""	"I would have to agree with the newspaper critic who said that ""Firefly was too good to survive Network Television"". It is a complex story, with complex characters, and a rich background, much of which is never fully explained. This combination would make any network exec see ""cancellation"" stamped all over the script. The show defies the ""cookie cutter"", stamped out of a mold sci-fi that the networks tell us we want.The cast is filled with excellent actors, who quickly become real people with unique flaws, strengths, and mysteries of their own. The cast fits together so well that the loss of a single character, any character, would mean the end of the story.In the real world there is no sound in space. There is no sound in space in Firefly either. I consider this a strength, as so few people can resist the urge to follow the Hollywood conceit that sound in space scenes makes them more dramatic. I felt that the drama was heightened by the added realism.My personal favorite episode is ""War Stories"", an episode filled with peril, humor, and courage. Each character also shows a diffent side to their personalities, as some of their usual roles get reversed. Except of course for Jayne. Jayne is almost a constant, as his personality is so narrow. He is not one-dimensional however, just very consistant.Wash, and Zoe really shine in this episode. Zoe walks a very fine line between her loyaty to Wash (her husband), and Mal (her captain), and makes it look easy. Wash, a self-described, Semi-muscular man, takes on a tough guy aspect that would be out of character if not for the subtle touches of humor that tinge every scene he is in. He delivers a tough guy speech, with all the machismo of a big action star, while cocking the smallest gun I have ever seen.Mal is put through the wringer in a big way, and shows off his strength as a leader. We also see that he is a big fan of the ""eye for an eye"" concept.The other characters shine as well but there are five more, and I'm sure that I would run out of space if tried to cover them all. Suffice to say, this series is definately good sci-fi. It would even appeal to people who are not sci-fi fans, or Josh Wheden fans. Everyone who is tired of ""same old, same old"" tv should definately see Firefly.Thank you for your time,Sundiver"	5.0	Better than Star Wars?	2005-10-08	15	15	0

There's humor, drama, love connections and great acting. The show resembles FC because of too many similarities, criminals running from bad guys, living on a ship, being chased by bad guys, hot chicks with guns..There's no character for River in Farscape though, she's way out there......The only thing that is missing is Scorpius and ""Buckwheat"" The first few episodes are questionable as the characters evolve, but as soon as you pop in the second disk, you're hooked. Pick this box set up along with the first season of Farscape and you'll never watch that Star Gate show again, except for the current season.

I'm halfway through the set and am enjoying the series more with each episode.  The pilot, in particular, I thought was truly fine -- I would happily have to gone to see it more than once as a first-run film release.  I found the second episode to be a slight let-down, but since then they've only gotten better and better.  I can't believe Fox cancelled a program this good.  (Wait a minute, we're talking about Fox -- Simpsons aside, I can believe they cancelled a program this good.)Great writing, great acting, great special effects -- an exceptional, kickass series.

Each character embodies a personality and traits that makes the show greater than the sum of its parts.  The story lines are fluid, entertaining, intelligent and almost poetic.  The sets and costumes are unique against the otherwise generic and redundant backdrops of the average television show. You can see from the outtakes and commentaries on the bonus DVD as well as the show itself that the cast and crew dearly loved doing this show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3SRBACI3VJD9R	T. Johnson	I can't pinpoint exactly why I was drawn in to this series so strongly. I guess the number one thing is the characters who are just a lot of fun, and well cast across the board. After that it's the stories, which are sort of western/sci-fi/adventures with a touch of Mission Impossible at times. And then there's the universe and the ship/setting itself. I even love the title theme and opening sequence. Simply put, I just LOVED this show and I'm VERY disappointed that it got canceled. I've watched the series 2-3 times now, as well as Serenity the movie 3 times, and I still can't get enough - this is exceptional in my experience.I think if they could have gotten more people to watch the show in the first place and give it a chance, it might have been something much much bigger.	5.0	Can't get enough	2008-02-29	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AEZE484NHTP55	"T. Jones ""Liam Blue"""	Firefly isn't a perfect show, especially in it's first, and only, season. It tends to never really explain why the government is so bad, nor does it give, much, of a progression between any of the characters. Although in it's favor, it is an expertly written and incredibly addictive piece of fiction. Firefly if given the chance, for more seasons on air, it did would have been an amazing piece in fiction, but as it stands, because it failed to find a mainstream audience, Firefly-The Complete Series is a fun footnote in sci-fi history that deserved better.	4.0	Not Quite Perfect	2005-10-03	9	2	7
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1Y8TP64ZONABT	"T. J. Stewart ""Terry S"""	"I never saw this on tv, and I'm not even sure if it was broadcast in Britain, but I picked it up anyway simply based on what everyone on the IMDb and Amazon were saying about it, and that it was a Joss Whedon show and I liked his other series Buffy and Angel.  Firefly has the same high quality of writing as these shows, but due to Fox's foolish decision to cancel the series the story arc never had a chance to really get going, though there are enough indications of where it was heading to make it extremely frustrating that the network never gave it a chance.The firefly universe is a very original one, owing little to any previous Sci-fi series I can remember with no alien races mentioned.  Basically in this universe there are a number of hi-tech and economically rich core worlds, where the flying cars, laser weaponry, futuristic cityscapes and the other things familiar from other Sci-fi series live.  However in the course of the series these are hardly ever visited.  Instead the stories take place in the terra-formed outer worlds, where everything is very low-tech; conventional firearms, horses to get around, a frontier, often rather lawless, Wild West aspect to many of the places, where survival is very much a struggle but things are still kept together by visiting space traders, such as the Firefly class ship Serenity on which our heroes live and work.  If the core worlds are the equivalent of modern day First World USA and Western Europe, these outer worlds are the equivalent of our more poverty stricken Third World.Earth is never mentioned much, except when people refer to ""Earth that was"", which hints something rather drastic happened here in this universe's past, and when we first see it, it's in the aftermath of a civil war, between a centralised Alliance and a number of other worlds who want independence (the brownshirts), and in which the Alliance has won.  The captain of Serenity, Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion, who played the evil expriest Caleb in Buffy Season 7), and his friend and second in command Zoe Warren (Gina Torres, who played the evil Jasmin in Angel Season 4), both fought in this war on the losing brownshirt side.  Other crew members are Wash (Zoe's husband and the pilot), Jayne a mercenary employed as the ships muscle, and Kaylee the ship's engineer, as well as the 'companion' Inara, a very high class prostitute who rents on of the ship's shuttles (in this world this class of 'companion' is an honorable profession, more like a courtesan, and Inara was initially taken on board the ship to give them openings to high society).The series starts as the ship takes on board some passengers including Shepard (sort of a priest) Book and a doctor called Simon Tam, to raise some money to keep the ship going (they are always rather hard up for money).  I won't spoil anything by going into what happens, (you'll just have to get hold of the DVD's), though Simon's sister River (Summer Glau, who played the balerina in an episode of Season 3 Angel) plays an increasingly important part Anyway the first episode is a great introductory story, and all in all I recommend Firefly to anyone who likes Sci-fi, westerns or just a good story.  On this basis I can't wait for the film Serenity, when it comes out in 2005.5 / 5"	5.0	One of the most original Sci-fi series since Babylon 5	2004-09-28	16	15	1

It's like I want to leap into the TV screen and become a part of it.It's very unfortunate that the show got cancelled so early, but I'm very glad there was made a movie later on.I really think this could be the next Star Trek.  Looking back in history, even the Star Trek shows did quite poor at first, until it was cancelled after the 3rd season.  It took quite a while before a movie was made, and despite it doing quite mediocre in the box office, the fanbase kept it going.  I hope this is what'll happen to Firefly too (or Serenity if you like).I see it already, more Firefly seasons with additional ""sub-shows"" called ala ""Star Trek Voyager"" and such, with a completely different ship and different crew, just the same universe.Anyway, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen this show yet; GO BUY THESE GORRAM DVD'S!(then watch the movie Serenity).

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3CZVZ35U5F96H	T. Kucukyumuk	"I don't come from the American culture. But I grew up watching western movies on Sunday mornings. In that sense, ""the wild west"" is not an unfamiliar setting for me.When I first heard about Firefly, I was suspicious about the universe Whedon created. How believeable is a place where you have spaceships and cowboys or whatever co-existing? However, I could not resist the temptation. Unfortunately, in today's movie and TV landscape original ideas are hard to come by. And Firefly is an original concept. Although the basic premises of the story is really hard to buy (horses and spaceships), the character depth, the pace and freshness of the series is strong enough to keep you pinned to your seat accross the TV.The visual effects also play a very strong role in making you believe in this universe. I am very pleased to see more and more of real world physics appearing in sci-fi movies and TV series. Explosions in space won't make sounds. And there is none. The camera actions I was so fond of in the new Battlestar Galactica are also seen here which gives more strength to the visual drama of the series.Going back to the characters, every one of them are well-developed and you like each and every one of them. I could not understand the real power of River until I watched the movie (yes, in some episodes you do see that she has special combat skills but that is just a glimpse compared to the showdown in the movie). Even Jayne gets likable sometimes. The romance between Mal and Inara and Kaylee and Simon gets in the way of the story from time to time, but I guess we need some emotion and I won't complain. I don't know how others felt but for me Shepherd Book is a very important part of the series. He introduces a healthy dose of mystery and well, ""serenity"" into the hectic pace of the Firefly. I was shocked to see what Whedon decided to do with him in the movie (don't worry I won't ruin the experience for you, just in case you haven't watched it).What is more, you see morality, the concepts of good-bad, right-wrong questioned all the time. In times of hardship, how would a decent man behave? You see some answers that you probably would have given.As a final point, I should say that I am very glad that I bought the DVD set. I wish there was more of it. I don't know if they will be able to continue the series after Serenity, but I will be here to watch it if you bring it on Mr. Whedon."	5.0	Firefly: Adventures in Wild Westspace	2006-01-04	16	15	1

I was hesitant at first because TV shows these days are just plain dull, until I came on Amazon and saw all the 5 Stars for this show.  First I thought it was a fluke.  I haven't even saw a single show before purchasing the Series and Serenity.  It was no fluke, I am now a BELIEVER!!  Everything about it was wonderful.  I could not stop watching it (completed the whole series and the movie on a saturday).  I wish there was more.  I also got my girlfriend addicted to it, and she is not a SciFi fan.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3IH00TBDPDS1R	Todd A. Fonseca	"Joss Whedon's Firefly series is an enigma.  It's not hard core science fiction - pistols in space?  But it is strangely addictive not only to science fiction fans but anyone who enjoys a good yarn.I originally approached this series skeptically after hearing about it from a friend.  However, after buying the box set the next thing I knew I had stayed up all night going through episode after episode.  Why?  In all honesty some episodes were better than others and I found I preferred ones written by either Tim Minear or Joss Whedon though I enjoyed them all.  But here are some other reasons.The ship, I love the ship!  But how?  No laser guns, no weapons at all - it's a cargo ship - rather a smuggler's ship.  This is the type of ship that the just emerging space travelers from some distant unknown and unnecessary planet would have on any other series, but on Firefly it is a character of it's own.  Whedon's interior is masterfully perfect for the characters that man it.  It's an electic mix of furniture where the majority of the vessel looks like my great grandmother's house in rural Indiana.Wash's (Alan Tudyk) pilot station is personalized like any cube in corporate America.  Contrast this with Inara's (Morena Baccarin) shuttle where she conducts her ""companion"" activities - again perfect.  Whedon made a great choice when building the set to have it be one complete set.  The camera follows the characters throughout Serenity in many scenes and this makes the entire story come to life.But it's obviously not just the ship but those inside.The character development throughout the series is what will keep you coming back for more.  This is what is so sad about the death of the series.  Serenity the feature film brought some closure in some areas but far too abrupt.  Therefore, I'm left with re-watching the same episodes over and over wondering what might have been.So I guess like many of you out there, I too am Browncoat.  You can't stop the signal!"	5.0	Are you a Browncoat?	2008-08-11	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A62BVFCGWU650	Todd CK	The production value and special effects are just ridiculously good, especially for its time. The casts chemistry and characters are top notch. I'm blown away that fox didn't renew this. It's like this amazing gem that they had no idea what they held. I hope the guy that canceled it got fired long ago. I get that it's about ratings, but any fool can see firefly would have eventually caught on big when more people found out about it. Some of the biggest shows ever can take a second season before they become noticed and take off. If fox had any sense they would have recognized it was worth hanging onto it longer and pushing it better. I feel bad I didn't support it when it came out. I remember the commercials well, I just thought it was something different than it was from what I saw back then. Eventually I would have started watching when I figured it out. As I'm sure many others would. But we never got the chance. It's like one of TV's biggest tragedies that there were not more seasons. It feels so strange how amazing the world is they put together, and that's it, just basically half a season. Just ends right there. And you are thinking, how in the world can this be all there is to this amazing universe? Well they had a great movie that wrapped things up nice. Would have been better though to see that all play out (and more) over a few more seasons though.	5.0	Pure awesome	2014-06-08	1	1	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJAH15UB1KX5P	Todd Guthrie	"I too missed this one in the few weeks Fox aired it, but caught it later in re-release on the SciFi channel and was hooked. The cast is delightful, the writing sharp and witty, and the premise interesting. What truly impressed me was how well Whedon created his universe - the juxtaposition of futuristic high tech and retro Old West was not only plausible, but made sense. Whedon re-invented the wagon trains of the push westward on a galactic scale, and set a bunch of characters you could genuinely care about loose in it. This show rings more ""real"" in a human sense than any modern reality show - do your intellect and sense of humor a favor and check this out!"	5.0	Television Worth Watching - What a Concept!	2006-04-03	11	10	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2DOMNZ0NFR471	Tod Lackey	"I'm not sure what I could possibly say about Firefly that hasn't been said a thousand times before.  I completely missed it during its first run on Fox.  In fact, my first exposure to Firefly was when a friend encouraged me to see Serenity at a movie theater.  Since then, I've watched the series several times.As a word of warning to other conscientious parents, the show can be fun and lighthearted, but ultimately this is NOT a show for kids.  There's plenty of sex, violence, torture and other adult themes.  (This hit me when my daughter asked me, ""What's a Companion?"")  Firefly is best watched after the kids are in bed."	5.0	What can I say?	2011-04-05	2	1	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ATF23YVUT0KYJ	Toivo Voll	Among all the current science fiction series--Enterprise, Andromeda, Farscape, SG1 etc. Firefly was easily the best. The chemistry between the crew members, the depth and edge all the characters had, the witty dialogue, all contributed to make this a very intelligent and entertaining show. Yet I can see how it might not appeal to everyone--you can't just watch the gunfights, but actually have to think about the moral issues, and follow the stories to learn more about the characters. If you do, there is so much more depth here than your typical space show.	5.0	Best Scifi in Recent Memory	2003-09-02	9	8	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1MM1MODB81PTU	Tom Abols	It baffles me how Fox was able to cancel this show, it is, without question, one of the best Sci-Fi shows produced in recent memory.  If you like science fiction, or just good characterization, tight scripts, and great stories, then you definetely need to pick this up.  The only negative thing I can think of in relation to this DVD is that there aren't any more episodes coming our way.

This show makes you think about morality and there are great lessons in Leadership, Teamwork and Family presented here. Maybe it is better for The Legend of Firefly that only 1 season was made.... they did not make any episodes that stink.	5.0	Firefly is possibly the BEST SciFi Series ever made	2013-04-24	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"Back in 2004, being a big fan of Joss Whedon's shows ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"" and ""ANGEL"", I decided I'd better pick up his failed sci-fi series, ""FIREFLY"".  My aunt bought it for me for my birthday, and I eventually began watching it.  The pilot, ""Serenity"", runs 85 minutes and I was bored through most of it.  Why had people been talking about this?A few months later, with nothing else to do, I decided to check out the rest of the series.  Oh, boy, am I glad I did.""FIREFLY"" is one of the greatest television series ever, a true masterpiece.  It dares to go where other shows will not - something that angered television executives when it was on the air.  It's set in a distant future, where sleazy corporations run the many different worlds in the universe.  Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) captains the Firefly-class spaceship ""Serenity"", which smuggles goods across planets while running from the Alliance.  In each episode, the crew is faced with a different problem, both off and on the ship.This show is mind-blowing, absolutely and completely.  As with ""BUFFY"" and ""ANGEL"", Joss Whedon provides us with thought-out storylines, witty dialogue, and realistic characters whom we care about.  The casting is absolutely superb; each actor and actress brings their character to life perfectly.  The show is a science-fiction drama mixed with western action and grit.  Greg Edmonson's music is unique and entirely fitting; it really adds to the emotion.Though each episode is nearly the same in quality, I would say that the best episode is ""Out of Gas"", a moving look at how Mal Reynolds first met the crew that he (and we) would come to love.  ""The Message"" has received much acclaim due to its beautiful cinematography, Emmy-worthy performances and very moving script.Out of the 14 outstanding episodes the set contains, only 11 were aired before the show's cancellation.  Why?  An excuse from the network was ""viewers"".  But can the viewers be blamed?  The network placed the episodes on Friday nights (a notorious time slot) and aired them out of sequence.  The network was afraid to do anything out of the ordinary.  Instead they would rather air ""series"" like ""My Big Fat Obnoxious Husband"".  Cancelling this series was one of the worst mistakes in television history.  I'm not the first one to say that it could have been the next ""STAR TREK"".With a feature-length movie, ""SERENITY"", about to be released, two sequels being planned, and incredible DVD sales, this series will not be forgotten.  But that doesn't make its cancellation much easier to deal with.  By all means, pick up this absolutely fantastic series and show the television corporations what we REALLY want."	5.0	Cancelling it was one of the worst mistakes in television history	2005-08-12	6	5	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A76P6QCZP2LDI	Tom	"Others have written better and more complete reviews here. I only want to add another five-star vote. I stumbled across this series looking for something to fill the sci-fi/fantasy void left by Farscape's untimely demise. At first, I looked into Kevin Sorbo's ""Andromeda"" series (what a disaster!) and then I came across ""Firefly."" It's at turns a dark (by that I mean it's occasionally bloody, creepy, gruesome, and sexy--this is not a series for children of any age, in my opinion) but also a funny and winsome series that I really loved. The story is ongoing and complex, and the chemistry and acting of the nine principal characters in this series is nothing short of amazing.The only downside to this series is that it finally ends. Come on, Firefly movie! (Some of the latest web rumors I've read even suggest that the film version being developed has been rewritten to serve less as an ""epilogue"" and more as a [possible] return of this very fine series to television. I sure hope these rumours are accurate.)"	5.0	Fantastic!	2004-02-12	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3DF9Q8AB3DLX9	Tom Sawyer	While I firmly believe that the Firefly legend is growing out of hand, it was a good show.  I watched all  the episodes when they originally aired and thought Fox was making a mistake by pulling the plug on the show.  It was however, as the DVDs show, not the best hour of television ever.  It was not even as original as its proponents make it out to be. Star Trek was the first western in space.  It was reliably good TV that confronted the capacity for good and evil in the same person, had moral ambiguities and examined ideas that seem especially relevant now, such as is it okay to steal under extreme circumstances.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AGQE8IRJJWZGY	"Tonua Carano ""tonuab"""	At the time that I am writing this review, Firefly is ranked #21 on the top sales for Amazon. That's #21 out of hundreds of thousands of items. So, tell me again why Fox cancelled this show?Apparently, the country music theme song scared off a few people...which is too bad. Because it really is one of the best science fiction shows ever to air on television. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for the Star Trek franchise and I think that Gene Roddenberry was great. However, as an avid consumer of science fiction television, movies, and books, I feel strongly that Firefly far surpassed Star Trek.It has all of the elements that I look for when searching for a science fiction book, movie or show: interesting stories, action, adventure, humor, and people I care about. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is one of the greatest space ship captains ever (Captains Kirk and Picard notwithstanding).I can't believe that Fox cancelled this show. At the time Firefly aired, they were running encore shows of Fastlane on Fox AND MTV. (If you missed this week's episode of Fastlane, see it again at ...) Firefly was in the worst possible timeslot (Fridays at 8:00) and they never advertised it EXCEPT during the show itself. If they had supported it half as much as they had supported the now cancelled Fastlane, or The O.C., Firefly would have been a huge success.Review of the DVD: don't let what appears to be low-budget packaging scare you. The content on the DVD set is excellent. And the new episodes (that were filmed but never aired) were well worth the wait. Buy this DVD now to show Joss Whedon and the cast that you support them. Hopefully, the DVD sales will show Fox what a mistake they made in cancelling this show and give it another chance. If that doesn't work, maybe the Firefly film Joss is writing will.	5.0	Best Sci-Fi Show on Television	2003-12-16	3	3	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3S0CP45CMEEQT	Tony	I don't usually review shows. I find it to be a waste of my time. In fact, this is my first review for anything on amazon. I've watched many shows out today, lost, 24, house, but nothing compares to firefly. I only started watching firefly a few weeks ago because of how highly regarded this show is, and I must say, after watching the first few episodes, I was in love with the show. I've watched the aforementioned shows for several years now, but after a few episodes, I can say firefly is my favorite show of all time. I finished watching the last episode of firefly and the movie serenity a couple of hours ago and I am saddened to see that its over. I love the movie, but I must say, I wish it was never made because the existence of this movie hurts the possibility of the return of firefly, at least with all the crew on board. Anyways, I can't think of any show that can combine the elements of story, dialog, character development and originality as well as firefly. Dollhouse was another great show by Joss Whedon but it still can't hold a candle to firefly. If you've never watched firefly before, I envy you because you will get to experience an amazing show like this. I've already finished watching this show, and sadly, I'm not very optimistic that another show as amazing firefly will come about again in my life time. I'll miss this gorram show. I suggest everyone buy the DVD/Blu ray, give it to your friends if you have it, spread the word. Heck, even watching it on hulu for free will support the show through ads.

Just try this out, if you haven't seen it yet. It's quirky, funny, and warm, and you have to love Nathan Fillion. At least he's still getting roles, like in Castle, or Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.Really miss this show, but really glad to have the blu-ray set of it, both to enjoy and to lend to friends so they too can enjoy this great show.	5.0	just an awesome show	2011-07-30	1	0	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A18JQ7MJPTAWJ3	T. Parsons	I don't even remember this being on-the-air, shame on me.  Buffy is my favorite all-time show and I bought the &quot;Firefly&quot; DVD set on the strength of Wedon's name and the handful of positive reviews I glanced at.  And am I ever glad I did.This show is amazing.  It has all the hallmarks that make Buffy great:  strong ensemble cast, stellar writing, engaging arcs that bubble beneath the episodic plots.  The writing on Wedon's shows is so far above most other shows it's no wonder I can hardly stand TV anymore.  &quot;Firefly&quot; is a shining example of the Space Western genre, with a grittiness that tempers the gadgetry.  Yes, it's got action and adventure and intrigue, but at heart it's an ensemble drama, and it's the characters' interactions that give it life.  And what interaction!  Characters with depth, outstanding performaces, witty dialogue; all the more amazing considering the size of the ensemble.As if another 5-star review were needed.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ATAYJN11E1F92	"Tracy J. Johnson ""tracyjj50"""	"OK, I admit it. I missed this gem when it aired. Fox had the stupidity to bury it on a Friday night when I'm never home. I saw the trailer for the movie and became intrigued, and rented the DVD's. Of course, I LOVE this show. It's Joss Whedon, who can do no wrong in my book.You have 9 totally different people with totally different veiwpoints, who have created this odd little ""family"" in the outer rim of space. Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who fancies himself this cynical, faithless, indifferent smuggler, is, in actuality, noble and generous to those he cares about, and ruthless to those who go up against him or his crew. His right hand, Zoe (Gina Torres), could have been this hard nosed, killing-machine type, but for the love of a good man, her husband (and ship's pilot, and resident wise ass) Wash (Alan Tudyk), who is totally not intimidated by his amazon warrior wife. Then you have the hired mercenary, Jayne (Adam Baldwin) and you are never sure of his loyalties. A more self centered, anything-for-a-buck type you may never meet, but his continued interactions with everyone aboard ""Serenity"" starts exposing a more thoughtful, human side. If the show had continued, you might have been able to say you actually liked Jayne. Ship's mechanic, Kaylee (Jewel Straite), is like everyone's kid sister. Quick to smile and tease, you wonder where a girl like that got such a mechanical mind.  Legalized Companion Inara (Morena Baccarin), has rented Serenity's shuttle for her... um... business liasons, and she and Malcolm have a very complicated relationship. In the first episode, the ship picks up three passengers that become part of the crew: Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), a futuristic version of a priest, who has knowledge and connections that no one sheltered in a monastary should have, and Simon Tam (Sean Maher), a brilliant young doctor turned fugitive after rescuing his kid sister River (Summer Glau), from being a human guinea pig for the Alliance. River at first seems like a complete loon and disconnected, but you slowly realize that she has been engineered into becoming maybe a super assasin, maybe a messiah, you just don't know. All you know is that the Alliance is willing to kill (and in a quite painful and unpleasant manner) to get her back. Hopefully the film will answer these questions.You had a mix of action, moments both hilarious and heartbreaking, and some characters that were sympathetic and others downright scary. And how in the world do spaceships, horses and rifles, and a little bit of Mandarin Chinese fit together to create a perfect new vision of the future? Once again, it's the brilliance of Joss Whedon. There's so much more I wish I knew about these characters. Thank goodness for the movie. Keeping my fingers crossed that film is a success, so that the saga of ""Firefly"" continues."	5.0	Gone Too Soon....	2005-07-29	7	7	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AD2LQ9E9N6Y48	Trail Runner	One of the few shows I can truely say that I loved.  The strange thing is that I never watched it on TV when it was on, even though I knew it was on and would occasionally catch a show but never finish watching one for some reason.  I was used to my Star Trek/Stargate type of shows, and found Firefly too different.  Eventually, there was a sci-fi low for me as I caught up with all of my other sci-fi shows, and I decide to give the series a try starting from the beginning by watching it on DVD.  I was hooked after the first few shows and I couldn't believe I almost missed out on one of the best shows ever.  There are a lot of things to like about Firefly and a lot of things that are a bit contrived or cliche, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  What really sets Firefly part from other sci-fi I would have to say is its humor.  I've never laughed out loud so much watching a sci-fi show.  In the end, it's unfortunate they weren't able to let the story unfold at a slower rate instead of jam packing everything into Serenity.  While Serenity was a good movie, I felt the story was too rushed.  Even so, this short series should not be missed.  Definitely one of the best ever.	5.0	One of the best sci-fi series ever	2008-08-04	0	0	0

It almost seems as though the actors are physically with me!As a fan I may be getting carried away but as someone very familiar with all these episodes I felt I was watching them anew and noticing new things and detail.Suffice to say that as a newbie HD viewer this is my most exciting discovery over and above watching my favourite films.And it works fine on a UK machine.BTW the series itself is a beautiful gem!

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A268N58GBK6AMX	Travis Starnes	This is one of my all time favorite shows.  The writing is top notch with a great blending of humor and drama.  While the quality of the drama can come and go, I will admit a lot of the stuff revolving around river can some times be tough due to Summer Glau's not so amazing acting, the humor always works.  Even Glau pulls off the comedy which really is saying something.Fillion really makes the show.  He was destined to play this character and you can just feel the charisma rolling off the man.  He has that good guy in a not so good world thing going on, and he is as ruthless as he needs to be while still having honor.  Its the kind of personality traits you see in great characters such as the Doctor from Doctor Who.  And he really pulls it off.  He has made me a fan of his for life.The other thing that really helps this show work is the world building.  The entire universe where these characters live feels real.  The level of detail that Whedon has gone to is amazing and unlike some other shows this one feels like it is set in a living, breathing world.  And how can you not love sci-fi western.  Its a great genre that many have been trying to copy since this show came out.  Combine that with really great details, like the mixture of Chinese and English, gives the show a backdrop to play each episode off of is that extra something that really makes this show sing.Also, for sci-fi buffs out there, having a show with no sound in space is a rarity.  It's a small detail and some more casual viewers may be bothered by it, but its a great detail.The only really sad part is how few episodes there are to this.  You can feel he was building to some great stuff that we will never get resolved.  Sure there was the movie, but this only resolved River's story and left so many of the other plot threads swinging loose.	5.0	One Of The Best Shows Ever Made	2013-11-27	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3DKB9QZUJYBE3	"Trixie ""cupcakejones"""	As usual, Fox puts a brilliant show on Friday nights and then kills it before it has a chance (Wonderfalls, we hardly knew ye.)Firefly was the creation of Joss Whedon, the man behind Buffy. This show, other than it's snappy dialogue and quirky heroes, bears no relation though. It's a sci-fi western about a crew of smugglers and their prostitute boarder-a career both legal and respectable in the future-who live on the fringes of space eeking out a living on not exactly legal activities. They must hide from the goverment and the Reivers, a pack of cannibals who roam the frontier territories with faster ships and tractor magnets. As well as the occasional grudge-holding crime overlord-Captain Reynolds and the gang were an honorable lot and only criminal by necessity. The cast and acting were perfection, the plots were clever and funny and the show was original. So naturally it was doomed to fail.Every episode, including a few that never aired, are assembled for this collection. This includes the pilot. Fox skipped the pilot and aired the episodes out of order for reasons of their own (did I mention how much I hate the Fox network?) The extras include one very funny bonus scene from the &quot;Mrs. Reynolds&quot; episode and some commentary. There is also an easter egg of Adam Baldwin singing &quot;The Hero of Canton&quot; from Jaynestown, mine and Adam's favorite episode. To access it, select bonus features on the fourth disc. Highlight Joss Whedon singing &quot;Serenity&quot; but do not select it. Hit the left arrow, then hit select.It's a shame this show didn't get a better chance.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3ADWDZI0GG2KL	Troy Schilperoort	"As a huge sci-fi fan, I have always been at least vaguely familiar with all the conventional sci-fi shows out there.  So when I had three friends describe Firefly to me as ""the greatest sci-fi show ever,"" I was naturally skeptical, as I had never even previously heard of it.  After doing a little research and seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on amazon, I decided $30 was worth the risk.  Believe me when I say that it was worth it 100%.  Firefly is possibly the most underappreciated show out there- and I know that's saying a lot with the huge cult fan base.  This show was a work of genius.  Everything about it was just so refreshing.  After DS9, BSG, TNG, B5 and other sci-fi shows that more or less look the same on the outside, you can't imagine how refreshing it was for me to see a sci-fi show that was so wildly original.  Most sci-fi shows are based on the premise that in the future, mankind will have advanced, and everything will be different.  The genius of Firefly come from the fact that it is based in a future universe that is more or less the same as ours.  Sure, we've moved forward in time, but as the saying goes, ""the more things change, the more they stay the same.""Besides this, the writing is absolutely fantastic, the characters interesting (and funny!), the acting suberb, and the stories interesting and engaging.  The only downside is that the whole series didn't even last an entire season.  History may very well prove the premature cancellation of Firefly to be a greater blunder than Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  Firefly is television storytelling at its finest.  Give it a shot.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AE1OP60IC5O82	truster38	I am a certified fan of Joss Whedon, that celluloid genius who brought us our very favorite vampire slayer.  I own all the Buffy and Angel DVDs and even read Whedon's comic book work, from Fray to the current Astonishing X-Men.  But I stayed away from Firefly when it was on the air, for much the same reason I'd never watch the original Buffy movie: I knew it was going to fail.  Just as I knew that the 1992 movie would only disappoint me, I knew that Firefly would not succeed commercially.  There was no way, in this ever-more homogenous Bush-supporting society, that a Joss Whedon show would survive on a network.  I thought that it was better to stay away than to be left with a huge gaping hole in my side after only a few episodes.  Now, after watching the DVD set of the 14 episodes that managed to be completed, I can't help but feel remorse.  Firefly, and I will take much flak from the Whedon community for saying this, is the Buffy's creator best show.  It's better than Buffy and Angel.  Buffy and Angel, while spectacular television shows, both sometimes hit snags in terms of consistency.  See Season Four of Buffy and Season One of Angel for further details.  This is because, while those shows were the product of a concept, a cool, flash-in-the-pan idea that Whedon's mind hatched, Firefly is the show he has always wanted to make.  Every frame and every line of dialogue is the realization of a talented filmmaker's ultimate wet dream.  You get the feeling that Whedon imagined every single aspect of Firefly long before he ever started typing on his iBook.  This is a fantastic show.  It is an absolutely complete body of work, although it's only 14 episodes long.  Firefly is Whedon's love letter to all of his influences, from sci-fi to westerns to good old character-driven drama.  The cast and crew coalesce to help Whedon achieve his vision and are all fantastic.  The way the show is shot and lighted give the viewer a very obvious visual clue about the show's message: history always repeats itself.  Nothing ever really changes and people should stop mistaking technological advancements for true human evolution.  I love the zooms and the &quot;imperfect&quot; special effects style, complete with lens flares, poor lighting in places, and various other supposed no-no's.  The staff, which included familiar faces Tim Minear and Jane Espenson, are of course reliably brilliant.  The sets, by old Buffy alum Carey Meyer, really betray the show's budget with a very real sense of space (especially the ship).  There's also the actors, who I think are just an amazing group of nine very individual talents.  Nathan Fillion exudes both confidence and hopelessness in every scene and is hilarious when paired with &quot;Saffron,&quot; the recurring con artist played by Christina Hendricks.  The &quot;strong woman-chicken&quot; couple played by Gina Torres and Alan Tudyk drive both actors to play each scene to the nines, although I wish we would have seen more of their very complex yet beautiful relationship.  Adam Baldwin is perhaps my favorite as Jayne Cobb, the beefy action hero who is despicable but also very much a man-child.  Ron Glass is the definition of dignity as Shephard Book, whose mysterious past would have been one of the juicest plot lines had the show been allowed to continue.  Sean Maher and Summer Glau share a kind of sibling love that is so realistic, with Maher taking the role of the ship doctor beyond the confines of any Trek.  Glau, in her first substantial acting role, makes Brittany Murphy look like a hack with a truly difficult character that she nails consistently.  Morena Baccarin, in the role of companion Inara, demonstrates a truly complex feminine strength that is rarely seen on a landscape littered with Bachelorettes.  Finally, there is Jewel Staite, who never confuses innocence with stupidity and brought much-needed heart to the show.  Favorite episodes include &quot;Serenity,&quot; the intended pilot, the hilarious &quot;Jaynestown&quot; and &quot;The Message,&quot; which gives the term plot twist a new meaning.  &quot;Out Of Gas,&quot; however, might just be the finest hour of television I've ever seen.  With a movie due out spring of next year, here's to hoping that all the bottom-line obsessed suits will not &quot;take the sky&quot; from us.	5.0	Our Mr. Whedon	2004-06-23	14	13	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A33EI6AS6ML1XL	"T. Sanders ""ubermunkee"""	Let me start by saying that I don't usually write reviews on Amazon.com. But I feel pretty strongly about this series.I've noticed in the past year that there have been a few DVD sets of shows that FOX killed prematurely. &quot;The Tick&quot; and &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; are the first two that spring to mind. Neither one was a masterpiece, but each showed real promise. You can tell by the last few episodes of each that they had reached their stride and were about to become something really good.Now, &quot;Firefly&quot; is something altogether different. Joss Whedon's sci-fi/western found it's stride by the end of the first ten minutes of the first episode. Just the idea of having spaceships in an old west setting was a stroke of genius. But, this show was also brilliantly written and had characters you actually liked and related to. It's the perfect example of a network not recognizing a show for it's quality and giving it a shot. FOX obviously didn't give &quot;Firefly&quot; a chance from the beginning. Has anyone who bought the DVD noticed that the episodes were originally aired COMPLETELY out of order? How can you show the introductory episode 3 months after the series started?At least FOX had the presence of mind to release a DVD that lives up to this amazing show. All 13 episodes (including the unaired episodes) and a ton of extras (that are actually worth watching) make for the type of DVD set more TV shows should shoot for.Anyway, get it. It's more than worth it.	5.0	What is FOX's problem?!	2003-12-12	8	6	2

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R	"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter"""	This series, was an expirement, and in a way a succesful one.  It was to see if Joss Whedon would have a career away from Buffy.  And boy can he, althouth (unlike most) he should stick to the smaller stations.The show itself is about a rag-tag team of space luders, and the wacky adventures they have.  It has all of the same heart, feeling, love, and writing of Buffy but in a completely different universe.Only though the show only had 14 episodes, it was still a great romp in the wacky mind of Joss Whedon.	5.0	An intergalatic Journey, from the mind of Joss Whedon	2003-07-22	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3G9IOPF37PQKE	Turquoise	"At times this feels more like a classic film than a TV series.  The characters are wonderful, the score is really too good for TV in some spots, and there are moments when you feel like you're in something that should be winning Oscars.  The attention to detail on character development, as well as the great dialogue have earned 'Firefly' its deserved place as a top seller.This well-acted, well-written series is almost as good as the current hit ""Lost,"" (it's certainly funnier and more endearing) and could be as successful if only someone would get with the program and renew it.  Thankfully, the fans have spoken and are continuing to spread the word, lending out their DVD sets and buying more as gifts.  Don't judge this one as a Sci Fi, but a story about people that you will come to love.  It touches almost everyone and is sure to make a fan out of you.Be sure to pick up the Firefly Box set (you will probably watch it all in one sitting - most people are hooked after the first 2 episodes or so) and then view Serenity for an even *more* exciting, action packed story that will have you laughing and crying all over again.It's just possible that millions of intelligent fans can undo Fox's idiocy and get this show back on the air *somewhere.*  It happened for Family Guy, which is nowhere near the quality of Firefly.No kidding, this is one of the best shows you'll ever have the privilege to see.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AKOI9E359RVU2	"Tyler Rader ""Darth Rader"""	What can be said about this show that isn't described by every breath taking episode. It anything is to be said, it is that Firefly was a truly amazing show that was never given a chance. The cast of Firefly was superb. My favorite character is Wash played by Alan Tudyk. His sense of humor really lightened the mood of the show but also never took away from the parts that were meant to be hard, heavy, or sad. Joss Whedon really knows what the audience wants. Firefly was the greatest show ever. Just like his other creations Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel. This show was truly something special. I'm extremely happy that this show got a feature film, Serenity. I just hope that Fox will see the error of their ways and revive the show. I would really like to learn more about Book. He was a shepard who had an amazing knowledge of weaponry. That and I was hoping to see if Simon and Kaylee would act on their growing feelings for each other. Or if Wash and Zoe would see more turmoil in their marriage. But I guess we'll never know. But honestly, this show is perfect for anyone who loves a good sci-fi or western. Or a combination of both. And if you get this show, I highly recommend getting it's movie counterpart, Serenity to finish it off.	5.0	Firefly, A show we all love and miss!	2009-02-12	0	0	0

'Firefly' more than fits that description.While I didn't watch this show when it originally aired seeing it now makes me wonder why it took me this long to do so? While Joss Whedon may now be one of the hottest names in the entertainment industry thanks to a little film called..'The Avengers', Firefly was truly his baby. 'Firefly' is a beautiful blend of sci-fi and the old west and not the classic battle of good vs. evil either. The cast is brilliant and everyone works so well off of one another. The show is exciting, extremely funny and has a huge heart. You really feel for these simple folks living in a complicated time. What I love so much about this show is the fact that even though it takes place in a time that is so far away, it is incredible that the things we take for granted suddenly become the things that we hold so dear to us. After watching these 14 fun-filled episodes, I wondered why this show was asked the leave so soon. I mean I am unsure what future seasons could have been like and for now I can just keep on guessing.If you are a fan of sci-fi, or westerns or you just want to seem something that will probably be impossible to replicate, I highly recommend you watch this series.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3G4CHV3FSSEUN	Valerie Bell	This SciFi show takes place 500 years in the future after earth has used up all its resources and humans have terraformed planets in other galaxies. The government is evil and the heroes of the story are ex-freedom fighters turned smugglers. Nathan Fillion of Castle fame is the captain of the smuggler's space ship the Firefly. There are lots of futuristic details to the stories like space ships that can travel to distant galaxies quickly. The atmosphere of the show though is like an old western. People are dressed as they did in the 1800's. Many of the planets colonized are poor and lack modern technology and the people live by farming and ranching. The crew of the Firefly is an eclectic mix of ex-soldiers, fugitives, a preacher and even a high class Companion. (Prostitution has become a legitimate, well respected business that requires years of training and a licence). There is a good chemistry among the cast members. The show is funny and entertaining.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AALSKQO38SQ1F	Valerie	I admit I went into Firefly biased. I am a huge Joss Whedon fan and love his quick wit. However, though I intended to support his new endeavor no matter what, I was pleasantly surprised that Firefly's quality equalled that of Buffy and Angel. While some may scoff at these shows because of their content (stories of vampires, demons, space travel and gangs of do-gooders are seen as somehow beneath them), few that actually took the time to give it a chance were dissapointed. This series was hilarious and definatley underrated. I can't bring myself to understand how sitcoms about the exact same subjects and written the exact same way are continually put on the main networks. Inevitably they are cancelled - or worse dragged out over two or three seasons of horrid repetition. The dynamic shown in the characters' relationships of Firefly and again that sharp humor characteristic of Whedon made this show work well. But what made it great was its completely new concept. Most stories have that old western flair of good vs. evil, complicated hero with love interest(s) and many battles. Only this show didn't try to hide from its roots. It openly acknowledged and even exploited this connection, giving it a completely new flair that was only properly appreciated after its time. Few critics ever gave Buffy any credit, yet it lasted for seven seasons and could have gone on longer if the cast had not been ready to move on.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A14VMK6B10ZE4I	Val M. Jamora	I was shown the pilot episode(s) by a friend and went immediately to the store to buy the DVD collection for myself.  I found it hard to understand how this show could have been cancelled before it's first season was up.  Witty dialog, rich characters, and superb acting make this a gem of a show. Furthermore, Whedon's decision to build the Serenity interior as a continuous interconnected series of sets is genius, and adds so much to the flow of the ship environment.  I am an avid sci-fi /fantasy fan, but I do not mindlessly support a show just because it has a space ship and a few laser pistols... This is just good writing.  This show could have been set in any venue and it would have still been great.  (but then, Asimov once said that good science fiction has a great human story at it's core).The only thing wrong with this show is that it died too soon.	5.0	Instantly Hooked!	2004-09-16	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A24X8X2HTHZG72	Vanessa	Love Buffy, love Angel, even love Fray, but Firefly is my favorite of all Joss's efforts. The man is a genius. Firefly has a great set of characters that have regular, everyday problems. Even if they live on a spaceship. I love the show's concept, and the relationships between characters just got better and better. Until the show got canceled by some idiot network execs.Luckily, the movie is coming out.  It's amazing that television networks are so far removed from what people actually want. The junk that's on TV now can't hold a candle to Firefly.You can't take the skies from me.	5.0	Joss Whedon is a genius!	2005-04-30	3	3	0

To this we could add that you shouldn't be so afraid of losing something that you won't try for it.Don't miss Firefly. This was something really special.	5.0	Brilliant, heartrending	2005-11-27	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2PUSUUCGGW8RT	Vanetia	I was extremely happy to find this series on sale here on Amazon, and snagged up this blu-ray set immediately. It arrived quickly, and I was amazed at the quality of this set.Not only is the picture crystal clear in many shots (they did a really good job doing whatever they needed to do to get the film in HD), but the interface is great as well. Lots of commentary to listen to for all the fans who want to watch their show again and again, but this time with some insight.I won't speak to the series itself. I don't think I need to. It's too good and needs no introduction.If you're a Firefly fan: buy this immediately! If you're not a Firefly fan: buy this and watch it immediately!	5.0	Amazing quality	2011-05-23	3	2	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3JC3GLQG698U7	V.A. Raj	I never saw this series when it aired, and I wish I had.  I saw the movie, Serenity, and I absolutely loved it.  The characters were intelligent and all had foibles and weaknesses.  The plot was straight-forward, but with enough twists and turns to keep your mind focused.  The storytelling, however was outstanding. It was effective and purposeful, without a wasted scene.  In other words, the story felt real.So, the day after seeing the movie, I bought the Firefly collection.  The show is even better than the movie.  Some may find the western/cowboy slang ridiculous or may feel the fusion of western/scifi to be silly.For me, I get what Joss Wheldon was trying to say.  The future won't be nice and rosy ala Star Trek.  It could be grim and hard for many people and a return to previous ways of existence - the gun in this case (and the sword in even earlier times), may prove necessary.  Once the luxury of civilization is stripped from settlers on a very rough frontier, previous means of survival and living can take over.So, cowboy justice; not trusting strangers; slavery; indentured labor-all of these may be seen.  But despite these hurdles, the characters in Firefly are a family.  They bond only with one another and strangers don't automatically earn their charity.  They are often cruel with one another as only family can be.  They are uncaring of others' misery and engage in willful blindness to some of the damage that their actions bring upon others.  Despite these flaws, they still do the best they can for themselves and when forced to confront the evil all around them, they rise to the challenge and offer up all that they have.Their stories are set in an epic setting -  a space operatic milieu - but their actions are highly personal, discrete, and limited.  They aren't out to save the universe; just one another.  Their stories are believable and true because we can all envision ourselves in the crew's place and acting similarly.  This is so refreshing after the 3 deadly dull Star Wars movies and the impotent, utopian, flailing of Star Trek.I am passionate about this show, and I would love to see sequels to the movie, or even better, direct-to-DVD episodes.	5.0	A Tragic Loss	2005-10-22	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3GQCU5UUW162	"""veggiestar"""	I was not familiar with Buffy or Angel when I first saw this show, and I was initially a little skeptical of its combined Western and Sci-fi elements. After seeing a couple of episodes out of order, I was interested but it wasn't until I watched the pilot, &quot;Serenity,&quot; and then started viewing the rest of the series in order that I realized what a terrific show this is! The dialogue is extremely witty, and it is very quotable and memorable. The characters are three-dimensional, and this certainly isn't a simple &quot;good guy vs. bad guy&quot; show. It is great entertainment, but it's interesting that people with very different political, religious, and general world views all seem to find something in this series that reflects their viewpoints. It stimulates intelligent thought and conversation, which is not something that can be said about a lot of TV shows. In short, it's funny, smart, interesting, and a definite 5+ star DVD. Start enjoying the Firefly 'verse today (there is even a movie forthcoming!).	5.0	Excellent series with something for everyone	2004-04-12	60	55	5

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A38XEAK0QC55CD	vfrickey	"Firefly is Joss Whedon at his quirky best: a freewheeling amalgam of Western and space opera.  It is big and misanthropic and brainy and funny and touching, sometimes all at once; it has acquired the most fiercely loyal following of any untimely dead TV series since Star Trek: the original series.  I wear a brown trench coat because of that show (well, I had the coat before the show came out, but I STILL wear it because I'm a Browncoat, dammit).Firefly is the Star Trek franchise with a high testosterone titer and a streetwise distrust for Big anything, including government.  It's gutty, smart, heartbreakingly good television.  And it ended far too soon.It also had some of the best actors in television at the time: Nathan Fillion, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau and (may God love her, I surely do) Jewel Staite were all welcome discoveries of the series, while Ron Glass - whom I've followed since his ""Barney Miller"" days - just kills as ""Shepherd Derrian Book.""  Most of Firefly's ingenue cast have gone on to do great work since the show, but they will never shine as they did together in that show.  It was a remarkable, tragically short-lived case of artistic and dramatic synergy.Nor, unfortunately, has Joss Whedon as a show creator excelled Firefox or is he ever likely to - this was his apex.It's also grown-up fare, I have to warn parents; but your teens could do worse than watch it, because it also has Lessons to impart - if you're libertarian, small ""l"" or large, you're going to love what Whedon has to say about high-minded politicians.  I just love this show.  Odds are pretty good you will, too.Just as a parting shot, if you like Firefly, see the movie which capped the series, Serenity.  It is very likely the best thing Joss Whedon and the Firefly cast have done or will ever do."	5.0	Joss Whedon's best work	2010-09-14	4	3	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A84TTTQ5P8X1O	Vicki Khouli	"I missed ""Firefly"" when it was a T.V. show.  I was already a Joss Whedon fan, having really enjoyed the Buffy/Angel saga (especially the first few years).  Sometimes it's hard for me to catch TV shows in the evening though, since I teach at two colleges and usually am gone several nights a week.  However, when one of my students (also a Buffy fan) offered to let me preview her Firefly collection, I jumped at the chance.  I was really going in cold, not knowing much about the series.I started watching wioth the pilot episode.  I recognized some faces from Buffy/Angel - and there were some new ones.  I kept watching - about 10 or 15 minutes into it, I was going to leave and watch something else, when I was suddenly caught, riveted.  For the rest of the week, I fell headlong into the story, watched it through, then sat down and watched it again, roping as many of my family members in to watch with me as I could.Joss creates this world filled with funny, lovable, fallable, wonderful characters.  They lapse from English into Chinese and back again at the drop of a hat.  They have created a family aboard a space-going ship, firefly class, named ""Serenity.""  That wonderful mix of relationships is what Joss excels at - you care so much about them so quickly - you want to see what happens next.I remember what happened with Star Trek - I can only hope that the series will live on - the movie ""Serenity"" was a wonderful stand-alone story that ties up a lot of loose ends from the series.Get it - you won't be disappointed."	5.0	The Firefly World	2005-10-10	8	8	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JV3EXIENR28A	Vic Simon	Okay - I LOVE this series and will extol it's virtues to anyone interested. However, I will attempt to hold back my fandom geek side and give as balanced a review as possible:Firefly is a series that moves beyond the ordinary drivel that is shoved down our throats. Witty, engaging and entirely believable characters who face everyday problems outside of the major plot lines are the absolute foundation of this series. It could not have been done by any other cast. For anyone watching it for the first time, be sure to give the series a few episodes to form a solid opinion as the interactivity over time between characters is the essential component of this series.However, there will be those out there who just don't like it for one reason or another. So, I would suggest that you rent before you buy just to be sure that you do indeed, LOVE it (like I do) before you blow your wad.	5.0	A Helping Of Awesome With Sauce	2009-10-13	0	0	0

A friend of mine introduced me to Firefly after it was released onto DVD.  The first five minutes of the pilot were enough to convince me that I loved the show.  The rest of the pilot convinced me this was the best sci-fi on television ever.  The production values and quality of writing make it one of the best shows of ANY kind, sci-fi or not!Though I call it sci-fi, don't let that deter you if that's not your thing.  The show is a beautiful fusion of many genres, with a style and a wit all its own.  An example:  my father is so-so at best on the science fiction front, but likes Firefly for the gutsy humor and the Western flavor.Give it try.  I'm 99.5% convinced you'll like it!

After a couple of episodes, however, I realized what a truly unique and great show this really is. The actors are excellent and the world they inhabit is truly interesting. While all of the wild west cliches are here--the noble southern rebel, the kindly prostitute, the preacher, the city doc...etc. They truly become unique characters in their own right that you come to care about and want to see what happens next. This show was shorted on publicity because many did not know how to take this show. It's great!! I can't wait to see it on the big screen!	5.0	A Hidden Gem!	2004-09-07	4	4	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A31AI8XGITN8JS	Victoria Yeager	Joss Whedon, creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel,' is a genius.  This short-lived show (most wrongfully cancelled by FOX) was very unique.  I didn't watch the show when it first came on (didn't know much of it, probably due to the not-so-great promotion efforts), but rented the set first (hearing of it after getting sucked into the Buffyverse, so went to this to see what else Whedon's mind comes up with), and fell in love with it and eventually purchsed the set.  The characters are extremely interesting.  The idea of a Sci-Fi/Western mix itself is fascinating, plus seems more interesting than typical futuristic tales where everything is high-tech and shiny.  I love this more down-to-earth feel, with the ship (the main star), Serenity, being an older class model ship (a firefly), with wires and the likes in view.This show is really the first time in which I actually study the cinematography.  I watched the shows first, then went for watching with commentaries (which can actually be very funny and informative than other commentaries I've listened to on other DVDs), where I learn the way they designed Serenity and the lighting, purposely looking for glares and using handhelds, adding a shaky quality (adding to the feel that this crew are taking jobs they can get to survive; in a way, there lives are shaky, always in danger, running from the Alliance (Feds).Mal, Zoe, Wash, Jayne, Kaylee, Inara, Book, Simon, and River are intriging.  Though it may seem like it would be hard to remember 9 characters, it really isn't.  TV Shows were made to tell stories and characters's pasts over at least 20 eps a season, in hopes of continuing a story with more seasons.  'Firefly' didn't get that, but the foundation of these characters are presented, and hopefully the movie (and comic being released as well) can help extend what is learned during the short time on the show.  Maybe then, more movies can be made to continue the tale of these 9, actually 10 (Serenity), characters.The show itself, a Sci-Fi/Western, has everything that everybody likes.  Like Sci-Fi, it's there; like Westerns, it's there; like comedy, got that too; like action/adventure, you betcha; even some romance and drama.  All these qualities, beautifully put together.  It's just a shame it was cancelled.  Thankfully, Universal is a nice, lovely company that has an eye for quality.  They bought the rights, and now there's gonna be a movie, titled 'Serenity.'  I can't wait 'til Sept. 30, 2005.	5.0	Truly Amazing	2005-07-10	4	4	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3ZQ0EY7TAZ89	Vincent Marius Gray	"Just a few months ago I watched the movie ""Serenity"" in theaters to be blown away by the witty, comical and dramatic dialogue as well as the proper use of computer graphics. My brother, before I watched the movie, told me it was the best sci-fi movie that had been released since Minority Report and far surpassed that movie. Of course I was skeptical, but he was true to his word. Not only was I blown away by Serenity, but also I was left craving for more. Such a desire was fulfilled for the two weeks I took in watching the series (and trust me, it was hard to make the series last that long), but now I am left with the concern that this show has been discontinued. Such an innovative program that introduces one into a highly complex set of relations between nine equally interesting characters should not have been cancelled half way through its first season. Thus it seems highly reasonable to state that Fox has made a huge mistake. With a sci-fi show that makes the new Battlestar Galactica look like a big joke (which I was a big fan of before I watched Firefly), Joss Whedon's highly ambitious mixture of a somewhat 'Western' mentality with a sci-fi spin could have been a huge success if advertised correctly. Also, the tyrannical Alliance government that seems to equally ignore all of their planet's needs with the interesting historical background that has forced the average citizen to speak Chinese provides the viewer with an undeniably unique experience. Overall, this show should not be avoided, but exalted by those who have watched it in order to pressure some broadcasting company (it doesn't really matter which one) to continue the show."	5.0	Fox's lost, a sci-fi fan's dream	2005-12-05	9	8	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2CPTH3C7XTHPM	ViolentMetaphor	This is an amazing series.  I found the first episode and in some respects the movieSerenity (Widescreen Edition)to the be slightly less entertaining than the rest.  Otherwise, this was a consistently great series.  I can't even begin to pick a favorite episode.  It is my favorite scifi show.  It's one of the few scifi shows that I have fallen in love with.  I loved the plot and general feel to the series but what sold me were the characters.  You could easily fall in love with this series without being a fan of scifi.About the title of this review...  I have heard lots of people say how great this series was, but I didn't feel like watching it.  A scifi drama?  A soap opera in space?  Really?  I have watched maybe a dozen Star Trek episodes and I think Star Wars is okay.  I liked Farscape and Lexxx was fun.  I wouldn't go out of my way to watch any of those but if it was on I would watch it.  I was putting Firefly into the same category so I didn't feel like watching it.  A friend on the other side of the country kept telling me how I should watch this series and it wasn't like other scifi/fantasy that I have seen in the past.  I didn't give in because I was busy.  In an effort to get me to watch the series, he bought it for me.  Imagine my surprise when this DVD shows up at my place and even more so when I find out just how right he was.  Don't be stubborn like me and make your friends find a way to get you to watch it.  Go watch this series!	5.0	Watch it before your friends force you to	2011-03-02	2	2	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AJ4B0XZ9AUFOG	"Virginia A. Campbell ""I am the host of the Br..."	Why did the Network sabatoge this show by forcing Joss Whedon to show the episodes out of order? Watching the show the way it was meant to be seen left me feeling that they were either stupid or they wanted the show to fail.At any rate, the show is just as good as Buffy, though it is entirely different. Each character is unique and has a story that only partially unfolds in this partial season. The series is part science fiction and part western, but even if you are not drawn to either of these genres you can enjoy it's wonderful storytelling.I can't wait for the movie!	5.0	Will Leave You Wanting More!!	2005-05-13	8	5	3
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A19N3GRTJ0S8J8	"Virginia Lore ""rumtussle"""	The Firefly DVD extra features include a wonderful montage of actor and crew interviews about how it felt to be involved in this project.  This montage is a documentary in itself, about a heroic group of artists struggling with their hope and grief in the face of heartless decisions by evil television executives.But the extra features also give tidbits of information which just make the show that much more enjoyable.  For example:  the camera work was intentionally jerky in places because the aim was to reproduce the cinematic values of the old tv westerns rather than the slick, overproduced space shows we've seen of late.  Joss Whedon's aim was to give it a Western feel--and it works.It works because of the characters.  Though the episodes are occasionally reminiscent of Star Trek (juiced up with that cast-iron Whedon humor), the cast of nine work to make this truly an ensemble production.  And this is not your typical roundup of characters.There is the manly captain, the ass-kicking female warrior, the Xander-like tongue-in-cheek pilot, the suspiciously sophisticated missionary, the handsome fugitive doctor, the rough-and-ready ship's man, the wise harlot, and the mesmerizingly cheerful engineer.  Perhaps the most captivating is River, a teenaged girl who exhibits symptoms of schizophrenia after her super-genius brain has been experimented on by the government.  To what purpose remains unclear, since the show was cancelled.The show may not have been cancelled, but the story lives on in Whedon's _Serenity_, a movie slated to come out in the summer of 2005.  All of the original cast members have been hired for the film, so this single aborted season of Firefly becomes essential viewing for those intending to see the movie.  And I, for one, can't wait.	5.0	Intelligent Space Western for the Masses	2004-08-17	4	3	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A70LB1OG3O3Y5	"""voisine"""	People are saying this is the best sci-fi in a long time. I disagree. Star Trek doesn't hold a candle to this. This is the best ever. Maybe the original Star Wars movies rival it, but it's a close call. The space western theme is genius and makes perfect sense. As Trek so aptly put it and then failed to demonstrate, space is a frontier, much like the American old west. People are creating new settlements. Those that brave this frontier are those poor or oppressed looking for better opportunities, those seeking adventure, and generally anyone disaffected with the rest of civilization. Communication back to civilization is slow given the distance. People tend to move into new areas faster than the law can establish it's presence and people are forced to defend themselves against bandits and savages.There are so many details that make a true sci-fi fan drool. There's the strict, no sound in space policy, The genius use of language oddities that are perfectly understandable but different enough from current speech patterns to convey the feeling that this is a different time period. There are none of standard sci-fi crutches like pulling new tech out of no where to cover over a plot hole and then conveniently losing it the next episode when that same tech could solve the plot in the first five minutes. The characters survive on their wits, not their tech. All these things work together to make this the best sci-fi show of all time.	5.0	Why the Space Western theme works.	2003-12-17	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ACSRYG70V61AV	V. Propst	"Some friends, who refuse to watch any sci-fi shows but this one, recommended it to me. At first I was suspicious, but after about the 4th episode I had decided that this was a very good show. I like the idea of a space western (star trek was supposed to be one, but instead opted for something more intelligent...) that is done in an interesting and intelligent manner. The characters are strong, and the way they develop and interact over the unfortunately brief 14-episode run is great.The premise of a 'darker' future devoid of ANY alien races, poverty, and earth ruled corruptly is interesting and done pretty well. I also like the idea of our heroes being amoral thieves.However, there is also a core of people (some of my friends among them) who are making the bold claim that this is greatest and best sci-fi show EVER. Of course, the people saying that have not seen any sci-fi shows but this one. There's nothing that makes this the best show ever, by any means.The storylines, for example, are nice and develop the characters well. However, they aren't the most original, and if you've seen much of any Star Trek for example, you'll realize that these do resemble some things done before.Just a word of advice, don't listen to the chorus of people saying ""Firefly is much better than Star Trek"" (who coincidentally have not ever seen more than 1 episode of any Star Trek series.) If you've seen a good deal of the four Star Trek shows (Enterprise not included of course) or Babylon 5 you'll enjoy this, but will most definitely not be shocked by the plotlines or proclaim it ""the best show ever."" Instead, approach this show with an open mind, and you'll most likely be somewhat surprised by it and enjoy it.Also, the Serenity movie is also quite good, but again, it's not exactly ""the best show ever."""	4.0	A very good TV show	2005-11-27	5	2	3

The final (original?) two-hour episode ""Serenity"" is still lovingly saved on my TIVO because we can't bear to part with it.  The writers of Firefly created characters that are human - not an idealized or perfect one in the bunch, all have their secrets and flaws.  In spite of that (because of it?) the viewer is left with a deep connection and a desire to know them better.  This isn't all CGI flash.  It isn't just schmaltzy character development and human interest either.  Firefly is one of the best shows I've seen on TV in a very long time, and it is a tragedy that FOX didn't realize the gem they had and promote it properly.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1IN3AZD6NZRSG	wadrad	Not sure what the executives at Fox were thinking when they micro-managed this puppy right into the ground and then canceled it.  I'm a middle-of-the road sci-fi fan, but even apart from the &quot;sci-fi&quot; label, this show was/is extremely well-written and extremely well-acted, something SO many shows can't actually boast.I didn't actually see this when it aired other than maybe 10 minutes one night when I was channel surfing, and I later moved overseas, so I had NO chance to see it after that.  What prompted me to buy it was I remembered the previews to the show and thinking it looked cool, and mostly a review written about the DVD collection, and how unfortunate it was that the show was canceled.  And here I am writing pretty much the same thing.Yeah, even though the premise (a western in the future, basically) and some of the plots are a little cheesy, the acting and writing pulls it together.  And there are weaker members of the cast, but as a whole supporting team, they also gelled pretty well.Very unfortunate that the Fox executives didn't see the potential rapport this show would build with the audience.  But so it goes.  They're out to make money, and if they're conditioned by the expectations of brain-dead couch potatoes, then they'll try to deliver the product they think the brain-dead couch potatoes want.  It is a business afterall.If you like Farscape or Picard/Voyager-era Star Trek, you'll like this.

There is too too much of the Walking Dead having for lunch Human Sushi. I'm tired of flipping the cable box to only find Ghost Hunters - Wow. Vampires - same story - different actors. And the same with Werewolves. Some network executives' elevators don't even go to the fourth floor on a 10-story building. Nothing good to watch.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2SEGGOBDOQW4O	Wangenstein	You can get a better synopsis from any of these other reviews, so I'll just throw out a few thoughts. Release the hounds!A show that takes 'space, the final frontier' to its logical conclusion. A show with nine equally interesting main characters. A show in which a man can be put through an engine and come out clean the other side (well, more 'hamburger' than 'clean'). Firefly is all of these things, and more...Firefly takes place in a universe where colonies are neither domed cities nor idyllic paradises waiting for bright-eyed, stouthearted men and women to move in. Life is as it has always been on the frontier of the moment: hard, gritty, sometimes violent and usually more than a little smelly. The 'haves' live on Core worlds, with most of the advances people usually think of when they think of The Future. The 'have-nots' live, for the most part, everywhere else. Oh, there may be a maglev train pulling into the station, but it's as likely there's a herd of cattle to be unloaded from it.Firefly's main characters are each interesting in their own right. Black and white give way to nine different shades of gray, some (read that: Jayne) darker than others. Even relatively minor characters (such as &quot;Badger&quot;, a 'businessman' with A Very Fine Hat) seem to possess a life of their own, one that continues even after their scene ends. In just 14 episodes, this series introduced several secondary characters (Badger, Saffron and Early spring to mind) that I would be very interested to learn more about.The first time I saw 'The Train Job', I knew that Firefly would be A Different Kind of Show. You don't push a (quite deserving) man into a spaceship's engine and then go on like you're so-called 'Must See TV'. The good guys don't wear white hats (in fact, they don't wear hats at all and aren't always that good). The gray areas of personal morality and ethics remind me of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, although opportunities for moral and ethical fuzziness come up a lot more often on Firefly than they ever did on DS9. Point being, while they do have some broad, archetypal strokes (the Captain, the Mercenary, the Doctor, etc.), you quickly begin to notice how much fine brushwork went into these characters. They seem like real people, and I can't think of higher praise for fictional characters.Misc Points:* No sound in space (it takes you aback at first, as you wonder if your fancy Surround Sound system just gave out)* Bathrooms (Star Trek has no bathrooms; a Federation toilet is as mythical as a Romulan Jumping Bigfoot)* Laser guns are expensive and rare (and an old-fashioned slug-thrower will make a man just as dead)If you like DS9, Farscape, Buffy, Brisco County Jr., Gargoyles, Millennium... I think you'll like this show. 673 people can't be wrong! (Actually, it's quite possible we're all wrong, but after watching the first episode, &quot;Serenity&quot;, I think you'll find that the odds start to stack up in our favor.)I won't even bother making crude allusions about the FOX executives, their parentage, their intelligence or their personal habits. It's obvious they've done that themselves.Keep your hopes up. With talk of a soundtrack and a movie, it's quite possible Serenity will keep flying.	5.0	A &quot;space western&quot;... and y'know what?

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A17U3HDG5X4F9C	Ward Mesick	"I'm not a big fan of Whedon's other works.  I didn't like Buffy and I've never seen Angel.  I say that to express that I can't be considered part of his ""cult"" as some reviewers have insisted everyone giving this show a positive review must be.  I'm just a fan of science fiction, and I think Firefly is cool science fiction.I'd like to address a couple of the complaints that have been promienent:True, there are no aliens.  But so what?  Someone dares to consider that we might not have encountered aliens 500 years in the future, and they're not doing sci-fi?  That's silly.  Most current sci-fi has tended to only use aliens because they can't write interesting characters.  'Let's dress someone up to look odd and people won't notice they don't have much going on in character development.'  I'll take an all human cast if it works, and in this case it does.True, it is very western.  So what?  It's the frontier.  Is it hard to believe that humans will still be humans 500 years from now?  You've been watching too much Star Trek if you thinking flying around in space is going to magically change the human race.  And besides, this is a future that is LIVED IN.  It's not septic at all, it's a real place.Finally, consider that virtually every negative review given was by someone who admits that they never watched more than one or two episodes.  How can you possibly judge a show by one ep?  That's like watching a random ten minutes of a movie and trying to review it.  You can't consider yourself a good judge of quality based on such a short amount of exposure.This show was a fine work.  It's not perfect but it's enjoyable.  The writing is usually sharp and the story is very human.  There's not a ton of action but some of us prefer to have development and story over non-stop explosions.Also of note, the creators of BSG clearly watched Firefly.  The ""silent space"" idea as well as the steady cam zoom-ins in BSG are virtually a rip-off from Firefly.  And that's not a complaint."	4.0	Good Sci-Fi	2005-06-24	21	20	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ALHC64J88LVWO	Wayfinder	Most reviews I've read here were about the series.  Regarding that, there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.What I'm rating-- and for which I'm giving one star-- is the adaptation to BluRay.I have purchased the original DVD set, the original release of Serenity, the Serenity DVD Collector's edition, and the Serenity BluRay Collector's edition.  So when I purchased the BluRay Series Collector's Edition I expected something special.  However, the only thing shiney about the BluRay version of the series is the mirror-side of the discs.This is unfortunately, one of the few BluRay releases where I can honestly say the DVD release was better.  I can watch the DVD release in my UpConvert BluRay player and get splendid quality.  However, when I play the BluRay version the picture is grainy to the point of annoyance.I do realize that part of the series was shot in a grainy manner on purpose and have made allowance for that.  But this entire release is grainy all the way through.  Why this is the case I cannot fathom.  Was Firefly released prior to the release of HiDef television?  Was it shot in the old 800x400 standard and therefore did not transfer well to BluRay?  Did someone at the factory not know what s/he was doing, deciding to do a straight-from-DVD conversion without UpConvert standards... or perhaps attempting to push it to BluRay quality and unfortunately resulting with an extremely grainy picture?  I don't know.All I know is that most BluRay movies I've seen I can see the pores on the actor's chin in a close-up shot.  In this release a closeup shot looks like someone Photoshopped the faces with a splatterbrush effect.I am sorry to see that this series was treated with such poor rendition in the BluRay version.  And while this is a recommendation I seldom give:  for those who have not yet purchased this set, I would most definitely recommend the DVD version instead.	1.0	Rating the BluRay release, not the series itself	2011-03-14	34	19	15

Had it aired on the Fox Network of the 80's and early 90's it would have had a longer run, but that bunch have turned into corporate weasels and are not willing to let a show find an audience. I didn't see it on the original run on fox, but thanks to the SciFi channel I had the opportunity to view the series and become a ""Browncoat.""

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3BTLIGE6C6BF6	"Wayne J. Villines ""WJ Villines"""	Firefly is an incredible show that had such great potential for a multi-season program. But like always with Sci-fi, when they get something good, they toss it for something lousy. This was great from the first moment to the very last episode. It actually leaves one saddened for the premature loss of something that could have been better.It was awsome to see firefly reborn briefly with the new sci-fi show, Battlestar Galactica -- the scene of ships flying by when Rosslyn learns she has terminal breast cancer prior to going out to the Galactica -- they give a fairly clear bit of homage to firefly with the firefly looking like it was heading in for a landing.It will be interesting to see any of Firefly's future incarnations, and one would hope future movies straight to disk.	5.0	Another awsome show ended by corporate ignorant greed	2013-02-13	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Firefly was much maligned when it was first aired. Critics savaged it which, in retrospect, seems highly unfair. They were expecting Buffy in outer space and what Josh Whedon gave them was an update of Wagon Train to the stars (or what Star Trek might have been if the franchise hadn't become stuffy over time). Firefly showed great potential which is precisely why Fox gunned it down; Fox the network that once let dark horse series find an audience became as conversative and musty as CBS.In the two hour pilot we're introduced to the basic concept of the series; five centuries have passed. There's been a civil war. Our heroes were on the losing side and now making a living  carrying illegal and legal merchandise. They're not bad guys and have a code of honor not too dissimilar to the code of gunfighters in the old west. The characters are appealing, interesting and well played by the cast.Fox's miscalculation is, in one sense, the fan's gain; evidently Whedon is planning a film at some point in the future. It's just as well as Firefly was too clever and intelligent for Fox and most of the viewers and critics that caught the show all too briefly in its 11 episode run. The DVD picture and sound quality is very, very good. The extras include a gag reel, featurette, screen test and commentaries on a number of episodes.The big bonus, though, is the inclusion of 3 never before seen episodes of the series that didn't air after it was canceled. I'm surprised that Sci-Fi Channel didn't pick this up (but then again Sci-Fi usually demands a portion of ownership now prior to agreeing to run a series--a factor that probably played into the remake of Battlestar: Galatica). It's a pity that Sci-Fi chose to remake Battlestar:Galatica vs. continuing this fine series. A number of questionable choices have been made at both networks although the cancelation of Firefly without giving the series a fair chance was probably Fox's biggest blunder for new shows of the 2002 season.In reinventing the space opera, Whedon crafted a terrific, intelligent and well written series. It's a pity that no one else realized it.	4.0	Burned bright, fast	2003-12-14	9	8	1

Being a fan of science fiction films I went and saw Serenity at the movie house, which was wonderful.  Started going back and catching what reruns I could of the original series, with limited sucess, and found it a quirky but engrossing show.  The DVD collection is a nice compilation of the entire series, with enough special features to warrant its purchase over recording it yourself.  The series does a good job taking a western show into outer space, although in a much less subtle way than Gene R. did in Star Trek.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AK6L9DT01EHXZ	W. D. Gagliani	"I also came to the show too late, when it was gone. Thank the gods old TV shows don't go away anymore, but get packaged into DVD releases like this one. Yes, it was a group of key friends' recommendations that finally got me there. I was never comfortable with the ""western in outer space"" feel of the show, despite the fact I'd loved the Sean Connery movie ""Outland"" back in the day, and the fact that half the SF shows ever done could, in some way, be seen recast as westerns and vice-versa. I was never comfortable with FIREFLY's western motif until after seeing several episodes, after which it fit like an old glove. Maybe I needed to grow into it. In any case, that's no reason not to like something, and I rose above that slight prejudice. There's not much left to say that the three thousand plus reviews haven't already said, probably better than I can. I'll just add my stamp. I didn't come to this a huge Whedon fan, though I enjoyed many episodes of his other shows. I didn't come to this as a fan of SF, though I've loved some SF since I was a kid and loved Jules Verne and HG Wells first and Star Trek later, not to mention Philip K. Dick and Harlan Ellison. My ""thing"" is horror and thrillers and dark fantasy. (I write some of'em, not that it matters here.) No, I came to this based on recommendations and an ultimately open mind, and a deep appreciation for great characters, great dialogue, great acting, and great action... and, not surprisingly, the chance to find a strong message hidden beneath all those elements. FIREFLY fulfilled a lot of expectations and exceeded many. I became a fan of TV's ""Castle"" mostly due to Nathan Fillion (OK, and the fact that his character is a writer), and the strength of his likability there made FIREFLY a more certain gamble... and it paid off handsomely. As many have said, FIREFLY may well be one one the best television series ever, perhaps partly because of its stunted, truncated life. It left many of us ""wanting more,"" and in that sense it entered the realm of mythology. It's the great TV show that got away. The one the Fox let escape into its legendary status. Too bad for you, Fox. But maybe, just maybe, it protected the idea and the thematic thrust and the ensemble from ever becoming old or stale. Maybe we'll love it all the more for its rare quality, like a diamond, or a rich vein of gold. I haven't tried to describe the show -- much better descriptions are out there than what I could attempt. I tried to give you a sense of what made it special for me, seeing it so long after it had come and gone. This one belongs in all collections of television greatness. If you're on the fence, jump off and delve into this deceptive treatise on the human condition that just happens to be disguised as a ""western in outer space."" Just try to feel that way after you've watched it all. Classic. And rare. I envy you, those who are about to experience it for the first time. Enjoy.--W.D.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1LZJPPAOEYXEW	WDP	"I found Firefly on DVD in early 2004 because I was a fan of other Joss Whedon work.  Having never seen an episode, I took the $40 chance that it might be silly and empty.  That could not be farther from the truth.  I thoroughly enjoyed every single episode of this unique TV show.Plenty of other reviewers have described the plot of the show, so I won't bother.  What I will say is that I was affected enough by the interactions and comaradery of the characters that I was very sad when I finished watching the episodes, realizing there will never be any more thanks to the network television system.  These are very human characters who you will deeply miss once you have completed the series.  It is a show that mass TV audiences will be confused and alienated by because it is so sophisticated and complex, both in terms of cinematic qualities and plot.  If you are unwilling to commit to TV series, then Firefly is most likely not for you.In addition to terrific production values and an engaging visual style, the show boasts trademark Joss Whedon dialogue that, again, will not be understood by the attention-deficit MTV generation raised on bodily-function jokes that require no thought to enjoy.The sum of all these parts, though, is a very unique attitude that the show has that immensely appeals to me.  Witty vigilantes on the run, each with layered psyches and problems, set against the backdrop of  the American West 500 years in the future.  Despite loving certain seasons of Whedon's previous TV work, I believe Firefly is his greatest creation, and something that will be difficult to do justice to when the big-screen version ""Serenity"" appears later this month.  That said, if you intend to see ""Serenity,"" there is no doubt your enjoyment of the movie will be enhanced by viewing this short-lived series first."	5.0	Excellent and Completely Unique	2005-09-11	10	10	0

I never heard of this show till a friend lent me one of the four DVDs a few weeks back (summer '05), It's a very smart show; very creative, with believeable and sympathetic able characters set in a galaxy of humans who seem to speak either English or Chinese.

Heyser ""easier_rhino"""	There are a great many other, better reviews already, and you probably either already love the show or aren't going to be swayed by my love of it.  Let me just say that I'm not a Joss Whedon fanboy; I don't really know much of his other work, and what of it I do know pales in comparison.  I know that people love Buffy with the same passion, but I've never been able to get into it.But Firefly, this I can get into.  I've watched many attempts to make new Westerns in the style of the classics, and they all fall flat... except Firefly.  Sure, rather than a stagecoach they have a space ship, and rather than frontier towns they have frontier planets, but one thing that most other sci-fi fails to even suggest is the utter tedium that must be space travel, in the same way that modern westerns can't convey the utter tedium of travelling the prairie by horse.  It took families months to get from St. Louis to Oregon, and to them, the airplane would probably be a bit like Star Trek's warp drive.  Real space is just as vast and empty as the Old West, and takes just as long if not longer to travel, even at speeds which make trips between planets take days rather than months or years or generations.Then there's the guns.  In all 14 episodes, I think laser guns show up twice, and they're both expensive and unreliable toys.  While it's never made clear how the guns of the future work, they both lend to the setting and acknowledge that really, in terms of reliability, cost, accuracy, and power, nothing beats good old inertial energy transfer from an object at high speed to a body at rest.  In other words, the bullet is the apex of killing technology, at least until we hit some level of technology which allows us to violate various physical laws.I could go on about how &#34;realistic&#34; the show is, but that's not really a selling point; it's as realistic as the setting and tone demand.  Westerns weren't realistic either, but neither were they magical.  And while Firefly isn't a Western, it is as close as we've come in a long time.If you don't fall in love with these characters, that's okay; I'm not going to judge you harshly for taste.  But I warn you, you may, and there are only 14 episodes and a movie, so it's going to be a whirlwind love affair.  But worth it.	5.0	I don't need to review this	2014-01-03	1	1	0

Well, the creators of the Galaxy Rangers of the 1980s did, and, apparently, Joss Whedon approved.Whedon's Firefly series is one of the greatest TV shows I've ever seen! Unfortunately, it was cancelled after only one season, which I believe is due mostly to FOX's poor advertising for the show. The fans are now pushing for a return, but it seems unlikely.Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew on board the ship Serenity are some of the best creations to ever come out of the mind of Joss Whedon- and that's saying something! This show has everything: comedy, suspense, action, horror, and romance. It's one of the few genre-hopping programs to ever be on television and actually not make me want to change the channel. The characters are very diverse in nature: a captain/former soldier, his lieutenant turned second-in-command/wife, a pilot/husband/comedic element, a mercenary (the all brawns/no brains of the ship), a female, highly-sexual, innocent mechanic, a ""shepherd"" (aka preacher), a ""Companion"" (upscale geisha/prostitute of the future), and a doctor and his mysterious, seemingly psychotic sister. The chemistry between all the actors is fantastic; you really believe they care about one another and the ship they inhabit.In the midst of trying to earn a living in the smuggling business, and working with some rather unscrupulous but very entertaining men and women, Mal and his crew try to figure out just who Doctor Tam and his sister, River, really are and what they're looking for. It's a story of family, beatings, friends, space travel, love, whores, doing the right thing, illegal dealings, marriages, divorces, and loyalty and it will forever go down in my movie inventory as not-to-be-missed!"	5.0	One of the best shows to leave television!	2006-11-09	5	4	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A22I5V34OUHR6Q	Will	Firefly is undeniably a brilliant series, and despite being cancelled after just one year, it remains one of my favorite TV shows of all time. This Blu-Ray package is the most complete collection of the series yet. The episodes are formatted in their original widescreen to play on modern TVs, and the menus look very slick in HD.My only small complaint is that there was no indicator of what episodes or features were present on what disk of the multi-disk set. This makes tracking down specific features a bit of a pain, but it's a small issue.If you want to own the best and most complete Firefly collection, this is the one. I also recommend purchasing Serenity on Blu-Ray of course.	4.0	Perfect series, nearly perfect package.	2011-03-02	1	1	0

Naegele ""Old Guy"""	"As a long-time sci-fi fan, I was sadly disappointed upon my first viewing of an episode of ""Star Trek"" -- I thought the writing pedestrian -- at best -- characters of cardboard -- and story lines that smacked of 1930s-ish development of the written genre. The excitement behind the ""Star Trek"" phenomena was quite beyond me. On the other hand, I was nailed to the set during my first encounter with ""Firefly"": not only were the writing, characters and story lines first rate sci-fi, but music, photography, et al, were very professionally done. They very cleverly let you know that Chinese Mandarin was the language of the future [prophetic!], and dropped hints of the technology that allowed ""Firefly"" to be furnished like an apartment house, with people sitting and walking about as the ship gyrated through space. The ""space cowboys"" is an interesting twist -- makes me wonder if one of the show's creators was familiar with the old ""Captain Video"" sci-fi series aired back in the dawn of the TV age, in which the producers, in order to fill out running time, would insert action via the ""Video Rangers"" -- actually old B-cowboy flicks run as serial. But while horses might make sense on a backwater planet, revolvers don't. I assume they were put in to compliment the western theme, but semi-auto pistols would have done as well. [Obviously, the show's creators never tried to reload a revolver in the middle of a fire fight.]"	5.0	"The is the series that ""Star Trek"" should have been -- and never was  ..."	2011-03-12	3	2	1

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2K8WM3H3SK8T9	William Haugen	Absolutely love this show.  It has humor, drama and romance rolled into an action-filled Sci-Fi series.  Basically, it's a western that takes place 500 years in our future and follows a group of independent, diverse that serve as the captain and crew of Serenity (a firefly class freighter, hence the series name) through some wonderfully written plots and well delivered lines.  Even those who aren't Sci-Fi fans can enjoy this series.  Joss Whedon really created a following for this series, and the accompanying feature length movie (Serenity); as they are all wonderfully entertaining.  And, if you love good stories, and actors that enhance your entertainment experience, this is a must-have.  Best value on Amazon.	5.0	The Best Show Ever Canceled	2010-05-03	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A27YARGHO5AWYZ	William M. Finnegan	"I heard about this show and Joss Whedon for a long time while listening to different podcasts like Twit and Buzz out Loud.  They would mention Joss and how amazing his writing is, and every once in a while I would hear ""Firefly"".  I recently finished grad school and have gotten more into watching shows.  I got addicted to X-files in '05 after watching it on and off for years.  I compare most shows to that.  So I picked up firefly while on sale on a whim.  By the last episode I was in a deep depression knowing that there wasn't going to be anymore.  I in fact didn't want to watch the last one for a while because I knew it would be over at that point (my girlfriend convinced me to go ahead and watch).  This show is amazing.  Every time I catch a glimpse of American Idle or some other terrible show I am outraged.  How Firefly got cancelled is beyond me.  But then again, most people on the decision level of showbiz are incredibly out of touch with what people want.  Example: look into how long it took Linkoln Park to get a record deal, and how many labels turned them down.  Once they got singed, they won every music award imaginable.  Many people lost their jobs over that one....I have shown and discussed Firefly with everyone I know and once they sit down and watch, they get it.  This show is/was genious.  Many people can't look past the 'space ship' aspect.  But that is not what the show is about.  It is far more than sci fi.  Buy it, watch it, period.  Buy it 5 times to show the people in control that this show needs to be brought back, or at least another movie needs to be made!....And watch Castle to support Nathan Fillion!

I thought it looked pretty intriguing, but its Friday night timeslot precluded my watching it for one reason or another.  When I did finally get around to watching it, it had been pre-empted/moved/otherwise displaced.  Thanks to DVD I finally discovered its wonders.  ""Western with spaceships"" initially may sound silly, but it's an apt description, a jumping-off point to the somewhat anti-Star Trek universe, or ""the 'Verse,"" as the Firefly characters refer to it.  I'm only regretful that half a season and the movie Serenity is all we've got.  I'm hopeful that more Serenity movies come our way, and hoping against hope for a renewed, revitalized Firefly series.

I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised.Whedon has created something unique to television with his wild west meets the far future Firefly, and FOX has shown a special amount of stupidity in cancelling the show. I hear there's a movie, so I'll live. This is a short lived series that, even in its brevity, captures the viewer and sets them firmly in a happily believable world where more often than not the bad guy wins (until they get what's coming to them) and the good guy gets away by actually using what most shows lack... smarts. It's just... damn fun to watch!If the powers that be get it together and put it back in production for a television audience, I won't complain... but for now, this is an excellent set, and  a collection any fan of sci fi, or just good old fashioned gunslinging, will enjoy.	5.0	Shooting Stars...	2003-12-30	2	2	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ASZEK2N0EYMXG	"Willy Boy ""Willy Boy"""	At the time I am writing this review, over 2000 other reviewers have given this series 5 stars.  It was based on this tremendous possitive feedback that I went out and bought the series myself, never having seen it (or the movie).  I now see why everyone has given this show such good reviews.  The creators of Firfly have combined sharp writing with very good acting and an amazing story.  The basic premis has been done over and over ... sci fi western (e.g., Star Wars).  But the fresh spin and great character development make this a great series.  Great shows are not always about originality.  If a retread is told in a manner that fires the imagination it can just as powerful.What bogles my mind, is how FOX could completely drop the ball on this.  Unless there were major problems with the actors not getting along (of which there is no evidence) or unless the writers were getting bored with the idea (which is unlikely given its short run) this show should have been around for at least 5-6 years.  Instead FOX is now bringing us such classics as Skating with the Stars.  Good job guys.My hope was that the Sci Fi Channel would pick this show up, but other than viewing repeats I have not yet heard of any new production planned.  So, I will add my voice to the hurricane of great reviews and highly recommend this series and the movie.	5.0	How could FOX screw this up so bad ???	2006-01-16	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2KKJPYAAC8ZAB	"Wil Ogden ""Pantros"""	I hear the guys that put this show on fridays and out of order are cleaning public water fountains for a living. Okay, maybe not, but when karma kicks in...The writing on this show is just incredible. In a few episodes you will love all of the crew members of Serenity, even the ones you hated after the first couple.Without question this is a better series than any Star Trek. I think this is because it is a far more realistic, believable future with characters we can all understand. Who doesn't understand the idea of just trying to get by in the world with what you have?Fans frequently compare this to Star Wars. There is definitely a common idea or two. This series is every bit as innovative as Star Wars. I am not exaggerating. I'm just not talking special effects. The innovation comes from technological and conceptual backtracking to create a more natural, immersive feeling.The heroes are not monodimensional good guys, but are clearly good at heart. Captain Malcom Reynolds will shoot first and not lose any respect for it. He's not the genius of a Star Trek Captain and that makes him more likable. He is a great leader of small groups of men. His care for those under his command is clear.The other characters are each unique and likeable for their own reasons. No one of them is perfect, but all have enough for anyone to sympathize with.Joss Whedon's writing is perfect for the current world. This is not a relaxed pace but at the same time everything is done for a reason and contributes to the characters and/or story.This is not just for SCI FI fans. The setting is SCIFI, the stories are not. The characters are not, well 8 of the 9 could exist without SCIFI.Arguably one of the best Series ever.	5.0	Fox will rue the day....okay so they already do.	2005-09-21	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2OPK2FZ93ZGNE	"""wilsonfrontier"""	I am - without a doubt - very picky about what I like and what I don't like.  When I first saw a few episodes of Firefly on FOX during it's brief television run, I didn't like the show much at all.  Toss it up to a dash of stupidity one my part and a large helping of it on the part of the FOX network.  By not airing the pilot they threw the audience in head first without directions.  Without that pilot, which was the key to all the marks on the map that was Firefly, no one had a clue what was going on.  Only a few intelligent people who saw passed the confusion and to the heart of the show became fans.  Somehow though, Firefly's become the new Star Trek - a little known cancelled show that grew (and is growing) into so much more through the support of it's fans post-cancellation.  It was another fan who dared me to watch the pilot and see what I thought that got be to become a Firefly fan.  Consider this your dare.  Firefly is without a doubt a fantastic show, and soon to be feature film entitlted Serenity - the name of the ship, and the title of the un-aired pilot.The DVD set is exceptional.  I have DVD sets for a few TV shows and rarely do you get such excellent bonus features - even though those shows where multiple-seasons long and poor Firefly only got half a season.  I guarentee you'll love Firefly.	5.0	They Truly Can't Take the Sky from Us...	2004-03-03	10	10	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JRUSI8U5B88I	WiltDurkey	Much, much, better than I expected.  Though a 5 star rating by 1800+ folks does raise your expectations a bit ;-)My background:  I love SciFi, but more so in books than in films.  I have especially low expectations for TV series.  It hurts me to see my favorite genre get mangled time after time by humanoid aliens that look like made-up humans, cheesy special effects and fake-looking sets.  The worst: bad plots that rely on techy pseudo-babble (as spoofed by GalaxyQuest).  Good SF films can overcome these problems, but,  over the long term, TV series always seem to lack the budget and/or good screenplays.But having liked Serenity-the-movie and read some of the reviews here, I figured I'd give Firefly-the-series a try.Firefly was an amazingly pleasant surprise!  The CGI special effects are very well done, but mostly limited to external views of the ship.  They are used sparingly and there are no space battle scenes to speak of.  The ship itself is very believable, in the same way that the Nostromo (Alien) was:  it looks worn, lived-in and patched together.  In short it looks like a typical big piece of machinery, not an oversized plastic toy.Firefly is concerned with the relationship of humans on poor frontier planets to a central government.  So it opts for a Wild-West theme which is long on atmosphere and realism but short on flashy gadgets. The frequent use of Chinese hints at some interesting political history as well...Beyond the unexpectedly good production quality, the crew is what really makes the series.  Each has his/her own quirks and each episode gives you some more insight into what makes them tick.  My personal favorite being Jayne, as he is such a dumb moron.  There might be a good side to him, somewhere, but the series goes out of its way to always knock him off his pedestal whenever you start to like him.  Oh, and Kaylee is a real hottie!Other reviewers have already written about the depth and subversive nature of the main plotline so there is no need to repeat those points.	5.0	Wow!	2005-12-17	10	10	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3HLILEELA8BPU	Winston Wolf	Firefly really shows what's wrong with the Fox network.  This was easily one of the best shows on television when it came out, and if given the chance to grow into its potential, could have been so much more than it was.  What is presented here is the complete series, including the episodes not seen in the U.S. until after the original run was over, along with the behind the scenes stuff that adds to the show.If you are a western fan, a science fiction fan, and even a comedy fan, there is something here for you!  I was very surprised when I found this for a reasonable price, and quickly snatched it up.For a show to STILL have people talking so many years after its premature demise is really a credit to Joss and his writing team.  Very different characters color a future that is both classic, futuristic, Chinese (watch the series, you'll understand) and funny.  Gone are the pristine, military ships of Star Trek, instead you get ships that have debris on them, aren't too pretty, and basically look like HOME to a crew.  Don't take that as a bash on Star Trek, I love Star Trek, but I also love the crew of Serenity.  Why another network doesn't jump on this show and take it to the next level is beyond me.	5.0	Fox really messed up	2007-05-04	3	3	0

But in the same breathe I must say that I love this series, I love this series, I love this series. It is for this reason I felt compelled to write this, my first review. Like many others I also missed it when it originally aired but was introduced to it recently by a friend. I watched his Firefly box set, then saw Serenity at another friend's house, and then ordered both yesterday. Buying both the series and the movie is my way of saying to Universal ""please make a sequel."" I'm sure many others feel the same. If you've never seen this show before bear past the first few episodes. It doesn't really hit it's stride until the middle of disc 2. The last disc is especially great. If you're looking for aliens, space battles, and computer generated eye candy this series is not for you. Firefly is about great story telling and the intriguing characters in it, qualities seldom seen on TV today. I hope to see Serenity fly again in the future.One last thought: Book. Previous life.

Operating with the knowledge that Fox was trying to can the show, Joss Whedon didn't go for the big, flashy visuals, but instead treated every episode like it was going to be the last one he got to write. Fans of the show, such as myself, who have watched the commentaries, note the chemistry between the actors and the passion they put into their roles. When anyone asks what it is about, it is hard to avoid the term ""space-western"", something that made many dismiss the show with a laugh. But when you watch it, it is almost impossible to pull away from it. You'll be singing the show's catchy theme for days, and you'll find yourself looking for any excuse to describe something as ""shiny.""

We all enjoyed what we could see when the series was on TV but most were not able to see all of the episodes due to the crazy scheduling.  I imagine most individuals who became fans did so despite the best efforts of the ""suits"" to kill the project, ...due to cost I would imagine.The movie that resulted from the outcry of those few but vocal fans does a good job of bringing the character's stories together and resolving most of the questions, as well as leaving a potential for another movie or additional episodes.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2GUVU889LA2O	"Woo Kim ""Woo S. Kim"""	Firefly is created by the creator of Angel Joss Whedon.  And you'd think a guy who has written and created a series about a vampire with a soul, could not do a sci-fi series?  Not true.  Like Angel, Firefly has the same sense of friends, co-workers, who become family.  Complicated and deep relations between characters and very witty banter between characters.  This series single handly made me like a science fiction series.  Because this series not only a sci-fi but it is also a Western as well.  If you're a fan of Lost, 24, Prison Break, Heroes, or any of those other garbage fictional series.  This is not the series for you, but if you want to see a television series, that will make you think and leave you satisifed by the end of the evening but still make you wanting more.  This is the series for you.  It's got action, comedy, romance, horror, Utopian society, and Western gun fights.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A16XUSPY6DOMKE	ws	I've never writen a review on Amazon.com, but any fan should take the time to try and spread the good word on this show.I don't watch much TV and I have to admit that I paid no attention to Firefly when it was on Fox.  I can't even remember seeing ads for it.  It was just recently (after hearing all the glowing reviews for the Serenity movie) that I stumbled onto the Firefly DVD set.  I decided to give the show a look before I watched the movie.  It took me a couple of episodes to get my head around the style (kind of a sci-fi/western vibe), but once I did I have to say that the DVDs were worth every penny.  A very original and entertaining show!Don't let the fact that it's a sci-fi show turn you away.  My wife (who usually can't stand sci-fi) even got hooked on it!I'm guilty of passing the show by when it was originally on the air, but I have to say it's a shame it was cut short so soon.  I only hope that this series will someday be resurrected.  The characters, stories, and style were so original that it just doesn't seem fair that the book was closed on them.  Maybe if the fans (old and new) keep spreading the word the series will have a chance to live on.  Judging by Amazon's sales rankings of the film and the tv show it could become a possibility.Five very well earned stars!!	5.0	Great show!!	2006-01-24	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2TSNI06EAHGPS	Wulfgar	This was a show that took me completely by surprise.  I was a hardcore Buffy/Angel fan back in the day and loved almost anything they put out, so I loved to see Joss and then the other executive producers and writers put new stuff out.I finally got around to watching Wonderfalls a few months back and I loved it, so I figured that I would eventually get around to seeing Joss's new baby, Firefly.  However, I had seen one episode back during Fox's hack and slash airings of the show and didn't really care for it too much, so I wondered whether or not I would even get through the entire box set.  Let me tell you up front that it was no problem at all.Firefly is set in the future after a great war between the Alliance and the Independents.  The Alliance was the corporate and government conglomerate that formed to rule our part of the universe.  In this world, food and medicine are the silver and gold of today.  Everyone is still constantly expanding to new worlds so these things will fetch a pretty penny.Who will get these things to the people you ask.  None other than Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew aboard the spaceship Firefly.If you are not a big fan of Sci-Fi, don't let the whole spaceship thing bother you.  This is more western than it is sci-fi.  The captian carries a six shooter and more than once they get into good old fashion gun fights.The best part, though is the characters and the little things that you begin to love.You start with Mal, the man that has been hurt by everyone and has a hard time opening up, but will do anything to protect his crew.Next is Zoe, his tough as nails second who is always with him in a fight and is second in command on the ship.  She deals with the constant struggle between being their for her captain and her husband.Who happens to be the pilot of the ship.  Hoban, was the third person on board the ship and eventually fell in love with Zoe.  He is a bit of a goofball, but is responsible for all of their lives everyday.  However, he is not very good in a fight, so he tends to leave that to his wife.Next is one of my favorite characters, Kaylee, acts and talks like allot like a Southern girl of today.  She also has a gift of being able to sense what is going on with the ship and what it needs to continue to run.  This helps allot since it seems to be held together MacGyver style with chewing gum and baseball cards.  She really is the heart of the crew.The final member of the crew at the beginning of the show is Jayne.  He is a mercenary through and through, always out to make a buck and not letting anything stop him to do it.  However, as the season progresses he beging little by little to see his shipmates as more of a family.We then get a few passengers that hang on for a bit.  There is Book, the Shepherd(preacher) who we find out will be far more than we will know, Simon who is a Doctor that smuggled his sister on board in cryogenic stasis, and his sister River who was a supergenius until the government started cutting on her brain, now she's more than a bit crazy and a bit psychic as well.This was a show that I began to like from the beginning, but only a bit.  However, as I continue to watch it grew on me until I couldn't wait to see the last few.  By that time, I was hooked... a fiend that needed my fix, but alas the show was canceled after only 15 episodes were made.  I was left with so many question that I hope at least a few of which will be answered in the film Serenity.  However, I am hoping with all of my might that the brass will realize what a great thing it was that they canceled and go the Family Guy route and pick it back up.	5.0	Firefly...

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2VX2WC60RKEFY	xitwound117	"I bought this after thoroughly enjoying the theatrical and subsequent DVD release of Serenity.Yes, I am a fresh recruited Browncoat.First, it was the buzz of a new science fiction movie based on a TV show that was a cult hit. I hadn't heard of the TV show, but I always look forward to good sci-fi releases.Then I saw the trailer. Now I was excited.Then I saw it in theaters. One of the best movies I had ever seen.Then I bought both Serenity and Firefly when Serenity's DVD release came around.Firefly is incredible. Astounding. Extremely enjoyable. Superbly written. The acting was just about the best I've seen. The music was great. The jokes were hilarious. The curse words are absolutely lovable. I mean, who can't stop saying ""Gorram it!"" once you start?It started with a movie I only really, really enjoyed. It is now a TV show that I really, really love.Simply put, it is a crime against art that this show had only 14 episodes. Firefly should have had 3 excellent seasons. What is wrong with people?Had I been a Fox executive, I would have driven my entire company into bankruptcy just to keep filming Firefly. Screw all else.Someone has to bring this show back. Something has to be done. I can't have only 14 episodes.And just to support the show, I'm going to buy everything I can.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZJ7BW8M1XQ71	"YBNORMAL2 ""YB"""	This is a great scifi series that was cut down before it's time.Even those who do not usually watch scifi and can not get into the monster, gadgets and weird future societies would like this series.It paints a picture of the future that is not far off from today. People are still people with the same problems, ambitions, good and evil and the need to be independant.You have the alliance a controlling government who fought the independants, the Browncoats and what happened after the final battle of Serenity Valley. The battle the Firefly ship was named after.The alliance won and now Mal the capt. of the firefly and his crew makes a living on the outer planets taking jobs, some honest, some not so honest.He picks up passengers Simon and River Tam, the Dr and his sister who he broke out of a secret government facility and they are now on the run.He also picks up a preacher who seems to know more than you would expect from a preacher.The series has adventure and humor. In the future but with a westerm feel. The planets have horses, cattle, whore houses, bars, gun fights and more.No monsters, aliens, laser guns, robots or other typical scifi elements.Taking on what jobs they need with fugitives on board and the alliance after them who will do anything to get their experiment River Tam back.This series does not center around any one character. It spends time developing everyone and I love the interaction between them.There is something to like in everyone though they do have their conflicts as well.This is a great series I recommend for everyone if you have seen Serenity but not the Firefly series check it out.Highly recommend A++++++	5.0	A Series with Something for Everyone	2006-01-05	7	7	0

Here was one of the best series' I have ever seen on television, (US TV that is) and the network know-it-alls had to sabotage it.  First they did not allow the amazing Mr Whedon to present it in the order that he developed it, so not many people got attached because they didn't understand the characters or situation. Very unfortunate.  And then for those starved for decent sci-fi, that were getting into the series, they yanked it off the screen.  I feel like Oliver, Please sir, may I have MORE?The writing was fabulous.  My father and uncle both are screenwriters and were very impressed.  The acting was great and you could tell that they liked each other and the project.  Sigh.  Maybe someday it will replay on the sci-fi channel.  Maybe if I wish really hard, someone will take the sci-fi genre seriously and realize that there is a demographic out there that will make someone some money if they put something this good on the tube and leave it there.  Gee, Star Trek was almost cancelled and look what happened to it.  This could have easily gone that far.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A34DDM8GUVTJ3Y	Y. H. Ivan Chu	After watching the amazing Battlestar Galactica, I went on searching for another amazing Sci-Fi TV series. I found three that popped out. Stargate, Farscape, and Firefly. These three have very good ratings and reviews. I first picked Farscape to watch because of all the aliens and stuff ... unfortunately, it was incomparable to Battlestar Galactica. The story is cliched, predictable, acting is average, and episodes don't feel like they connect very well. After about 5-6 episodes, I dropped the series.Then I found Firefly. If you have seen Battlestar Galactica, I think you'd agree that it's an amazing series with a story that is exciting, full of mystery, unpredictable, funny, emotional, tense, and all the things a great story should have. After watching Firefly for 3-4 episodes, I can say that it lives up to my expectation of Battlestar Galactica. Firefly is a REALLY AMAZING series that will surely entertain you, excite you, emotionize you, make you laugh, make you wonder what's going to happen next, and make you simply just have a BLAST watching it!If you're looking for a GREAT Sci-Fi TV series that has a great story + characters - look no further.

Hyun ""jijibebe_98"""	Like a few others, after watching the movie Serenity, I was intrigued enough about the show to rent the Firefly episodes. After watching a few episodes, I knew I had to own the series. I've consequently hooked my family and friends to being Firefly fans.I love the sci-fi western mix, the dialogue, the characters (all nine crew members were perfectly cast), the stories are all superb. I don't think there is one bad episode in the season--just episodes that you have as favorites. And I have favorite moments of each episode. Another plus about this boxed set, is that the episodes are in the order the creators wanted and not how they were aired, so each episode, while self-contained, also builds the overall story.The show perfectly balances humor, drama, action and mystery. What is the Shepherd's background? What exactly did the Alliance do to River? Who are the guys with blue hands?(some of which was NOT answered in the movie)Anyway, a BIG thank you to Joss Whedon and the cast and crew for making such a terrific show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2Z0ZKFHA79QCU	Ylena Slovakyera	Fuirefly is, simply put, not a very intelligent show. If you like science fiction that challenges your head, heart, mid, soul while taking you on amazing adventures, try something else. Firefly is not for you. Perhaps it appeals to so many people because one doesn't need to think too much to get through Firefly.Every science fiction cliche` in the book is used, not one idea stands out as original. Even the fans have to agree that the terraforming theory is quite simply old. It first appeared in 1967 and the theory has been touted as utter rubbish by modern science. If we colonize other worlds it is NOT going to happen by terraforming.The dialogue is hollw. There is no pathos or ethos for the less than sympathetic characters. Unlike Farscape or Mutant X --both highly orinal series'-- it is extremely difficult to care about the characters.Suffice to say, Fox showed good jusgement in cancelling a show that was cancelled for a very good reason. No one liked it the first time, but now that it's made it to the big screen everybody is suddenly interested.	1.0	Bland at best - It's all hype	2006-06-09	294	25	269

And second, the special features on this DVD set are so wonderful.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2J3MR64L567OK	Yossarian	I'm one of those idiots that never watched this show while it was on television.  I think I saw maybe half of one episode before it got cancelled.  Man, if I could have that to do over again... Firefly is an awesome series.  Like all classic shows (particularly sci-fi) it is a bit inaccessible at first, as you're bombarded with images, characters, plots, and roles that come at you from dizzying angles and without immediate resolution.  However, that chaos eventually becomes Firefly's great strength, which sadly is only evident over the long term.  Firefly is what I wish the new Star Wars movies had been:  long on character development, full of style, and never quite what it seems.  Just when you think you have each character, from the taciturn but loveable captain to the beautiful Companion to the surly thug figured out, they do something to throw a wrench in it and make you start over nearly from scratch.I know now that I largely missed out - not really on the episodes as I have the DVDs - but on the chance of doing my small part to keep it from getting cancelled.  However, thanks to the glory of the Internet and of DVD sales, we're soon to get a Firefly movie, 'Serenity', and perhaps, just perhaps, with some luck and a network executive with a spine, a reprise of the show.  Firefly deserves so much better than how it was treated, and the legions of loyal fans (cultish tendency to refer to one another as 'Browncoats' aside) are a testament to that.  If you get your hands on these DVDs, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.	5.0	You wanna see the REAL me now?	2005-07-20	10	9	1
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A2J2H99PPA7WD3	"Yo Yo Ma's Worst Nightmare. ""Timothy"""	You know, in the long, sad history of this little rock we call Earth, there have been many ghastly mistakes, crimes and travesties. If you could write all of these mistakes down in a big book, the cancellation and mismanagement of 'Firefly' by the Fox network would be just a few pages back from Vietnam and the conception of the beer-can-holding hat (Possibly just a few pages before day Lionel Ritchie decided to breed...possibly.)Well, as I'm sure you can tell by now, I like the show. Joss Whedon's work on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Alien: Resurrection, Angel, and the like were, to put it delicately, very bad, in this reviewer's opinion. However, he did well on this one. Perhaps he just got lucky, but the one thing can tell you is that he knocked this one out of the park and into the heads of us, the innocent but grateful bystander's.Now that I've had my say about the writing, I'd like to comment on the technical stuff. The effects are what would be expected, stunning but not unusually so. I can't count how many times some one has told me the effects in a movie of show were great, though. Not that they're not right, it's just that effects have to be great for it to get aired. Next time you see a modern, nationally broadcast television show that runs for more than ten episodes that has really bad effects, tell me and I'll eat my hat. Actually, I don't have a hat...tell you what, I'll buy at hat, and than eat it, while watching ten consecutive hours of `Lost In Space.'But, I digress. The thing to look for in these episodes is not the effects, flashy guns, and what have you, but the characters. Each of the nine key characters has a distinct, and endlessly entertaining personality and back-story. You grow to really love them, and, even the 'Companion' character, Inara, whom I hated like at the beginning, grew on me. Each of the main characters have their own little moments where you can really understand what they're after, what they're about. So, buy this DVD set and I swear you'll never regret it. Even if you do regret it, I'm sure the 'Amazon.com' people will be more than happy to supply you with a detailed profile on me, so you may hunt me down. That is my promise to you.	5.0	I knew they lost it with 'The Simple Life.'	2004-12-22	12	8	4

Don't know if the Fox execs read this or not.  Don't much care.  I just hope that some other network picks this up (like the WB) and brings Serenity back on the air for us.  P-L-E-A-S-E...p.s.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A277TW0L7RX560	Zachary D. Bernstein	"Okay, maybe there's something out there that can top Firefly.  Maybe.  But the fact remains that this is a truly amazing show, one that was criminally underrated and underwatched during its time on the air and, like so many other good shows that have played on Fox, canceled when it really shouldn't have been.Now, even if you didn't see the show, you can see what all the fuss is about.The best things about this show are the characters and the writing.  Joss Whedon's trademark wit shows on every episode - even, amazingly enough, the ones he didn't write.  The dialogue helps you fall for the characters (especially Wash, the uncannily talented pilot and arguably the most loved character of them all), although some of them are just so gosh-darn lovable by themselves that they could say just about anything and still be great (I'm thinking here of Kaylee, the adorable ship's mechanic).Which is not to say the stories themselves aren't worth watching either.  Not only are they worth watching, they're worth watching over and over.  That's one other amazing thing about this series - after repeated viewings, I'm not even close to tired of this show.  In fact, watching it over and over makes me long for season two - or perhaps a sequel to ""Serenity,"" the 2005 Joss Whedon-directed feature film continuation."	5.0	Best.  Show.

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"As a fan of TV dramas in general (and science fiction in specific), I had always wondered what ""all the fuss"" was about ""Firefly"" and the furious reaction to its cancellation.  As I began watching the show, it slowly began to grow on me.  By the end, I understood.For a basic plot summary, ""Firefly"" describes a dark future in which the planets have all fallen under a centralized, government-controlled rule.  There are some on the fringes of the galaxy, however, who resist, and smuggling-ship captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is one of them.  Along with first mate Zoe (Gina Torres), tough guy Jayne (Adam Baldwin) pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), and engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite), Mal survives by ""doing jobs"" for various un-sundry parties.  As the opening voice-over states, Mal ""doesn't much care what they are"", as long as they pay him enough to keep his ship in the sky.  Along the way, Mal and Co. pick up a religious Sheperd Book (Ron Glass), a high-class prostitute companion Inara (Morena Baccarin), doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher), and the doc's crazy sister River (Summer Glau), who the authorities are always after.It took me a few episodes to really ""get"" this show, as the premise is quite strange.  It is basically a ""space western"" created by Joss Whedon, and what are all westerns truly about at heart...the characters!  The first few episodes feature quite a bit of gun-play and swashbuckling from the cast and thus it takes some time for the characters themselves to become flesh-out.  Once that happens, though, each character becomes quite ""real"" and easy to get emotionally attached to.  A great ensemble cast, to be sure.  At first, I wasn't too comfortable with Fillion as the lead (I'm always so used to seeing him as the ""stuffed shirt"" type), but even he grew on me.It truly was a shame that the FOX network did such a disservice to such a great concept and group of characters.  Not only was the series advertised all wrong and pre-empted seemingly every night by sporting events in the fall, but it also was aired out-of-order and forced to include ""mythology"" elements to make it more X-Files-ish.  Basically, the FOX execs out-thought themselves on this one.  Had they just given Whedon a little bit more play on the leash, ""Firefly"" could have been a great franchise, I think.  As it is, now the title ""cult classic"" better applies to the 14-episode run.  Very similar parallels to a later FOX show in ""Fringe"", although that show survived longer because of the JJ Abrams brand.Overall, I very much enjoyed the ""Firefly"" series, short as it was.  The characters really grew on me as I kept watching and I truly feel as if I could have watched many more episodes of this type of drama.  There are better TV dramas to be had, admittedly, but this one is still better than most.  The show's abrupt and unsettling cancellation is just proof that justice isn't always served.  At least we got what we got."	4.0	A Show That Will Grow On You	2013-08-18	1	1	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	AC61Y0DC9XHEF	Zach Walker	"Imagine a television universe with action, mystery, suspense and characters with actual dimension. Now, imagine that the show was a commercial success. Sadly, only one of those two sentences can be true.With Firefly, Joss Whedon pulled a sci-fi trick out of his writing hat, and in the process gave us a new group of fascinating characters to care about. With his customarily sharp wit, Whedon delivered arguably the best dialog in television, and laid out a new Anglo-Sino dialect peppered with wild-west accents. Chinese and ""awww-shucks"" english blended seemlessly together, all the time cracking wise to crack us up and turning effortlessly poetic to break the heart. For the first time in a very, very, very long time, we get a captivating brave new world of not-so-good-good-guys and lots and lots of secrets.It all added up to a formula of sci-fi that was not self-important, formal, serious or hygenic to the point of sterility. It was a used, lived-in universe that bore all the markings of having people in it. It was space opera meets shoot-em-up-western, and it was the best thing to happen to television, even if it only lasted an all too brief moment. If you like good old-fashioned storytelling, this is your show."	5.0	What TV could be	2005-10-02	5	5	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	ANRFU0JUSQBNJ	Z. Cornelius	This should have lasted longer. The network ran the episodes out of order and did not give this show a chance. This could have become a long running popular series, but the network was short sighted on this one. I'm glad we at least have what we do. Sci-Fi is a better genre because Firefly exists.	5.0	Do yourself a favor and watch this series!	2013-10-26	0	0	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A36K52Z2R0LU4H	Z. D. Houghton	The tragedy of Firefly's pilot being cut from an exciting two-hour premiere to a different one-hour episode has already been widely lamented. Yet, even with the early abridgement, I cannot fathom how this show could not have performed better. It is full of not only quirkly, fun ideas, but extremely well written with an interesting premise.One cannot say this is the type of show anyone &quot;expected&quot;, but it should come as no surprise that creator Joss Wheldon gave birth to another series full of solid scripts, quotable quotes, and unforgettable characters. The actors do a tremendous job with potraying the chemistry (and sometimes lack thereof) of a small group of adventurers, but they have certainly been set up for success by Wheldon. There will be those who snort and say you can't really find any sort of depth in a space western, but those same people probably are shocked to find credible philosophical works being written on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I'm sure most of us fans who have sniffed out this boxed set can agree Fox dumped this one far too soon. Our collective solace? With a Firefly movie in the works, and such series as Family Guy resuscitated due to strong DVD sales, can a Firefly revival be far behind?	5.0	Too Good to Be Gone!	2004-07-18	6	6	0
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A3L89J6F5R7NRC	"Zed ""Slinger of code. Eater of sushi."""	Sadly, I'm a bit late to the Firefly party. I saw the movie Serenity, and loved it.  I soon found out it was based on the tv series Firefly, so I immediately went out and bought these dvds.After watching all of the series, I am now even more impressed.  What an amazing show.  Detailed, complex and interesting characters. Realistic personalities, not the typical cartoon characters in most tv series. The characters and story lines aren't watered down politically correct vanilla.  Characters actually stay in character and do the things you would expect them to do in that situation, even it wasn't... nice.  Acting was spot on.  Even though there are a lot of characters, you get pulled into caring about all of them.The set & special effects are top notch and movie-like (not cheapy typical tv).  I didn't really notice it the first time I watched it (because I was intent on the show) but there is some really interesting cinematography here, very different than traditional movies/tv... and it really makes you feel like you are part of the story rather than just watching it.  Awesome, awesome stuff.How Fox execs could be so short sighted and cancel this show, I have no idea.  Some of the best tv ever made.	5.0	So, they still can make a good tv show...	2005-12-17	9	9	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1JLJH8WAKHT6F	Z. Gray	For those of you who've been living under a rock, Firefly is one of the best things to happen to science fiction television in a long time. Perhaps ever. Joss Whedon's intoxicating space-western drama has complex and intriguing characters, fantastic dialogue, and an on-the-money sense of dramatic pacing. The story arc clearly has a long-term spin, and the world our characters inhabit is at once foreign and familiar. Such is the power of this series to captivate your imagination that spaceship captains sporting revolvers and country-bumpkin farmgirls speaking fluent mandarin seem perfectly reasonable. This is a yarn about our future, rooted solidly in our past, which feels like our very familiar present.So thumb your nose at the powers that be at Fox who unwittingly axed this show and do yourself a favor and pick up the DVD set ASAP.	5.0	Serial Sci-Fi at is Best	2004-03-01	5	5	0

Like everyone else that watched it and fought for it to return, I'm sad that they cancelled it with all that potential. Sound and picture quality are good, in the darker scenes you can see some of the grainy-ness of the film because of the type of camera they used.

Joss Wheadon is absolutely amazing - Firefly was indeed stellar and anyone who picks up the DVD will not regret it... no matter who they are or what genre they usually prefer.  The only thing that will be a drawback is that there are no more seasons - Firefly with all the original characters should be brought back.	5.0	Joss Wheadon is the best	2004-12-11	0	0	0

B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A1ZPFEKSC8IYAA	Zoologist440	I have to commend Joss Whedon for his ridiculously fantastic space western show, but what really surprised me was the sheer toughness of the series. I had just received the series in the mail when a group of space pirates descended from the heavens, hellbent on snatching my brand new purchase. They pulled out their rifles and began to fire at me. With only underwear and Firefly to protect me, I thought I was a goner. Lucky for me, Firefly, through sheer badass, began to act on its own, blocking every shot fired and ricocheting the bullets back at the pirates just like in Star Wars. Truly, this is a magnificent series, capably of the most amazing feats of badassery.	5.0	This Series Saved My Life	2012-05-21	3	1	2
B0000AQS0F	Firefly: The Complete Series	A37BV7IC7QQUBT	"Zoot Zoot ""Zootie"""	"I reccommend for all to buy Firefly the Series and Serenity Collector's Edition to all those who haven't purchased either one.Serenity (Collector's Edition)I must admit that when Firefly first came on Fox I watched the first 15 minutes and gave up on the series right then. I thought it was going to be some melodrama crap like another crap sci fi show called ""Space Above & Beyond."" Even when the movie Serenity came out I still had the opinion that this was a terrible series. I was wrong.I had my appendix removed not long ago and had to spend some time in bed. It was then the Sci Fi Channel ran reruns of Firefly and I became hooked. I am truly kicking myself for my initial opinion of the show but better late than never. I wish I had seen the movie Serenity in the theater, but I ended up buying it too.I'm not going to go into the storyline or why I liked the series and the movie. I just reccommend that those of you slightly interested to buy Firefly the Series and Serenity the Collector's Edition. You'll love it."	5.0	Great DVD Series.

Its one of those series that I enjoy every time I watch it (Amazon Prime).  The story for those who never watched firefly is futuristic and the &#34;hero&#34; is like a futuristic John Wayne (just thought of that).  Each one of the story's characters has a unique blend of good and bad with humor.  It was followed by a movie which for me helped with the let down of the series being cut off.	5.0	I'll never understand why this was cancelled	2013-12-14	0	0	0
