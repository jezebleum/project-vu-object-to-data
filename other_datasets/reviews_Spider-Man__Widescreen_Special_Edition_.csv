B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A155X6KYOPQEZ5	"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe"""	"Tobey McGuire stars as an ordinary Peter Parker who happens to be a high school nerd. He also happens to have a major crush on a classmate Mary Jane. One day on a field trip his class goes to a laboratory with genetic engineered ""superspiders"". As he's taking photographs of Mary Jane a ""superspider"" slides down the ceiling and bites Peter. He starts to feel sick and then goes to sleep. He doesn't wake up the same man he was when he fell asleep. From then on he becomes Spider-Man. The web-slinging life saving Spider-Man. Unfortunately, as always, there's a villain in town. There's where the Green Goblin comes in. Then Spiderman has to fight a battle between good and evil.I have never seen any of the Spider-Man comics. In fact, I'm not even a big fan of the cartoons. However, after just seeing the first movie, I wanted more and more of Spiderman. The Spiderman costume for is classic. His abilities are even better:clinging to walls, spraying webs of string from his hand, better jumping capabilities, more strength, faster reflexes, and the special Spidey Sense--which allows Peter to forsee things that are coming at him or coming for him.All of the scenes take place in New York City. During the film, there's a lot of good animation. Spider-Man swinging from building to building requires effects. I was very impressed with all of the effects. If you have seen the comics or just want to tryout a superhero film, I recommend Spider-Man."	5.0	"""And now...the amazing SPIDER-MAN!!!"""	2008-07-23	3	3	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2Q4NN103KKTUG	"2crowded ""crowded2"""	For it's entertainment value alone, movie enthusiasts who don't necessarily consider themselves Spider-Man fans, may actually enjoy the movie more than the hardcore Spider-Man fan.The movie is a fairly good adaption of the classic comic. But, there are some innacuracies and a couple of things I would have liked to see. Hardcore Spider-Man fans will first notice technical issues such as the organic web shooters that are inconsistant with Peter Parker's hand made web shooters from the original comics. That seemed to be such a big issue before the movie ever even came out, and such a departure may not be easily overlooked by an original fan. However, I think for this movie it worked pretty well and it may have actually helped tell the story a little better. And, while I realize that there was just too much to include in a 2 hour film, I still would have liked to have seen (or at least had some mention of) more of Spider-Man's many villians. There was absolutely no mention of some of the more infamous bad guys such as Doc Ock, Venom, etc. Of course, the movie ends leaving you with the impression that there is more to come, so perhaps there's a sequel in the works with more of the classic villians for Spidey to battle.In the genre of super hero movies, I think that Spider-Man is one of the better ones out there, if not the best. One reason is Green Goblin's tough guy factor. He seems to be a much stronger adversary than some of the other goofy, wise-cracking super hero villians, such as Superman's Lex Luther, or Batman's Joker or Penguin.Included on the DVD are notes and commentary by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee and many of the other writers and artists, along with background and history of the comic franchise. Overall, with all the extras included, I'd say this DVD is a must have for Spider-Man fans, and a good buy for the regular movie-goer looking for some entertainment value. The DVD extras alone will keep the Spider-Man fans busy, and will introduce many other viewers to the world of Spider-Man comics.	4.0	Good adaptation of the classic comic	2003-01-24	2	2	0

The one big thing that most people will hate about this movie is how predictable it is. You can always guess what's going to happen next.

But in Puerto Rico where I live, The movies usually arrive here 2 or 3 weeks later. All that I have heard about Spider-Man is excellent. Even though I am a Batman & Superman fan all my life, the only Marvel character that I always liked was Spider-Man. If the movie is faithful to the original storyline, it should be a smash.

The plot seems to do a good job of following what I remember of the comic book plot line, the dialog is comic book in nature but all right( after all it is a comic book not real life) and the special effects seem to do all right by me. Some complain that some of the action scenes don't look right but considering that a man is being portrayed swinging on a strand of web (the spider characteristics are the biggest variance from the historical plotline)I think they were well done.I got finished with the movie wanting something more, maybe the next one will do an even better job.The extra's should be a lot of fun to see, if I get it they will be the reason.	3.0	Lot of fun to watch, seems faithfully done, buy for extras	2003-02-07	0	0	0

Lets face it, something for everyone.Peter Parker is your typical geeky high schooler who has a crush on a popular girl at school.  Ofcrouse, the super jock also likes her, and wants to make Peter's life miserable.  Then one day, Peter's life changes when he's bitten by a special spider.  The rest, as they say, is history.The casting was perfect. Defoe is wonderful as the Green Goblin. He has the perfect mannerism for a bad guy. Kirsten Dunst as MJ was wonderful, full of sweet and innocence. Ofcourse, Toby is perfect for Spiderman.What I liked about this movie is that the lesson that Peter learns. I can't way what it is, ofcourse, because I don't want to ruin it, but the lesson is well learned.I highly suggest you go see this movie. Stay for the credits b/c at the end of the movies (and after most of the songs at the end) they play the ""Spiderman song"" from the cartoon.

It's a review of the box set: Spider-Man Limited Eidtion DVD Collector's Gift Set. (I'll do a review of the Spider-Man dvd at a later time) It contains two dvds: 1) the Spider-Man widescreen special edition, and while I'm not going to go into it in this review, it is a great movie and a great dvd; and 2) Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels, which I've reviewed under the dvd, so I won't go much into this dvd here. But it is a very informative interview. These two dvds pretty much make the gift set worth the price. It also comes with a few 'collector's items' which I leave to you to decide if they make it worth picking up the gift set or just buying the dvds. There's a reproduction of the Amazing Fantasy comic that first introduced Spider-Man. It's monetary value is null, since it is a reproduction, but it is nice to get a copy of our favorite web-slinger's first appearance. A bit juvenile, but valueable for the Spidey-fan. There's a piece of artwork by John Romita Sr, nice but doesn't add much to the set. And finally there is a film cell from the movie (when Spider-Man is dodging Goblin's bats in the burning building). Also nice to have, but I found these collector's items don't add much to the enjoyment of the dvds. I'd say the gift set is only valuable to the hard core fan. Otherwise, just pick up the dvds.	5.0	a review of Spider-Man Limited Edition Collector's Gift Set	2002-11-24	37	29	8

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3ONKRWEZMJJUV	"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista"""	Spider man is mediocre film. Crappy direction, bad visual effects, cheesy emotions and Hollywood clich&eacute;s enhanced by an stupid script. Any serious consideration concerning the quality of its well manufactured commercial approach is completely absurd and futile. Don't mind the childish aspects of its whole concept, you won't need to use your brain through this movie (just the way you like it dear Spider Man Fan). Is it entertaining? Well yeah, but Jerry Springer is way more entertaining and way more stupid. Is it exiting like a roller coaster ride? Hell no! The action sequences are a constant routine, besides the script was to simplistic and superficial to let any of them turn into a real cliffhanger. Is the love story really compelling? Like a soap opera I would say, and just as bad. What about the villain? Well, Willem Dafoe is a great actor, but the Green Goblin thing was to over the top for him, so he is not to blame (the Green Goblin outfit seems like a big pajama with a helmet). And what about Tobey Mcguire as Peter Parker? His looks and performance really fit the character essence, but the film was so bad that it didn't matter, and Sam Raimi has to take all take all the blame for this. It's not his understanding of the characters and their world what he got wrong, but the choice of script and easy direction that pushed every emotive theme too heavy over the protagonist, making everything shallow and vulgar. With great Power comes great Responsibility! Is this line a joke? Hell yeah! Pure vacuity by definition.So, Peter Parker is a dump nerd trying hard to find his way in life. No body likes him, everybody mocks him, the girl he loves seems to close and away, not a penny in his pocket, and other minor dramas are drawn in his way to become a superhero. Plus, the tragic element enters his life when his beloved uncle dies, Mary Jane hooks up with his best friend, and the villain is born by another accident (who by the way, is the father of his best buddy), and suddenly: BANG! That is the plot.I suppose some credit has to be given to the treatment of Spidey's Origin; the rest of the movie is developed between predictable situations and corny adolescent weeps. But any kind of critical statements towards this film may end in a big: who gives a fu...! Its enormous box office success is enough to shut anyone's mouth. Now take also into consideration the DVD income, trigger happy studio executives and ecstatic  pseudo-artistic film makers won't be sad at all with bad reviews.The visual effects (made up by the already doubtful I.L.M.), resulted in an exposure of cheap muscular movements and bad body textures, too obvious to the be ignore by today's highly trained Spectator Eye (cause anything less the seemingless is not good enough). And of course, the jokes where deadly stupid.Good and accurate photography, an O.K. music score by Danny Elfman, nice editing and some ephemeral moments of decent narration (plus some dry kisses), made this flick a real taster's choice (that is if you are a fan of Gigli and those dump films that Jerry Bruckheimer so often loves to produce). Questions about; Why Kirsten Dunst was selected to play Mary Jane instead of a Hot Busty Blonde? Can never be answer. Mary Jane importance was all about that lousy wet T-shirt scene, the rest was about looking pretty (no acting incorporated).There are various versions available of the Spider Man movie on DVD (including a Limited Edition Collector's Gift Set), everyone comes with great Visual and Sound Quality, plus a generous number of special features about the making of this junk. The 3-Disk Deluxe Edition can be considered a less hurtful move to your pocket (Its better to give it as a gift than to own it).The problem with this kind of films is how easy they can look silly without ever touching their concept with seriousness, the concern is always about looking good in their outfits, the story and its treatment is secondary.And so, Comic Book adaptations have reached rock bottom. With titles like Spider Man, The Hulk, Dare Devil, and The Punisher, from here on, it can only get better. And never in cinema History such an empty and shallow film has tried so hard to be intimate and personal. The fun side of it is only in your mind, not on the celluloid print.	2.0	Super Fun Happy Slide.	2004-09-22	8	5	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AZSN1TO0JI87B	A. Estes	First off, I have never read a Spider-man comic in my life, in fact, I never was into comics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It delivers everything you would expect from any big-budget summer blockbuster. You get action, you get dazzling special effects and even a love story to boot. Sure, the movie is predictable, but that's what makes it so great. Sure, I like a lot of cynical films and most of my favorite movies don't have happy endings, but it's refreshing to see a movie that actually feels good to watch. Tobey Maguire is perfect in his roll as Peter Parker, a photography geek who is turned into Spider-man by way of a poisonous spider-bite. His love interest and next door neighbor is played by Kirsten Dunst. Both are perfect for the movie and do a really good job. Willem Dafoe was a great choice for Norman Osbourne (AKA The Green Goblin) to me, his character had the most dimension. Even though he was the bad guy, I didn't know how to feel towards him in the movie. At times he would be a caring father and five minutes later he would be an insane terrorist. The plot is very good, I don't know if it actually comes from the comic book, but I thought it was VERY well written and has plenty of plot twists to keep you awake. My only gripe about this film is the scene inside of the burning building where Spider-Man and the Green Goblin get into a fight [...]. If I had been behind the editing chair, that scene would have hit the cutting room floor [...]. But one tiny problem can't defeat an otherwise great movie. I suggest anyone goes to see it. I'm not a comic-book freak and I loved it, and I plan on going to see it again while it's still in theaters.	5.0	Definetly lives up to the hype	2002-05-06	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F	Ahmed	Spider-man is great. Great visual effects, just as speedy (or rather slow) as the matrix. It has it all-great characters, great plot, great special effects and of coarse great sound editing! It is almost exactly like the comics/TV cartoons! In all probability one of the only differences are that... I'll let you know after you watch it (don't want to spoil it). This movie is worth watching! It's worth the wait that all Spider man fans have been waiting for. It's a film that's appealing to children, teenagers, and adults! I haven't met anyone who hates it! It has both romance and humor! Dunst and Maguire are perfect for the role! It's a movie that let's you know how wide an imagination of a director can be. It's a touching story and at the same time a fast action movie that you wouldn't mind watching over and over again! In a way it's like the comic book coming alive! It's for all Lord of the rings-Harry Potter-The matrix- and Batman fans!It's fundamentally concentrates on Peter Parker-a guy who's in love with Mary Jane. It's a kind of movie that Alanis Morissette songs would really go with since she has songs to support all the moods that you'd feel as you watch Spider-Man (and hey she has a song called Mary Jane!).Overall it was really worth the wait. It's better than any movie I've watched all summer! The movie packs together a lot of excitement. Just like Lord of the rings it's touching and at the same time exciting (I know I've mentioned this before!). No one could have made it any better than Raimi (although I'd like to watch a movie directed by Peter Jackson and Raimi). Spider-man is no old super hero movie (although it does have a damsel who is constantly in distress)-it's a modernized fast creation that could only be imagined as you read the comic books-until now! It's an impressive flick that you should watch if you haven't watched it yet! It's a movie that very rarely bores you. It doesn't stretch a scene by giving you too much detail.	5.0	And then along came a spider!	2002-10-29	3	1	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A103AZLY78GMZW	A & J	"A: 2/5 StarsUnless you are a superhero buff I wouldn't reccommend this movie to anyone.Long + Predictable = Boring.  That's exactly what this movie was.  Sure, the action scenes were loud and big, but they are neither believable or original, and all they did was keep me awake.I would tell you the ending and all that, but I want you to see how sadly predictable this movie is.  Or maybe you should just not waste any time or money on it.J: 2/5 Starsspider-man is a comic book hero movie with a sadly undeveloped story and pointlessly cartoonish action sequences. it is the kind that begs to be considered good but falls below average. the story is about a teen outcast who receives ""special powers"" from a genetically enhanced spider on a field trip to a science lab. this leads to a bunch of computer  animated action scenes where the hero tests out his new abilities. The problem with these scenes is that they are more fake and inexplicable than real and at least somewhat believable. they are loud and flashy and serve as eye candy for the blind. the story is the standard version of the comic and does nothing special to surpass it's expectations (Although i liked the sweetness in the relationship with the boy and his grandfather). after a sudden tragedy, spidey realizes that he should use his superhuman abilities for good.this leads to the meeting of harry osborne who is also mutated into the green goblin, one of the series most infamous villains. their final confrontation is staged to be suspenseful but is anything but.the movie's lesson:with great power comes great responsibility. sam raimi(who is not a stranger to superhero films with Darkman) seems to have slapped the movie together and goes for the wrong vibe by putting in too many stupid action scenes instead of developing the characters and the story/plot. the actors do the best they can with what they have been given but the movie falls too short. spider-man is an unenternaining slog through cartoonish action sequences and a thin story."	2.0	Get some bug spray	2003-07-04	14	2	12
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1A4DEENGHK51T	Alan Attebery	"There's a reason that ""Spider-Man"" broke all kinds of box office records in the United States on its way to grossing just over $800 million dollards world wide.For starters, Spider-Man is one of the most popular comic book super heroes of all time. Almost everyone can somehow relate to the struggles that Peter Parker faces. Most of us can associate with feeling like you are living a dual-life. And besides, just how cool would it be to be able to crawl up walls and shoot webs from our hands.Another reason is that ""Spider-Man"" almost faithfully adapts the story of our hero from the small pages to the big screen. There are minor changes, but nothing that alters what the story is about or who the characters are.Yet another reason is because of the terrific action in the movie. The CGI and special effects in the action sequences were nothing short of amazing.And still another reason is the romance in the movie. It made it easier for the guys to ask their girls to go watch the movie with them.""Spider-Man"" is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of all time. Despite initial concerns, Tobey Maguire is very convincing as our conflicted hero. Kirstin Dunst, as always, was excellent, and casting William DaFoe as the Green Goblin was nothing short of brilliant.This DVD edition comes packed with hours of extra, much of which most people won't care about. However, the ""making of"" and ""E! Entertainment"" specials are worth watching. And for the fans of the comic books, there is an entire section of the 2nd DVD devoted to the history of the Spider-Man comics, including the loves of Peter Parker."	5.0	He's Amazing	2002-11-13	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1TUZL12O7X1A9	Alexander G.	I liked this movie But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them.Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I just think it is a little bit overrated. It needs some tweaking, so I'll give it 7/10.Blu-Ray Quality is Great.	4.0	Good, but not THAT good!	2014-01-24	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1CPHQWW51G0YG	Alexander Usoltsev	Well. What do we have? Just another movie based on the books of comics? Just another variation of Superman and X-men? In some way - the answer is YES. Cause such books have a lot in common. ButBut it is completely different. The main hero is not Superman or Batman. He is Spider-Man.This movie is made in a very cool way. It is really fun. There is some romance here. It is not stupid as some other movies of such a kind. Director is really talented man with a great sense of humor. Actors and their characters are wonderful.And besides everything - this is a story with a long long history. This is a story about the great battle of light and darkness. Who will win in this battle? The answer which gave us Spider-Man is LIGHT. So if U dont like this film just think about this thought. And PLEASE dont abuse this cool movie anyway.	4.0	Matrix, Forrest Gump, Spider-Man	2002-05-02	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"Even though I am not a comic book-based movie fan, I really enjoyed Sam Raimi's fun and reverent adaptation of Stan Lee's web-spinning, wall-crawling Spider-Man.I have to admit that I did not see this movie in my local cinema.  At the time I was saving my limited movie-going funds for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which opened two weeks after Spider-Man.  I was also leery of having to pay to see a comic-book movie adaptation. I had loved the first two Superman movies, missed the third entirely until it came on TV (and hated it), saw the laughable Superman IV turkey, then had been further disappointed by the Batman franchise.  I did see the 2000 X-Men feature  film, but only because my best friend Rogers loaned me his DVD.Even so, the critical reviews on Time and elsewhere had given Spider-Man a pretty good ""buzz,"" so when another friend asked me what I wanted for the holidays, so I requested the Wide-screen Special Edition.My friends, this movie and its DVD version do not disappoint!  Like Richard Donner did in the first Superman feature film, director Sam Raimi gives us a reverent ""origins of' story that fairly captures Stan Lee's original storyline.The screenplay by David (Jurassic Park) Koepp introduces us to Peter Parker, a nerdy high school senior who is not very popular.  As played by Tobey (Pleasantville) Maguire, Peter represents the vast majority of teenage boys who excel academically yet, because they aren't socially skilled or good looking, are teased or even ostracized by their fellow students.  If you watch the opening scene where Peter has to run after the school bus, you'll understand.Spider-Man is really the intertwined tale of the origins of both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, a.k.a. Norman Osborn.  As played by the talented Willem (Platoon) Dafoe, Osborne is a charismatic yet ambitious scientist who wants to get a military contract for a ""super soldier.""  With a physical enhancement formula, a technically advanced armored suit, and a neat-o powered glider, this super soldier will, hopefully, give Osborn's OsCorp billions in funding, and establish Norman as a visionary entrepreneur.However, this being a comic book adaptation, is a recipe for disaster.  When one of his top scientists warns Norman that the formula needs to be researched further (which would mean missing the Pentagon's deadline for bids) and warns of really nasty side effects, Osborn decides to test the formula on himself.  And before you can say Dr. Jekyll, poor Norman - as the soon-to-be-departed scientific naysayer predicted - goes suddenly and tragically insane.Meanwhile, while on a field trip to Columbia University, Peter Parker has his own rendezvous with destiny with a genetically altered super-spider.  (This is just one of a few ""re-imaginings"" of the original Spider-Man concept.  In the comic book premiere issue of 1962, the spider had been affected by radiation - a dark little allusion to the then prevalent threat of nuclear war.  There are other revisions...more on those later.)Although I am not an expert on Spider-Man - nor any comic book superhero, for that matter - the movie is faithful to its sources.  Spider-Man (like DC's Batman) becomes a crime-fighter when crime touches his family.  In Peter's case, his motivation is the senseless death of his uncle (in the movie, by a robber who car jacks Ben Parker after taking the money from a cheapskate wrestling ring operator). Not only does Peter seek revenge for his uncle's murder, but he also feels responsible: When Peter has a chance to at least call the police to report the robbery at the wrestling entrepreneur's office, he doesn't do so because he was not paid the promised prize money.The rest of the story revolves around two plots: Spidey's clashes with the Green Goblin and his relationships with  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (Peter Franco), who is Norman's son and, according to the legend of Spider-Man, destined to become the web-weaver's nemesis, the Hobgoblin.  In this, what seems to be the first of a hopefully successful franchise, the seeds of conflict are planted in two ways.  First, Peter and Harry, who start the film as best friends, compete for M.J's affections.  Second, Harry will, by movie's end, come to hate Spider-Man with a passion.The film, like most adaptations of novels or comics, does tweak certain things to fit into contemporary culture or for dramatic reasons.  Spidey's webs, originally designed by Peter and incorporated into his costume, now are organic mutations.  The fine spidery hairs that form on his hands and fingers to grip walls and surfaces are also new inventions, as are the changes in the timeline (in the movie, Peter and his fellow teens are graduating seniors, where in the comic they were underclassmen).  Nevertheless, this movie, like Warner Bros.' 1978 Superman: The Movie, are fine examples of how a comic book hero can make the transition from the printed page to the silver screen.The DVD is chock-full of extra features, including two commentaries on the feature film disc, branching ""Web-I-sodes,"" TV and theatrical trailers, and exciting DVD-Rom features (such as Record Your Own Commentary).Even if you are not a big fan of comic book movies, this is a good movie to own."	5.0	A Stunning First Spider-Feature	2003-05-29	1	1	0

Spider-Man is my second favorite comic book character of all time topped only by Tigra, the Were-Woman. Since she is female, that means Spider-Man is my favorite male comic book character. It was wonderful having the Green Goblin in this movie. He is my # 1 favorite Spidey villain. For good reason. His wondrous performance in this movie rocked my world like never before. The acting was perfect, and so was the special effects and the stunts. Oh, and Mary Jane was just as beautiful as she should have been. Go Spidey! Go Goblin! Go MJ! Oh, and Harry Osborn was pretty funny, in a loose sense of course. Aunt May was absolutely hilarious. Anyway, this movie is as good as they get with the exception of Spidey 2.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A374SZFFJIQKYJ	Alex Toropov	If you did not have spiderman poster at your bedroom when you were kid, you simply do not have good reason to love this movie.Sam Raimi had big budget, some reasonable actors (McGuire, Dunst and Defoe), cult superhero comic book as script base, but he created an absolute failure. Plot is laughable and very childish, characters are unbelievable and what is most important, it lacks any kind of special graphic novel &quot;environment&quot;. Instead it is just boring teenage action movie. However, as it had huge success among critics and in box office, producers probably decided that there is no need for any improvement and made even worse one - Daredevil. I bet Spiderman 2 will not be any better, so I suggest to forget about franchise and enjoy GOOD comic book adaptations like - BATMAN,X-MEN or BLADE.	2.0	Boring and overrated	2003-12-24	5	1	4
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A10WCSGF78M2KE	Alfonso A.	"Since the sequel is already in the works, a review of ""Spider-Man"" almost seems superfluous. But it definitely isn't. Because, when a comic-book movie gets it right, as this one does, people should know, especially those who think of going to a big over-hyped summer blockbuster about as often as they think about going to the South Pole.This is a film, of course, in which a guy slings webs, scales walls and fights a villain who looks like a cross between the Joker and the grille of a Dodge Ram. But much like Peter Jackson and the initial ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, director Sam Raimi gets Spider-Man; he's been smitten with Spidey since he was a kid. (For his 12th birthday,we're told, his mom painted a Spider-Man mural on his bedroom wall.)To Raimi, making Spider-Man isn't interchangeable with making ""The Scorpion King"" or ""Men In Black II"" or any other big-budgeted summer movie. That fan's pure devotion coupled with Raimi's considerable directorial flair (remember the ""Evil Dead"" movies or ""A Simple Plan""?) makes the movie far better than you might expect.For anyone who hasn't been reading Marvel Comics since the early '60s (when Stan Lee created the character), Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a teen geek who lives in Queens with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris). Peter's the kind of guy who gets kicked around by the other kids for no particular reason, the kind of guy with a hopeless crush on the girl next door, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, with flame-red hair).On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically mutated spider. The next morning, he no longer needs his glasses; his abs look like they were carved out of The Rock. He soon discovers he has other powers, too: He can crawl up walls and spin webs that make leaping over tall buildings in a single bound uneccessary. He simply swings though Manhattan's concrete canyons. (Special effects evaluation: very, very good but not always thrilling.)When tragedy strikes his family, Peter stops fooling around with his new powers and starts fighting crime. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the tycoon dad of Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco who played James Dean on TV), is experiencing a super-power make-over, too. In a Jekyll -and- Hyde scenario, the good Osborn turns into the bad Green Goblin, who cruises around on a glider wreaking havoc and trying to destroy Spider-Man.Okay, it's not Tolstoy. It's not even Tolkien. But it is a picture jam-packed with swinging action scenes, spiffy spider jokes and an unforced earnestness that never becoes corny or tongue-in-cheek. ""Spider-Man"" doesn't go for the retro-camp of ""Dick Tracy"" or the brooding hipness of ""Batman."" True, the Spidey/Green Goblin battles are generic and somewhat repetitive, which can make the movie feel long. But the picture has an an energy and a self-confidence that give it a terrific movie-movie feel.Even the acting is better than it usually is in this kind of flick. Dafoe brings some of his downtown theater training to his role, especially in the scenes where the innocent Osborn is talking with his evil alter identity. (at one point, he chats with The Green Goblin's mask which hangs from a wing-back chair.) Dunst, whose work in the current ""The Cat's Meow"" proves she doesn't have anything to prove to anyone, puts some spunk and integrity in her admittedly limited role.Still, it all comes down to Maguire who is flat-out terrific. A lot of fuss surrounded his casting: what's the sensitive kid from ""The Ice Storm"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" doing as a beloved comic-book hero? But Raimi said that he didn't need to look for Spider-Man; he needed to find Peter Parker. Maguire, with his slightly crooked grin, his mild yet laser-sharp gaze and his crackly, choked-up voice turns out to be the perfect choice. He knows we root for poor, shy Peter as much as we do for Spidey in all his wall-crawling splendor. Maguire brings a pensiveness to the part as well a goofy likability and an unabashed intelligence. When things get totally outlandish, he's our touchstone.The best advice Uncle Ben gives to his nephew is ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Sam Raimi knows exactly what that means."	4.0	Spider-Mania	2002-05-31	13	11	2

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A9Z4C6SSRUL0E	A. Liu	"Despite the hype and financial sucess, Spiderman was in fact one of the biggest disappointment among the Summer Blockbusters. Indeed, the action sequences and the special effects rank at the top (for people who complained that the CGI looks cartoon-ish, please refer to the ""article"" the film was based on.) At time it even seem far too graphic for younger viewers, though audiences would not expect anything less from the director of ""Evil Dead"".For just any pop-corn movie, I would've shrouded mu shoulders and say, ""It was a good ride while it lasted"". But this is a film which was suppose to define the vision of the original superhero. With it's history, a more engrossing or engaging characters development should shine as bright as the actions. the problem is, they don't. When Spiderman is walking around without his mask on or nor revealing his super power, the film comes to a stall. We see wooden boxes stacked together being blown around by wind instead of actors. Maguire is dull, and Dunst is just awkward. Their love scene together not only generate no chemistry or heat, the lines are equally laughable, if not put most of the audience to sleep. The infamous spider-kiss (where Spiderman was hanging upside-down tounging Mary-Jane) is anything but sexy, instead, it looked dirty, even disturbing. In fact, the only person in the film who actually deliver an adequate performance is Willem Dafoe's menancing overacting.Production-wise, it surely deserve more stars. But as a movie of whole, with a story that is already fully-developed, this Spider-Man fails on so many levels."	2.0	James Cameron should have done it...	2002-12-12	2	0	2

He's a real Spidey fanatic and I had to wake him up at several points throughout the film.  The only reason I managed to stay conscious was because I knew nothing about the origin of Spider-man and was driven on by curiosity.  But we both found the film totally predictable and cheezy.  The romance aspect of the movie was played out much to much and even the promise of exciting special effects did not follow through.  The only good thing about this movie was the ever erasable Toby McGuire, who was perfect as Peter Parker.  I am a big Kirsten Dunst fan, and I must say that her acting in this movie was nausiating.

Marklin	"...with the absolutely perfect translation of Spider-Man's fluidity of motion and poses from the comic to the live-action screen. Examine the shots of him leaping from the side of a building, casting a web-line onto a cornice, whipping through the concrete canyons, soft-landing upside down under a lintel--perfect! You can imagine King Kirby's artwork as snapshots from these sequences. This really IS the comic come to life, and I have to say, ""Well done, ladies and gentlemen!"" They really did pull it off and I'm still amazed.Toby Maguire, Willem Dafoe...big names, yes, but also big acting talent. That bodes well; you can add CG, costumes, FX to an imperfectly-cast actor and come out okay, but no amount of bells and whistles can make up for bad acting (George Clooney as Batman? Oh please...)I don't know the plot (other than the broadest outlines of the origin story--I'd rather be surprised). But come May 3rd, I'll believe that a guy with the proportional strength and speed of a spider could become your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.It's wonderful when you see a beloved childhood icon treated with care and fondness, and very painful when the producers take a cavalier attitude toward the subject. I haven't read the comics for years, but Batman and Spider-Man and other great genre heroes became part of my childhood mythology. I love dipping into that nostalgic well, and I hate seeing those memories sullied (Kevin Kostner as Robin Hood...I rest my case.)Let's hope they can pull it off for 120 minutes.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AX3F504V8XX9Y	Amazon.com Customer	"... From an artistic point of view this movie is garbage since it has no merits(*sigh* no I do not write this merely to impress, I fully grasp the concept of artistry as I believe any thinking individual rightly should). The gravest of all sins committed, even above that attrocious rethinking of the classic Green Goblin costume, is that the studios saw fit to assign David Keopp scripting chores on such a major motion picture. He is an unoriginal man likely to have a boring life since he sees fit NOT to imbue his work with any noticible personal touch, rather he seems content merely to regurgetate what he's seen in other movies ( and not doubt the tenets of screenwritting as preached in Robert Mckee, and Syd Field books).The screenplay is crassly, so stupidly, so utterly banal, and shameless one wonders if in fact the writer (writers I should say...) were fully conscious of their actions , intending  to pass this off as a malicious joke on the American public. You will find, thinkers, that there is NOT ONE single original idea in the whole of this expensive Xerox. One need not reach far back into the annals of film history to see from which works it pilfered thus I will not name them, having full confidence in your film memory.The direction is boring, as is Tobey Maguire in the lead. Kirsten Dunst resgisters, but only as a non-entity. Her character was sorely underwritten.The cacophany of sound that Danny Elfman passes off as a score shows how the poor the material is, since even the man who wrote the great score to Batman cannot work wonders without first being inspired.One more grave failing is perhaps the cornerstone of its appeal to the masses. Spiderman is an 'accessible' hero( unlike Superman who is perfect for ex.). The 'accessible' superhero is an awful concept since it DESTROYS all that is worthy in the hero by giving him flaws, the underlying message being one of reassurance to the average that they may continue about their way, complacent, unmotivated to strive for greatness, since even those men we laud as our champions share our same basic failings, and may be prone to caving into temptation at any given time. This is the anathema of nobility. Sadly, it's popularity has spread in our culture not like AIDS to which there have risen many pleas for a cure, but like a disease much liked in its giving both the great, and the small a common bond.To provide a balanced review, I will write that on the plus side, William Dafoe is quite good as Norman Osborn, and is the only one in the cast who plays his role, however lousy, with something approximating true conviction. It is he alone that raises this movie 'several rungs in hell' for me; it is the only thing about this movie in which I do not find much fault.At this point you may wonder, ""What did you expect? Shakespeare""? Yes. We all should, as a collective body demand only the very best in order to recieve it. Telling ourselves that we should settle for what we're given in order to not offend others, or simply shrugging our shoulders will lead only to our film industry's downward spiral( or rather continued downward spiral) allowing for mediocorities like this to arise like so many weeds, in place of say American Beauties, or Magnolias ( which are at the very at least have a view point dictated by their authors and not everyone else, a concept rendered beautiful by our society's protestations to even a single man declaring himself seperate and of an unlike mind)..."	1.0	Garbage	2002-08-30	143	10	133

Helmed by one of my favorite directors in Sam Raimi(whom also wrote and directed the Evil Dead films; check them out), Spider-Man makes for a great movie.Tobey Maguire is genius casting. In the lead role, Maguire lets you empathize and sympathize with Peter Parker, which is missing from many other comic-based films. Willem Dafoe chews up the scenery as Norman Osborn AKA the Green Goblin. He makes for a great adversary. Stuck in the middle are Kirston Dunst(Mary Jane, the main girl in Peter's life) and James Franco(Harry Osborn, son of Norman and Peter's best friend), both of whom provide great supporting parts.What makes Spider-Man succeed, is that the script(Well written by David Koepp) and Raimi's touch take the time to develop the characters and make you actually care about them. (Not too many comic-movies can make that claim) They're layered, so that when they cry, you cry with them. Not that this film is nothing but sappy, there's plenty of action to satisfy popcorn nuts. Some may complain that CGI Spider-Man doesn't look real, but I thought it looked just fine.Everything about this movie is top-notch, and there's only more to love with the DVD, considering the huge load of extras.

The acting was superbly done, the action in the fighting scenes really captured what Spider-Man is, and while the digital scenes were slightly fake the overall image left in your mind is one of utter amazement.  Many people say that the story lacked complexity like Training Day or Beautiful Mind.  Well all I have to say is that Spider-Man is not about philosophical emotions or deep thoughts.  It is about ordinary life in which extraordinary things occur.  That is all.  That is what Spider-Man has always been about.  If Sam Raimi had done that then it would have ruined the movie.  Thank God Raimi was faithful to the comic book and did not make it in to something it is not.Also Tobey was fantastic as Spider-Man I will admit that I had my doubts but after seeing this movie I will no longer doubt that man's talent both with the emotional and physical aspects of acting.  He really brought Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life and made both characters believable.  If I thought that a comic book movie have stood a chance to be nominated for an Academy Award I say the Tobey should get best actor.	5.0	It is finally here	2002-05-03	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1VHK9A4VLJTHC	"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly"""	"Very entertaining flick, even for those that aren't into comic books or super hero's.  I thought the special effects and the costumes were all well done.  The acting was good and the story basically made sense (although there were a couple of coincidences that were a bit hard to take).  This movie is definitely worth watching.On the negative side I felt that it lacked the super ""Blockbuster"" appeal that certain movies have that make them watchable over and over again.  I am not sure that I can pin point why that is but I can make a few guesses:The villain was too ""convenient"" (who he is and the timing are too coincidental) and he didn't have any evil cohorts.  The acting by Dafoe was excellent but the situations he was in and the surrounding story line just weren't as strong.The transition from normal Peter Parker into Spider-man was a bit forced and making all the time frames work was obviously a problem.  This is also why the timing between the good and bad characters and how they meet was awkward.  Perhaps the film should have started with Spider-man being around for a long time already and simply just fighting evil.  Then Spider-man II could have been made showing the touching and romantic part of his growing up, the high school sweetheart part of the story, etc.  In X-men we just got Wolverine in action, right off the bat, and it plays better.  I don't remember a lot of background story in the first Superman movie either.  In other words, we already knew he gets bit by a spider...The romantic part of the story was on the soft side.  Does every super hero by night have to be a sucker by day?  I guess it's part and parcel of the genre but I felt it was flat on screen.  Anyway, the acting was good and I am not being critical of the performances.I recommend this movie, it is fun to watch, but it isn't on my ""got to own it"" list."	4.0	Good movie but not a blockbuster	2002-12-05	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2HGET34VBQPIK	"Amazon Customer ""starscroll"""	"Firstly, let me say that I think Tobey Maguire was a great choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He also seemed to play the typical boy next door better than Kirsten Dunst's typical girl next door. The first costume Peter comes up with for his costume is just hilarious...you'll know what I mean when you see it but the actual costume you see him in for the majority of the movie was just fantastic. Apparently they had to sew him into his costume since the seams kept on ripping - not at all surprising when you see just how agile he had to be in the role of superhero.I had not followed the comics or cartoons but found the story very easy to follow. At times I actually anticipated where the story was going, like what happened with Peter's uncle and when the Green Gobulin tricks Spiderman into saving him. I also enjoyed the scene on the rooftop when Peter first tries to use his webbing on command, when he first climbs a wall and his aunt's comment ""You're not Superman, you know"".One major downfall was the obvious use of computer animation in scenes such as where Spiderman is pursuing the criminal in the car. It's disappointing because the CGI is detectable but it would be so hard to do that kind of stunt work using real people with speed, realism and acrobatics. I remember thinking that it was looking more and more like a game or something. Most noticable on the big screen I predict that it will be less of a problem when watching at home on DVD.William Dafoe seemed to play his duel role with particular relish and I think that the scenes involving the glider would have been quite fun. The scene he does in front of the mirror  was quite clever I thought.It's also easy to see how they they are planning to do a sequel to the movie since the storyline was already written into the story."	4.0	From great power comes great responsibility!	2002-06-11	2	2	0

The Green Goblin's motivation is questionable at best, though the strength of Dafoe's performance helps cover this up.	3.0	In retrospect, the weakest of the trilogy.	2012-11-05	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AW8VL5NN3GWNV	Ana Luisa Aldana	I'm married to an original web-head (original meaning he actually purchased, read and collected the first Spider-Man comics back in the 60's...I'm saying this not to be boastful but to more or less date us, he-he) so I inevitably I had to go see this movie with my husband on one of his repeat viewings (My husband, by the way, said they got everything right...he even did not mind the organic web shooter).  I loved this movie and thought it was great.  It had great writing, great acting and a great story.  True, there was CGI involved; but in no way was it overused and shoved into your face like Star Wars Episode 2 (see my review for that movie here...).  Tobey Maguire IS Spidey.  I don't know about the rest of the female viewers, but I will say this much...that kiss scene was supremely erotic (albeit was Kirsten Dunst's/Mary Jane's obvious 'wet t-shirt' really necessary?  Just the rain would have been fine).  Willem Dafoe deftly portrays the tortured business tycoon Norman Osborne who descends into his evil alter-ego, the Green Goblin, by his own will.Although I never read a Spider-Man comic book in my life (my husband is obviously the resident Spidey-Expert here in our household) I do know the words to the original cartoon series song.  It was a cool nostalgia kick (and major point score with the hubby) to get to sing along at the end of the movie!A MUST-SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN...REPEAT VIEWINGS HIGHLY SUGGESTED.	5.0	Kiss of the Spider-Man	2002-06-23	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L	"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino"""	"This, the first of the theatrical Spidermen movies was a colossal hit for the time period. Almost every actor cast did a wonderful job, save for JK Simmons, and his over the top portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson. Thank goodness he was used only sparingly. Nevertheless, this movie really hit the spot for me. Cliff Robertson was fantastic, as were all of the other supporting characters, save for perhaps Dunst. Yet that was not her fault as she was given little to work with in this movie. All she did was scream. I kid you not; she was in three situations of extreme danger within the space of only a month of movie time! Get real! The festival at Times Square, the attempted gang rape by tough thugs and last but not least the kidnapping by Green Goblin. That was too many times. The second time was contrived and written in just to exhibit Kirsten Dunst's voluptuous figure in a wet T-shirt. That scene should have been edited out.Comparing and contrasting the two films is fairly straightforward. The 2002 Spiderman was sheer comic book action showcasing a superhero recently endowed with his powers fighting a mad scientist bent on destruction whilst saving the damsel in distress. Peter Parker's parents are never alluded to, and while this kept the action centered in/on the story, it left us wondering about his backstory. Without offending the great Martin Sheen, I liked Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben the best of the two. The same goes with Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. She looks and feels more like ""Aunt May"" than Sally Field. Field is 20 years younger than Harris is and thus there is a 10 year difference in their characters' ages (2002/2012). The scenes with him and his Uncle Ben are very dramatic and emotional. I liked them greatly for their depth of emotion.The Amazing Spiderman with Andrew Garfield was a more in-depth movie. The subplot with Peter's parents disappearing gave us food for thought, as did the very end of that movie where The Lizard converses with a mysterious (Osborn?) man. The acting was just as good and I liked the romance between Parker and the cop's daughter more than I did the love triangle that existed with Maguire, Franco and Dunst. I can't understand how friends would let themselves get placed in that position, especially since Franco's character could have had (Attracted) any girl (Better Looking Girls Too) with his Dad's money!In a nutshell, I loved both movies, but the characterizations were the best in the 2002 movie (Save For J. Jonah Jameson). The reason I give Spiderman Four Stars is because of the writer's penchant to place Mary Jane Watson in too many dangerous situations. Come on guys, we are in the 21st century, women don't scream like Fay Wray anymore! To me it was unseemly, not to mention extremely unlikely for a single woman to be walking down dark streets in New York City in this day and age! No way would that happen in any big American city!Despite its few faults, this movie was a technical masterpiece and brought back Spiderman to the masses after decades of waiting since Nicholas Hammond last played Spiderman (He Too Was Pretty Good For His Time Period).A.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Growing up, there was really nothing more exciting to me than Spider-Man.  He was my favorite superhero and I literally obsessed about him.  I think Andrew Garfield summed it up best when he was asked about his role in this years `The Amazing Spider-Man'.  I mean, what little boy doesn't dream about being Spider-Man?  Sam Raimi's vision of Spider-Man's origin is inspired yet respectful of the comic series and really lends itself to being immortalized as one of the better superhero movies in recent memory.  It tackles Peter Parker's progression from boy to man really well, and while it doesn't have the same emotional weight as the second installment did (probably the best superhero movie of the aughts), it manages to build a solid foundation for what was to come.  Maguire is perfect for the role (seriously, the best Peter Parker imaginable) and the rest of the cast also fits very well into their respective roles, with Dafoe effectively evil (the man is just scary to look at) and the divine Kirsten Dunst making a memorable Mary Jane.  The special effects are solid, the action is intense and the progression of story takes centerfold in a very respectable way.  Raimi certainly perfected his mold with the second film (and then threw it away on the awful third chapter) but what he does here sets us up for a great two part series.	4.0	In the beginning...	2012-10-10	2	1	1

I was blown away by this film.  The story was great, and the effects were stunning.  I knew enough about Spider-Man's history to know that Sam Raimi didn't screw this film up.  I originally thought that Tobey Maguire, as most people have agreed with, was wrong for the part, until I learned that Spider-Man was a nerdy kid to begin with.  After I saw the movie, I realized that Maguire can play a wide spectrum of characters, and his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was great.  Kirsten Dunst was, I thought, good in most ways, but she seemed a little prone to changing her personality.  Willem Dafoe was the best, though.  He perfectly played Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, with the scenes where he's arguing with himself very believable.  He was very creepy, and that made the movie even better.  The only thing that I would have liked to have seen were more fights between Spidy and Gobby.  Altogether, this was an amazing film.P.S.After 9/11, a scene was removed with a giant spider-web between the World Trade Center towers.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen this in the movie, as kind of a memory or tribute to the WTC.	4.0	Sticks On You	2002-05-11	1	1	0

I admit the storyline wasn't excellent and it was a little predictable but that isn't bad enough to take away a star.  The special effects were amazing and it lived up to it's expectations.  The best movie I've seen this year.It's about a high school boy, who is kind of geeky and loves spiders.  One day his school goes on a field trip to a spider museum.  He gets bitten by a new species and goes home to have a sleep because he is not feeling so good.  When he wakes up he doesn't need his glasses to see, and he has all of these weird super-powers.  He turns into the ultimate superhero... Spiderman!It is a classic movie, a must see.  Everybody will enjoy this movie, and it is a movie for both kids and adults.

Johnson ""anna joy"""	"I went into the theater expecting some mild entertainment, something that was totally overdone, silly, and [not real], and not like the Spider-Man comics at all. However, I was SO delighted to discover that I had been hugely wrong.First of all, Tobey Maguire, despite all the criticism he's had, was excellent as Peter Parker. He was so dorky and lovable, I just couldn't help but crack up watching him running for the bus and snapping ""pictures for the newspaper"" of Mary-Jane in the museum. He may be a superhero by the end of the movie, but he's still a nerd when he takes his mask off. Tobey Maguire is always going to be a nerd. That's why I love him.Secondly, Sam Raimi blew me away! He didn't try to make Spider-Man over-realistic or new-millenium-cool. He simply captured the essence of what Spider-Man really is--outrageous, impossible, yet incredibly enviable stunts, the sense of victory over injustice, and all the little details down to the random passerby that points and shouts: ""Look! It's Spider-Man!"" It just had, as someone said below, this perfect B-movie quality that was completely irresistible. I totally felt like I was watching one of those nostalgic old superhero movies from decades ago, expecting a POW! and BANG! to pop up on the screen any second.This is really Spider-Man at its truest and purest.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AJJX5JJ24SU46	"Anonymouse ""anony_mouse"""	...this was a revelation! Too many comic characters just don't translate well, if at all, to the big screen, but Spidey isn't one of them. Not in this version, anyway. I was talked into going to see it by my best friend, as I wasn't interested at first...and I am SO glad she did!&quot;In spite of all you've done for them, eventually they will hate you!&quot;...truer words were never spoken. What makes both the original comic and this film so poignant is that this wisdom comes from the VILLAIN. And he's right. The articles in the Bugle are as negative as they are favourable: 'yes, he saved those people...but who put them in danger in the first place?', and the reader (or the audience) can't possibly miss the implication.Driven by tragedy, first losing his parents, then his beloved uncle (at the hands of a petty thief he, Peter, allowed to escape), eventually coming to hate his powers and the responsibility they force upon him, Spider-Man was and is the most enduring of the Marvel characters because he's not just a hero...he's a very human hero. Flawed, imperfect, always concerned about the consequences of his actions - even in the face of events that seem to spiral out of his control, a theme that never let up in the comic. This made him stand out from all the other Marvel characters, and is the reason he's such an enduring one, especially as he learned the fundamental truth of being a superhero - &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot; - the hard way. Would that today's world leaders understood that as well as Spider-Man does.I was most impressed as to how closely the plot followed the original storyline, but updated it for a modern audience. The final confrontation with the Goblin, in particular, was spot-on, even to the Goblin discovering Spider-Man's true identity and vice versa, being hoist on his own petard, his last, sane words spoken by Norman and not the Goblin: &quot;Peter...don't tell Harry...&quot;Casting was superb - especially J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson! I swear, he was BORN to play that role! He couldn't have been closer if they'd scanned him from the comic and used that to create a 3D computer model of him! Tobey - spot-on geek-turned-superhero. Kirsten - rrrowwwwllll! Red hair SO works on her! Willem - Norman and the Goblin both played to perfection.The DVD itself was superb, with plenty of extras.

What a mistake that would have been!An action film with an actual story that makes sense, has character development and heart (something Lucas' films seem to be lacking lately). Imagine that!My only slight critcism would be the cheesy costume worn by the Green Goblin (It looks like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.) and his lack of character development. As a villian, he could have been explained a little more thoroughly. He's portrayed as a Jekyl and Hyde kind of personality. It works ok, but could have been stronger.And, I wouldn't recommend taking children under the age of 15 to see it. Some of the ""cartoon"" violence is rather graphic (I had to close my eyes a couple of times) and totally inappropriate for youngsters.

"A lot of times when a classic cartoon/comic strip is made into a live-action movie, the result is unbearable. But the movie Spider-Man flowed pretty smoothly, and it had great effects that really captured the audience.There were a few things I have to mention, though. Peter (Tobey Maguire) was getting irritated that his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who was also his guardian, was being too fatherly toward him, to the point that Ben said, ""I'm not your father"" and Peter replied, ""Then stop acting like it!"" It made it sound as though later in the movie we'd find out what happened to Peter's father, but we never do. Also, when Peter accepts the last-a-few-minutes-in-the-ring-with-the-champ challenge at the wrestling arena, he beats up the champ pretty quickly, and when he goes to the manager to collect his cash prize, he is only given a percentage of it because he didn't stay in the ring for the allocated time. He tries arguing with the manager without much luck. Why didn't he just beat him up for the money? He just beat up the champ, didn't he?The end of the movie was also unsettling, even though that's what had to happen (you have to see the entire movie to understand what I mean). And by the way, there was one scene in the movie that really drove the point home that if a bully beats up a nerd, it's funny, but if it's the other way around, it's mean. Why IS that, anyway? Oh well, despite the other things I pointed out, this movie still has enough good moments to make it worth your while."	3.0	(3-1/2 stars) Good for the most part	2003-01-30	0	0	0

So many legal setbacks forced Spider-man to bounce from rights holder to rights holder before finally finding a place with Sony to deliver the goods.The hype surrounding this movie was astounding. I remember getting my copy of the soundtrack before the movie came out, and not just that, but also a copy of the ""Hero"" single by Nickelback as well. Seeing Spidey swinging over a gold-bathed New York on its cover got me even more stoked for this film.And so, opening night, I went with my dad to check the movie out, my heart pounding with excitement, the previews before the movie taking excruciatingly long.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), geek extraordinaire, gets bitten by a radioactive ""super spider"" while on a class fieldtrip as he tries to get a picture for the school paper of next-door-neighbour-slash-love-of-his-life Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Following a bout of sickness, Peter wakes up the next morning no longer a skinny geek but instead buff and tough, wondering what happened to him. Adding to the weirdness, he's suddenly able to do things he wasn't able to do before: no need for glasses; lots of energy; fantastic agility; amazing strength; sticks to walls; shoots sticky white web-things out of his wrists; can sense bad things before they happen. So, like any good teenager with superpowers, he uses them to impress the girl of his dreams, in his case taking on a spider-like persona in a wrestling match to win some big money to buy a car. While on the way there, he fights with his uncle, Ben, and leaves in a huff, only to later find out the burglar he let get away--who had stolen from the wrestling folks who didn't pay him what he was worth--killed his uncle in an effort to swipe a getaway car.Also going on, Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is having trouble with his company and so, in a fit to prove to the military his superhuman formula works so he can sell it to them, he tries it on himself . . . but with dire side effects: the creation of an alternate personality which is eventually dubbed ""the Green Goblin."" When things go sour for the company, the board of directors votes him out and Norman goes into full villain mode to exact his revenge.Across the city, Peter has learned that with great power comes great responsibility and so avenges his uncle's death by using his new spider-like powers for good and becomes the Amazing Spider-man.It's hero versus villain, Spider-man versus the Green Goblin, in this superheroic slugfest/love story/coming-of-age movie that made the wait for this flick well worth it.To be honest, however, the crazy overhype of this movie did put a damper on it for me when I first saw it. Straight up: when I left the theatre opening night I left disappointed. No that I thought it was awful, not by any means, it was just there was this lingering ""Is that it?"" feeling that hung over me as I made my way back to the car.If anything, Spider-man is definitely an origin movie, something to set the stage for more to come, giving a rich back story and atmosphere not to just Peter Parker's world, but to each of the supporting characters, even J. Jonah Jameson (who J.K. Simmons played brilliantly, by the way).The effects were top notch save for a couple moments where you clearly saw the Peter that was swinging and jumping from rooftop to rooftop was animated. Speaking of the swinging, when Spidey took you up and down through the deep concrete chasms of New York--man, you felt like you were there, swinging along with him. I heard they even developed a ""spider-cam"" for this movie. Cool. And that heartbreaking scene at the end where Peter turns down MJ? My heart bled for the guy.Do I stand by Spider-man? Absolutely. I saw it again in the theatre, going back with the mindset of ""seeing it for what it was,"" and I adored it afterward. Out of the three movies in this series so far, it's my second favorite. As for my favorite-favorite, just watch my reviews.This was a superhero movie done right, done well and done just plain cool.Recommended.A.P.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3UF6Y57Q4RBAT	Art Turner	"Almost...in the sense that it is not my belief that the creations of human beings can be perfect.Having said that, there are several human creations that approach perfection: the Tao Te Ching; Van Morrison's Astral Weeks; those incredible paintings Van Gogh did right before he died; Jack Daniels bourbon.Spider-Man is on that level.No, really. For what it is, it's just that good.Okay, I can hear a couple of criticisms to such (seemingly!) ridiculous hyperbole, so I'll take a shot at answering them.#1: ""It's a friggin' super-hero movie!""And your point is...? That's like saying The Searchers is a friggin' Western, or that 2001 is a friggin' sci-fi flick. Guys, I'm gonna say this one more time: quality IS NOT a function of genre. Just because an artist chooses to work within a given generic framework does not mean he doesn't have anything to say. Not all the great filmmakers have unpronounceable names or have been dead for 20-plus years (many of them have, but that's a subject for another review).#2: ""It's a friggin' soap opera!""Sure it is. So's the book of Genesis. So are many of Shakespeare's plays. As one of Spidey's co-creators used to put it, ""Nuff said"".****Listen, here's what I know. Spider-Man is, hands down, the best super-hero movie I've ever seen, both in terms of faithfulness to its source material and simply as a piece of cinema. It is, for lack of a better (or more appropriate) way of describing it, like BEING INSIDE OF a super-hero comic, which, fine films that they are, is more than I can say of either Tim Burton's Batman or Bryan Singer's X-Men. It's one of the best sf/fantasy films I've ever seen in my life. Hell, it's one of the best films I've seen in the last ten years, of ANY kind (and I've seen A LOT of films in the last ten years). It's a (literally) wonderful parable for our time and, I think, for all time.Aw, just go see it. Then you'll know what I'm going on about."	5.0	Almost Perfect	2002-05-09	1	1	0

A film based on a superhero is hard as well. It worked for ""Superman"" and for ""Batman"", and now, it has worked for Spider-Man. To be perfectly honest with you, I was never a Spider-Man fan. I really didn't know anything about the character or the history or any other characters. It certainly was nice going into this movie to realize that you don't need to know anything to get into it. It's all pretty much laid out for you and you don't need to be a rabid fan or Spider-Man junkie to figure anything out. Tobey Maguire plays dorky Peter Parker. A nerd who's just kind of there. During a class field trip, Peter is bitten by a mysterious new species of spider. By the next morning, Peter has gone through some kind of metamorphosis. He doesn't need his glasses and his body has gotten more muscular. The spider bite has given him spider like abilities and super strength. Things go badly when there is a family accident, and Peter then knows right then and there that he has to use his new abilities and help people. Enter rich businessman Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe),who is the father of Peter's best friend. Osborn has gone through a change himself. He masquerades as The Green Goblin, and soon becomes Spider-Man's arch nemesis. Through all of this chaos, one thing stays constant - Peter's love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). Director Sam Raimi is known for smaller films like the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, as well as ""The Gift"", ""A Simple Plan"", and others. Some wondered if he had the stuff to handle such a big, epic film. Oh yes, he does. He does the job perfectly. It also doesn't hurt when you got a great cast doing good work. Maguire passes for Spider-Man, but he's far more interesting and intriguing as Peter Parker. Peter has real character. Something to play with. As Spider-Man, Maguire gets to do fancy stuff and wear a cool costume, but all of the character and charm that Maguire gives us as Peter, quickly goes away once he puts the costume on. Willem Dafoe is a great actor. I think everyone knows that. He really makes Norman Osborn a creepy fellow, even before he turns bad. Like Spider-Man, he loses character when he's The Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst is well cast as Mary Jane. She has the sweet, pretty girl next door thing down that would make anyone wish she had lived next door to them when they were young. I don't think she has ever looked as beautiful and radiant as she does here. The rest of the cast includes film veteran Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and a small cameo by the great Bruce Campbell. The movie goes by at a pretty nice pace. It's never boring or slow. It keeps going and it's a fun ride. Pure popcorn entertainment. The only problem I had with the movie were the special effects. Yes, they were fun and really took you for a ride, but I couldn't get over the fact of how faked it looked. That's really disappointing. With a movie like this and with the way effects and everything are nowadays, fake looking special effects are the last thing you would think a movie would have. Especially a movie like this. It makes one scratch their head. The movie would of been so much better if the effects were more realistic. It's been done hundreds of times. I've seen it. What's the deal Sam Raimi?. All in all, this is a colorful and fun ride for everyone to enjoy. It joins the rank as good superhero films. It's not in the 'great' catgory like ""Superman"" and ""Batman"", but it did what it was supposed to do and it was a lot of fun. Check this film out.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A351XMJF8DCD8Z	"bart ""wwfrockfan"""	"Without any doubt, Spiderman is easily known to be the best movie of 2002.  It is the second MARVEL movie made this century (With X-men being the 1st) and has more sequels to come.  It is also the best MARVEL movie so far, Daredevil sadly didn't turn out to be as good as this.  It has a good plot and great action scenes.  Although things don't go the same way in this movie as they did in the Comic books, it is still a fun Spiderman story to watch.  Tobey Maguire did a great job as Peter Parker/Spiderman especially when it comes changing from a nerd to a guy who will beat possibly anybody up and be fearless.  This movie had great acting.  Even this special edition DVD it comes on is great.  It is packed with 2 disks and a lot of neat x-tra stuff.  Here is the movie's plot.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is probably known to be the biggest loser in school.  He has only one friend named Harry Osborn (James Franko) and has had the biggest crush on a girl named Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst) in which he has had since like the first grade.  Anyway on a school field trip to a laboratory that studies spider the scientists have created spiders which has some sort genetic gene from three other different spiders put in it so it can became a ""super Spider"".  One of the Spiders escapes and goes ""wandering"" around in the lab.  It eventually goes on to Peter's hand and gives him a big bite, OUCH!!  At first Peter feels fine, but later things feel different.  Also, Harry has a father named Norman who is the President and one of the workers at a company called OSCORB.  What OSCORB does is make weapons for the military.  Norman is working on some sort of gas that can enhance human performance once inhaled.  But soon, Norman realizes he is in one of those now or never situations where he either tests the gas to see if it works or else his company goes down.  Norman test the gas but things seem to wrong and Norman doesn't appear to be the same person.  Anyway, back to Peter.  Peter starts to feel weird but he when feels better, he notices some changes.  For starters, his eyes don't seem to need glasses anymore and plus, he seems to be stronger, make that much stronger and things tend to stick to his fingertips even when the object is non sticky.  And later he notices when danger is coming and he also notices a white sticky string come shooting out of his wriest.  And last, he realizes he has the ability to climb up walls and jump like 100 ft high.  With all his new abilities, Peter decides to join ameuter wrestling to score some big bucks.  He decides to draw out an attire which is a read and blue costume with a black spider symbol in the middle of the chest.  As he takes wrestling, his attire isn't exactly what he drew but it seems that scoring the big bucks won't be hard at all.  But when the wrestling manager decides not to pay Peter the amount he should have gotten (nor did what he got come even close to what he expected) he gets really [mad].  Then when the manager gets robbed, Peter lets the robber go feeling like he got even with manager.  But Peter's feeling change sad fully when he sees that his uncle's car was hijacked and the hijacker shot his uncle.  Peter is bent on revenge to finding the guy who did this and when he does Peter realizes something shocking- The hijacker was the same guy who was the robber who Peter just let go.  If he had cought him then when he should have, then his uncle would have never have been killed.  After that, Peter swears to have never let that happen again.  Before you know, a man now dressed in a costume, which is identical to the one Peter drew, now swings and crawls thru the city of New York stopping crime at now cost.  No matter who does the crime, he'll do the time because he was stopped by the one, the only: SPIDERMAN!  Now that peter's life has had a huge change he now faces many problems: 1, he cannot seem to hold a job cuz he is always staying up late to fight crime.  2, the girl of his dreams, MJ (Mary-Jane) is now dating his friend Harry.  3, the worst of all, a lunatic who travels on the oscorp glider decides to cause chaos over New York.  His name- The green goblin.  The green goblin is super strong like Spiderman, he likes to throw bombs, and the bottom line is that he is just completely crazy.  And what he wants to do is to cause destruction over the city, but to achieve that he must do one thing first-KILL SPIDERMAN.  And worst comes to worst when he discovers certain information on Spidey.DVD Features:2 DiscsDisc 1-Full Screen or widescreen format (for whichever version you get)-Trailor (s)-Mucic videos-Tv Spots-CommentariesDisc 2-HBO making of Spiderman-E!

It's not as campy and sappy as Superman or as lurid and pretentious as Batman. The special effects have been criticized, but unjustly in my view. They have the feel of a comic book, much like certain action sequences in THE other great comics-come-to-life movie--Spawn. Batman (the first one) is a distant third in this genre; while JOR-EL is turning in his Kryptonian grave until a new, updated movie is made about his super son.	5.0	Spiderman conquers the Comic Book movie world	2002-08-07	0	0	0

Several years back there was talk of James Cameron directing a feature based on the SPIDER-MAN comic after all the hype of his megabudget pukefest TITANIC. Finally this year the movie was made flesh under the direction of Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi, who is no stranger to comic book territory having directed DARKMAN.I was pleasantly surprised when I saw SPIDER-MAN. Apparently this is loyal to the comic book (I've only owned 2 SPIDER-MAN comics in my lifetime), but what you get is so much more than a live action graphic novel.Tobey MacGuire is perfectly cast as the nebbish high school student Peter Parker who is bitten by a radioactive spider and as a result inherits spider- like powers which he finds he has to use to save his city from the wrath of the menacing Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, in another effectively slimy performance)-whose secret identity happens to be that of one the man at the local paper he works for, which also assigns him the Spider-Man story.And of course there's the foundations laid for Parker's relationshop with MJ (Kirsten Dunst). Excellent visual effects and a story in which the characters are given a chance to develop without compromising on the expected stunt seqences make SPIDER-MAN one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3CGOPCF6FR3GS	Benjamin Seeberger	Spiderman is the thrilling tale of Spiderman's birth, his conflict with his most nefarious villain, the undying Green Goblin, and the film which describes the beginnings of his adult relationships with Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osbourne. This film addresses the ancient myth of absolute good and absolute evil, and shows how these two can sometimes become blurred, but with a strong heart can be distinguished. Spiderman includes some exciting scenes of blood-spattering facial fist blows, but never strays into unneeded sensuality and apologetic expletives. A romp through the sky-alleys of a modern American city, Spiderman remains one of our contemporary classics which will be remembered as a landmark in the American mythos.STUDY GUIDE: questions to think about while watching the film...1. Humanity: What events in the film drove Peter Parker to adopting his vigilante attitude toward crime?2. Implications: How is Spiderman's understanding of &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; an example of contemporary American thought? Think specifically about the nature of evil and the propensity toward intense individual classification when one's existence becomes threatened.3. Evolution: Spiderman was a hero born out of the 60s, springing from both the dangers of genetic manipulation and the problems of substance abuse (in the form of Oscorp Chemicals). Raimi makes little mention of the chemical abuse in the story, and paints it in a much simpler picture of the probable evil in man's soul and the strange world of pseudoscience. Therefore, it is obvious that in many ways, the film departs from its traditional conditioning while remaining loyal to the original personalities of the characters. In which ways is Spiderman the hero shown to be a creation of the contemporary age, versus a creation of the 60s, in the film?4. Realism: America has a long history, not only in comics but in legendary history, of people who take the law into their own hands. If a being like Spiderman existed, could he survive in our real world, or is he only a dream?5. Stageplay: Spiderman is classicly a cynic, an individual thinker, an avid contemporarian (someone &quot;in&quot; the times), a man of passions (versus someone who could care less), an irreligious jokester and a man who is not sure of his destiny, but lives to succeed. Do you feel Maguire fulfills this role? Some critics say he is too much of a &quot;boy&quot; to fill Spiderman's shoes, while others claim it is his boyishness that charms us into belief.

I particulary enjoyed the part were Spiderman chases that crook who killed his uncle, ther are points in the film were Spidey and the green goblin duel, and we catch up with the idea that this is like watching power rangers (who miss a flying rocket but still trip over and nearly die) Spiderman was excellent in all meanings of the word, a bit basic, you must admit, the typical ways of making such a film, The FX are effective yet there are points were we can see that its FX and not a real life spiderman.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AB0GGIQBNB36Q	Ben Milton	Wow, I have to ask those people trashing this movie if they've really read the Spider-Man comic books. Because Peter Parker wasn't a muscle bound superhero, Marvel comics heros were and are primarely Science bound heroes. With alittle bit of action thrown in, and Spider-Man was no exception. He had to fight villains while on the other side of the city his Aunt is in the hospital because of a heart attack. Tobey Mcguire did an awsome job as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst was okay as Mary Jane. And to disagree with a previous reviewer, this story is straight out of the golden age of Spider-man comics, yes they did change some of the origins. But again, it actually didn't hurt the story. The green Goblin, was alittle weak. Not too much, again to bring Spider-man to the big screen, this was Better than you think it was.	5.0	It's better than you think	2012-10-16	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AJIRBY6KZVZON	"Ben M. ""MaqAtaq"""	I went into Spiderman with high expectations for a movie on one of my 2 favorite super heros, directed by one of my favorite directors. I can happily say that I was not let down. This movie blew my expectations away. Toby Maguire is a perfect adolescent Peter Parker; Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, and does a pretty good job playing Mary Jane Watson; and Willem Dafoe is outstanding as the Green Goblin. Casting was outstanding. The costumes, unlike those of the X-Men, look like they were torn straight from the comic-book pages. Everything is presented in Sam Rami's (Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman, and Xena television series) wonderfully campy style without going overboard and becoming stupid slapstick mush. Also, fans of the Evil Dead trilogy should be pleased to know that Rami has lots of Evil Dead cameos in Spiderman, Ash's car makes an appearance, as does Bruce CampbellPersonally,I feel Spiderman rises above my other favorite superhero movie: Tim Burton's 1989 Batman. Star Wars Episode II definitely has its work cut out for it, and I don't think there is much chance that the modernized Star Wars will be able to one-up the Wall-crawler. All in all, don't wait for this to come out on DVD. see it on the biggest screen possible.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A30XWFT62RTSMS	"""bert3573"""	The only reason this film is successful is because of September 11th. Do any of you really think this generic action film could ever acheive such a lofty standing as the number #1 movie of the year if New York City did not go through such tragedy?Tobey McGuire is far to passive as an actor to carry this film. His performance during Uncle Ben's death was not very convincing especially with those forced tears.How about the annoyingly over-acted performance of William Defoe?

However, it was not.The good: Willem Dafoe, the editor of The Bugle (forgot his name), and Dunst's legs.The bad:  both the story and acting seemed extremely forced and cheesy, the special effects were laughably bad (which should be unacceptable for a movie with this high a budget), and the special effects were seemingly used JUST to be used and did not further the story or add to anything.Overall, an extremely average movie.

But this film is an exception to that rule.The acting is fantastic. Maguire and Defoe are excellent choices as Spiderman and the Green Goblin. And the story was extremelly close to the original comic origin of both characters. Something you'll find less and less of these days in comic-originated movies (see X-men for more info on that).There are really only two flaws in this film. One is the suit of the Green Goblin. He has been made into more of a mechanical character than the original. But the most significant flaw is the webbing on Spiderman himself. Although the film did a nice job of utilizing his web-shooting power and subsequent discovery of it, it wasn't orignially intended to be a natural ability. Originally his webbing was synthetically created by ""web-shooters"" which he created and applied to his wrists.But the overall rating for this film is much better than any other comic-to-film movie to date and is most certainly worth watching."	5.0	Much better than I thought it would be.	2002-11-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3UQX2JG0XTP50	bigtj5live	This film is spectacular. I thought it was a bit Hollywood, but anyways a great film. The first film i saw by Sam Raimi was Army of Darkness, which was hilarious. I then went on to see Evil Dead 1 and 2, quick and the dead, and the Gift. When i saw this though i was very excited. this film has great acting from tobey mcguire, kirsten dunst, and william dafoe from one of my favorite movies Platoon. Although it doesn't follow the comics exactly and modernizes a lot of things, it still manages to keep things drawn out and easy to figure out. it revolves around the green goblin and spider-man fighting each other for right and wrong and such, but also talks about mary-jane and peter's relationship. although not true to the comics, the relationship is still interesting to watch. i do wish the dvd had better commentary by sam raimi and the crew, like the evil dead commentary he's done, too bad. the dvd has a lot of material, but most short and boring. movies still great though	5.0	Another great Raimi film	2003-01-03	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A82MLYSUUU3CF	"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!"""	Another comic book superhero finds his way to the big screen in this amiable high-flying adventure. Perpetually adorable Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker, a geeky high-school student with an aptitude for science who is one day bitten by a mutant spider while attending a field trip to Columbia University, and suddenly finds himself developing strange powers much like that of the offending arachnid. Suddenly graced with exceptionally quick reflexes, impressive strength, plus major webshooters biologically emitting from each wrist, Parker goes from quiet underachiever to the city's hardest working crimefighter in no time flat. It seems his transformation couldn't be more perfectly timed either, because a new brand of villain in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) is intent on destroying human life to advance his personal breakthroughs in kinetic power. Kirsten Dunst does her best with the limp character of Mary Jane, a young woman who is constantly being victimized by one man or another and so seems to always be playing the same pity-me note every time we see her. It's no wonder Parker has been in love with her for so long: after all, it seems that falling in love with her would be the most complimentary way to feel sorry for her. Lack of pretentiousness and an excellent first act in the screenplay by David Koepp that allows for the best character development and personal conflict seen in a superhero movie since Michelle Pfeiffer played Catwoman is what sets this thrilling adventure apart from most of the summer fare that audiences are forced to endure, but there's a lack of power to it as well (particularly in the second half) that keeps it from being totally engrossing. This is probably due to Sam Raimi's decidedly uncommitted direction, but it also doesn't help that Dafoe's villain isn't all that scary or dedicated to an easily palpable evil endeavour (his main purpose is to kill the board members who are planning to shut down his corporation, and then after that decides that Spider-Man is his only nemesis and so tries to hurt him through the people he loves). J.K. Simmons pays delightful tribute to the original animated program with his boisterous portrayal of Parker's magazine editor, and Rosemary Harris is a delight as Parker's cookie-baking, patient and loving aunt. Look for cameos by Lucy Lawless, Macy Gray and Raimi mainstay Bruce Campbell in one of the film's most delightful sequences.	4.0	Enjoyable but not memorable enough	2003-01-06	0	0	0

Kirsten Dunst stars as the beatiful love intrest of Peter Parker, the red haired Mary Jane Watson. Watching Spiderman was very entertaining eventhough I knew what the story was. Watching it was like watching a tennis match, moving your eyes back and forth, back and forth.As far is I can see, Willem Dafoe played the Green Goblin almost flawlessly. Because of a science experiment gone wrong, the mild manered scientist Norman Osborne gets metamorphisised into the supervillian Green Goblin.James Franco plays the cast aside son of Norman Osborne, Harry Osborne. Although he doesn't have a big roll in the movie, you will see him in the other movies.The movie has an unpretentous B-movie quality that made it irresistable to any movie goer. Unlike the other comic book to movie ventures, Spiderman stayed very very very true to the comic series.

Yet I got to wonder with all the hype and all the money spent on this DVD set why they didn't work on a better Interface for the DVD Navigation (this includes the DVD-ROM as well). Even my friend said it was difficult to get around in it (so it is not me...and he buys a lot of DVD's) Small, hard to see icons to indicate where what you have selected and very non responsive (push the button five or six times and it might respond). The background commentary can be fascinating...though sometimes they fight for stuff to say. Would have liked if Toby had been part of it since he was involoved in a lot of the movie and could have gotten his perspecitve (he is the star after all). My roommate was a wrangler for the crowds and I learned a lot more from him about some of the stuff going on...so it was a bit more interesting what I got to see on the DVD. The second DVD is throwaway stuff for the most part...E-entrainment the making of (now that ought to be deep investigative reporting) and some screen tests and clothing shots (though finding out that the guy who does JJ is bald in real life was fun and great to see how he enhanced the character) So I would recomend getting the DVD don't let the interface ruin your movie going experience.	4.0	Great Movie...Bad DVD Interface	2002-11-07	2	1	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3Q6HRJBN8CYA6	Blake Man	Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes of all time. This movie was very well done from start to finish. What makes Spider-Man so darn good isn't its action or music, its the story behind it. The story is very heart warming and touching. You connect with the hero so well that its like he really exists. Its rare to find a comic book movie that not only delivers a very good story, but a touching one as well. Unlike another film I just reviewed (Wanted), this movie tells the story of a man that learns that with great power comes great responsibility.Setting the wonderful story aside, the rest of the movie falls into place as well. The action sequences are well done and exciting. I'd want nothing more than to be able to web sling across buildings like Spidy does. I loved the soundtrack to this film. The music is original and powerful, and it may give you goosebumps. The acting is very well done in this film as well.I think the best part about this movie is that it feels very complete. While there is no cliffhanger at the end of the film, it successfully is left open to continue future stories. Nothing feels rushed. Nothing feels missing. Spider-Man feels like a full helping of everything good.	4.0	Very well done	2009-08-11	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`Spiderman',`Fantastic Four', and `Daredevil' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.	5.0	The best of the superhero cinematic experience.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AO05DTP9GM4B1	B. Murphy	Spider-man, based on the comic, personifies the spider, who is also a super-hero, with strength and agility along with the ability to spray his web wherever he chooses. Peter Parker, or Spider-man out of hero mode, is a young student who gets bit by a spider and achieves super powers. Peter eventually uses his powers to fight off criminals, and those who hurt others. He eventually encounters the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe, who is his friends' father when not out on the streets causing trouble. In the film, Peter's character has a crush on a girl he knew growing up, M.J.. M.J. is our `damsel in distress' who is seemingly always in need of help, and has perfected the art of screeching for aid. Our two super powered characters are both male, one in search of power, money, and Spider-man's neck, the other, trying to attain his love, M.J.. M.J. is objectified and made to seem like a dumb girl who needs a smart strong man to save her. The panoptical view of the hero, who sees all evil, seems to also see M.J. and focus his life-saving abilities on achieving a mate. Overall the film is pleasing to the eye, and allows for critical thinking on how woman are portrayed in movies that mainly focusing on young audiences.	3.0	Spider bites	2004-05-12	10	2	8

I wouldn't go that far. Although it's better than all Superman movies and recent Batman disasters, it still is what it is: CGI mayhem with some character development (wow!) and few nice scenes for kids. It's too lightweight even for X-men (which I liked very much), not to compare it to darkness of Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns.The script is solid, and waiting for the sequel will be like waiting for the next NBA basketball season - you know it's coming, but it all depends if you like the basketball.For me, CGI Spidey flying without control was a plus, CGI spidey fighting was a minus. If it was a bit more character driven (like X-Men) and a little darker, it would be fantastic. This is compromise for the kids (an understandable one) so it is pretty darn good.So, Green Goblin is dead.

No superficial pointless plot twists, no heavy handed preachy message (although the morality lesson conveyed IS valid and tactfully done without too much browbeating), and even the sexual tension is RELATIVELY innocent for the target age group.

Tobey Maguire is a good actor, don't get me wrong.. yet he didn't have that superhuman quality that he should've. Spider-Man should've been somebody taller, with a deeper voice, and an unknown. To put a known actor in a movie about a superhero sort of trashes it in ways, like Val Kilmer and George Clooney for the last two installments of the &quot;Batman&quot; series. Every time I saw Clooney, I thought of &quot;E.R.&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot;, not the dark knight. But enough about that, the focus of this review is basically how they should've gotten somebody else for the hero besides Tobey Maguire. All-in-all though, I really enjoyed the movie. As to how closely it followed the comics, I think they were very spot-on (with a very small number of exceptions). It's worth getting on DVD or VHS, either way it makes a great addition to anyone's video library.	5.0	Great movie; insignificant flaws	2002-12-18	0	0	0

Despite a couple of scenes in which they are obviously computer generated, in which some people think that it made the scenes look cheesy, I don't think these minor flaws took anything away from the movie as a whole. The remaining effects in the movie, namely the scenes as he webs his way from building to building, are nothing short of exhilarating.The plot of the movie followed the story of the Spider-Man comics quite admirably with the Green Goblin storyline and the anticipated emergence of Hobgoblin. I think it would be great if they also included one of the better Spider-Man villains (e.g. Carnage, Venom) in the sequel (to a limited extent where it's inclusiveness isn't overdone as in the Batman movies). But apart from that, it also appealed to those who weren't hardcore fans of the comic book series and was certainly easy to follow if you weren't familiar with the details of Spider-Man's background.If you didn't truly enjoy this movie, then face it. You just don't like good movies. This had a little bit of everything for everyone. Those who didn't get anything out of it should seek a profession as a critic and make money off of their wordy blurbs and useless opinions while continuously praising those discrete low-budget movies that nobody ever cares to or really wants to go see. Definitely one of the most enjoyable super-hero movies to date if not the most. The directing was well done, the plot was excellent, good acting, great effects. Overall, an excellent flick.	5.0	If You Didn't Like This One, You're Better Off Reading Books	2002-05-30	3	1	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A29FAAQN74YHCH	Brian R. Magri	Without a doubt, this is the film that all Spider-Man (and Marvel fans) have been waiting for.  As a lifelong comic book super-hero enthusiast, I must admit that Spider-Man has always been a favorite of mine, and watching some of the past adaptations has been painful at times.  Seeing the transition from comic book to film performed so well in this case, however, is remarkable, from the special effects to the writing and even some of the inside jokes meant strictly for the comic book fans (we know who we are).  Instead of poking fun at the character, the filmmakers do what they should do when making a movie of this caliber, and that is to pay homage to the character.  People who may not understand why this character is so popular before seeing this movie will (we hope) understand why after seeing it. While it is not a literal translation of each and every comic book, it does capture the essence of who he is and what he represents.  This movie may have seemed to take forever to make, but it was certainly well worth the wait.  Make Mine Marvel!	5.0	"An ""amazing"" film"	2002-09-07	4	4	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1TONI9A0YFOD6	Bruce Rux	Genius high school nerd Peter Parker hasn't felt the same, since that genetically engineered spider bit him during a field trip.  He's stronger, faster, more resilient, and he shoots webs out of his wrists, climbing skyscraper walls with the greatest of ease.By the time he's started college, Peter's learned some hard lessons in life.  His family is torn by tragedy, and his fantasy girl-next-door love, Mary Jane Watson, is going out with his best friend Harry Osborn.  Harry's defense contractor father, Norman, is more like a surrogate father to Peter than a genuine father to his own son.  But, unbeknownst to anyone  -  including himself  -  Norman Osborn suffers an even worse tragedy than any Peter has endured...one that will turn him into the scourge of New York City and Peter Parker's arch-nemesis.This fabulous action-adventure film version of the famous Stan Lee Marvel comic book character suffers only from too much underplaying of the title character by Tobey Maguire, and not enough chemistry between him and co-star Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  Maguire is credible and likeable as Peter, he just doesn't have much fire until he's got the Spider-suit on.  The rest of the cast are fine, some even superb  -  for a single example, Cliff Robertson is wonderful in the small but important support role of Peter's Uncle Ben.  The special effects and the pacing are uneven, but overall better than not  -  director Sam Raimi is an experienced hand at this kind of movie, and keeps it moving pretty well.But the highest marks go to Willem Defoe, as the tortured Norman Osborn.  Defoe's Osborn not only gets to chew the scenery as the wicked Green Goblin, but simultaneously (and convincingly) also plays the Goblin's first frightened victim  -  himself.  The mechanical-looking costume and props of the Goblin are really incredible, and fortunately are very well-matched by those of Spider-Man, himself.Not a perfect movie, but a damn good one.  Enjoy.By the way, the novelization of this film is really terrific  -  check it out.	4.0	Teenaged Spider Battles Mean Green Machine!	2002-05-24	2	2	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AWCABX26V7MS5	Bryan Schuessler	Having wondered how some of the tricks of the trade were handled and some shots were filmed with all the special effects, I really enjoyed the commentaries available on the audio tracks, as well as the spidey pop-ups done in VH1 pop-up video fashion. For those of you who watch t.v. as much as movies on dvd/video- you'll know what I'm talking about. The pop-ups really told me some quite interesting facts about the movie and not just all the technical mumbo-jumbo, but the little things about the movie that you never would have thought to consider asking about. I watched the dvd 3 times in a row and each time it was like watching a different movie. The added features with the cd-rom portion on it are quite cool as well, being able to record your own commentary. I liked the movie a lot but I liked the dvd a lot more. All in all, for the average price you will pay, buying Spiderman is worth the buck. You can't go wrong.	4.0	Packed with loads of goodies	2002-12-31	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AZLC3D46UHOAK	Bryan Weber	This movie is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a comic book that I have ever seen. Tobey Maguire is Sensational as Peter Parker, portraying him as the outcast teenager undergoing some Spectacular changes.Dafoe portrays businessman Norman Osborn and his diabolical alter-ego, the Green Goblin, with undeniable skill and makes Spidey's deadliest foe oh-so-frighteningly believable.Kirstin Dunst is outstanding as Mary-Jane Watson, Peter Parker's long time love interest. She shows a wide range of emotion in this film, from joy, elation, and happiness to fear, grief, anguish, and sorrow.The rest of the cast accurately portray their roles, from irrascible publisher and noted nemisis of Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, to Norman Osborn's unappreciated and troubled son, Harry, to Peter's beloved Aunt May, the comic that entertained me since I was five years old comes to life in a way I'd only dreamed about.The special effects are well done, too. From Spider-Man's wall-crawling ability to his trademark webs, and the mid-air battles with the Green Goblin, you can almost feel what it's like to swing through Manhattan.Some aspects of the book were changed for the movie. Spider-Man's web-shooters are no longer mechanical, but a biological aspect of his new powers, and the Goblin's costume is somewhat altered, among many other things. But these details are to make the movie flow more smoothly, and only readers of the comic will notice them anyway.	5.0	My Movie-Sense is Tingling!	2002-05-06	5	4	1

Well... here we go again an awesome comic book hero turned into a movie. In any other case this movie would suck b***s. But this movie is rather good. A rather unique phenomena in the movie field. The end was rather STUPID. But the rest of the movie was fair, scratch that awesome. Well I think that it deserved all the credit that it got for being good.Tobey Maguire is a geek that goes on a field trip that  turns out to change his life. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider, the next morning he wakes up as a buff dude. He goes to school and starts testing out his powers. Meanwhile his bestfriends father (Willem DaFoe) makes this super artificial weapon. He then turns insane and uses it to turn himself as the green goblin. He then turns himself infamous. You start seeing him doing this Gollum from LOTR type thing going on and it is quite creepy.Well you know the rest, Spiderman and the Green Goblin face off in a big fight. It is pretty big and sweet, so watch this movie if you want to I recommend it greatly.	4.0	Enter Spiderman	2004-01-30	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	"This review will be split into three sections, they will be The Story, The Characters & The Verdict. This will give you a fair and true description of the movie and its characters and will give you my personal opinion of the movie which should help you make an informed decision on whether to watch this film for the first time or whether to stay away like you have already done for six years.The Story: Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker an aspiring photographer who one day is taking pictures of his crush Mary Jane Watson for the ""School Newspaper"" when he's bitten by a radioactive spider. After the incident Peter goes through a change and gains powers that are similar to a spider, he can walk up walls, shoot web, he gains super human strength, agility and has the ability to sense danger before it comes. One day after Peter uses his powers to take part in a wrestling event to try and win some money, his uncle Ben is shot dead, Peter discovers that his uncle was shot by the man he'd let pass by after stealing money from the wrestling promoter who'd cheated Peter out of money. Peter tracks down the criminal and through a series of incidents the man is killed for which Peter makes the decision to become a superhero, thus giving birth to the phrase ""With great power comes great responsibility."" The best friend of Peter, Harry Osbourne is the son of the CEO of Ozcorp Industries Norman Osbourne. Ozcorp industries develop weapons and other experimental devices for the United States Army, they're also working on an experimental treatment that would increase the speed and strength of soldiers. One night Norman tests this treatment on himself, but something goes wrong with the treatment and it develops an alternate evil personality that we come to know as the Green Goblin.The Characters:Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a genius choice to make and at the time he was chosen, Tobey was very much an unknown actor but he's now an A-Lister and it's thanks to his stellar performance as the troubled Peter Parker. You gain this sympathy for Peter as he's the typical geek who always gets the worst of everything, you begin to feel like you really want him to succeed in getting the girl and getting the great career being a photographer for the Daily Bugle.Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane was again a genius choice of casting as the chemistry between the two was something inspirational. Kirsten is a really good fit for this character and through the movie you expect her to go with Harry but you know she really wants the excuse she's looking for to get with Peter. To be able to convince the viewer that you're going to go in the opposite direction than is obvious for the story to progress is something special and I hope if there is a Spiderman 4 then these are the first two to get re-signed as the main characters.Willem Dafoe: I've never really been familiar with Willems work and I think a lot of people went into this movie and said ""who the hell is he?"" when he first came on the screen. After about the first half hour and after first seeing him play the psychotic Green Goblin, we came to realise that although to many casual movie goers he may have been an unknown we came to recognise that he was the perfect choice for this part.The Verdict: Many would agree that the Spider-Man character is Marvels greatest creation and the mainstream success of this movie would not dispute that in the slightest. Personally I loved this film, the action sequences between Spidey and the Goblin are intense and something that although they're minimal they get the job done in establishing the characters and the story. The relationship between MJ & Peter is at times heart wrenching as you first see that Peter is starting to win her over then when he saves her as Spidey she's won over by him. Peter becomes stuck in sort of a four way relationship and one of the other people he's competing with is himself. Because of the reason he can't tell MJ he's spidey it becomes heartbreaking to see her love struck by him and yet Peter can't tell her that he's Spiderman. This is a really good movie that gives us a great blend of both character development and action. It takes a completely fantasy element like an average man getting superpowers and puts it in the real world setting with real characters that people can relate to, this is something Stan Lee set out to do when originally creating the spiderman character and this is something that is carried on with the movie."	5.0	Excellent Debut For Spidey	2008-06-21	3	3	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1N00127IDBHD6	CConn	"When I first saw this film over 3 years ago, I was one of the very few people to not enjoy the film. It hardly seemed anything special to me at the time, and it's gigantic success was, in all honestly, quite baffling. Needless to say, I gave a less than glowing review of Spider-Man 1. But now, after years removed from it's opening, and as my knowledge of the comic books this movie was based on grows, I find myself liking this movie more and more. And thusly, feel the need to retract my previous statements about it, and submit a new review of the film.I guess, my main problem with Spider-Man (AKA SM1) originally was it's lack of sophistication and depth. The somewhat hollow, campy, ""popcorn flick"" nature of the movie didn't sit well with me...I didn't understand it. Now however, after viewing it multiple times, I've begun to understand the director's goal in regards to SM1, and, really, its beauty. Spider-Man is not a deep, emotional movie like Batman Begins or even its sequel, Spider-Man 2, would be. It trades in emotion for fun. And it succeeds excellently.Of course, at the beginning of the film, we open with young Peter Parker. A geek, hopelessly in love with a girl whom won't even give him the time of day. The real beauty of this origin really can't be observed without a knowledge of the source material. But once you are familiar with said material, it's quite astonishing. Amazingly, the first 30 minutes of Spider-Man are a near duplication of Amazing Fantasy #15 (Spider-Man's introductory issue). There are some changes to be sure. Such as Mary Jane's role in it all (in the comics, she doesn't appear until much later), and certainly plot lines that would have just been too campy for a big blockbuster of 2002. That aside, SM1 does an amazing job of bring Spider-Man's original, comic book origin to the screen. As good as, if not more so, than any other comic book adaptation yet made.The acting, one of the main sticking points of my original review, is still not all I would like it to be. While Maguire delivers a strong performance as our hero, he doesn't quite inhabit the character like other actors have in the past and present. But he definitely does a good job, and while its not the best performance of his career (Seabiscuit receives that honor), he does give an admirable effort that leaves little room for complaints. Willam Dafoe also gives a stand-out performance as one of Spider-Man's deadliest villains, The Green Goblin. Dafoe injects his usual creepy demeanor into the character, and while, like Maguire, it isn't the best performance of his career, it is noticeable and memorable. I've also come to appreciate acting of both Rosemary Harris as the caring Aunt May and the campy brilliance of J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson. Sadly however, the real weak link in the cast would have to be Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. I've always thought Dunst was a fairly capable child-actor, but as an adult she seems to have actually lost talent, as her performance in SM1 seems sadly hollow, adding nothing to the character, and hardly bringing it to life at all. Though I will admit, her character is written as poorly as it is acted. The director's GweMJ concept (the fusing of Peter's two comic love interests Gwen Stacy and MJ), is quite flawed, and seems to diminish MJ's character rather than add to it.One of my biggest problems of the film would have to be the score. Despite being a big fan of Danny Elfman, I was overwhelmingly disappointed with his score for SM1.  It seems to lack any and all distinctiveness, which a theme that sounds more like Batman-lite than Spider-Man, and a overall collection of notes that entirely unimpressive, and easily forgettable.Though may complain about SM1's special effects and poor CGI, I didn't find them particularly troublesome. While they aren't the best effects in the world by any means, they're acceptable, and overall, the actions are quite well done. Probably the best actions scenes in a superhero movie up until that point, in fact.Probably the aspect of the movie, is also the worst. The camp factor. While, positively, this makes the film extremely fun and easy to watch and rewatch, it also kills any and all possibility of it every being a ""great"" film, an epic film. This could turn some away (as it did me), but, thankfully, two years later, this ""flaw"" was greatly rectified greatly in Spider-Man 2. SM2 almost makes SM1 an introduction rather than an individual film, and this, in turn, makes SM1 a better movie in its own right. The lack of seriousness and drama is now understood, and even welcome, as it's all being saved up for Act #2 (and maybe even #3) in Spider-Man's multi-film saga.All in all, my opinion of Spider-Man 1 has changed quite drastically over the past few years, and frankly, I'm glad it did, as Spider-Man is indeed a wonderful popcorn flick that nearly everyone can enjoy.8/10"	4.0	The Cinematic Equivalent of Bubble Gum	2005-07-14	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"I'm not a comics fan (though I used to be), but I took this video out of the library's collection, and I'm glad I did.  You don't even have to be familiar with the original book to appreciate it, though if you are, you'll see immediately that the scriptwriters have been careful to remain true to it while still updating it for the 21st Century.  What's more, it retains the angsty and sometimes dark flavor for which Marvel has long been famous.  Hero Peter Parker starts out as a nerd--a science whiz who serves as the butt of jokes and small-scale bullying by the more conventionally popular boys in his high school (his only real friend is Harry Osborn, whose father Norman has long served as his own substitute dad), and whose lifelong object of worship, Mary Jane Watson, hardly knows he's alive.  Then, on a class trip to the Museum of Natural History, he's bitten by a hybrid spider that has been exposed to ""the largest electron microscope on the East Coast,"" and overnight develops astonishing powers--his vision normalizes, he gains superhuman strength and speed, he's able to sense approaching danger and to shoot sticky webbing from ducts on his wrists.  At first he uses these abilities with little thought, but when his beloved Uncle Ben is killed by a carjacker while waiting for him (unaware that Peter had signed up to ""spend three minutes in the ring"" with a notorious wrestler in hopes of winning $5000 to buy himself a car), he realizes that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" and remakes himself as ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"" a sort of one-man vigilante force who strikes out at muggers and purse-snatchers, rescues people from burning buildings, and arouses the ire of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson.  Meanwhile Norman Osborn, desperate to save his high-tech company, has exposed himself to an experimental process intended to create superhuman powers--and it has, but with terrifying side effects: he becomes the Green Goblin, an airborne mischief-maker who soon realizes that only Spidey has what it takes to stop him.  For some time Osborn doesn't even realize what his new alter ego is doing, and when he does he's terrified, but a move by his Board of Directors to force him out brings all his latent negative personality to the fore and he becomes the Goblin consciously too.  Yet there's still hope for him: his final words to Spidey are ""Don't tell my son!""Of course, the best part of the film are the effects, which are splendid, especially the sequences in which Spidey is seen swinging through the ""topless towers"" of New York by his webbing.  Yet the complex storyline and carefully studied and developed personalities of the major characters (the only one whose motivations aren't very well explained is Jameson, who seems to hate Spidey just out of sheer ill temper!) give them an added dimension that will make the movie enjoyable by more than just the classic teen-and-twentysomething audience.  Old-time members of the Mighty Marvel Marching Society will delight in its accuracy, and strangers to the Marvel Universe will be provided with a tight and fascinating introduction to it.  This is a DVD I'll be adding to my permanent collection as soon as I can."	5.0	An angsty SFX feast!	2008-01-28	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A25TDEGIPHZTZS	"chris banez lim ""Crutchead"""	James Cameron, the unsung movie director of Alien movie sequel - and who've made a major flash in the pan with the common popular shallow social market with the disappointing TITANIC (which could've done well to incorporate the mysteries within the legendary ships tragedy, than doing a love story schtick which cashes on the popularity of its stars (that the movie PEARL HARBOR gets its deserved bad-kharma by trying to incorporate its formula to sell from its movie theme song to plotlines and production patterns)) ~ was the one supposed to direct and script this movie, that fortunately enough director Sam Raimi who've done great work in his own right with the Evil Dead siries - being a fan himself came to the rescue, into near protests of Cameron's draft of idea for the film - that got Cameron sulked to create the non-notable tv siries Dark Angel.Raimi have done quite well in interpolating Spidey's origin story (first appearing in Amazing Adult Adventures # 15) where Peter learned of resposibility upon the death of his adaptive parent Uncle Ben with the Death of the original Green Goblin plotline (Amazing Spider-Man #'s 121 to 122) that could've been perfect enough (lotsa death- welp, the ingredient which makes an epic); if only they never rushed to pitt Mary Jane Watson in the part, where in the comic book Peter Paker (ie. SPIDEY himself) in this plotline have Gwen Stacy as his girlfriend instead, and Mary Jane was actually only just still around the background as Foster's best friend. The story goes that Goblin killed Gwen Stacy (issue # 121) and in the following episode of the comic book (#122), the lead was taken into the death of the Green Goblin. They should've opted to put Mary Jane as SPIDEY's leading lady for the sequel - which in fact would've given a good stretch for the movie indeed.If only the movie had never taken its shortcut, it could've been perfect.I was first turned off when I heard its the-guy-with-Micahel-Douglas who'd play the part of Peter/Spiderman, but it turned out good. As for Kirsten Dunst as &quot;spiderman's b*tch&quot; (so'd the then- child actress have told David Letterman) - well, they coul've opted for someone else to've played the role of Mary Jane Watson.The other turn off for me in the movie is the soundtrack and appearance of that forgettable pop singer - they could've really done better in this aspect (I's thinking of MN OIL, being that there've been rumours back in '78 to put their vocalist Peter Garrett in Spidey spandex costume (year that I got converted since to be a fan of Spide at six years old)). Good AEROSMITH theme rendition though.And so we now come to its lurking sequel with the leering villain Doc Ock -- smells like romance for Pete's aunt ? We'll see, unless if they'd dodge that storyline as well.Overall rating 9 out of 10	4.0	The Spider, The Woman, and the Goblin	2004-01-23	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1CZICCYP2M5PX	Christian Pelchat	A Nerdy High-School Student named Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is always had a crush on his beautiful next door neighbour named Mary-Jane (Kristen Dunst), which Peter lives his Grand-Parents (Cliff Robertson & Rosemary Harris). Which he always want to say something to her, but always ended up, not saying nothing. One Day, He and the High-School students went to a field trip on the research on Spiders, which the Spiders are actually Radioactive. When Peter gets bitten by One of the Spiders and the next day, He changes differently, getting Perfect 20/20 Vision, His muscles are Strong and Everything atleration on his Body are more much Powerful and also having Spider-Sense into Him. When a billionaire business man scientist (Williem Dafoe) gets exposed himself after accidently to an Experimental Gas, developes into a Split-Personality and He becomes the Green Goblin. Peter is actually Best Friend to the Scientist Billionaire Son (James Franco). When one day, when Peter is experimenting on his New Gift, which is a Great Thing or a Curse-His grandfather is Murder by a Thug-then Peter uses his Power to become a Crime Fighter being called:Spider-Man. When Spider-Man sees for the First-Time, the Green Golbin. Since they have two very strong different Powers. Spider-Man is nearly becoming a Hero for the City of New York and the Green Golbin is the New Villian in Town, they fight, just until One of Them is Dead. But Peter/Spider-Man has to choose his Future, what he thinks is Right for Him. Since he always wanted to be with Mary-Jane but it's a challenge, he has to choose to make it Right to his Decision.Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, Darkman, A Simple Plan) makes a strong entertaining Action-Adventure film, Based on a Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Based on Marvel Comics. Raimi does tribute to his Earlier Movie, including:Darkman, which his lastest movie does have some Familiarity with Darkman, which it was a Comic Book Style Flick before it becomes a Short-Lived Comic. This has a Smart Screenplay by David Koepp (Carlito's Way, Jurassic Park, the Panic Room), which is often Funny and at times-Campy (Although Screen-Writer Alvin Sargent & Scott Rosenberg did some Re-Writing for the Movie). Terrific Score by Danny Elfman and the Visual Effects supervised by Oscar-Winner:John Dykstra are One of the Few Highlighs of the Film. Tobey Maguire is just Perfect as the Lead in this Flick (Although James Franco did auditioned to Play-Peter Parker). Williem Dafoe is Fun as the Villian of the Movie. The Supporting Cast are Wonderful. (This film recieves Two Oscar Nominations for Best Sound & Best Visual Effects.) DVD has an terrific Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (On different Sets of DVD's). This DVD has plenty of Extras, including Commentary Tracks, Documentaires, Outtakes and More. This is all thanks to Sam Raimi, since he knew, the way-Spider Man should be done. It's Well Made and also Memorable Flick. Watch for Bruce Campbell, Randy (Macho Man) Savage, Bill Nunn, Ted Raimi, Lucy Lawless, Macy Gray, Stan Lee, Rance Howard and Scott Spiegel is Cameos.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1EO5YR1238VL3	Christopher Fama	"I saw Spider-Man last night at a sneak preview sponsored by a famous food company.  As a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I was very pleased with Sam Raimi's faithful interpretation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's character, and his world.  The writing couldn't have captured the spirit of the comic any better, and the casting was truly inspired.  Unlike so many other comic book movies, Spider-Man brought the best of the series to the screen without needless changes aimed at ""marketing"" to a broader audience.My only complaint with the film was the Green Goblin's costume.  Defoe is one of Hollywood's greatest modern faces, he can convey a broad range of emotions simply by changing the expression on his face. Yet in Spider-Man his face is covered with a metal shell which doesn't move at all.  Not even when he speaks.  This unfortunate decision, the only bankrupt concept inherited from the Batman films, mutes Defoes effectiveness as the Goblin right when needed most.  I found myself wishing he confronted Spider-Man as Norman Osborn rather than the lifeless robot impersonating the Green Goblin."	4.0	An Amazing Spider-Man Movie	2002-05-01	29	23	6
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A81UC9NWP39KI	Christopher H. Jansmann	"There is good reason that Spider-Man is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe.  Unlike many of his ""peers,"" Spider-Man is a fully developed character with depth and background... both of which (in the proper context) make him a believable, relatable character.As is appropriate for this movie (the first movie in what will hopefully be a long franchise), Director Sam Raimi takes the first quarter of the picture to create the core character of Peter Parker, and document his transformation into Spider-Man.  Updated for today's society, Peter is introduced as the prototypical high school geek, torn down by the ""popular"" students while at the same time pining away for the girl next door who is, for all practical purposes, out of his reach.Fate steps in during a school field trip, changing his life forever.  While Peter initially is buoyed by his new-found abilities and what they can do for him against those who have bullied him in the past, he quickly learns the painful consequences of their misuse.  It's a lesson that Raimi successfully interweaves through the rest of the picture (and one that will continue into the second movie, Spider-Man 2).Raimi has done an unparalled job of bringing the comic universe Spidey inhabits into the real world streets of New York City.  He has created a visual environment that allows you to believe such characters could, indeed, exist just around the next block.  Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man; he nails the essence of the conflicted soul of the character.  Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe are also well cast, although I fear that Dunst was reduced to the obligatory screaming siren in more scenes than were necessary.  (As a side note, she is allowed to explore the character of Mary Jane much more fully in the second movie -- thank goodness!)Overall, this movie was every bit as good as its extraordinary movie gross would indicate.  This DVD version of the film includes many bonus features and behind-the-scenes tidbits that are fascinating but sadly too short.  Commentary by Raimi, Dunst and others is extremely interesting and fun to hear; the unique pop-up commentary contains unusual tidbits that are also worth exploring.  If you watch the film on a PC, the pop-ups can also link to the excellent Spider-Man website for additional background information.If you are a fan of Spider-Man, you'll love this film.  If you've never heard of him, this is a great way to gently ease into the mythos of this extremely popular character."	5.0	Polished, enjoyable big-screen adaptation	2004-12-25	2	2	0

So at least some of you know who Spider-man is.  Now, the show was based on a character who had his own comic series, and he first appeared in a final issue of a short-lived fantasy series called, &quot;Amazing Fantasy.&quot;  40 years after that issue saw print, that same character has finally made his first ever appearance on the big screen(excluding cameos in other movies).  And what can I say?  It SUCKS.  The acting is bad, the plot is messed up(okay, so Uncle Ben dies around June, since it's shortly before Peter's graduation, and then only an hour later, it's THANKSGIVING?!  WHEN DID ALL THIS TIME PASS?!), there is no chemistry between any of the actors, the SFX are lame, and the score by Danny Elfman is forgettable(when did he fall from grace?)

I simply had to see this when it came out.Spidey is done true by this big screen, special effects fest.  Tobey Maguire does a convincing Parker as someone stretching his nerd wings with super powers.  It is especially gratifying that the origin section with its Spidey as entertainer in the ring with wrestler and subsequent robbery, death of Uncle Ben Parker is kept fully intact with very little alteration whatsoever. (kudos to the filmakers).If you ever enjoyed a read of your Spiderman comics (particularly as originally created without the unusual ""bio-organism"" costume) then you should get this DVD.  You'll enjoy seeing something as outrageous as a teenager swinging through midtown manhatten.NOTE: Even J.Jonah Jameson is done to a ""T"".

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A16EFRMJOKEI0B	Christopher Wyer	"I'm not the world's biggest comic book fan but I don't exactly avoid them on purpose either.  But I really looked forward to seeing Spider-Man on the big screen in a serious modern-era movie.  And as far as super hero comic book characters turned into full length movies, this one didn't let us down.  Fans of the old show will miss the opening song, but Danny Elfman more than makes up for the missing piece of nostalgia with his continuing creativity in the scoring of movies.  Comic book perfectionists will complain about the slight changes that they made to the origins of Spider-man but to the average fan the changes are hardly noticeable.  These few shortfalls aren't nearly enough to knock this movie down even a single notch.The casting was one of the best jobs that I've seen.  Tobey Maguire took some time off from his more serious roles (The Cider House Rules) and could become THE nations next big super hero.  Kirsten Dunst has really come into her own over the last couple years and has the potential to become a very serious leading lady.  And the casting of William Dafoe as the ""Green Goblin"" was really the only way to go.  Aside from Christopher Walken, nobody can look that evil just by changing his facial expressions.  And even the small supporting roles added to the movie.  Macho Man Randy Savage's appearance as wrestler ""Bone Saw"" made me and my friends laugh for quite a while.  And the newspaper editor, while somewhat overacting, had the entire theatre laughing at once.The story itself doesn't really need a lot of explaining.  It's a well constructed story of how a simple kid grows to become the city's newest superhero.  A bite from a genetically altered spider causes changes in young Peter Parker's life.  His vision difficulties fade and he discovers strange new powers, such as the ability to climb walls and spin his own webs.  Peter Parker aside, William Dafoe's character and his transformation into the new super-villain The Green Goblin is a main focal point.  Dafoe's collapse from the top of the corporate world was explained very well and acted beautifully.  The story that evolves is a tangled web (ha-ha) of both actor's everyday characters and there respective alter-egos and the way all four personalties interact with each other.  All in all, the movie is a well paced action flick with a little bit of love story thrown in.There are a few warnings that go with this movie.  First, if you suffer from really bad motion sickness, I highly recommend motion sickness pills as a must have before watching this movie.  The other warning that I give is for people who don't like computer generated effects.  There are several shots in this movie that were obviously computer generated and although they looked good at times, some really looked fake.  I understand that they were necessary elements but I heard a few people complaining about it as we left the theatre.  And don't worry to much about it.  None of the shots were as bad as the airplane crash in ""Air Force One"".  Just a slight warning.Now on to the comparisons.  As far as the other superhero turned movie star, nothing can come close to Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and the entire ""Superman"" series is phenomenal for the time period that they were made in.  Compared to ""X-Men"" of a couple years ago, ""Spider-man"" was a much better movie.  I can only hope that ""The Incredible Hulk"" lives up to it's predecessors.  And compared to the other big Blockbusters already this year, this was way better than ""The Scorpion King."" And although I haven't seen ""Star Wars Episode 2"" yet, my friends weren't to thrilled with that either.  So if you don't mind sitting in crowded theatre's ""Spider-man"" should be your choice for this summers earliest must see movie.The Breakdown:1.  Plot-9 (well constructed story, well in tune with the comic)2.  Characters-9 (took a lot of time to develop almost every character)3.  Flow-9 (just a few lulls for a 2 hr. movie isn't that bad)4.  Atmosphere-10 (well constructed scenes as well as Danny Elfman's music is a big plus)5.  Cinematography-9 (excellent all around effects with a few minor glitches)6.  Entertainment Value-10 (2 hrs. just flew by)7.  Replay Value-9 (well worth seeing twice)8.  Casting/Character Depth-9 (doesn't get much better)9.  Relevance to genre-9 (great comic book turned movie, not quite as good as Batman)10.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	Citizen John	I've always appreciated Spider Man (Spidey) because he's like a real person with real problems.  I loved Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in their roles as Peter Parker and the girl next door.  This was an epic movie that covered a lot of ground in Spiderman's early life, explaining how he got to be what he became.What I like most of this movie is the depiction of Spidey's city, New York with touches of Chicago and made in a fantasyland of good people and some hardcore villains.  My least favorite dimension was surprisingly a good part of the action and special effects.  I expected to like the spiderlike scenes more, but they seemed repetitious and overly long to me.  I recommend the movie but without the one hundred percent endorsement I expected.	4.0	My favorite action hero	2011-05-02	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2H2AVM0SFVV1X	C. Jannuzi	This is the best bigscreen adaptation of a major comic superhero that I've seen, much better than the chaotic messes of Burton's Batman films (though I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as Batman). Tobey Maguire's characterization of Peter Parker/Spiderman is perfect, though I do hope he doesn't get limited to the role, since he is probably the best Hollywood male actor of the twenty-something age group.Sometimes I think Raimi still goes for too much close-up violence in that sort of goofy but sadistic cult director way (as does Peter Jackson in Lord of the Rings), but overall this is a serious action hero movie that manages to have some fun. It sticks pretty close to the Spiderman many will know from the 60s comic book, but the story and conceits have been largely updated for this century.Here's hoping Ben Affleck as Daredevil (another Marvel favorite of mine) turns out as good.	4.0	Much Better than Burton's Batman Flicks	2002-10-11	0	0	0

I have loved Spiderman since my youth and this was a great film adaptation.  It didn't vary much off the real thing, something that annoyed me about the X-MEN movie.  The biggest change, and I think something that improved Spiderman, was the idea of letting Peter have web that came out of himself just like a real spider.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2BQG5VKHO33OF	"CMC ""Diamondfist"""	"Sam Raimi was the best choice for director for Spider-Man. His parents had a Spider-Man mural painted on his wall for him in his childhood, and he had the perfect vision for how Spider-Man should be. Better actors could not have been picked to play these roles; Tobey Maguire made the role of Peter Parker his. Kirsten Dunst was an excellent Mary Jane, and Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were the best as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. J. K. Simmons stole the show as Jameson, who played the part magnificently; he literally WAS Jonah. Sam's brother Ted Raimi (from Xena) was a nice surprise appearing in the Daily Bugle office. Willem Dafoe's Norman/Goblin over-the-top performance was superb, but the armored costume took some getting used to. If you look quickly, you'll see Stan (The Man) Lee making a little heroic appearance! Right from the start, the characters are believable, and the characters are fleshed out wonderfully from the comic. A great deal of time was invested in getting a costume for Spidey that looks awesome; this endeavor was obviously taken very seriously and the designers did a great job.The CGI Spider-Man was fantastic! The talents involved with the CGI captured Spider-Man's movements so flawlessly, I almost believed at some points that it was actually a person performing Spidey's complex acrobatic abilities and fighting style, but would have liked to see a bit more jumping; Spidey can jump pretty high and far, but will hopefully be more prominent when the character is older (in the sequels!) I'll have to get used to the organic webs; which was my least favorite aspect of the film. The creators decided it was easier than having to explain how he was able to pay for the chemicals for the webbing. This doesn't allow us to see Pete as a scientist, which I love, but maybe they will bring some of that out (and some higher jumping) for the sequel! More of the Bugle characters hopefully will make an extended appearance in the sequels, too.The DVD is literally packed with special features from on-screen pop-ups that display information and tidbits pertaining to what was said, or shown in a particular scene, and a ""spider sense"" that takes you from the main movie to a mini-movie when you press the proper remote button. The menu selection is a visual treat and the DVD-ROM extras are a nice bonus, from Marvel dot comics to an Activision Spider-Man PC game demo. I would have liked to see some deleted scenes, but disc 2 provides some outtakes and gags which are a delight to see. It finally took a true, talented Spider-Man fan to turn out the best Spidey production I've ever seen. Sam Raimi's love for Spider-Man and the hard work of all the talented people in this film gave those of us who love Spidey an unforgettable movie experience, and just as much work was put into this DVD edition that is a pleasure to own."	5.0	An extraordinary movie on a splendid DVD edition.	2002-11-02	10	9	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A45DMDHO56OK6	Colin	I love Spider-Man the comics, but I didn't know whether I would love the movie, after disliking other comic-related movies such as X-Men. But after seeing Spider-Man, I can definitely say that this is up there with Superman with the comic-book movies. Tobey Maguire makes a great choice to play Spider-Man. Some may think he's an odd casting choice, but I think he's perfect. Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and the overacting-and-loving-it Willem Dafoe round out the cast.The DVD is amazing; the menus are just spectacular. I loved there was actually a section on the comic book; now why wasn't something like this on the X-Men discs? The comic cover gallery, however, was a bit of a rip; I thought it showed all the covers, but it only shows a select few from a year, with a brief write-up on it. All in all, this is one of the best DVDs of the year.	5.0	Does whatever a spider can	2003-01-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2DB22MRLKXUT4	"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000"""	What separates Spider-Man from almost any other superhero movie? It has heart. Not some forced and transparent emotional nudges, but genuine heart. Peter Parker's relationship with his sweet aunt and uncle is touching and his love for Mary Jane is in no way possessive or sexualized. Spider-Man is not hardened like most other modern superheroes, but a sensitive and relatable young man who tries his best to do what he thinks is right. This may sound corny, and in many ways it is, but it's refreshing to see in a superhero movie. Writer David Koepp has a cheesy sense of humor, and many of the dramatic scenes come of as histrionic, but the terrific cast keeps these elements in check. The casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a stroke of genius. He's awkward and tender, yet handsome and virile. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is just as fantastic. She embodies the girl-next-door cuteness and is greatly effective as the damsel often in distress. Willem Dafoe is sinister and sadistic as the Green Goblin/Norman Osbourne. James Franco is solid as the troubled and emotionally stilted Harry. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are adorable as the aunt and uncle. J.K. Simmons is the perfect money-grubbing, sleaze-ball newspaper publisher. Director Sam Raimi, who previously worked on the superhero film Darkman, was very well-suited to adapt Koepp's screenplay. Raimi has a very stylized and precise camera technique, one that is match-made for the kind of swooping and constantly moving story of Spider-Man. This film rightly puts the characters first and the visual spectacle second, a tip many of the latest generation Marvel film producers could take.	4.0	Spider-Man, Deliver Us From Evil	2014-06-10	0	0	0

The story has a love base with Kirsten Dunst; some good laughs; a few tugs at your heart strings; and that vile Green Goblin made for lots of great action. I could tell by all those movie fans seated around me that they too enjoyed the show. Most were young high school and college kids. I can tell you I am no kid, I remember reading the Spider-Man Comic books when they hit the stands each month. I loved the hero then and I loved him in this movie.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3DTUMLBZCG47D	Connor J. Hamilton	For the most part, there is nothing terrible to pick on in Spider Man. However, this film fails to hold high interest all throughout. Most likely this is because the movie is trying to make a top-notch film from a children's comic book, which is not necessarily easy to do.Most of the acting is good. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker-Spider Man is not bad. He does well at portraying Peter's shy, picked on life at school, and then his transformation to a more confidant superhero.Kirsten Dunst is alright as M.J., but her acting does not stand out as amazing--there is nothing to complain about, however.Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/the somewhat overdone villain the Green Goblin, deffinitely stands out. He plays Norman well as he deteriorates from a nice businessman to a trapped man enslaved to the Goblin's intimidating mask.So far, so good. This film, coming as it did after a history of many films crammed with convincing special effects, it would be expected that Spider Man would be the same. Unfortunately, the effects here are somewhat disappointing. Especially in one scene where Peter Parker is jumping up the wall of a building, it looks like he is in a computer game--a well done, convincing computer game, but still a computer game.The character of the Green Goblin is something I have somewhat of a beef with. I would have no problem if Sam Raimi, the director of the film, had kept his mean tempermant at the same level, but his own admittance of his standing as an anti-hero and a lunatic seems to go a little over the top.With some decent action scenes and good acting, this movie is fairly good, but not the dream film.	3.0	Good, but not the best	2003-07-06	1	0	1

It will be perfect to watch the movie on DVD because the special effects will look sharp and realistic just like at the movie.Its also full of funny jokes, like Spiderman's first outfit. He starts as a wrestler, and has to make a suit out of sweatshirts and stuff. Spiderman also makes fun of the bad guy, Green-Goblin. He calls him Gobby for short, which makes Gobby mad.There's some tragic parts too. Spiderman learns a lesson when he lets a crook escape.

The mirror scene is a highlight of the film.In the supporting cast are Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, Rosemary Harris as Aunt Mae, James Franco as Harry Osborne (looking a lot like James Dean), and J.K.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	That Sam Raimi was the right director for Spider-man's debut on the big screen is obvious once you've seen this film.  His penchant for cartoon-like moments in his other films (e.g., the Evil Dead series, the Quick and the Dead, and the comic-inspired Darkman) boded well for success.  Likewise, his encycopediac knowledge of the character was not new - he'd been collecting Spiderman comics ever since he was a kid.  With such a director at the helm, and with Spider-man creator Stan Lee looking over his shoulder, it's no wonder that Spider-man the Film looks and feels exactly like we'd imagine based on reading Spider-man the Comic.  When compared to, say, the Batman films, Spidey fans must have breathed a sigh of relief that the filmakers got the character mostly right.Most of our favourite Spidey characters are here - Peter Parker (played to &quot;wallflower&quot; perfection by Toby Maguire), his colleagues Harry and Flash, the fiery readhead Mary Jane Watson, and of course Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  The film covers Spiderman's origin (slightly updating the spider bite from a radioactive spider to a genetically enhanced one).  The absolute highlight of the film is his attempt to make money wrestling, where he takes on a seriously buffed-up Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage (called &quot;Bonesaw&quot; in the film).  Raimi regular Bruce Campbell appears as the ring announcer, apparently using the Elvis hair and wardrobe acquired from his recent &quot;Bubba Ho-tep&quot; film.We then advance to the main story - the battle with arch-enemy Green Goblin, here played by Willem Dafoe, who does an admirable job personifying the villain even though half the time we can't see his face.  Likewise Maguire's Webslinger personifies the comic character using body language, standard Spidey poses, and a generous helping of CGI to aid his webslinging trips through the concrete jungles of Manhatten.  The CGI is normally not intrusive or obvious - a glaring exception being one scene where Spidey takes on 5 muggers simultaneously, where the animation is jerky and unrealistic.  Mostly, though, it's smooth and doesn't defy the laws of physics too badly....True Spider-man fans will question certain decisions of the filmakers, of course.  Most notable is the absence of Gwen Stacy, who is killed by one incarnation of the Green Goblin in the comics.  Unfortunately, we know Mary Jane will be alright when GG threatens her - the same wouldn't be true if it had been Gwen up there.  Similarly, the romantic quadrangle between Peter, Harry, MJ, and Gwen would have been really fun to see on film, if only to give actress Kirsten Dunst a break from all the testoterone-driven action from an otherwise male cast.  Maybe we'll get to see Gwen (and even Felicia (the Black Cat)? he asks hopefully) in the sequels.  Finally, the patented Spider-man wisecracking banter is somewhat submerged in overly melodramatic fight scenes.  Likewise, MJ's confidence - hopefully Raimi allows himself and his characters to loosen up as the series progresses.The DVD is quite good, with some long-ish documentaries on the making of the film and on bringing Spidey to the big screen.  There are some neat comic-book extras as well (although the navigation through some of the comic-book segments is annoying).  Of course, the film itself looks and sounds fantastic (although I have a low-level sound system, and cannot comment on the high-end output).  The commentary featuring Sam Raimi and others is entertaining and informative.  All-in-all, a solid debut for what promises to be a long-running franchise.	4.0	Fairly loyal to the Spiderman of the comics; good DVD	2004-07-11	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2W0SHGPT7O0OI	"""critic_2000"""	"Finally, ""Spider-Man"" is here! Personally, I thought it was great that they decided to do a live-action version of this classic comic book character rather than a dumb animated one, like the TV show. To me, live-action is always better, mainly though because the films looks more real. I just saw ""Spider-Man"" and have to say that it was fantastic! I already cannot wait for it's sequel, which will hopefully be released next year in 2003.If you've ever read the comic books and saw the show, then you've probably got a good idea on what this movie was all about. Spider-Man vs. the evil Green Goblin (played by William Dafeo). It's also about how Peter Parker (played perfectly by Tobey Maguire) came to be Spider-Man, and trying to win over the affection of the beautiful Mary-Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). There's a lot of action and spin-tingly moments. Although I still thought ""Star Wars--Episode II, Attack of the Clones"" was a better film, ""Spider-Man"" was still awesome and worth seeing, but basically because I am a bigger ""Star Wars"" fan than ""Spider-Man"" fan...I really only went to see ""Spider-Man"" because I heard it was a good movie and I'm really into sci-fic/fantasy/action movies. Plus, I also think Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor (but Hayden Christensen in ""Star Wars"" is hotter, and I believe, more talented!).Anyway, getting back to ""Spider-Man"", the special effects were amazing and a great touch to the film. The storyline and dialouge were strong, but dialouge seems to never be a very important element in fantasy and action films, in reality. The acting was superb, including the performances by the supporting roles. I can't wait for the ""Spider-Man"" DVD to be released and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen. I believe ""Spider-Man"" will be nominated for a few Oscars next year...I think though mostly for technical nods, if any. Probably not any acting nods, and most definitely not a best picture nod because fantasy films just don't get nominated for best picture, which is wrong, I know...because there are a lot of excellent fantasy films out there that the Oscar judges overlook, come Oscar time! Sam Raimi did an excellent job with the directing...though it would've been interesting to see James Cameron direct this, like he was first supposed to. And Danny Elfman provides a wonderful, haunting score. Elfman is no John Williams or James Horner, but he does a good job in his own right. ... All in all, ""Spider-Man"" is an awesome film and should be seen by all fans of Spidey! It was rated PG-13 for some very mild lanuage, some violence, and a few scary moments. I wouldn't really recommend it for very young children, but I think it is appropriate for people ages 7 and up.Final Grade: A+"	5.0	The best film adaptation from a comic book yet!	2002-06-29	8	6	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A14ZFUKBGTWA36	C. Schifano	"What can I say?  Peter Parker / Spider-Man was poorly portrayed throughout the series thank goodness they are rebooting.  Did you all know he's not supposed to be an awkward nerd stare into the headlights with barely any personality all the time?  Not to mention Spider-Man is a witty wise cracker?  This doesn't mean Raimi's film is not fun.  There's plenty of Spider-Man / Green Goblin action and the effects are pretty good.Overall this film is cheesy, and just feels held back.  The Spider-Man series could have been much more, instead we got a mass appeal trilogy ""all about a girl"" and less about Peter Parker's guilt / mistake over his one huge error in life.The Spider-Man costume is spectacular it's everything I always imagine the live action costume would be.I like the Green Goblin but boy could have we have gotten better.  I imagine Raimi didn't want to scare all the kiddies and box office $$ away.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	I remember when this film was first released, the immediate buzz and praise it received, and the expression on my face after the credits began to roll.  I was in utter awe, and rightfully so.  Until `Batman Begins' there hadn't been a single superhero movie that could compare.  `Spider-Man' marks the beginning of the `serious' superhero film, the film that's more about plot and relationships then about high adrenaline action sequences (although they are here in large heaping amounts).  Sam Raimi and David Koepp brought to life one of the most revered and beloved comic book heroes and did so brilliantly.First smart move was the casting choices.  Tobey Maguire was a genius choice for Peter Parker.  Peter Parker was a nerdy loner and looking at Tobey you'd assume the same for him.  He has that awkward appearance, that fearful and cautious step and that guilt written all over his face.  He plays this role perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst was also a wonderful pick for Mary Jane Watson, Peters love interest.  Anyone would have to be blind not to fall in love with her.  Willem Dafoe finally impressed me, mostly because the role of Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin) just seems like the role he was born to perform, and James Franco is good as Harry, Norman's son, although he (it this film at least) is more background noise.The second smart move was making this a much more `bright' superhero film.  What I mean is, instead of following the darker subtext of films like the original `Batman' or `Daredevil', `Spider-Man' is almost a happy film.  It never falls into camp, like the horrid `Batman & Robin', but it keeps things on the up and up, cheery and...happy.  Yes I know it deals with issues like the death of Peter's Uncle Ben and the psychosis of a said crazy Green Goblin, but the action and animation is done in such bright, crisp way that the mood is never heavy and never detracts from the enjoyment of the film.The third smart move was taking the time to really develop the main characters and explain the origin of Spider-Man, never rushing into things nor bogging the film down with `too-much' information, but giving us a perfect balance.  By the end of the film you truly care about Peter and his plight.  He's more than just an action-hero...he's a human being with real problems and distractions and concerns and you want him to succeed.  You want him to `get-the-girl'.`Spider-Man' will probably be remembered as the first of the `great' superhero movies.  Finally a superhero film was taken serious, was worked and brought to cinematic perfection, not taken lightly and thrown together, but molded into a great movie.  It breaks itself away from the mold of generic superhero action film and becomes, in of its own, a brilliant MOVIE...one that everyone can and should enjoy!	5.0	The first of the 'great' superhero movies!	2006-12-21	2	2	0

This movie was so havily marketed to young children, I thought it would be ok. I wish there had been a stronger warning as to the graphic violence at the end of the movie. It was hard to enjoy because my grandson was so upset. Television movies have a rating sytem that specifies the reason for the rating, perhaps it would be appropriate for movies to do the same.	3.0	Excessive Graphic Violence	2002-05-24	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3VXR9RQHZXPYE	Daniel A. Hart	This is a well-done action flick of a movie, and I've always liked Tobey McGuire since I saw him in the movie ``Pleasantville''...also like Kirsten Dunst in this movie, but not so sure about Willem Dafoe as the bad guy or the character who played his son. I recommend people give this movie a try, and certainly they won't be disappointed at the prices it's selling for now.	5.0	Spider-Man: Easy to Get Caught In His Web	2006-07-26	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	I had feared that Tobey McGuire would not perform well in this role after his lackluster narration for the game. Thankfully he pulled of Peter Parker brilliantly. I was amazed as to how well casted this movie actually turned out. The movie seems a bit on the long side, but this is actually a good thing. I've been complaining that movies of late have been relatively short. Its not as long as Fellowship of the Ring, but it is longer than X-Men, and that gives us more time for character development, and while I would have liked to have seen Mary Jane and Harry Osbourne focused on a little more over all the characters were all fleshed out nicely. This is a very emotional film, and I appreciate Raimi's focus on Spider-Man as the tragic hero. This is what Spider-Man is, and that is the critical point that I think that some critics were missing. Spider-Man fights to keep a positive swing (pun intended) on things. He is very much surrounded by constant negativity, and villains deliberately try to go after his friends and family just because he's Spider-Man! The problem with being Spider-Man, for Peter, is just being Spider-Man. This has been the focus of the comic book for years, and while the argument over organic web-shooters, versus mechanical web-shooters can go on for ages it works well with the film. Everything about this film is brilliantly done, well thought out, and at time so well done it is frightening (William DaFoe as the Green Goblin, arguing with William DaFoe as Norman Osbourne.) In this film you see Spider-Man try so hard to write the wrongs of the world around him, only to end up getting hurt. The tragic hero manages to keep a smile on his face and spout witty remarks just the same. The best part of the movie is how real the characters felt. It's a bloody shame that NOTHING about the CGI animations looked or felt real. With as real as the characters felt, the lackluster videogame looking CGI animations worked against the over all film, and in many instances an easy fix should have been available for the sizable budget this movie had. The problem? Probably that ILM has all of its good people out on Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and probably wasn't available to do the CGI sequences. The sad fact is that only ILM can do CGI sequences and have them look good. Every movie without ILM's best people on board has terrible effects. Which is why, were I shooting it I would have done the special effects in a very different way. It is hard, but not impossible to get a human to move that way. All you'd need to do is digitally speed him up. Also, in the first act of the film there is a scene where Peter Parker is chasing after the car jacker who killed his uncle and the entire scene is painfully CGI, and taking McGuire's real face and grafting it to the CGI body would have drastically improved the scene. When Star Wars and other movies offer stunning CGI visuals, and even Nintendo's remake of Resident Evil has such attention to detail right down to loose threads in the clothing there is no excuse for such bad CGI. The effects are the only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect score, because this could have otherwise been the best comic to film adaptation of them all. This movie is a five star film in a three star package, and that's what holds it back. The worst part is that just a few minor alterations would have made a world of difference. I hope that they do touch up the CGI for the DVD. If not then lets hope that the sequel will have better effects.	4.0	If only the special effects were good as the movie itself!	2002-05-06	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2	"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru"""	"I always liked the Spider-Man comics.  Spider-Man (& his alter ego, Peter Parker) is portrayed as an ordinary guy struggling to balance superheroics with the real world.  This is in contrast with D.C.'s Batman comics where Bruce Wayne, as a millionaire, has no financial concerns, and Superman, where his job as a mild mannered reporter helps put him where he is most needed.  But I always had reservations about some parts of the Spider-man origin story.  In the comic book, after Peter Parker acquires his Spider powers, he becomes a professional wrestler (like in the film), but he garners some fame and fortune and when the robber runs past he doesn't stop the crook simply because he didn't feel it was his job.  The movie pointedly gave Peter Parker a motive for letting the robber go.  Later in the comic that very same robber breaks into Peter's house and murders his Uncle Ben.  This struck me as a severe plot contrivance which was lessened in the film by having this villain kill Uncle Ben in a carjacking.When I read about the talent behind this movie I was excited.  Sam Raimi has impressed me ever since Evil Dead 1, Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst were also perfectly cast.  And when I watched the movie they did not disapoint.  The romance between them is the most stirring part of the movie.This movie possesses a spirit similar to Superman: The Movie, even if it lacks that film's epic quality. There are parrellels to Superman.  Both are mild-mannered in their alter egos, both work for a newspaper -- Clark Kent as a reporter, Peter Parker as a freelance photographer, both have loudmouthed editors, although Perry White is a supporter of Superman, while J. Jonah Jameson loathes Spider-Man (J.K. Simmons in a terrific performance).  But the plot of Superman is grander, beginning on Krypton, going to Smallville, Metropolis and for the climax all over the U.S. while Spider-Man keeps itself firmly in New York and is divided into 2 distinct acts; pre-graduation, and post-graduation.This film has some great acting and humorous, stylish direction with a few visual cues lifted from the Batman & Superman movies which feel more like homages than rip-offs.The plot is a basic origin/first adventure narrative.  We are introduced to Peter Parker, shy high school senior, on his way to a field trip where he gets bitten by a geneticly enhanced spider giving him super powers, which he at first wants to use for profit, but then, after tragedy strikes, he uses it to do ggod deeds.Simultaneous to Peter's transformation, his best friend's father, Norman Osborn, is conducting tests on himself to turn himself into a super soldier.  These experiments cause him to go insane and become the Green Goblin.Naturally it is only a matter of time before super hero and super villain meet.Another refreshing elemnt of this movie is that the origins are kept seperate, unlike so many other super hero movies where the villains and the heroes are involved in creating each other.  Spider-Man has no direct involvement in the creation of the Green Goblin, and the Green Goblin is not involved in Spider-Man's development.The only liablilty this movie has is in the visual effects.  When Superman was released it came with the tag line ""You will belive a man can fly.""  They spent that much time on the special effects to make certain the the flying scenes looked realistic.  In Spider-Man, though, the web-swinging moments are obviously computer animated, resembling a computer game more than a feature film, as though Sam Raimi didn't care much about the effects either.Thankfully the human element of the movie saves the day, keeping it compelling to allow me to suspend my disbelief through these more awkward special effects sequences."	5.0	Spiderman	2002-11-30	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2PDC6SESC021Q	Daniel	I've gotta admit, I didn't expect [spiderman] to be such a hit, I also didn't expect it to be such a phenemonemon.  My expectations were wrong.  Spiderman is probably one f the best movies I have seen in agood while.  It is a great mix of action, romance, action, and drama.  Tobey MAguire was just born to be spiderman.  he is a great actor.  Also this DVD is a great example of a DVD player.  It is loaded to the brim with special features, and DVD rom features.  The special affects are just plain and simpley absoulutely beautiful!  It is some of the greatest affects of all time(although not pioneering)  All in all I would reccomend any comic book fan, or anybody else to come and see this wondeful movie.  I can't wait for the sequel.~Daniel~	5.0	...	2002-11-05	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1GALZCXD8FHOR	Daniel L Edelen	"""Spiderman""-  a film eighteen years in arriving according to the director's commentary - is worth waiting for. Rather than give a long-winded, hard to follow review, I'll keep to the highlights -Just perfect:1) The movie itself. Director Sam Raimi (of ""Evil Dead"", ""A Simple Plan"",  ""Darkman"", ""Xena"", and ""Hercules"" fame) nails the film dead-on. The look and feel of the settings, the choices of shots, the comic book feel, and editing are top notch. He manages to draw out the best in the characters and the actors who play them. As is noted several times in the commentary tracks, Raimi chose characterizations over action, and I believe that is what separates ""Spiderman"" from so many other films in the Action genre. The characters are real and people you can identify with.2) Casting and acting. Fans groaned at some of the casting choices, but the actors were perfect. Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is magnificent, capturing the difficult inner conflicts of the character. The final scene in which his inner dialog plays out perfectly matches the subtle expression changes on his face. Kirsten Dunst was a concern for me as Mary Jane, but brought a lively interpretation to the role. Willem Dafoe looks like a villain, even without a mask, but still was warm when his character was meant to be sympathetic. J.K. Simmons was born to be J. Jonah Jameson, the gruff newspaper head. And Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were spot on perfect as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Simply wonderful casting.3) The DVD. It's crisp and lively with a host of additional features. In particular were pop-up balloons that would give info during the film, two commentary tracks - one from the directing team and one from the visual effects team, background on the Spiderman comic book (villains, loves, etc.), and some outtakes and screen tests. My only disappointment in the screen tests was the lack of tests that featured actors who didn't get the parts. That you never see this anyway - must be a contractual thing - on other discs doesn't make this lack unusual, only missed.4) Sound. The DVD's sound options were pleasantly distinct. The dialog boost option worked wonderfully, much better than on some other DVDs I've seen.5) Faithfulness to the source. Best of all, the movie itself is true to the comic. They felt little need to mess around with the history of Spiderman. There are a few modifications, but they are unobtrusive and make sense. Thank you for not screwing Spiderman fans!Mixed:1) Spotty visual effects. Some of the CG effects looked like CG effects. The run across the rooftops was stilted. Others were brilliant. Case in point, the battle scene in the burning apartment. The commentary by the visual effects team noted that the CG of Spiderman avoiding weapons thrown by the Green Goblin fooled everyone, even other effects team members. Additionally, the commentary noted hundreds of spots where CG work was used that went completely unnoticed by me and certainly other viewers. That these were so seamless speaks well of the effects crew. Now if other parts can only be fixed up for the next film....2) Deleted scenes. The visual effects team made note of hundreds of effects and scenes that were left on the cutting room floor. However, the DVD lacks a set of deleted scenes. In particular it was noted that the final confrontation was cut down considerably. It would have been nice to see those scenes. I guess they are being held for a box set once the series has run its course.Poor:1) DVD navigation. It's remarkably poor. Tiny glowing lights highlighted sections of the navigation. On some TVs they might be impossible to see. Too subtle to be helpful. You might think you got stuck in a section of features, but the system is working. Several people told me they had problems with the subtle changes in the navigation, too.All in all, one of the best superhero movies (and accompanying DVDs) to hit the market since ""Superman II"". Definitely worth the cost to buy if you are a fan of action and superheroes."	4.0	A superhero done right (on a good DVD)	2002-12-01	1	1	0

The attention to detail in the special effects and the overall appearence of this movie is amazing. The characters are dynamic and interesting. There isn't a single lull point in this movie.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ATS7LYGLUX34L	Daniel V. Reilly	"I've been a fan of the Spider-Man comics since I was 3 years old, so I had great expectations for Sam Raimi's film adaptation. I'm happy to say that I wasn't let down....Tobey maguire stars as high-school science nerd Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider and finds himself with the ability to cling to walls, make tremendous leaps, sense danger, shoot webs, etc. He decides to cash in on his powers by becoming a pro wrestler, but fate has other things in store for our young hero. A personal tragedy teaches him that ""With great power, comes great responsibility"".Enter billionaire industrialist Norman Osborne: desperate to make the breakthrough that will enable his company to keep a lucrative government contract, he makes himself the test subject of his own strength-enhancement formula. The strength aspect works, but the added bonus is the addition of another personality: The murderous Green Goblin, who takes it upon himself to dispose of Norman's enemies.The Goblin is on a rampage through Manhattan when he runs up against Spidey for the first time. He senses a kindred spirit in Spidey, and attempts to enlist him as a partner. Barring that, he'll just kill him.....LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLEEEEEEEEEEE!!!I sat through Spider-Man with a HUGE grin on my face; It's JUST like the comic-Book. Fans will be thrilled by the obvious love Director Raimi has for the source material, and non-fans will appreciate the fact that Raimi delivers a rock-solid action movie without resorting to the usual comic-book movie campiness.Comic fans will also revel in the many appearances of classic Spidey characters such as Mendel Stromm, J. Jonah Jameson (A superb J.K. Simmons), Betty Brant, Flash Thompson, etc., as well as mentions of Dr. Conners and Daily Bugle photographer, who in the books become villains The Lizard and Venom, respectively. Raimi regular Bruce Campbell is hilarious as the Ring Announcer in the wrestling sequence, and Kirsten Dunst shines as love interest Mary Jane Watson; It's easy to see how Peter is smitten with her. Willem Dafoe walks a thin line as the homicidal Goblin, and he nevr crosses the line between insanity and hamminess. Maguire delivers a star-making performance as the hapless teen who rises to the occasion by becoming the hero the city so desperately needs. Kudos to Raimi for using real N.Y.C locations; The city has never looked better! My only beef with the film is the Goblin's mask: It's immobility is kind of jarring when Dafoe is talking.....All in all, Spider-Man is, in my opinion, the best Comic Book movie EVER, bar none! (Be on the lookout for cameos by Lucy Lawless and Stan Lee, Spidey's co-creator. And stick around through the credits to hear the catchy theme song from the 60's catroon!)"	5.0	Amazing!	2002-05-06	3	3	0

A lot can be said for the film because it appealed not only to nerds and geeks, but to the mainstream movie-goer as well.

Also The Green Goblins outfit was made interily out of metal which shoulent have been. When the Green Goblin would talk his mouth would not move because of the costume problem. Also I dont see how people would not notice a giant web comming out of Spidermans arm especcially when he is in the Cafeteria.Anyways, despite those very minor problems the movie is a must see. Spiderman fans will want to see it tons of times as everyone else will still most likely enjoy it.I Would definately Recommened it.	4.0	Marval attacks the Big Screen	2002-05-04	0	0	0

First it was Batman and then it was X-Men and now Hollywood brings out it's hardest punch (I believe) with the web slinging action flick of Spiderman.Tobey McGuire plays the part as Peter Parker the little high school nerd that is the joke of the crowd.  Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane the beautiful young women who Peter Parker was in love with since the third grade.  As the stories goes Peter Parker is living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He finds himself wanting to get the girl of his dreams and yet doesn't know how.  Parker is at a school field trip and taking pictures for the school paper.  He makes a move on Mary by taking a picture of her for the school paper as he is doing so a spider dangles his web down and lands on Peter's hand and bites him.  When Peter gets home he is very tired and goes straight to his room and falls asleep.  When he wakes up he finds that he has changed and that he doesn't need his glasses anymore and that he has gained ""miraculously"" muscle tone.  As he finds out that these powers are too good to be true we see Parker jumping buildings and climbing buildings.  As he see's Mary having a difficult time and he wanting to find a way to her heart he enters a wrestling contest and wins only  a little money and not the full amount.  As he is exiting the building though he see himself in the middle of a robbery and let's the guy pass because he see's the company as being possesive.  When Parker is out starting to go home he finds a crowd with cops and he makes his way through and finds his uncle shot on the ground.  He hears from the cops talking to eachother were the suspect is and runs to find him. This is where you see a great chase scene. As he finds his powers and tries to strengthen them there is another evil starting to brew on the other side of New York and that is the character called the Green Goblin. The green goblin is a man who was fired from his jobed and gets really ticked and wants to get even.  The green goblin's son is friends with parker and is dating the Mary Jane.  Yet as the story starts to unfold Mary Jane starts to fall for Parker when he doesn't even know it.  As Parker becomes more known, the Green Goblin tries to unite forces with him and yet SPiderman refuses and the green goblin tries to kill him.The whole movie is very well done and not over romanced and all the roll playing of the characters was very well done.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1OM5269E8J401	"Darryl M. Haase ""dothehucklebuck"""	"The new movie ""Spiderman"" proves how Hollywood over-kill can squash any sense of fun found in the adventures of comic book heroes. The movie is uneven, long and overdoses on computer special effects. The beginning scenes offer promise as Peter Parker (played fairly by the pensive Tobey MacGuire) is bitten by a super geneticized spider and metamorphisizes into Spiderman. However, the spider theme is hurriedly abandoned; it would have been great to have Parker cohabit with the anachrids as Bruce Wayne did with bats in ""Batman"". Once the villain enters the picture, the Green Goblin, the movie stretches for its plot. Wilhem Defoe is wasted as the Goblin; his costume could have been from the Power Rangers TV show and his banter with his alter-ego in the mirror is truly laughable and ridiculous. Kirsten Dunst is bland as the heroine and the viewer wonders how Parker could stay infatuated with her for so long! Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are also wasted as the Aunt and Uncle of Parker, and the moral message is simple beyond belief: ""With Power comes great responsibility"". Haven't thousands of movies and books dealt with this theme over the years? Danny Elfman's score is a copy of his own Batman themes, and director Sam Raimi (remember the 1980's bomb ""Dark Man""?) copies a scene out of Burton's film by having a bunch of giant balloons showcased at a city event. ""Spiderman"" has none of Burton's macabre or Richard Donner's (director of 1978's ""Superman"") sense of fun and tongue in cheek homage. Also, the computer special effects make people move in positions which would break most people's backs or necks, regardless of whether they are superheroes or not."	2.0	"""SPIDERMAN"" FAILS TO CATCH ME IN ITS WEB!!!"	2002-05-12	8	2	6
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	"Spiderman is the perfect summer movie.  It features a well known hero, played by a talented, well known actor and has a very good supporting cast.  Toby Maguire is excellent as the smart but nerdy Peter Parker and doubles perfectly as the beefed up, super cool Spiderman.  Toby Maguire has shown us what a good actor he is in films like ""Wonder Boys"" and ""Cider House Rules"" so it is great to see him in an action film where he can let loose and just have fun.  Kirstin Dunst is good as Peter's sexy but elusive love interest and Willem Dafoe is delightfully demented and evil as the Green Goblin.  The action sequences are exactly what you'd expect and my only problem was some slow pacing at certain points in the movie.  With the origin of Spidey out of the way and introducing Peter Parker's character, the next movie should be able to move completely forward into non-stop action.  Regardless, this is well worth the wait.  If you a superhero film, action buff, or just love lots of colorful movie making, go see ""Spiderman"".

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"What kind of movie is Spider-Man? Are you sure you really want to know? This movie is not for the weak of heart...Summer 2002, millions of die-hard Marvel comic fans were treated to seeing one of their heroes come to life on the big screen. Spider-Man. When I first saw the preview for Spider-Man, it was right before viewing my first PG-13 movie - Lord of the Rings (Another movie for another review). When confronted by the action scenes of the movie, and the grotesque view of the Green Goblin's face, my first thought was ""Ew gross, another dumb blow-'em-up flick."" followed by ""When will they stop with the previews and just show Lord of the Rings?""When the movie came to theaters, however, I checked out some of the reviews at Focus on the Family's Plugged-in website and found that, while it did contain blow-'em-up action scenes and grotesque goblin faces, it did not contain the other junk that usually goes with such movies: swearing every ten seconds by the clock, and more skin than a hospital DOCTOR typically sees. So, after securing permission from my parents, we went to see it. In case you are thinking of seeing it but don't know for sure, or if your kids are hitting you up to go see it, here is as detailed of a review as I can give about the movie's good points and bad points, from the perspective of a 16-year old Christian.In case you are like I was, not knowing about the general basics, here they are:  Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and is transformed into...Spider-Man. Just in time, because Norman Osborn, scientist for OsCorp has just turned into a raving lunatic because of his reckless Human Performance Enhancers test...on himself. Peter/Spidey chooses to protect the city of New York, and ends up in a fight to the death with The Green Goblin.GOOD POINTS: As has been said in other reviews, Spider-Man draws a distinct line between good and evil. When Spider-Man misuses his abilities and refuses to stop a fleeing robber because it ""wasn't his problem"" tragic events result. His Aunt recites nearly all of the Lord's Prayer at one point. There are several expressions of ""Thank God for you"". When offered a chance to join the Green Goblin, Spider-Man chooses good. The Green Goblin, in fact, is portrayed almost as a demon possession of the father. From a purely secular standpoint, the movie is excellent, with its dazzling special effects, allowing us to see and swing along with Spider-Man through New York City. The soundtrack music by Ben Elfman is but the icing on the cake. The story and plot are also very well formed, but occasionally poorly written. The relationship between Peter and Norman Osborn is especially interesting. When Norman is sane, he accepts Peter as a fellow science whiz and almost like a second son. (Then they both go don their respective costumes and beat each other up.) Harry Osborn, Peter's friend, tells Peter at the end that ""Spider-Man must pay"" for something Harry thinks Spider-Man did, he then says ""But thank God for you Peter. You're the only friend I have."" The door is left WIDE open for Spider-Man 2.BAD POINTS: Violence is a key factor. In an attack, Green Goblin drops a bomb-like object to kill his former employers who fired him, and, in a gruesome manner, dispatches them. Spider-Man and Green Goblin slug it out several times, as well as the mandatory explosions and city chaos/blow-'em-up stuff previously mentioned. One key character (who I cannot name) is gored by a blade, nearly bloodless, but intensely violent. Several bad words are used, but unnecessarily so, sadly. The sweet aunt tells the uncle to get off the ladder before he falls on his...um, patootie. I don't remember the D-word being used, but at one point someone makes a remark that is translated ""You are really making me angry"". Kirsten Dunst, Spider-Man's honey, is nearly always immodestly dressed, or as I like to say ""HEY! WHERE'S YOUR SHIRT!?"" At one point she is chased by four hoods who have obvious intent. Spider-Man rescues her, and they kiss as they rain pours down. Dunst's shirt gets...wet, shall we say. When Peter, after realizing his super strength, goes to a wrestling rink to win the [money]prize, there are several severely immodestly-clad women, but it's not entirely emphasized, and otherwise, there is no nudity or immorality, implied or other.MY THOUGHTS: Kids shouldn't see this movie, in my opinion. If it weren't for the bad language, and lack of clothes (""Pants don't cost THAT much, do they?!"") it would be better, but the fact is that it isn't. For those who know what to be on guard for, it's a great watch.""Whatever life has in store for me, I will always remember these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift; my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man.""SPIDER-MAN TRIVIA FUN FACT: Stan Lee makes a cameo as a citizen hero who saves a little kid from falling city wreckage.SPIDER-MAN QUESTION: If Spider-Man wears that suit, how does he climb the walls?

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"""Spider-Man"" has to be viewed as the first chapter of a continuing saga.  My reaction to having seen it originally that it was okay for a first film in a continuing series but I was hankering for more.  ""Spider-Man 2"" filled in the blanks from the first film, therefore, this film should be seen in conjunction with the second for a more rewarding experience.  Just think about the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before it's cycle was completed or ""Kill Bill:Volume 1"" before the interminable wait for ""Volume 2"".  That said, ""Spider-Man"" does a terrific job in exploring the origins of Peter Parker's evolution to the legendary web-spinner.  It's only the film's main plotline involving the Green Goblin that get's short-shrift here.  If the filmmakers were allowed to expand their work beyond the prescribed two hour time limit it's possible that this story would have been developed better.  Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man as does Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin.  It's good to see that an actor of Dafoe's calibre was chosen for this part instead of a ""star"".  Kudos to Dafoe for having to act wearing that ridiculous looking green armor.  Kirsten Dunst is fetching as Mary Jane Watson.  This character truly comes into her own in the second film.  James Franco broods effectively as Harry Osborn.  Indications seem to be that this is a character to look out for in future installments.  It was good to see an old hand like Cliff Robertson deliver a solid turn as Uncle Ben.  I will admit that my familiarity with Spider-Man is limited to the cartoon series from the 1960's.  For a novice like myself this was a satisfying viewing experience."	4.0	A Well Spun Tale	2005-02-03	3	3	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	This is the movie I've been waiting for since I was 9 years old!  Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp have gotten it just right.  The story of high school nerd Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) transformation into the powerful, crime-fighting Spider-Man is light, humorous, and filled with action and thrills.  The major characters from the comic are brought to life by the fine cast.  I hope we get to see more of JK Simmons' J Jonah Jameson next time around.Unlike many, I thought that the CGI effects worked well.  The one disappointment in this film--and it was a big one--was the design of the Green Goblin's costume.  Why did they put that blank Power Rangers-type helmet on him when they had such a fine actor playing the role?  The Goblin's mask should have been malleable, just as it is in the comics, so that we could have seen Willem Dafoe's acting.  As he demonstrated in the laboratory scene, he is capable of projecting frightening rage./	5.0	Top-notch comic adaptation	2003-01-10	2	2	0

Tobey Maguire is passable as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is appealing as Mary Jane (although I found her obviously dyed red hair distracting).  The first half of the movie works well, but at the end it just becomes ridiculous; super strength is one thing, but supporting a cable car full of people would pull Spidey's arms right out of their sockets!

You Betcha i was so amazed by the special effects of this film whe i watched it for the first time.My favorite actor in this film is Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane. Wow is she hot and she does a great job staying true to her charactor.This is one of the best superhero movies out there bar none.it raises the envelope in terms of action suspense and canage and its a little different from the commic book but mostly the same which is a good thing.Spiderman aka Peter Parker is just like he is supposed to be portrayed in the comics as a nervouse dweeb - nerd that has a tough time making new friends and getting girlfriends.All that will change when he gets bitten by a spider that gives him amazing SuPERPOWERS beyond his Wildest dreams. Lets just say Peter after  getting bitten by that Spider is never the same again. Like the saying goes change is good and in peter Parker's case it is but not in the green Goblin's case aka Harries dad. He makes a big mistake and turns into an evil dude with wicked powers.This is a nice long well done movie that is so fantastic and epic i cant even begin to imagine  how hard it must have been for the directors and crew to get this film to be as special as it is.So Sam Raimi  Directs this great film and boy does he do a great job staying true to the comic books and bringing Spiderman to life at last on the big screen. it seems these days no comic charactors or even cartoon charactors can stay away from the big screen and thats great for us movie lovers.Scoobydoo was one cartoon among a few others that was made into a movie no not an animated movie a realistic looking movie like this one. Spiderman used to be considered a superhero just for kids but this aint the case anymore. This aint no animated spiderman tv show This is SPiderman the movie which i highly recommend to fans of superhero moviesand try to remember all your'e never to old to like superheros cause they give us hope even though they aren't real cause i find that theres a hero in all of us.	5.0	A Superb Masterpiece of a Movie too see again and again	2011-12-08	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2680VQ435SSUM	"David L. Abbajay ""ferrisbueller_disciple"""	Let me start off by saying that Spider-Man was/is my all-time favorite comic book superhero. I was actually infuriated when I saw the first teaser trailer back in early 2001. Why? Because I didn't think I could bear to see the mutilation of another comic hero, ala Batman and Superman. When it came out, I saw it with much hesitation.I was not disappointed at all. Probably the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation out there, and one of the best action/adventure movies that has graced the silver screen. One of the reasons this movie has such a wide appeal, is that Spider-Man is the most human of all superheroes. He's plagued by the same obstacles in life that we all are. Peter Parker is a nerd in high school, broken family, loves a girl that is (or seems to be) unattainable. He struggles to fit in just like the rest of us do. He's human, and uses all his resources unselfishly in trying to help others.And this is why Spider-Man does and will succeed as a movie franchise. If they stick to the comic books, Peter has some of his greatest challenges ahead. He struggles to win the affections of Mary-Jane (even though she knows who he REALLY is,) problems at work, struggles to find a job and make ends meet, not to mention some of Spider-Man's greatest villians and battles lie ahead (which eventually destroy his marriage to Mary Jane.) Look forward to Doctor Octopus, the return of Goblin, and my personal fave- Venom!Here's to hoping that our favorite Web-Head will enjoy a long and entertaining movie career.	5.0	Spider-Man, Spider-Man, doin' the things a spider can...	2003-06-23	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q	David Roy	Spider-Man is the epitome of a summer action flick.  It doesn't have wonderful acting or a wonderful script, but it is interesting enough and loud enough to make it worth the money that you pay.Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  He's the perfect casting, creating a mix of shyness, naivet&eacute; and brooding after his uncle is killed.  It's hard to say how he is as Spider-Man himself, since he has so few lines.  But what we did see was pretty good.  He only made a couple of quips, which disappointed me a bit, since that's what Spider-Man is known for.  Hopefully, that was because he was still getting used to the superhero thing and will happen more in the second movie.Kirsten Dunst is a great Mary Jane.  She runs the gamut between a flighty exterior while being extremely troubled inside.  It helps draw the male audience in, of course, that she's gorgeous in the role.  She doesn't have as big of a role as I would have liked, however.  She fulfills the love interest role admirably, but the script doesn't give her much to do besides that.  Hopefully that will also change in the next movie.  I did like how the movie ended between Peter and Mary Jane, though.  It was very appropriate to the character.Willem Dafoe was the perfect Green Goblin as well.  He handles the scenes where he's arguing with himself exceptionally well.  A lesser actor would have sunk deep into the campiness of the role, but he holds his own.  The dialogue is still pretty bad, but Dafoe rises above it.  He is able to play both the sinister charm of Norman Osborn as well as the total insanity of the Green Goblin.Those are the main characters, but I have to mention J.K. Simmons as the crotchety newspaper publisher, J. Jonah Jameson.  He fits the character in the comic to a T.  He simply steals the few scenes that he's in.  I don't know if the role was written quite right (I don't remember Jameson being that cruel to people like his wife), but Simmons hit a home run with what he was given.The plot of the movie is your typical superhero action plot.  There's nothing really new here, but I was pleased to see how close they came to the actual comic plot.  There are some differences, of course, but it was very recognizable.  They kept true to the spirit of the characters for the most part, with only minor changes.  As a fan of the comics, I am very thankful. I think that had a lot to do with Sam Raimi's direction, which is also fabulous.The main drawback of the film (besides the rather pedestrian plot) is the CGI effects.  There are too many times where it actually looks fake.  I know CGI isn't perfect, but it really throws you out of the movie when your eyes register the effect itself rather than the result of the effect.  The other drawback is James Franco, the guy who plays Harry Osborne.  He had no believability whatsoever, and he was very uninteresting.  I'm not sure if that was Franco or the way that Harry was written, but it didn't come across well at all.Still, this is a great movie to see if you're just in the mood for a popcorn flick.  It's exciting, has lots of eye candy and it will entertain you.  I was a big fan of the comics, and my wife has never read one before in her life.  Both of us liked it.  That should be a good indication.	4.0	Web-swinging for fun and frolic	2002-07-12	7	3	4

The deviations I did not like included his origin, his discovery of his transformation and the romance with Mary Jane Watson...They should have at least left in the webshooters that he invented. Now for what I did like about the movie. His transformation happening over night makes more sense than the comic. His learning curve on swinging from his webs were funny and more 'realistic'. The special effects and action scenes were awesome to say the least. The Green Goblin costume was a passable interpretation of the comic, but a bit hokey. Randy Savage as the wrestler was a humorous casting and a welcome interpretation...Over all I liked the movie...it is a fine movie, but you'll find yourself longing for more	3.0	50/50 split for the comic book fans	2002-11-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A105YVLAZNYQUU	Dentallica	This movie is really really good. It reminds me of why I loved comics as a kid. The script stays very close to the original Spider-Man comic. Its cool to see Peter Parker stumble into his super powers and learn how to use them. The performances are amazing. I dont think Willem Dafoe has ever had a bad performance but he absolutely shines as the menacing Osborne / Goblin. Especially the scene where he confonts himself in the mirror -- cool! Tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker. The original comic portrayed Parker as a nerd who becomed this hero, and Tobey plays the part perfectly. Kirstin Dunst plays MJ to a tee. She is the perfect girl next door. Very sweet and incredibly sexual at the same time. The CGI looks kinda wacky at times but because of the lighting / cinematography Sam Raimi allows us to fall into this world seemlessly. Other movies that rely heavily on CGI end up looking stupid - but in this movie it fits because Spider-Man does move with that agility and speed in the comics. The movie is 2 hours long but flows easily and you are never looking at your watch. Go see this movie. I can only hope that the inevitable sequels do not tarnish this fantastic film.	4.0	Good Times	2006-08-18	1	1	0

I used to read a few, but the story lines would jump around, as the next week&iexcl;s edition would be a completely new story (maybe it was my newsagent) I was really into animation on the TV. The Jackson 5 (remember that?) was one of my favorites, as was the Spiderman series. Thus Spidey became my favorite super hero.  This film really lays it all bare as too why. Firstly here is a super hero I can relate. Shy, nerdy, intelligent, awkward, basically sums up my pre teen years. And did I mention that he&iexcl;s hopeless with the fairer sex? Could be me. This films works on several levels, but essentially it&iexcl;s a love story. A love for a girl (Mary Parker), for his extended family, and for the people of New York.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3QEJ40NQEW36Q	"Desired FX ""Call me Don. It's shorter than Is..."	And I don't mean that as an insult.  Chick flicks are well known for dealing with the internals of the characters, and if there's one thing that SPIDER-MAN excels at it's giving us a look at what's going on in the hearts of everyone in the film.I've never seen a superhero film where everyone is so human, so in that way, Raimi carries on the tradition of the original comic book series--the tragedy of a young hero with feet of clay.As a long-time comic reader, I viewed this movie with some trepidation--as much confidence as I had in Raimi the director, I still had to recognize that this one was a Major Hollywood Blockbuster, with Major Hollywood Money and Major Hollywood Politics behind it. After seeing what impact those forces had on the Batman and Superman franchises, I just couldn't help worrying.I shouldn't have been the least bit concerned: Raimi, Dunst, and--most of all--Maguire deliver knock-out punches on every level.  Peter Parker is so much the nerd that even the nerdy girls won't let him sit next to them on the bus, MJ Watson is the popular girl from a dysfunctional family with an ache in her heart, and everyone--even the bad guy--garners sympathy from the audience.In many ways, this is a story about pain, grief, loss, and the hope that can blossom from them. It spends as much time on the dark side of humanity as it does in the four-color world of superheroes, and even the hero's motivations aren't always noble.Everyone in this film cares for someone, and everyone pays the price for doing so. The story ends on a maginficent note that is at once tragic and hopeful, and if there's ever a movie that had me ready for a sequel, this is it.  It stands as one of my &quot;had to watch it again, immediately&quot; landmark films.If anyone wants to know how superhero movies should be done, they should call Sam Raimi.  With this film, he establishes himself as the foremost expert in the genre.	5.0	Hm...is this the first superhero chick flick?	2002-11-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8	Desmond Chan	An excursion to Columbia University science lab transforms the bespectacled Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) with miraculous vision, sculpted body after a genetically-altered spider bits him. He possesses agility in leaping from skyscrapers and can spin webs from his wrist. Henceforth he assumes the identity Spider-man to combat evil manifested in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), a Species-look-alike perpetrator that terrrorizes the city with a glider that drops bombs.Spider-Man embodies the heroics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who had graced the popular Marvel Comics to become an comic icon as a crime-buster - and now the film further increases the fanaticism. It is a US 140 million blockbuster and gaudy with sleek costumes and galvanizing stunts. It is digitally-enhanced F/X to capture panoramic swings in its most realistic and The Times Square action-sequence is one of the most dazzling in cinematic history.Yet the superhero adventure fails to surprise because of its conventional storyline of good-vs-evil. The self-discovery and mutation renders so much punch that the second-half falls relatively lack-lustre. Fortunately Spider-Man spins a complex web of humanity and empathy for the characters - and Tobey Maguire as the lead is the emotional core who captivates with his vulnerability in handling his growth traumas, doubts and fears. No less sterling is Willem Dafoe who is all hysterics and maniacal in his split personality inherited from the aftermath of a blundered experiment. Kirsten Dunst as his love-interest Mary Jane, James Franco as his buddy and even his uncle Ben played by Cliff Robertson show surprising dimensions.Spider-Man is thus an evocative tale of a hero struggling with his adolescence, betrayal and murder. And Sam Raimi displays the same sensitivity here with his eariler works like Darkman with his flawed avenger. He directs it with eye-popping visuals like Army of Darkness and the comic hero resonates in its true-self. Its brooding hero is what makes Spider-Man a nifty web - and Maguire has definitely triumphed the cynics with his soulful spin.	4.0	Spider-man spins a complex web of humanity in characters	2002-05-01	18	11	7

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1KBYHP3MIRPV	Dimitri McKay	"I'll say right up front that I enjoyed the movie for entertainments value. I enjoyed the action that Sam Raimi gave us, although I thought it was too fast. It was like Spiderman was too fast for gravity, and that kind of bothered me. It also bothered me that they eliminated his web slingers. That really irked me, because it made Spiderman more careless with his webbing... because there was an endless supply. I was like ""What the HELL!"" - The web shooters were an integral part of who Spiderman is, because it made him more human, less freak. Yes, he could walk on walls. Yes, he can jump around. Yes, he was a nerd... but he was never socially acceptable, which is why he was so much more free as Spiderman... with a great sense of humor, confidence, and well... superhero-ness. In the comics, Parker is a nerd. A total geek... and as Spiderman, he's still a man in that suit. He's not superman but they made him seem as though he was as strong as superman, and frankly, that irked me. Beyond that, the movie was cool. I wish the fight scenes were slowed down. The film speed was too high or something, as if you were fast forwarding through the scenes. Beyond that, not a bad adaptation. I just wish they did like X-men did, and kept it direct to the story, and the characters."	5.0	It's not all THAT bad - but the diehards will be irked	2004-11-01	1	0	1

The special effects - the only strength that this movie could have - were corny and cliched. What tops them all is the shot of peter climbing on the ""wall"" - clearly he was climbing on the floor and thd shot was on its side. The characters? Again, cliche after cliche. Bad guys look evil, good guys look like saints. And don't even get me started on the green goblin - was that supposed to be funny? The dialogue was horrible too... Don't see this movie.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AFMDBOW2K7S6L	"Disney_Fanatic ""Disney_Fanatic"""	Tobey Maguire is outstanding as Peter Parker, the nerdy high school student who moonlights as Spider-Man. I absolutely loved this movie. It was definitely better on the big screen but you still get the feel of it on DVD. Willem Dafoe plays a terrific villan and is very eerie. I thought it was well written and acted. I highly recommend this movie to all ages. It sure beats some of the other comic book movies that were so awful, words can't describe (Tank-girl, Judge Dredd, Batman Forever, etc) I think it's the best movie to date.	5.0	Possibly the best Comic Book movie ever.	2003-02-15	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"The movie-theatre adaptation of the Spider Man franchise went through years of failed plot attempts and numerous legal battles to materialize but despite all of the obstacles, it would absolutely succeed by getting praising reviews from both critics and movie-goers alike and it definitely deserved all of that and I would like to add my share of praise to ""Spider Man"". This movie is unbelievably great. (DANGER: THERE COULD BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD BUT HOPEFULLY NOT.)Tobey McGuire was on the border of being perfect for the role of playing the 'nerdy', bumbling, yet intelligent and caring student Peter Parker who gains new abilities after being bitten and genetically altered by a genetically engineered spider and also gains 'spider like senses' that warn him of approaching danger. He tries to keep them under wraps until one fateful night when his uncle Ben Parker is murdered in a carjacking that he failed to stop and vowed to get his revenge for his uncle's murder by fighting for justice and apprehending criminals. However it becomes a chaotic juggling circus as he juggles being a superhero, fighting crime and upholding the law, working as a newspaper editor for his disgruntled employer J. Jonah Jameson, who seems to hate Spider-Man with a passion, and also trying to win the love of Mary Jane Watson who is in love with Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, who is the son of company CEO, Norman Osborn. I couldn't imagine how he manages all three of these burdens and how much sleep that Mr. Parker loses over time but as they say ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"".Norman, in this movie is, experimenting with a new genetically altering chemical lab but something goes wrong and genetically enhances his genetic makeup and turns him into a monstrous new character who eventually becomes the ever feared Green Goblin while remaining a human but with new powers but goes mad over his company Oscorp being threatened with being shut down by government officials and he goes into defiance of them but yet also threatens the safety of the citizens of New York in the process and Spider Man now has to go head to head against him and protect the public from his malice. William Dafoe definitely shows the pure evil expressions yet the internal vulnerabilities of Norman Osborn.Quite frankly, I love the choice of the actors who were selected to play the characters. Tobey McGuire as I said before was on the border of being perfect for the role of Peter Parker/Spider Man as McGuire brings out the somewhat 'nerdiness' but yet also the intelligence and the vulnerability of Parker's character and also the intelligence and the agility of Spider Man. Even the costume was almost spot-on and not overdone like some of those in ""X-Men"" and in the 1997 flop ""Batman & Robin"". Kristen Dunst filling in the role as Mary Jane Watson was absolutely unforgettable and showed the incredible beauty and the intelligence of Watson. My favorite though was the villainous role of William Dafoe playing the ever so frightening Green Goblin and the schizoid Norman Osborn. Then there are some relatively overlooked but unforgettable characters like the high school ruffian bully Flash Thompson. I actually loved watching the fighting scene between Parker and Thompson and its hilarious outcome. I feel that this movie was the best comic book adaptation in many years, if not of all time and none of the characters were dumbed down to one-dimensional characters.There are some interesting messages of how such great power and control also come with the need for great responsibility and it really is something to think about and I feel that those messages combined with fun action scenes in ""Spider Man"" make it a marvelous movie that is definitely miles above a lot of similar superhero movies or weak superhero movie additions that are sunk down by the MTV-oriented sequences, most notably ""Batman & Robin"". I think that this movie while occasionally flawed in some areas, ""Spider-Man"" was much better adapted to the big screen than the X-Men movie was. Unlike some of the characters of that great movie like Storm, Rogue, and Cyclops who I feel were reduced to middle of the road characters, the characters of ""Spider Man"" almost are as engaging and as great as their comic book incarnations and not since the 1989 ""Batman"" movie has a superhero comic and it's villains been so well adapted to the silver screen and that my friend is the definition of smart timing, great script and a movie that is destined to become a classic for many years to come, if not timeless. I just hope that the ""Spider-Man"" movie franchise will go for a long time and not be soiled into MTV oblivion like the Batman series was with ""Batman & Robin"". Let's just make sure that Joel Schumacher stays far away from this franchise.Let's just say that while these past few years have been dull and sometimes awful for music, they've also been great years for movies. Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Shrek, Monsters Inc......you name it. ""Spider Man"" took as long as a decade to finally bring to the big screen but it all paid off though. While this movie might have some room for improvement, ""Spider Man"" is about as great as comic book movie filmmaking gets with its fun atmosphere and eye-popping action sequences and wonderful script and all of these things bring this movie to life. Let me tell you, I haven't seen any comic book characters that were brought to so much life on the big screen in my life. While I'm not knocking on the ""X-Men"" movie at all, ""Spider-Man"" was better filmed and the costumes were great and not overdone like some of the characters. Despite all of the negative flaws of both of these two movies, they are both classics and make a great action movie combo! Both make great compliments, ""Spider-Man"" having a fun and colorful mood yet dark atmosphere while ""X-Men"" has a darker and much more dramatic atmosphere and these two are great movies to include side by side. Perhaps they should eventually put together a movie where ""Spider Man"" meets the ""X-Men"" and they battle a Magneto-Dr. Octopus alliance. Now that would be awesome! Enough of all of that, ""Spider Man"" is a must-have addition to any movie-goers movie collection. I may be wrong but it might be difficult in my opinion for the second Spider Man movie to surpass this one but time will tell though. Go and buy it! End of message! :-)"	5.0	Could as well be the best comic book adaptation of all time!	2003-03-22	2	1	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	Spider-Man is not a perfect movie.  But it does so many important things right that it can be forgiven for its weaker points.  Most importantly, it is a fun, kinetic movie that doesn't let up.The most successful element of Spider-Man is its inspired choices in personnel.  Director Sam Raimi brings his manic visualization skills to the film, making Spidey's famous &quot;webswinging&quot; as exciting as they can be, without undue showing off.  And the casting is simply brilliant.  Tobey Maguire was made for this role.  Not only does he nail the physical elements (his transformation from thin bookworm to stringily muscular acrobat, the shyness and awkwardness), but he is especially marvellous at expressing Spidey's chatty, self-deprecatory sense of humour.  The best performance of his career so far.  Kirsten Dunst was a terrific choice for Mary Jane -- while she is sometimes saddled with cheesy scenes (the final scene at the cemetary being especially disappointing), Dunst is never less than lovable.  And her kiss in the rain with an upside-down Spider-Man is probably the sexiest moment in movies this year!  Willem Dafoe deserves more screen time as Green Goblin; Dafoe is more than good enough as an actor to craft a character akin to The Joker in Tim Burton's Batman, but the script, by red-hot screenwriter David Koepp (Mission:  Impossible, The Panic Room) doesn't really allow him to explore the character's depths.  That appears to be a conscious chioce on Koepp and Raimi's part to keep the focus squarely on Peter Parker/Spider-Man, so it's forgiveable.  The one weak link is James Franco (City by the Sea), who plays Peter's best friend completely at face value, seemingly addicted to a furrowed-eyebrow expression to try to show internal turmoil but falling flat on his face.The comedic elements are delightful; the origins of Spider-Man's name is a hoot, as are his interactions with Mary Jane and the Daily Bugle.  The overall sense of fun is infectious, and the story moves along briskly enough that there are never any dull moments.A great movie for sheer entertainment.	4.0	What big-budget adventures should be.	2002-11-14	1	1	0

All the actors were amazing. Tobey Maguire was fantasic as Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary-Jane Watson. I also thought William Defoe was good as The Green Goblin. The movie stayed very true to the comics and everything! If you don't plan on seeing this movie I would have to say something must be wrong with you.This movie is nonstop and keeps you wanting more. I can't wait for the sequel! After I saw ""Harry Potter"" last year I thought nothing would ever be able to top it off but ""Spider-Man"" proved me wrong. The movie is great and I think everyone should go and see it. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars it was that good. If I could give it as many stars as I want I would have to give it like 15 stars.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AS09CJ2GLNXNV	D.N.	I am so glad David Koepp isn't invited back for the sequel, hopefully the Smallvile guys will not have any of their ideas projected on-screen, either. Though regarding this film, I found Tobey Maguire very likeable, very true to the original concept of Peter Parker, who was always a regular kid and never the typical, blue-eyed, 6 foot, muscle-choked Superhero. I think Kirsten Dunst is alright, but I don't really like her. Her MJ character never really likes Peter, and only comes around to him after noticing how nice he looks. Willem Dafoe is very creepy-looking, though the writing for him was too goofy and stupid. There are many, many humorous moments, most do not come from Spider-Man's mouth. There's a ridiculous scene where Aunt May relates to Peter how he mistook MJ for an angel. And another where she goes crazy in a hospital exclaiming, &quot;Those horrible yellow eyes!&quot; So this is a funny, funny movie, best suited to laughing at it in the back row.  Green Goblin is even goofier, thanks to his lines and costume. Another humorous aspect is how the paper says the wrestling arena requires colorful characters, and then he gets there and everyone is dressed completely in black! They really should have included the beautiful WTC teaser trailer on this DVD, which can be found online. I also like the nod to the comic books in the supplemental materials. Stan Lee's cameo should have been more than a mili-second. The backbone of all of this is fashioned into a very typical story, he evens runs to catch the bus exactly like Forrest Gump and the Goblin asks him to 'join' him, exactly like Darth Vader. Spider-Man should have been a much more original story, elements should have been better. I adore the ending with MJ and Peter, but she mentions his whole name repeatedly and so unnaturally. You do feel for the characters well enough, though. The CGI is sometimes wretched, but towards the end  it has a great scene, I just think all the CGI shots should have been like that all the way through the film, but I guess they were saving money. GG having his parts severed and MJ in the rain is a little steep for a PG-13 flick. Tobey's voice is a little too original for it not to be obvious to MJ who Spider-Man is, which defeats the purpose of a costume. It wasn't great, or very good, just good. I hope to see it vastly improved upon for the sequel.	3.0	Poor script, good performances...	2002-12-03	0	0	0

It won't take to long for the bottom of this franchise to fall apart and people receiving that garbage go broke at its small value.Now for my review.The special effects were ok though I expected a little bit more. The actors for Spiderman and co were lousy. In fact the movie is sort based on the comic book with important details left out at a fast pace. The villian, Ha! As if you call it a villian! The Green Goblin was introduced in such a silly way only those who've read the comicbook knows whats going on. Others who watched this movie out of the blue will be clueless on who is who. Anyway believe it or not when I saw this at the theater with my diehard Spiderman fan stepdad several people of all ages including us were laughing at the Green Goblin's first appearance to the big screen. My God he looked like a Power Ranger gone bad. Or better yet a lifesize reject of a Toy Story villian. And that mask! It's look like someone dug it out the dumpster across the street a week after Halloween to be used for the film. You can even see Osbourne's lips showing from the fake plastic gaping mouth. (Doesn't anyone else agree?) Throughout the movie whenever the G.G showed up on a suped up surf board (probbably swiped it from Lara Croft's (Tomb Raider) broom closet) and zooming around in the air and screeching out diologe that would come from middle schoolers during a routeen game of ""Capture The Flag"" that same group of people that kept growing larger by each G.G sequences were snickering and laughed while trying to avoid junkfood being thrown at us by overhead viewers obviously annoyed at the movie and decides to take their wrath out on us. Anyway at the last G.G scene at least ten people loose it and rush to the bathroom. For my opinion ""Greeny"" should be considered the stupidest looking villian ever. A guy dressed as the Riddler wearing a pink tu-tu would get better ratings As for Spiderman himself. they could've done a lot more better with the actor, scenes, etc. So I've heard that a second one is coming out and talk of third one is floating around.

Realizing that we can look at the movies with a great suspension of belief.  Of course there is some debate over which kiss was better but I prefer the one in 2 at the end.  It is one of the greatest film kisses in the history of film.  When Mary J. says go get em tiger you know that he and she will be married in the next film when it is made.  It is every lonely mans dream to have a good women kiss him and tell him to go get em.  The green goblin in the first one and Doc Ock in the second one are suitably nasty.  Of course we have to realize that the actor who was nasty in the first one started his career as Jesus Christ in King of Kings.  What a contrast for them to make from one actors career.  But, this is a very good film and worth your time to watch.  Sit back and open up your soda, put the bowl of popcorn on the table and get comfortable.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1EZMV5DSWU8TU	Draconis Blackthorne	"From the pages of comic book legend, another hero materializes into the third dimension to ooh and ahh the masses with super-human abilities, to wish for a super hero in such proportions of terrorist pre-occupation. And indeed, the war propaganda was made evident in the closing scene where the webslinger was perched atop a flag pole demonstrating Olde Glory, which received a few handclaps of approval from the audience.Besides this, I was accompanied by some friends to accompany them to this film - so being that I have had an affinity for the webhead since a Dracling, I decided to go. Rememberences of going to the corner store picking up copies of The Amazing Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, X-men, any of the Draculas I could find; and there was even a time when I went through a Superman phase {Note: Superman was actually inspired by the ideologies of Friederich Nietchzie, in his philosophies of the ""Ubermenchten"" or ""Overman"" / ""superman""}; so it afforded Me particular interest to view this film.Sam Raimi {The Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman} kept as close to the story as possible, so as to not disappoint discerning Spidey fans with minor modifications {such as the spider which bit Peter Parker was actually a mutated clone, which seems more timely, whereas the original story related that it was a radio-active spider}, yet these small changes do not really distract from the overall wonder of the character. CGI technology has advanced to the point where the spider stunts can now be brought into the 3D realm, whereas prevoiusly, Spiderman presentations were primarily relegated to either pure animation, or when actually using an actor, as on the short-lived television series, certain shots were made from a distance and whatnot, although that presentation seemed to have more of an air of believability, only because stuntmen were used more frequently.The only contention this writer had, was with the CGI in this particular presentation; was in the kinematics of the fluency of the character during swinging sequences, which was just a bit too animatronic. Yet again, these are small details that can be overlooked for the overall super hero drama of The Amazing Spiderman.Raimi also decided to use the original portrayal of web shooting directly from Spiderman's wrists, rather than from the eventual web-shooters added in subsequent evolutions of The Spiderman Saga.The Green Goblin {William Defoe} was quie impressive as well; the product of experimental radiation, he in encased in sinister armor bearing a demonic rictus, wihch also serves as a mirror / doorway to his dark subconscious in which his diabolical personality split speak to him in 360*, which gives the impression of possession; but the higher man wouls realize this as one's collective dark-side consciosness of the brain's expression of possiblities.The Prodicer decided to use a mask instead of the anthropomorphic face used int he comic book scenario, and for these purposes, I think it worked quite well. The goblin mask represents an archetype of villainy, and in this Satanist's opinion, is well-hewn.Of note, the Mary-Jane Watson character {who is a ditz in real life}, in one remarkable scene, during a kiss sequence she shares with the webslinger, the outline of her nipples and breasts are revelaed drenched in the rain underneath a white blouse - which was quite a delightful surprise, really.There is a touching scene with Peter's uncle really tugs at the heart-strings, in which he was shot by a mugger who exited the very same event Parker was wrestling at, even brushing past him in a getaway, stealing from an unscrupulous promoter {spidey fans will be very familiar with these events} - both the promoter and the thief receive dark justice.Overall, this film is definitely recommended for the Spiderman fan, who should not be disappointed; and for those new to the homosapien-arachnid's lore, this will prove to be a worthy introduction."	5.0	Sticky situations...	2004-08-07	3	2	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	"This is, in my mind, the single greatest Superhero movie ever made. The only one that comes close is the original Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN of the late 1970s. The film is action-packed, and yet it has a heart. The special effects are awesome eye-candy, but are far from the sole reason to buy this DVD.The forte of this endeavor is that it succeeds where so many Superhero movies have failed: it humanizes a young man who has almost omnipotent powers. Tobey Maguire is a credible Peter Parker, and this movie is almost more about Peter Parker than it is Spiderman. The biggest flaw of most Superhero efforts is that they pay too much attention to the hero and too little attention to the hero's secret identity.Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as the object of Parker's infatuation. She has an adorable girl-next-door beauty as opposed to a glamorous / COSMOPOLITAN magazine-cover look. In short, this is precisely what the film needs as Dunst's character is the symbolic all-American sweetheart that so many of us guys fall in love with in high school - but are never able to actually date.Willem Dafoe is, quite simply, the greatest Super-villain of all time. Sure, Gene Hackman was great as Lex Luthor and Jack Nicholson was memorable as the Joker, but Dafoe is utterly PERFECT as the Green Goblin. What's more, as is the case with Spiderman, the film does a remarkable job of humanizing his character as well. This is perhaps the least comic-booky seeming villian I've ever seen, despite the fact that they pulled the Goblin straight from the pages of a comic book!I cannot say enough about just how well-done this movie is. The soundtrack, courtesy of Danny Elfman, is outstanding. The direction is terrific, as is the acting. As an added bonus, the 2nd disc offers commentary and backdrop material of both the comic strip as well as the movie.  Most significant is an interview with the creator of SPIDERMAN himself:  Stan Lee.  It was terrific to see that he had a big hand in the writing and production of SPIDERMAN.The symmetry and length of the film are right on the money. The attack by some movie critics that the movie was too long is nothing short of ludicrous. It had just the right mix of the stories of the Goblin and Spiderman, enough grand standoffs + some mini-adventures along the way.The author C.S. Lewis once made the straightforward and yet trenchent observation that one should never critique a literary work that belongs to a genre that he dislikes. The same holds true for movies. If you don't like Superhero movies, you're most likely not going to like this one, for a Superhero movie is what it is. However, if you do enjoy Superhero films now & again, I can't imagine you NOT liking this production.The majority of movie critics who gave this film a poor rating did so not because it's a bad movie, but because they don't care for Superhero films. That is their prerogative, of course, but it also nullifies their tirades. After all, you can't ""blame"" a film for being of the genre it belongs to.As I walked out of the theatre as the credits rolled, I felt remarkably ""ordinary"" and mundane.  I cannot give a greater compliment to a movie of the Superhero genre, for that is precisely what you should feel like after viewing a story such as this.SPIDERMAN ROCKS!"	5.0	We are who we choose to be.	2003-01-26	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A106YXO3EHVD3J	"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b"""	Spider Man is creaky at times, but it is so much fun it's easy to forgive any flaws in it. It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic books, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May.Sure there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good choice to not have over emphasized that point. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love. Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important one because super hero films had not been taken very seriously until after this film made a ton of money.The Blu Ray is an improvement over the 2 disc DVD set, but many if not all of the bonus material was not carried over, so hole on to your DVD sets if you want to upgrade as the extras are well worth it.	5.0	THE FIRST IN THE NEW AGE OF SUPER HERO FILMS!	2014-05-06	1	1	0

Tobey Maguire shines as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and Willem Dafoe lends a deft bit of psychosis and humanity to the role of the Green Goblin. Ditto Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Rosemary Harris as Aunt  May. And special nods to to Cliff Robertson as the emphatic and sympathetic Uncle Ben. Yes, the Goblin's frozen gargoyle mask detracts from the insidious nature of the character, but other than that, this film never steps wrong. People have complained about the CGI effects. Phooey!!! Not since Superman caught the helicopter in one hand and Lois Lane in the other have I been so captivated and exhilerated by the screen presence of a superhero!!! In fact, this is hands down the best comic adaptation since the original &quot;Superman.&quot; If you like Spidey, then prepare to be dazzled. This film gives me hope, because it effectively demonstrates that there are filmmakers out there who still can embody their characters with a sense of wonder and awe. That's the strength of this movie- it regards its titular character with a sense of wonder, something sorely lacking in, say, the depressing &quot;Batman&quot; franchise. If this is the launch, then I cannot wait until the sequels! Go Spiderman! It's good to have a hero to cheer for again!!!

Aside from the horrible CGI, it really really drags.  Over 2 hours???  Why?  Throw out all the useless, underdeveloped character (Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Harry Osbourne, all the insignificant references to Spiderman comic book personalities), and you might end up with a decent 1 hr 40 min film.  And no it did not follow the comic book.  Anyone who says that is lying...all the more reason to get rid of some characters.  I fear the coming of Spiderman 2, or as I will call it, Spiderman Again.

Many details are left in the dark during the movie.  It has no sense of time. But the real kick in the groin was that he had natural web in the movie.  In the comic book and the cartoon he had web cartridges.  Making for a much better SpiderMan expierence. In the books and TV shows he would sometimes run out of the cartridges and have to think on his feet.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"Casting Tobey Maguire is the best thing about this movie; casting Kirsten Dunst is definitely the worst, ... just zero charisma, and her red hair is so blatantly fake it's not even funny.  Uncle Ben and Aunt May are also played by underwhelming actors...after Maguire, only William Dafoe pulls his own weight here.The special effects were also second rate, especially compared with for example ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""---you often feel that you're watching a video game because they're so choppy and cartoonish-looking.  The fight choreography is also lame...c'mon, in this day and age you could probably find better combat scenes in any 3rd rate B-movie with a fraction of this film's production budget!One nice thing about this movie is the political subtext: at the film's ending, we see Spidey swinging by an American flag atop a skyscraper while Maguire's voiceover recalls his Uncle's last lecture: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2KB14WCZ1DVE3	elvistcob@lvcm.com	"""Good things come to all that wait"" works like a charm here.  One has to applaud the folks from Marvel for waiting until the right time to make this movie.  In their cash-strapped years, it had to be a huge temptation to accept any kind of money for the rights to their characters.  Had they went with a movie before the technology was ready, any effort would have been a big disappointment.  Had they not held out for a reasonable degree of integrity when it comes to the comic book origins it would have been a disaster.  But for once everybody did just about everything right, and the results are smashingly good.Most important, the plot sticks faithfully (and lovingly) to the now forty-year-old storyline.  We get the teen-aged orphan, raised by an aunt and uncle, getting bit by a special spider that transfers it's powers to the boy.  The boy at first uses his new-found powers frivolously, but is quickly sobered up big-time to the responsibilities he has somewhat inherited.  With few exceptions, the movie goes to great lengths to keep millions of fans happy.There were only a few big breaks from the storyline, and I have no problem with them.  The books had him bitten by a radioactive spider, the movie has a genetically altered spider.  Big deal.  A bigger, more important difference is the fact that the movie Spiderman's body produces it's own webbing, while the book has him shooting web cartridges that he invented himself.  I like the new way much better, as it stretches credibility to think that the teenager could all of a sudden invent this miracle product, AND need to store hundreds of cartridges around the city as replacements.Casting is as perfect as can be.  I had thought a younger Tom Cruise would be a great Peter Parker, but Toby Maguire now owns the role, showing the shyness and vulnerability of the character perfectly.  I had thought Kirsten Dunst not voluptuous enough to be Mary Jane, but just getting her wet removed all doubts.  The portrayals of J. Jonah Jameson, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Harry Osborne are also done well.Special effects are the only place I have problems.  The biggest is this stupid plastic mask worn by villian Green Goblin.  It just looks dumb, and they should have somehow animated it.  Also, some of the action sequences go too fast to drink in.  But when you can see the magic, yes, it does look like he can crawl up walls and swing between buildings.  When he fights a group of criminals, the body language of his Spider-moves takes the care to show something beyond just human gymnastics.The movie does have something for everyone, and I hope everyone sees it to insure a string of Spiderman movies.  Very young children will like when the costumed folk are on screen, but get a little restless during adult dialog.  However, those generally not into comic books much (i.e., females), can follow the romantic line between Peter and Mary Jane, and for that matter, Spiderman and Mary Jane.  Tobey Maguire, just like Peter Parker, has lucked out big time with some pretty hot screen kisses.Of course, there are also those millions of fans, some that have waited almost forty years for this to happen, to finally get their due.  To these, of which I'm included, this movie's for you."	5.0	The Golden Age of Comic Book Movies is Here	2002-05-06	1	1	0

The music in the movie is very good, ESPECIALLY the opening music. And the PLOT, my goodness, I never thought a movie based off a comic book could have such a wonderful plot.However, as great as myself and others make this movie sound, it's not without its harsh critics. Some reviewers talk about the silly one-liners, the silly costume for green goblin, etc. This is where my title for the review comes in: THIS IS SPIDERMAN, NOT SHAKESPEARE!

The type of Blockbuster that the people involved actually cared about making, and it shows.  The characters are so much fun, from the central trio of young adults--Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, young Spidey-in-the-making, James Franco as his best friend, the troubled Harry Osbourne, and Kirsten Dunst, perfect as the warm and friendly but slightly inaccessible girl-next-door, Mary-Jane Watson--to the great Willem Dafoe, hamming it up gorgeously as Harry's scientist father, a.k.a. The Green Goblin.  One of the funniest scenes is when a wounded Spidey gets a pep talk from the responsible Goblin, who sits conspiratorily beside him and taps the woozy Spidey's head to get his attention.  The screenplay is marvellously tongue-in-cheek, every frame is drenched in colour, and the whole film shows the signs of love that went into making it.

So, the good parent that I am, braved the lines and went on opening night. After seeing countless episodes of the Batman movies, I was leery of the dark and extremely long movie plots with the introduction of so many characters in such a short period of time, but I gave it a chance. This was not the case with Spiderman. I went in with reserved expectations and came out thoroughly entertained. Spiderman took you away from the realities of the real world for a couple of hours.  Which is why I enjoyed it so much.  It was good entertainment.  It did not have the dark and dismal undertones of its comic book predecessor, Batman. Spiderman snared you in its web right from the beginning of the movie and you were totally unable to be pulled away. What Jack Nicholson did for the Joker, William Dafoe did for the Green Goblin. This movie was completely entertaining. Tobey McGuiere was a dream fit for his alter ego Peter Parker/Spiderman.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	Not too long ago, I was a rather avid fan of the Spider-Man comics, always anxiously awaiting each month to see what new catastrophe our webbed hero would have to face. I stopped keeping track of the stories after the &quot;clone saga&quot; mess, which is simply one of the worst cases of &quot;overblown&quot; I've ever read. Then I heard news about a Spider-Man movie, which quickly became reality. It was an event I was neither looking forward to nor dreading. Unsurprisingly, it's a movie that I felt neither unbridled enthusiasm for nor utter disdain. It's as middling as mediocre gets.High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy amateur photographer who's bitten by a radioactive spider, consquently being endowed with arachnid-like powers. He has super-strength, can jump great distances, and maybe best of all, he's got a spider-sense that warns him of danger. With these new abilities, his first acts are only thinking of himself, generally trying to make as much money as possible with his strength and agility.But when Peter's uncle is killed by a robber, he realizes that &quot;with great power comes great responsiblity.&quot; Haunted by his uncle's death, he goes about as a crimefighter, dressed in a red and blue costume, calling himself Spider-Man. A new, even more powerful foe called the Green Goblin arrives on the NYC scene, causing a lot of destruction in hopes of...well, that's not really clear. Meanwhile, Peter has to balance out his crimefighting with his personal lives, particularly with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), a redhead he's got a crush on.The very core of Spider-Man's biggest problem is its casting. While Willem Dafoe is terrific as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and J.K. Simmons is a wonderful J. Jonah Jameson, almost every major character is miscast. Tobey Maguire is a mixed bag as Peter Parker. When he concentrates on the dilemma of the mixed lives he has to juggle on-screen alone (or with Dafoe), he's very good, but comes across totally flat when he actually interacts with his co-stars, particularly James Franco and Kirsten Dunst.Speaking of Franco and Dunst, how can these two be so charmless and without emotion? Franco does little more than brood, making one wonder why the more chipper Parker would even hang out with such a guy in the first place (Harry Osbourne was different personality-wise in the comics). Kirsten Dunst is the worst bit of comic book-to-film miscasting since George Clooney as Batman. Mary Jane Watson, arguably the most important character in Parker's life, is now little more than a grating redhead who lacks a discernable personality beyond constant superhero doting.For all that's wrong with the portrayal of those major characters, the origin story is really rather well done. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit until Parker suited up as Spider-Man. The character's first CGI appearance is just a total distraction. Perhaps it was unavoidable, but the action scenes look more like cartoons than physical, death-defying showdowns. Unconvincing CGI was probably inevitble, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it.The movie also blows it in regards to the Green Goblin's motives. True, he initially wanted revenge against the board members that voted against him, but what about after that? Maybe the Goblin aspect of Osbourne's personality is power-hungry, but then again, all the Goblin ever does is blow stuff up. Maybe he just likes to see stuff blow up. If so, that's one of the laziest and lousiest villainous motives I've heard to date.Truthfully, not every aspect of the movie's central story or the action is as bad as I make it out to be. (moderate spoiler in this sentence) The dichotomy of the hero and villain is fairly interesting and their final mano-a-mano to the death is rather rousing, even if it ends on an idiotic note (was the Goblin trying to intentionally kill himself in the process of killing Spider-Man?)(he didn't have to get up like he did). But damn, those goofy CGI stuntmen and half-bad acting really put a downer on what should have been an exciting and touching summer blockbuster.** 1/2 out of *****	2.0	Ruined by miscasting, creaky plotting, and bad CGI.	2004-03-29	1	1	0

While I am old school and grew up with Spider-Man having web-shooters, I like having him with his own web power! It makes sense because why have the powers of a spider but can't shoot a web!?Anyway, this film by Sam Rani is genius but does borrow a lot from the original James Cameron script, particularly the organic web shooters. Still he makes it his own with the way he takes the classic origin story and updates it! From the spider-bite to the tragic death of his Uncle Ben.The only real knock I have on this film is that I would've rathered have waited to use The Green Goblin. He was a very major villian (arguably the greatest Spidey foe) and could've been just hinted at in this film and used in Spider-Man 2 rather than Doc Ock (though I know I will enjoy that film anyway).The extras also make this one a keeper! Get it in its old form as I have on good authority that the re-release is actually a step down from its original release as far as extras.	5.0	One Of The Better Super-Hero Movies!	2004-06-09	0	0	0

If you're not a fan, wait until this movie comes out on video, otherwise you may be disappointed.  With just a little creative license this movie follows the comic book to a ""T"" as far as how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, and what happens to his Uncle Ben.  The action in the movie is there, and like the comic there's a lot of ""slow"" drama between the action.  Out of a 2-hour movie (including the credits), there is about 20-30 minutes of action.  The rest is characters taking to each other, and making pleasantries.  One of the other reviews I read here is about the Green Goblin.  It states that Mr. Defoe is hidden behind a mask that doesn't move when he talks, etc.  While this is true, if you pay attention you can see his mouth behind the mask, so it does not detract from his acting abilites or your enjoyment of the film.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because the preview trailers contain almost all of the action seqences in the movie (which lets you know it is more drama than action)."	3.0	True to the comic, but not as entertaining	2002-05-03	0	0	0

Spider-Man is pretty much one of the best superhero films next to Batman. I'm so glad that Danny Elfman composed the music. He is my favorite music composer.

Probably because I went in thinking that it would suck.  I'm just not into this kind of stuff.  Of course, I'm a closet &quot;Batman&quot; fan so I guess it does say something.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie.  The cinematography was awesome!  From all the camera dynamics following Spidey's twists and flips, you really felt that you were flying through the air with him.  The cinematography also had a warm, upbeat feeling to it.  It was one of the main reasons the movie kept my eyes glued to the screen.The second reason is, of course, the actors.  From Tobey Maguire's clumsy but lovable Peter Parker to Kirstin Dunst's beautiful Mary Jane Watson to Willem Dafoe's deliciously evil Green Goblin, the actors most definitely made the movie.  The producers certainly picked the right people to handle the characters.The only downside to this movie was that the opening credits were too long and too boring.	5.0	Spiderman, Spiderman, watch this movie when you can	2004-07-18	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AOYQR2530QCDX	ffootballguru27	As I grew up I was a fan of Super Man and Spider Man comic books, but I never really got into them, but when I heard this movie was coming out I knew I had to see it. This movie portrays the great works of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who made Spider-Man into an ever-popular comic book while making Marvel Comics famous.A bite by a rare breed of spiders at the Columbia University science lab gives Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) great vision and a perfect body. He also is also given great agility to jump form large skyscrapers and spin webs from his wrist. Then he assumes the identity of Spider Man to fight off the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe),  that terrorizes the city with a glider that drops several bombs at a time.  Spider-Man nearly loses his life while saving the life of his girlfriend, people who are being threatened to be killed by the Green Goblin, and many innocent people who he doesn't even know.Tobey Maguire, with the emotional lead role overcomes the tragic death of his beloved Uncle Ben, growth trauma's, doubts, sorrows, and fear, to save lives and become the city icon. Willem Dafoe's hystericals and split-personality suffered after a lab-experiment gone wrong make him be a friend one minute and the evil Green Goblin the next. Kirsten Dunst fits the role nicely as Peter's love Mary Jane. Even characters with smaller parts like Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), and his friend Harry (James Franco) are amazing. Sam Raimi's big-screen version of the Marvel Comic's good-vs-evil Spider-Man comics is portrayed by outstanding acting, eye-popping special effects, great sound and much more. If you are a Spider-Man comic book fan this is a movie you have to see.	5.0	Above all expectations	2002-05-07	0	0	0

Yes, Batman had some great sets, but I don't remember any of the comic book looking anything like that at all.. It was a little TOO grandiose, if you ask me. This movie not only stayed true to the comic book (I'd say about 90%), it had spectacular web-swing sequences that only CGI could deliver.  I was a bit skeptical at first of too much CGI, but as I watched it, I realized that it was the only way to truly portray how Spider-Man's movements were in the comic book.  Tobey Maguire was a great pick for Spider-Man and even the smaller characters like Robbie Robertson and Betty Brant were there.Anybody that was a fan of the comic book will love this movie, in my opinion.  I liked this better than the X-men, even.. graphically, more pleasing and like I said, it was like seeing your favorite comic book come to life.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"Throughout the extras on the DVD for ""Spider-Man"" runs a subtext that the fan base -- that notoriously cranky demographic of male comic readers -- had to be accommodated, not antagonized. The filmmakers must have become pretty good at wrangling this dynamic. The extras on the swinging new ""Spider-Man"" DVD -- pointedly segregated at one point into sections for the comic and the movie -- should appeal both to Spidey fans and serious film folk alike. The two-disc set is packed with extras that are well-organized and, for the most part, worth the effort to wade through.The movie looks fine, especially considering all the disc space devoted to extras. The DVD faithfully renders the feature's surprisingly restrained color scheme of rich reds (Spider-Man), algae greens (the Goblin) and golds (the ambers of the dawn sun hitting Manhattan). Images range from OK (the Parker household set) to spectacular (the shining scenes over Gotham). The amazing look of the trailers collection hints at the potential for a reference-quality DVD.Audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 only. The fun takes a while to get started, but the soundstage soon enough does a home invasion on the viewing room. Rear effects consistently keep listeners on edge, delivering a few solid jolts (the Green Goblin's flashback, for instance).Director Sam Raimi and co-producer Grant Curtis provide entertaining commentary, their talk paired with a separate session by producer Laura Ziskin and star Kirsten Dunst.Many producers waste their DVD commentary time playing straight men to creative talent; Ziskin offers a rare perspective on what it's like to be a working producer, playing the budget game for time and money.Dunst says her Mary Jane character probably hasn't figured out that Parker is the web crawler: ""She isn't that smart."" The actress' famous wet-shirt scene passes without comment, but she reveals that she shot a solo bedroom dance in her underwear that was cut (""It was a little too much"").Raimi's a DVD commentary veteran, always upbeat, offbeat and informative. He spends a lot of time crediting co-workers like the second unit directors, giving the scope of just how intensely collaborative modern action films are.The film has two huge effects scenes -- the Times Square clash between Spidey and the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and the concluding sequence of our hero swinging through Manhattan. Both are covered in detail on an interesting separate commentary track from effects designer John Dykstra and digital co-conspirators Anthony LaMolinara and Scott Stokdyk."	4.0	It works for fans and film students	2002-11-04	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AWZAYORFYJC1W	FMR	"Question: What do you get when you try to cram nearly a decade worth of comic book history into a two hour superhero film, while at the same time ignoring elements unique to the origin of the superhero in question? Answer: This movie.When Sam Raimi was interviewed about this film he kept saying how much he loved the characters and how he was going to stay true to the spirit of the comic. But anyone who's familiar with the comic and the characters would be left to wonder what he meant after watching this travesty. The characters in this film bear little resemblance to their comic counterparts. Raimi took people and events as familiar to many of us as our own lives and changed them into something foreign and devoid of any spark of life. Not one of the major changes from comic to film was necessary, but were all done in the interests of having a modern approach and making it more believable. That was a pretty ambitious (and pointless) task for a movie based on a comic book wasn't it? Very little in a superhero comic could be considered believable, but we wanted to see the Spiderman we all knew brought to the big screen anyway. But Raimi couldn't be bothered to give us that, and treated us instead to HIS version of Spiderman.One of Raimi's biggest changes was not giving us Peter Parker the science whiz. It was his interest in the world of science that set him apart from his classmates who are more interested in being popular than in studying. In the comics Peter couldn't get the others to go with him to a science exhibit on radiation. It was his interest in science that drew him to that exhibit and it was there that the radioactive spider bit him. But in the film he is just one of many students on a class field trip. In the comics it was like it was almost fated to be him, but in the film it could just as easily have been anyone who became Spiderman.There is an interesting duality about Peter Parker. You could say that because of science he is a self made man. It made him both a good student and a superhero. His love of science defines him and hampers him at the same time. It allows him to get attention from his teachers but makes him an outcast with the other kids. Science gave him powers that allow him to do things that no one else can, but also caused him to be branded a menace. The kids at school like Spiderman but hate Peter. Adults like Peter but hate Spiderman. It's no real stretch to suggest that without science Peter Parker would be nothing. Peter couldn't have been a success as Spiderman without science. It is his life, and his knowledge of it saved him many times where his powers alone couldn't have. Peter's interest in science is an integral part of his character, but with the exception of a few passing comments it gets all but ignored in this film. Without that science background you diminish the character of Peter Parker and it certainly shows in this film.Raimi also changed the radioactive spider into a genetically altered spider. Back in the sixties radiation was an unknown to most people and could be used as a means to give Peter his powers. But a genetically altered ""super spider"" would be no more likely to give someone super powers than a radioactive one. How believable is it that these researchers would create just the right combination of changes in one of their spiders that it would turn Peter into Spiderman, but one altered by radiation couldn't? And does that mean that any of the spiders that were on display could have given him his powers had they bit him instead? If this is the case then you reduce Peter's accident to an almost trivial matter.Another complaint among many of the die-hard Spidey fans was the use of organic webbing. But when Raimi said that there would be a compromise for the fans it led me to suggest on a newsgroup that he would have to invent the web shooters to control and properly use this organic webbing, but this was not to be. Raimi's compromise was that Peter had to use the two fingers to the palm method for shooting his webs as he does in the comics. Some compromise. Raimi said it wasn't believable for a high school kid to invent webbing and web shooters. Is it believable that some children can play a musical instrument before they can read or write? It's hard to believe but it happens all the time. Some people are just born gifted, and in the case of Peter Parker his gift is science. But if that is too much to accept then how are we to accept that these organic web shooters conveniently show up on his arms (both of them) where he could use them? Why didn't they turn up on his back or the bottom of his feet? And are we to believe they would be so small, and that they would just grow on top of his skin and not from inside his arms displacing blood vessels, veins and muscle tissue as they did so? And how is Peter able to produce a giant web so quickly when real spiders have to construct their webs?But if these changes were made to make the film more believable then Raimi certainly fell down on the job in several other areas. In the film we see Peter accidentally shoot a web at a school lunch tray yet no one notices. He then drags that tray behind him with the webbing still attached to his arm in full view of the cafeteria. And a few minutes later he puts on a display of inhuman speed, agility and strength when fighting Flash Thompson. Is it believable that when Spiderman first appears a short time later that not one student might guess who he really is? Is it believable that a poor high school student with no job and no money could create such a complex costume? Peter didn't have the skills needed to design and assemble something like that or access to the machinery needed to do so. In the comics Spiderman's costume was made from a thin, lightweight material that he could comfortably wear under his clothes, that allowed him full range of movement. Does the movie costume look like it could do either of those?And why did Raimi feel the need to change the manner in which Uncle Ben died? In the comics when Uncle Ben is murdered at home Peter not only loses the man who helped raise him, but his sense of safety and shelter from the outside world as well. When his uncle's death happens in the only home he has ever know the comfortable little world that Peter lived in would forever be violated. But the film gave us a car jacking instead. Incredibly there were some on the Internet that actually said it was better this way. They felt it wasn't believable to have the burglar Peter let escape days later choose his house to rob. So how believable is it that of all the possible directions the burglar could have run and all the cars he could have chosen he picked the one that lead to Uncle Ben's death? It's worth pointing out that Uncle Ben wasn't in front of the building where Peter was wrestling but in front of the library where he let him off which was some distance away.And as for the Green Goblin what can I say. He isn't scary or even menacing. He is a dull one-dimensional character that looks like he should be fighting the Power Rangers instead of Spiderman. That helmet allows no emotion or personality to show through, and without that how could the audience be expected to identify with the character? He might as well have been a robot controlled by Osborn instead of Osborn himself. And where does he keep his weapons? The comic Goblin carried his stuff in a bag but the movie version seems to produce his from thin air. And why is there no investigation of Osborn after someone murders the people who publicly oppose him using his inventions? Not everyone who would have known of these events was killed, so why didn't a film so worried about believability give us a big scene showing Osborn under siege from both local and federal law enforcement agencies demanding answers?Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker as a mumbling lovesick wuss the entire film and he brought nothing to the role of Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst reduced Mary Jane to nothing more than a helpless girlfriend character and the ""wet T-shirt"" attempted assault scene was shameless and an insult to such a strong character. Willem Dafoe made a decent Norman Osborn but he never had anything to do. The part where Norman discovers Peter's secret was ridiculous and so was its presentation. The CGI suffered from many weak moments such as Peter jumping from roof to roof testing his new powers, and then later while chasing Uncle Ben's killer in his makeshift Spidey costume. And the scene where he stops the armored car robbery looked like something out of a video game.If you are looking for the classic Lee/Ditko Spiderman you won't find it here, but if you want to see a weepy teen drama that borrows from other superhero films then this is the movie for you."	1.0	Sam Raimi + bad casting + terrible script = this movie	2005-04-26	5	1	4
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2TQD1XU7FG2W2	"""forma11"""	I have just seen the movie Spider-man and came away impressed. First, there are many things to like about this movie. Tobey nailed Peter Parker and Spidey(would have liked to see a little more of his trademark sarcasm when in costume though). Dafoe was perfect for the Goblin and all of the cast nailed the dominant personality traits of their characters as they are portrayed in the comic. The scenes of web-slinging were the best. Childhood fantasy put on film. It was great to see all the little kids walk out of the theatre pretending to shoot webs.The hardest part for them to do must have been the costume. They hit that one perfect also. The goblin costume was less than perfect, but I guess the alternative was a rubber mask(or a tranformation ala' Dr. Jeckyll?) They strayed from the comic on some issues, but going in you knew they would. The obvious one is the web shooter. Another is the contaminated spider itself. I understand the sacrifice of the web story for the sake of brevity and believability, but the irradiated spider story would still work.Things I didn't like( also known as nit picking). Macy Gray? If it was on T.V at that point, I would has changed the channel. Kirsten Dunst. She could be a super criminal. Butterface. Also time to get somebody new to do the musical score. Elfman made the intro and music too similiar to Batman. Spiderman is young, hip and hopeful, not dark and brooding. He made himself sound like a one trick pony.Kudos to Sam Raimi!!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1FD8LITJZE48V	"Frank Ponce ""Movie Mavin"""	SPIDER-MAN was the the #1 film of 2002; it was a blockbuster liked by critics and loved by audiences (especially kids). But after repeated viewings, the movie becomes a bit stale for me after awhile.The film's good points though are Tobey Maguire's solid potrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as the lovely MJ. The bad points were the wearisome Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was good though) and the pathetic dialogue this film has, especially by the villian. It was a bit long as well.I'm giving it four stars though because of the way it looked like when I first saw it. It was fun, somewhat exciting, and the performances were grand. And also because I like Sam Raimi, the director, because he made a favorite movie of mine before. It was DARKMAN. It was way better then SPIDER-MAN, but Raimi did a good job at building a comic-book atmosphere for this movie.Every kid in this world has flocked around this movie, which is a bit annoying for me.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A16028DN1KQTEH	Fredrik Fyhr	"It's with a mixed feeling of different expectations I sit down in the cinema to watch SPIDER-MAN. I had a hope to see a Great Superheroflick, in the same class as Tim Burton's masterpiece BATMAN (1989). Then I had this more realistic spidersense telling me that ""you know, this'll probably be a lot of fun, but really nothing else"". Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but ""a lot of fun"" is kind of an understatement; It's REALLY a lot of fun watching SPIDER-MAN.First off, there is two things that made me want to see this film;1. As a kid Spidey was my idol, and Marvel my heaven. This resulted in me knowing state-of-the-art-geek-stuff for the rest of my life. Therefore when time came for ""Spidey the movie"", my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11-year-old-mania.2. My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick. As a horrorfan his THE EVIL DEAD (1982) remains more or less as a gift. His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames. But I heard Raimi would be a bit more down-to-earth, in SPIDER-MAN. Well that sounded good.Indeed, Raimi doesn't get all that carried away, even though the movie ooze from his fun directing manners. If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER-MAN has the same crazed tempo. Of course BRUCE CAMPBELL does a semi-cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions. Yeah, about the actors, SPIDER-MAN's lineup gives us three stars in the leading roles, Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors. Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character. Of course, to make an a-lot-of-fun-actionadventure these days requires some heavy artilleries from the digital front. True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment-meter. When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride. 'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this. Forget that it contains two love-declarations, one from Maguire and one from Dunst, that are absolutely ridiculous (and that the dialogues overall are no hotshots). Then you'll have a lot of fun. My rating is really a 7 out of 10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best.Buy the way. There is a Spider-Man 2 and 3 coming up. Good idea. This movie was very true to the comicbook it was based on, but Spidey lacked his unresistable wits and some of the stuff that are basic to the Spidey-reader are not yet shown off in the movie. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels. Even though I wonder... Sam Neill as DocOc? Bring in Eddie Brock!"	3.0	A lot of fun. Definitely	2002-08-15	0	0	0

It has only been a few years since it came out in theaters, but it is still as fun and spectacular as it was when I first watched it way back then. I have been a Spidey fan since the 80s, so he has always been a hero of mine, you can imagine the thrill I had when I finally got to see him on the big screen. Sam Raimi did an excellent job on this movie and it shows from beginning to end.Tobey McGuire is definitely the perfect choice to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He definitely brings the nerdiness out of Peter, but also brings the strength and courage of Spider-Man. You feel for the guy when a certain family member dies, and you cheer when he finally gets his revenge on those who hurt him and his family. With that said, I think the real movie star is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He is an incredible actor and is always fun to see on screen. From his change in voice to his facial expressions when he is the Goblin, no wonder he has been kept for the sequels, he is just someone fun to watch.Overall, this is a movie that you have to see if you haven't already, whether you are a fan or not.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"I'm not generally enthusiastic about superheroes, comic book characters, or even special effects movies--but I have to say that SPIDERMAN is easily the best movie of its kind that I have ever seen, a movie that packs a tremendous whallop in terms of being just flat-out fun to watch.  The cast is solid; the story is entertaining; the special effects are first rate all the way.Unless you've been living in a hole all these years, you already recognize the character--one of the last to emerge from the golden age of comic books and still one of the most popular.  But Spiderman differs somewhat from most comic book superheroes: he is insecure, angst-ridden, and carries with him all the uncertainties of youth; consequently, the character foreshadowed the current wave of much darker comicbook characters, many of whom might be described as underdog anti-heroes.  While the film departs from the original comic book storyline in a number of ways, it retains that element.  And it follows the legend in general outline: Peter Parker is a brainy but slightly nerdy and insecure kid--but when he is bitten by a radioactive (in this case a genetically mutated) spider, he develops amazing powers.  And when crime hits home in a personal way, he sets out to rid the city of bad guys and comes face to face with supercriminal Green Goblin, who is determined to tempt Spiderman into a life or crime or kill him trying.I would have never imagined Tobey Maguire in the role of Spiderman, but he brings the right blend of uncertainty and joy in his newly discovered powers to the role, and as a result is a superhero character that is a lot more believable than most other big screen efforts.  Willen Dafoe, who has made a career of playing unexpected characters, is also perfectly cast as The Green Goblin, and the supporting cast--which includes Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris--is also extremely good.  The film moves at a good pace, alternately witty and actionpacked, touching and sharp.  And although the special effects are a bit dimmed by the translation to the small screen (I always find that CGI works better on the big screen), it is still fascinating stuff to watch.The double DVD set comes with a host of extras, including computer games, outtakes, and the like, but the most enjoyable of the extras are a documentary on the making of the film and a documentary re Marvel Comics with an emphasis (of course) on ""your friendly neighborhood Spiderman;"" frankly, bonus packages don't come much better.  Now, if you're not a comicbook or superhero fan, you might want to rent this one before you buy it; the fact that everything is on the surface (no seriously deep meanings here) is also likely to annoy people looking for depth.  But that aside, SPIDERMAN is just a tremendous amount of fun to watch from start to finish, and if you can enter into that spirit of fun you'll enjoy every minute of it."	5.0	A Genuine Blockbuster!	2003-02-05	4	3	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	Sam Raimi has made a subtly acted mainstream movie with 'The Gift', but unwisely returns to the style of 'Darkman' for this belated comic book adaption, presumably because he felt it worked a treat the first time. Arguably, it didn't, the stylised affectations failing to engage on that occasion, either. Perhaps it's too hard to translate the 'realism' of the 'Spiderman' strip to celluloid, and Raimi doesn't try. Also, it's too old a strip to successfully incorporate the anochronistic aspects within a contemporary setting. The film also suffers from the use of too much shorthand in attempting to cover ground in Mr Parker's eventful life, making us lose interest in the second half. The audience in the late show I saw frankly giggled through the cack-handed love scenes. Parker ultimately managed to juggle a private life with heroism in the strip, thus making his vow of celebacy in the feature perplexing to the viewer. The original's charm and intrigue came from it's campus setting and if not for 'Buffy', which covers similar ground, it might have worked better as a series. Certainly, the first two 'Superman' films handled this sort of material with more wit and aplomb. As it stands, the film has trouble competing against modern fare such as 'The Matrix'. Perhaps sensing this, the producers introduce some unnecessarily graphic violence into the proceedings. This is inappropriate in my view, not to mention emetic as the film so closely resembles 'Inspector Gadget' in it's childishness. A poor commercial decision too, as much of it's target audience are now excluded from viewing 'Spiderman' in the UK. The comic strip conformed to a voluntary comics code and was never that violent, if memory serves, thus adding to one's cynicism.Another aspect that disappoints is the lack of widescreen presentation. Surely, this picture was crying out for panoramic vistas of the city. I felt short changed, as I always do when confronted with this restricted aspect.I have to say this is a minority view, as the public and critics have largely embraced Raimi's approach to the material.	1.0	A shoddy and boring enterprise	2002-06-12	11	5	6
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AY12DBB0U420B	Gary Peterson	"When I was a little kid and learning to read (mid 40s) I just loved the funnies. I'd get the Sunday paper comics section out and spread it on the floor and get down on my hands and knees and read the entire thing. Even Prince Valiant, although he'd come last. The first things were Superman, Dick Tracy and Batman. I loved super heroes and super bad guys. They were my favorites! I don't remember Spider-Man and it's possible that he didn't come along until later, or perhaps our paper just didn't have him included. Amazingly, a lot of these super heroes have stayed with us and now are on radio, television and in the movies. Well, I've seen a couple Batman movies and ""Superman Returns"" and I thought they were awful movies. These guys were much better as a part of my imagination!Well, the other day I picked up a Spider-Man movie (Spider-Man DVD Special Edition) off a deep discount shelf and I just had to see what it amounted to. Maybe it helped to have never read Spider-Man comics. In any case, the movie got off to an appealing start and about the first third was an enjoyable, if not somewhat touching, story.  Spider-Man (before transformation) was a teen-aged nerd and he lived next to a very pleasant and nice-looking young lady. They'd lived side by side for a number of years, but had never met. Alas, a reminder of my own shy and misspent youth. In any case, Nerd-Boy gets bitten by a spider and begins to take on some remarkable changes. It doesn't really get going until his Uncle (acting Father) gets killed and then the transformation into Spider-Man takes place in a rather short time. At this point, I quit watching the movie for the rather weak story and started watching it for the sets and remarkable animations.Hollywood is second to none when it comes to movies like this. I'm amazed! It's action, action, action as Spider_Man battles the Green Goblin. Biff, slam, crunch. Destroy this. Destroy that. The movie must have cost a fortune to make! The actors perform gymnastic feats far in excess of that any Olympic athlete could do. And do it in rapid sequential order. Well, you know Spider-Man is going to ultimately win, but who cares? Have you ever been to a Super-Hero movie where he/she didn't win? Alsa, the story is down the drain. I'm watching the wonderful stunts and animations. How do they ever do such things? Who cares about the story? There's an extra DVD (my Spider-Man is the Special Edition package) but I didn't watch it. Perhaps sometime in the future. I want to remain in awe at the marvelous technology, both in this movie and other movies like it. For me, the enjoyment is watching this thing unfold, not the story.Gary Peterson"	5.0	Wonderful Stunts and Animations. Weak Story.	2012-03-03	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1WOFFWF8UYPJ2	Gerald Booth	"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is somewhat of your typical high-school nerd.  He is a borderline genius who can't handle a simple conversation with the girl next door who he has loved for years, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  He works on the school paper, has coke-bottle thick glasses, and is spindly at best.  No wonder he is the point of all cruel jokes.  One day when the school is touring a science lab they go through an exhibit where scientists are trying to genetically mutate spiders combine all the individual powerful attributes of spiders into one ""super-spider.""  Unfortunately they don't know that one is missing.  Parker finds it as it bites him on the hand.  The rest of the day is a blur as he feels himself getting more and more sick.  When he returns to his Aunt and Uncle's house that night he passes out and has strange dreams involving the spider.The next day things are different.  Peter finds he doesn't need his glasses and he appears to have gone from scrawny to having the body of a gymnist as he slept.  Stranger things are beginning to happen as his hands stick to things and a weird web-like substance is coming out of his wrist.  After he defeates the school bully in a joke of a fight he finds himself running in panic into an alley.  When he remembers the bite on his hand he begins to have an idea and, being the scientist that he hopes to be, he tries an experiment.  Before he knows it he is crawling up the side of a building and jumping the roof tops.  He is even learning how to shoot the webs from his wrist.Like most teen-agers who suddenly have power he decides that with a lot of money would come the girl of his dreams.  Parker enters a professional wrestling ring for an exhibition bout dressed as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and promptly destroys the giant of a man.  Unfortunately things begin going to his head and he lets a robber get away from him with devestating consequences.  Suddenly he learns to his horror that, ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.""  Parker uses a newly designed costume as well as increased skill with his powers to help the citizens of New York.Unfortunately Parker is not your average super-hero.  He isn't rich and doesn't have a trust fund so while battling crime on the side, he also has to find a place to live, get a job, see about getting into college, take care of his Aunt, and oh yeah...dare we forget that with the rise of a super-hero and villain is bound to appear?Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the father of Parker's best friend.  He is rich, a brilliant inventor, and after ingesting a super-soldier type formula, quite insane.  Osborn dons the exo-skelton he had been designed for the military as well as stealing a glider and is quickly dubbed The Green Goblin by the press.  As we all know, the two will eventually battle.  The real question is how Parker is going to handle battling a villain who he frequently hangs out with for dinner when Norman drops by to see his son, Harry.This was really well-worth the wait.  Fans of the comic will really not have too many complaints.  Sure they have changed some things for simple continuity but nothing great has been changed.  People who haven't read the comic will also be able to follow this introductory story (since there will most certaintly be a sequel).Sam Raimi directs this with much of the style that he has done similar features previously with the Evil Dead series.  This has many dark tones but is also infused with the humor that helps move the story along.  There were a few slow moments but overall nothing that would cause the fans to lose interest.  The special effects are worth every penny that has been paid.  Certainly many things do look computer generated but it is done in such as style as to closely mimic the drawings that would appear in the comic.Casting was always a major worry in this movie.  Many people, such as myself, were worried to hear that Tobey Maguire had been cast.  Sure he had done a wonderful job in The Cider-House Rules and certainly he had held his own in the idiotic Wonder Boys, but casting him as Spider-Man???  Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Maguire because he certainly did a wonderful job hear.  He definitly was able to handle the dramatic moments and also carried more than a certain sly charm that allowed him to do the trade-mark quips that fans of Spider-Man have come to expect.  He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.  I for one will willingly back him for the sequels and hope that we don't have a fiasco similar to Batman with the actor changing each film.Willem Dafoe is probably ""the weakest link"" in the movie and that is more from the writing of his character than how he does.  I think that at times they made his acting a tad too comic-bookish if you will but that really wouldn't be his fault.I approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.  Spider-Man is a comic-book hero that many can identify with since he seems to have the most human problems of them all.  Thankfully the writers and direction of the movie all worked exceptionally well."	4.0	it was well worth the wait	2002-05-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A15Q9YEG1XPEJN	Get What We Give	"Wow!Since Hollywood has gone completely creatively bankrupt, it seems that comics are the last bastion of ""new"" material for them to use for films.  Too often these films are very poor renditions of their comic counterpart:  Batman and Robin; The Fantastic Four; Spiderman TV series; The Punisher; Captain America; and Tank Girl.There's always room for creative license when transferring mediums, but what is often an overthought is the fan base.  Who goes to see comics to film?  Young adults and kids do.  What do they expect?  Well, they expect something worth their 9 or 10 bucks - that's what.Spiderman delivers a whole lot of film and a whole lot of fun for the money (Okay - so I still think films are waaaaay too expensive, but that's another story).Toby McGuire IS Peter Parker!  Rami cast the part (in fact all the parts) perfectly.  He was right on that it didn't matter who played Spiderman, because whoever it was would be completely disguised.  Peter Parker was the tough character to cast.  Willem DaFoe is excellent as the Green Goblin.How about the story?  It could not have been told more appropriately and succinctly than it is.  Basically, it is the original story from 1962 about how Peter Parker becomes imbued with superhuman powers to later become Spiderman.  Some have argued that Rami and the writers took too much liberty with the character by allowing his web-creation to be internal as opposed to manufactured by Peter.  I beg to differ.  I think that Rami et al made that aspect of the character BETTER than the comic version.Folks, this is a movie.  That said, it's a movie based on a beloved comic and its lead character - and I think that the movie is just about the best comic to film rendition ever done.  Marvel would do well to follow its own example from this film and use the same logic with the next XMen film and any subsequent comics to film made.Go see this film!"	5.0	Top notch action film	2002-05-23	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A73IF5DF3SLXK	Greg Orr	Spider-Man - A name in the minds of every American this week.  And it isn't difficult to figure out why.  In it's first weekend Spider-Man grossed over $114 million, the first movie to ever break $100 million in its first three days.  The film is well on its way to become the fastest film to $200 million, a title currently held by Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, which arrived at the total in 13 days.40 years ago two men began a comic book character that would become a legacy.  Steve Ditko drew the Amazing Spider-Man, while the more popular Stan Lee, who has a cameo appearance in the movie, wrote the comic book.  Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, is a character that people can relate to, which is what has made the comic book so popular.  Spider-Man on the other hand was always misunderstood and made mistakes, which set him apart from all other comic book heroes.It is an amazing treat to see Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, swinging through the streets of New York.  As with any hero, there comes a villain, and Spider-Man has the ultimate villain, the Green Goblin, played spectacularly by Willam Dafoe.  The two super humans go face to face in a battle of wits and strengths, challenging each other's minds and morals.The special effects, supervised by John Dykstra who also supervised the special effects on the pioneer special FX movie, Star Wars, were seamless and out of this world.  As Spider-Man swings from one skyscraper to another, as the Green Goblin flies through the air on his glider, the finished effects are beautiful and virtually undetectable.  I was in awe of the wizardry of visual treats that make up the movie that is Spider-Man.The character relationships in the movie were surprisingly straight forward with the comic book world that they came from.  They were interesting enough without taking too much out of the action of the movie, and the action wasn't too much to take away from the story.  The action was top notch, Spider-Man's actions did not seem too over the top yet he seemed to be characteristic of a man with super human strengths, senses, and reflexes.  The fact the Peter Parker had organic web shooters opposed the classic mechanical web shooters he has had in the comic books for the past 40 years only added to the realism of the movie and helped his character in the story line.With Spider-Man now in the top 100 box-office success films in only the first week, I feel confident that it will continue up the ranks to the top ten in not any longer than two months.  The movie began with a bang and will continue to do so throughout its theatre release until it comes out onto video.  With actors and crew signed on for a second installment and a third in talk people can only wonder what's to come.  I for one will be in line once again on opening day to see what will be.Written Friday, May 10, 2002Spider-Man (R), Green Goblin (R), the characters, (R) & (C) 2002 Marvel Characters, Inc.	5.0	...a name in the minds of every American...	2002-05-18	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOW""Spider-Man"" is an awesome 2002 superhero film from Sony Pictures and Marvel Entertainment.  Starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Defoe, and Kirsten Dunst it pops off of the screen with action and also harbors a thought-provoking storyline.Directed by Sam Raimi and based on the comic book created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, ""Spider-Man"" is mostly exceptional.  Following an obligatory origin story for both hero and villain(Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider, while Norman Osborne essentially poisons himself in an experiment), the movie focuses on the choices Spider-Man makes which define him as the hero from the villainous Green Goblin.  At the center of the story is the call to do the right thing morally when often a path of least resistance seems easier.  In Spider-Man's case, the character is a teenager with enormous power and responsibility thrust on him.  Tobey Maguire plays the emotional conflict well.  As Spider-Man makes a decision to stand for goodness, the Green Goblin, the psychological id of Norman Osborne, consumes him.  There is a genuine tragic quality to the Green Goblin, because the good Norman Osborne regards Peter Parker as nothing less than a son.  This rankles his actual son(and Peter's best friend) Harry, played by James Franco, but that's a story for two other movies to tell.As Mary Jane Watson, Kirsten Dunst is intriguing playing a goodhearted character with a hard home life.  Ms. Dunst has obvious talent and a palpable chemistry with her two young male co-stars.The biggest mistake this movie makes is in costuming.  It is still a mystery to me why they chose to put Willlem Defoe in a metallic green suit as the Goblin.  I prefer the famous naturalistic Goblin of comic books and animation, but it's possible the filmmakers deemed that look too controversial and demonic.Also starring Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris, ""Spider-Man"" is one of the best comic book adaptations of the modern era."	4.0	Extremely good movie slightly downgraded for plastic presentation of its villain	2010-12-18	1	1	0

Can anybody tell me what this wonderful comic became?  A teenie bopper movie.  The CGI wasn't that good either, I mean there were tons of flick flubs with the cgi.  Whats up with the organic webs?!!!?!!!!  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie.  I just don't think it deserves the credit everyone is making over it.  Personally, I think the reason everyone enjoyed this movie was that they needed to feel good about New York city again.  Obviously it worked.  That is why I also feel that Daredevil was not given the time or day.  It was dark, and New York was referred to as, ""hells kitchen"".  Giving New York the feeling of being dirty again.  Now don't get me wrong.  Spiderman made me feel great about New York again, but once I let everything settle down, I saw the movie again.  I realized that the movie wasn't that good.  It was good, but not how everyone makes over it. I probably should have given three stars, but I wanted to draw attention to my post, and I'm too lazy to change.  Should you purchase it?  Yes, but don't worship like its the best thing in the whole entire world.  Then go see Daredevil!!!"	2.0	Give me a break!!!!	2003-05-24	4	3	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3DZBHBHLCLGD2	Guido Rosso	I just watched the movie for the second time at a sneek preview in KL, Malaysia. I went to the premiere here last night, and I expect to be going again soon.Amazing. This movie totally lived up to my expectations. I've always been a Batman and Superman fan, since I was a kid. I occasionally read some Spiderman comics, but I never got much into them.  That, however, has changed since I saw the first trailer for Spiderman. This is probably one of the movies I've most looked forward to seeing, and it beat the hype. The actors are great, the story had me hooked with a great balance of humor and drama, and the special effects are just incredible. It really feels like the comic come to life. The webslinging, dialogue, and even the poses are spot-on. The ending leaves the film open for a sequel, which I'll be greatly looking forward to.I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say more. The only thing I was really annoyed with is the cinema where I watched it. For some reason it wasn't in widescreen, and they censored big chunks of a main scene out of the movie. All the kisses where censored too. I understand that certain things can be inappropriate to show to everyone, but thats why there are movie ratings and censoring a kiss...come on.Anyway I hate to conclude on a bad note, so I'll repeat myself. This movie is great. Two hours of pure spidey bliss. I've rarely enjoyed a movie this much. Mad props to all those involved in making this movie, I hope they crash the box office.	5.0	Amazing.	2002-04-30	29	22	7

When I saw that it was Danny Elfman, I was surprised. His music usually has a very ""small"" feel to it with limited thematic phrases. This felt much larger.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A28ILXH590CMRJ	Hazen B Markoe	"Like everyone else, I was wondering just how the big-budget movie version of Marvel's #1 superhero would play.  After all, audiences had suffered through the over-blown camp of Joel Schumacher's dismal BATMAN & ROBIN, and then were entertained by Brian Singer's solid X-MEN.  Fortunately, director Sam Raimi and his stellar cast create a superhero classic that will rank up there with the first 2 Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batman flicks as the best of their genre.  Indeed, SPIDER-MAN achieves this distinction not for its action, but for its heart.By now, most people are familiar with Spidey's story.  A nerdy high school student, Peter Parker, gains amazing powers after being bitten by a genetically mutated spider during a field trip.  At first, he decides to use his powers for profit.  However, when his thoughtlessness results in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben, he resolves to use them for good...even though many around him question his motives. Indeed, in this movie, the whole story plays as a metaphor for one's coming-of-age...both physically and emotionally.  The casting is solid and most of them find the emotional truth in this unusual story.  Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he succeeds in getting us to empathize and root for him.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane Watson, the girl who he secretly carries a torch for.  Willem Dafoe is delightfully hammy as the menacing Green Goblin.  J.K. Simmons is an absolute scene- stealer as cranky newspaper editor, J. Jonah Jameson.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris add a wonderful touch of class as Peter's guardians, Uncle Ben and Aunt May.At a brisk 2 hours, Raimi keeps the film going at a good clip and the action sequences are engrossing.  He also has fun with his audiences.  Fans of ""Xena:Warrior Princess"" (a TV show that Raimi produced) will get a kick out the various cameos by Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell.  Of course, one could quibble about certain things, mainly how the Goblin's suit makes him look more likely to battle the Pink Ranger than Spider-Man, but the movie is so fun that you don't really care.All too often, most comic-book based films get caught up only in the action and characterization and depth get ignored as a result.  This film doesn't, making SPIDER-MAN that rare thing indeed.....a superhero film with heart.  Highly recommended."	5.0	SPIDER-MAN is a superhero thriller with heart	2002-05-07	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2IVSX9CFYQKZO	Heather Lawson	"Peter Parker was such a nice boy with a very nice Aunt and Uncle.  It was a storybook family picture, which was refreshing.  The part of the movie that turned me off, was the disrespect that Peter showed his Uncle in one scene.  The love and support Peter got from his Aunt and Uncle was not worthy of the comment Peter made to his Uncle about don't try to be my father.  The writers could have thought of a much more noble reason for ""OUR HERO"",Spider-man, to seek revenge.  Disrespecting people in authority is rampant in this country amongst our youth, and portraying Peter Parker as having this same disrespectful attitude was unnecessary.  Aside from that issue, the storyline as a whole was lame.  It was lacking in creativity and villians.  Since the end of the movie was inviting to a sequel, my suggestion is to start the team of writers brainstorming now, so that Spidey II doesn't come across as being written in a day."	3.0	Too much hype!	2002-05-06	3	0	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3IF5BJFPH8OG5	Hectic	I just got back from seeing the movie and it got standing ovations from evrybody at the end credits.  (Including me!)  I'm not a heavy Spiderman fan, or of comic books in general.  (Heck, I've never really even touched a comic book before.)  But I watched all the 90's Spiderman cartoon's and played the PC games and that's enough to know how the comic books go and judge the movie...and it was right on!  The story was well written, the acting was top-notch, and the web-slinging effects and fighting scenes were the best I've ever seen in a movie.  People who are hardcore Spidey fans should like it too, since the movie goes by the book...the comic book that is!  (Except for how Peter develops his web-slinging abilities.  Instead of web-shooters, the ability comes along with all the rest of his powers from the spider bite.)  That's the one and only thing I wish they would have kept the same from the comic books.  Anyway, you can't please everybody, which will probably come out in reviews.  But let me tell you, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  It is definately worth the money and you won't be disappointed.	5.0	SPIDERMAN Sticks It To 'Em!!!	2002-05-03	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2ENJGKZZCVNKK	"Henry-Clyde ""cLaSsIc MoViE lOvEr AnD bOoK rEaDeR"""	"Recently, superhero films have been an extremely effective genre in Hollywood. It is undeniable that superhero films are the movies that endure the most hype these days. If made correctly, these kind of movies offer plenty of action, thrills, and character, while also being impressively designed and using some of the best special effects teams around. Bryan Singer's ""X-MEN"" was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century. It raised the bar so high, the audiences were astounded and it seemed like no other movie, superhero or otherwise, could surpass it. That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" and, to a lesser extent, ""IRON MAN"". However, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is nothing to sneeze at either.High school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His next door neighbor happens to be the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom Peter has loved since ""before he even liked girls"". Peter is also best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose dad is Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Norman is overly ambitious with his company, Oscorp (which supplies weapons and special equipment to the military), and wants to give Harry everything that he never had in his younger days. One life-changing day, Peter's class goes on a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. During the tour, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically enhanced ""super-spider"" that escaped from an exhibit. That night, Norman is testing one of his company's performance enhancers on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and Norman becomes the incredibly strong yet viciously insane Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has undergone a night of dizziness and a stomach ache due to the spider bite. In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain ""spider-sense"" to warn him of danger. Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry. She also thinks she loves Spider-Man after he saves her life twice. Goblin is suspicious of Spider-Man's true identity. He also feels threatened by Parker, but has not yet made the connection between the two. They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie.But, at the end of the day, ""SPIDER-MAN"" still has its faults. For example, what is Goblin's plan? We understand his revenge against the Quest Aerospace officials and the Oscorp board members, but what else is there? He has a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, but why? Just to write it off as him being insane is not sufficient. Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider-Man swinging through the city. They play and look like a video game, with the camera seeming to be too distant and too close at the same time. The feeling of all the tension, fear, and confusion of his new powers is actually not felt at all; he acts more like a kid in a candy shop. Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time. Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good. The only scene of this kind that works in this film is the ending, which was filmed with the Spyder-Cam. It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in ""SPIDER-MAN 2"", and I would assume it was used in #3 as well, but I haven't seen that one yet. As a matter of fact, everything in #2 is improved over #1. The acting, action pieces, dialogue, and especially the villain. Nevertheless, everything in this film still comes together reasonably well, with only a few drawbacks.SPECIAL FEATURES- Audio commentary with director Sam Raimi & producer Grant Curtis, Kirsten Dunst and producer Laura Ziskin- Audio commentary with special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew- ""Weaving the Web"" optional pop-up factoids throughout film- ""Spider-Sense"" optional Web-i-sodes throughout film- Music videos with Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott: ""HERO"", Sum 41: ""WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT""- TV Spots- Theatrical Trailers- Filmographies & Character Files- DVD-ROM: Comic/Feature Comparison, Record Your Own Commentary, Countdown to ""SPIDER-MAN 2"", Weblinks- HBO Making of Spider-Man- Spider-Mania: An E!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A457S8SW690NM	hi	While this movie isn't as good as its sequel, it still is awesome. The movie does a nice job of telling the stroy of Spiderman. For those of you that don't know the plot, this movie is about a nerdy photographer named Peter Parker who lives with his aunt and uncle. He has a huge crush on Mary Jane Watson, his neighbor, but she probably doesn't. But, he suddenly changes once he gets bitten by a spider. He acquires superpowers and do wrestling to win money to buy a car so that Mary Jane will like him. He wins but the boss refuses to give him the amount that he owed. Spidey then doesn't stop a robber to make his point towards the boss's lies but he has made a big mistake. The robber then kills Spidey's uncle and then he gets revenge and becomes Spiderman. From then, he fights crime and then must fight a new vilain named the Green Goblin.The movie is so good because it introduces the nerdy and weak Peter Parker and it then shows his developpment into a superhero. The visuals are gorgeous and the fights are awesome. The acting is also great with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe perfect for their roles. A must see.	5.0	Great superhero movie!	2005-06-28	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This famous fiction personage follows in its basic conceptual roots, similar traces of its predecessors; Superman and Batman. Once more the myth is born again; our local hero `s origins are diffuse. As its ancestors he is orphan; hence he has not common roots with his community; all of them are shy and intend by all their means have not love affairs that eventually might lead us to marriage; the hero must not leave inheritors, because that would mean the end of his role in this world.But there are specific differences: NYC is NYC, there was not any masked metaphor allusive to it such as Gothic City or Metropolis. He is not an alien as Superman; on the contrary, his super powers proceed from natural causes, through an unexpected genetic crossroad.The film merits lays undeniable, on a very amusing parade of special effects here and there with a touch of suggested sex, when covered by a suspenseful action, his secret love is blockaded by four intruders in the middle of a rainy and lonely street.From the times of The Phantom (1996), the industry had not generated any other carton hero. And the election of Tobey Maguire could not be more fortunate. He possesses all the attributes for the character, an undeniable charisma. Dafoe is fabulous as the sinister villain. Do not scrape too much underneath the script, just forget the quotidian reality and come inside this evasive diversion.Adequate familiar entertainment.	4.0	Two hours of delirious evasion!	2005-12-26	1	0	1

The creators took some liberties with the storyline so as to make it appeal to the masses. This is a pretty typical tendency that you see with most comic book (Xmen, Hulk, Punisher) and fantasy (Lord of the Rings, D&amp;D) movies.An entertaining movie with some great visuals, it nevertheless suffers in a few places from some absolutely AWFUL dialogue.. Talk about cheese.. FEH!

But I remembered how dreadful the past 2 Batman films had been, and hoped against hope that Spider-Man would be better.Was it ever.Before I go further, I'll go over the plot. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is your average high school dork. On a field trip to Columbia University's science lab, he gets bit by a genetically engineered spider. The bite gives Peter exceptional agility, stamina, and strength, as well as the unique ability to spin webs from his wrists. Originally using his powers for self-gain, he decides to change his ways when his Uncle Ben is killed by a gunman in a carjacking that he could have prevented. Living by Uncle Ben's motto, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" Peter becomes Spider-Man. His powers come to the ultimate test when New York is terrorized by the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).The acting was solid on all counts. Maguire was good both as the nerdy Peter Parker and the wisecracking Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst, who plays love interest and high school student Mary Jane Watson, wasn't spectacular but had great chemistry with Maguire. Dafoe was over-the-top at times as Green Goblin, but there was one scene in particular involving a mirror that was maybe the finest scene in the movie. Supporting actor J.K. Simmons stoke the show as J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of a newspaper trying to make Spider-Man come out looking like a criminal.This DVD is loaded with tons of special features and easter eggs (special features not listed on the menu that you have to 'hunt' for). Included is a gallery of Spider-Man artists, the HBO Special ""Making of Spider-Man,"" and various character files. One of my favorite easter eggs was a CGI gag reel. Good luck finding it, though.Overall, director Sam Raimi has created a comic book movie that's not just for comics fans. Smart, witty, dramatic...Spider-Man has it all, and special feautures that you'll actually watch. I can't recommend it enough."	5.0	Everything you want in a DVD	2002-11-17	2	0	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	"I've always been a Spider-Man fan, and this movie is well done.  Excellent retelling of Spider-Man's origin.  Brilliant casting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst makes a very appealing Mary Jane Watson.One technicality that probably had been mentioned:  the original Spiderman created his own webbing by making web shooters.  This led to suspense in the comic books when he runs out of web-fluid.  Here, the webs are part of his spider abilities, with no explanation why the ""I love you"" hand signal releases it.  The special effects of the webs were excellent, light years ahead of the late '70's TV series.Many mentioned that the Green Goblin could have been better.  Make-up could probably worked to make the Goblin's face more mobile as in the comics, as opposed to the expressionless metal mask in the movie.  But DaFoe made a chilling villain.One drawback:  the final battle between Spidey and the Goblin is faithful to Spiderman #122 (""The Green Goblin's Last Stand""), and also had been done by one of the animated Spiderman series (though the animated had more adapting than the movie did).I enjoyed the Batman and X-Men movies more, but this still was a very good movie.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment.	2.0	Garish and cartoony	2004-04-10	6	2	4

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. Not knowing anything about the background of the Spiderman legend, I felt that the movie was a good mix of both explaining how Peter Parker became Spiderman and a full-length plot of his first encounter with a true villain. I normally don't like when movies these days rely too much on CGI, but I think that's a little bit unavoidable in a movie where the main character is jumping from building to building using just a few strands of a web! There was a pretty decent balance of fake stuff and plot. I'll always prefer movies based on acting (but that is just me; a lot of people love action movies). But I have to say a superhero doing these things is so much better than watching ordinary human beings doing impossible things like fighting on top of a moving train or dodging bullets!One thing I have to note is that Mary Jane Parker does not hold a candle to Lois Lane as the hero's girl. And Clark Kent has a much better conscience. But all in all a pretty good movie. I also enjoyed Spiderman 2. Spiderman 3 was a little bit overdone, I thought. Three villains and three plots at the same time, or something like that. Too much for one movie."	4.0	A decent hero movie	2012-06-30	2	0	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A28FD6UUCDEITK	"Izzy ""Izzy"""	I'm not going to review the movie, it speaks for itself and you either like it or not.  I purchased this disc to experiment with the 4K Mastering.  I can see little if any difference in this 4K mastered edition than my older Spiderman 1 BluRay.  I'm using a new Oppo Player with a Pioneer Kuro Elite TV.  Since I've just received the disc, I haven't had the time to call Oppo to determine if their new players support the Deep Color format but I'm assuming they do.  My Kuro TV does support Deep Color providing it's receiving the signal.  Since I'm not totally convinced the Oppo is setup for this format, I'll hold off further comments until I know for sure.  Other than that, this disc certainly doesn't blow me away.  I've got plenty of other discs that have much better PC.  Nothing great here, so far.  IMHO, it's all marketing hype by Sony trying to promote their new UltraHD TV's.  Until someone manufactures a player and software that truly output UHD material, I'll just keep my Kuro Elite PRO151 and my Oppo player.  I expected much better.	3.0	4K Marketing Hype	2013-07-20	2	1	1

My sister feels most films about sci-fi or super hero to be garbage. Well this film pleased us both and in my opinion has to be one of the best adaptation of a comic book hero to the big screen.Th special effects were very good, the acting by Tobey and company also very good. What I enjoyed the most was the humor that the film had. One thing that Spiderman fans like about the hero is the humor.The film will appeal to die-hard fans to even people that know nothing about Spiderman.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3D5UHUD1CMTXG	"Jacki ""Jack Mueller"""	It was in the summer of 2002, when The Web-Slinger finally hit the big screen. Toby Maguire asumed the role of the web-head and portarys Spidey truly. The beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst also steps up for the film and she takes on the role of Mary Jane Watson. Director Sam Rami, a fan of the comics, keeps the story and details of Spidey's world as true as one can with today's technology. When Peter Parker is bitten by a geneticly enchanced super-spider, he receives more than just a painful infected bite. The once skinny photographer wakes up a morning after the incident, and soon realizes that he has developed more than just bigger muscles, and better vision. In the next few days, Parker discovers what new abilites he has been given and how they will help him change the world. Except, his quest for good is soon disrupted when the existance of The Green Goblin is finally revealed at a public gathering of Oscorp associates and family members in downtown New York. Parker comes to the conclusion that it is up to him and his alter-ego to stop the hostile menace in order to protect the ones he loves. But, the duration of the battle and its grand finale between the duo may be too much for the young Peter Parker to handle.	5.0	It's Just Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man	2006-07-09	0	0	0

The acting was poor, the long drawn out proffesions of love by kirsten dunst and peter parker made me want to throw something at the screen. A slow begining just got progressivly worse. I couldn't believe it. When the green goblin, who looked like an idiot in that suit, said ""the itsy bitsy spider"" i wanted to walk out. If it hadn't been so close to the end of the movie i would have. Never have i been so dissapointed in a movie, ever. The only other movie i've seen in theaters that bad was Wing Commander with Freddie Prince JR. Props to Josh Krogan of Nickleback for writing an awesome song. Wait for it to go to the dollar movies.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2SZFHWX92NQ5F	Jamy Shaffer	For all of the comic book super hero movies being made recently, Spider-Man is definately the best.  The acting, special effects, and plot line are all superb.  Everytime I watch it (which is quite often), I still find myself in awe about the whole experience.Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe were brilliantly cast in the three pivotal roles.  Each one exemplified the parts brilliantly while not being overly done.  After all, it is only a comic book fantasy.  Mr. Maguire perfectly captured the role of a high-school outsider pining for the affections of a girl who seems to be out of bounds.  And is an absolute delight to behold as he screams with glee at his new found abilities.The writers captured the story of Spidey to a t.  Spider-Man has such heart and soul that any person could see themselves in the shoes of Peter Parker.  After all, who among us has never dreamed of being something more, wished they had asked that girl out, or fantasized about doing the daring dos that our friendly neighborhood web-slinger can do?With the coming sequels on the way one can hope and expect that they will all live up to the original.	5.0	Amazing Spider-Man	2003-08-18	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2RQZG0FUSSMPJ	Jamy Shaffer	"For as long as I can recall, I have always been enamored by Spider-Man.  As a young child, I remember watching reruns of the 60s cartoon and the live action series of the 70s thinking that they were cool.  In the 80s there was Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (Fire Star and Ice Man) and I thought this was even better.  In the 90s Fox brought the character back to Saturday mornings among all of the ridiculous teen shows which replaced the cartoons of years gone by.  Now, finally we get a live action motion picture of my favorite neighborhood do-gooder.Hollywood reports that the idea has been bandied around for nearly 20 years and it is a good thing that we have waited.  Like the continuing Star Wars saga, the things done in this thrill-a-minute epic could not have been achieved ten years ago.  The action sequences would not have been plausible without the leaps made by the animators and computers of today.  The awesome sequence wherein Spidey leaps on and over gigantic balloon figures could only recently be realized.  But all of the breathtaking visuals are not what makes this movie special.  There is so much more.All of the lore surrounding the origin of Spidey is seen.  Bravo to Sam Raimi, a true Spider-Man afficianado!!!!  Peter Parker is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  He is bitten by a genetically altered spider and given amazing powers.  We see Peter grow from a socially outcast teenager into an adult who has flaws.  As in the comic, Peter learns a painful lesson from Uncle Ben.  This is one of my favorite all-time lines anywhere : ""WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.""  Stan Lee wrote those words 40 years ago in the premiere edition of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book, and they are as much a part of this movie as they were then.The entire cast was super!!! Tobey Maguire is brilliant as both Parker and Spider-Man.  He is a geeky four-eyed egghead who can't even talk to M.J. The audience can feel the exuberance as Peter discovers and begins to experiment with his new power. Kirsten Dunst is so much more than the typical cardboard cutout heroine.  Willem Dafoe is masterful as the Jekyll/Hyde-ish Green Goblin.  James Franco was also great as the outcast son who takes a back seat to Peter for the attention of his father.This fantastic movie definately screams sequel.  My wish is that Mr. Raimi helms all of them and the cast remains intact  Hopefully, the characters will evolve so that the films will become better than other notable superhero franchises which fell by the wayside after their first time out.  Superman and Batman became laughable after each sequel because their characters were not developed.  Tobey Maguire at least will make sure that this will not happen.  Sam Raimi's passion for the characters should be realized.  Bring on Doc Oc!!!!"	5.0	An Amazingly Faithful Comic to Movie Adaptation	2002-05-07	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A13BLSXL78EMRX	Jason Troy	"Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to ""Spiderman"" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****"	4.0	The Wall Crawler	2006-04-28	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A31IFLAAZO672R	Jay J. Banks	I&iexcl;ll admit that I wasn&iexcl;t a die hard Spider-Man fan in the past.  I was a Batman fan but this film is visually and emotionally amazing.  This film does not go camp nor does is borrow on ideas already seen in superhero films.  It is almost a real human story.  You are left sympathizing for Peter Parker and his struggles and then cheering him on as he continues to do what is right despite all of his personal setbacks. Tobey Maguire did for this film what Michael Keaton did for Batman.  He is the essential Spider-Man.  You see that he feels right at home as Spider-Man and succeeds at making Peter Parker his own.  What is arguably the greatest and most successful comic book films of all time, it is almost as if you are reading a comic book.Willem Dafoe is simply astonishing as the Green Goblin.  While it is true that he does not compare to Nicholson as the Joker and Hackman as Luthor, he stands on his own as Osborn.  In the beginning, he&iexcl;s an ordinary billionaire, but after the accident, the transition he makes from businessman to raving psychotic is simply amazing.  You can tell he studied his character because his diction and his facial expressions are amazing if not straight out of the comics.  I remember feeling that Kirsten Dunst was miscast as Mary Jane but when I saw the film, I changed my mind.  This young lady is going places and it shows.  Mary Jane is portrayed as more of a victim in this film than she ever has in the comics or on the animated TV shows and it works.  Dunst&iexcl;s performance is breathtaking as she blends together the right mix of class, savvy, and sex appeal to make Mary Jane one of the most memorable comic book heroines ever portrayed on film.All in all, a great film which should be looked at as one of the greatest of all time.  The violence may turn some of you off but a comic book film without violence is like a romance film without kisses.  The CGI is off the charts, every time I watch it, I have difficulty telling the CGI from the real stuff.  That is amazing.  LOTR may be looked at as the better film visually and critically, but this is one film that we will not soon forget.	5.0	The film does whatever a Spider-Man can	2003-02-11	0	0	0

Spider-Man truly delivered all the action, excitement, and special effects that the hype promised.  Maguire was a fantastic and surprisingly studly Spider-Man.  Dafoe was born to play villains so no complaints there either.  I am not even a fan of the comic book or the cartoon but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Although the action and themes were perhaps a bit intense for a young audience, at least it wasn't overly gory.  That's a huge plus in my book.

Was there only $$ forty-nine ninety-nine in funds allocated to the special effects budget?Also, a mild irritant during the picture was Willem Dafoe's somewhat ""meaningless"" presence in the picture.  One of the things superb ""comic"" books have, in general, is an adequate nemesis for the hero.  It makes one's heroic deeds that much more...""heroic.""  Lex Luther and Magneto (of Supermman and XMen fame, respectively), were ambitious ""thinking men's"" men, had purpose, and, ultimately, were the driving force of the story.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A5K5UQT9XAAZP	jeda	Here's my movie review:First, I'll start with a synopsis.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) starts off as a normal geek trying to get the girl of his dreams (Kirsten Dunst).  He then gets bit by a spider and gains some superhero powers.  He puts on a costume and turns into Spider Man, and then goes out to stop crime and face down his enemy the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), who happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco).  Well, I didn't go into great detail but you get the point.Sure, this is a souless movie blockbuster, but it grabs your attention.  Two hours may be to long to sit through a movie like this, and the movie may not change you or affect your life, but their is enough action to hold you over.  The actors all turn in suprisingly good performances, even a scence-stealing JK Simmons as a newspaper reporter.  I reccomend this movie to anyone in need of a two hour pleasure ride.Now, on to the DVD extras.  Wow, two discs of extras.  There are so many extras its unbelievable.  Im not going to go into great depth for each one, but there are so many that you will have to spend days if you want to see each one.Movie: 4 starsExtras: 5 starsTotal: 4.5 stars	4.0	Good Movie, Lots Of Extras	2003-05-13	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	The biggest hit of the year is now available on DVD.  Spiderman, I think, was one of the best films of 2002.  It had a good story, great acting, good special effects, and great action sequences.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I had a smile on my face all the way through it.  It's big and it's fun.  The DVD is also quite good.Movie: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is hopelessy in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst).  Peter gets bitten by a genetic spider while on a field trip.  Suddenly, he is able to shoot out spiderwebs, and basically be a spider.  After the tragic death of his uncle, Peter decides to use his new powers to fight crime.  From then on, he becomes Spider Man.  But, he must also fight the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) in order to save those he loves.  A great action-adventure movie everyone will love.DVD:Video: The disc comes in a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer.  A Pan & Scan version is also available.  The image looks quite good, if not great.  There are a few flaws, and the picture can occassionally be a little bright.  All in all, pretty good picture quality.  (4.5/5)Sound:  The movie comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix.  I was hoping for a little more enveloping sound, but good overall.  (4.5/5)Features:  There is an HBO making of, the evoltion of Spiderman, TV Spots, trailers, music videos, and much more.  Features are a little bit promotional, but interesting.  (4.5/5)Overall: (4.7/5)  The 5 star rating is for the movie itself.	5.0	Spider Man DVD Review	2002-11-06	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A18UMI5W355FLB	Jeff Pettorino	Since Stan Lee was involved in the making of this film, it has stayed close in many respects to the original story, at least in so far as Spidey's inception.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2M56IJL2Y21RC	Jeffrey D. Reger	It's just a fun movie.  Special effects were great, and some of the liscense they took was actually an improvement.  Maguire played an good Parker, with that geeky kind of outlook on everything.  For a first movie that has to introduce everything and everybody, they did a wonderful job (much better than I expected).  Defoe overplayed his role a bit, but that is kind of his calling card anyways.  The web slinging was excellently done (computers are wonderful things).Yeah, if you are looking for a movie that is 100% comic book faithful, you might be a bit irritated at some of the changes.  But if you are looking for that, you need to stay away from Hollywood all together.If you are looking for a fun night with the family, or just want a good fun action flick, this is a definite good choice.  I even got to see it on a plane ride back from France.  Watching Spiderman swing around the city, while the plane is undergoing turbulance is a VERY interesting feeling.  :)	5.0	Excellent Movie to see again and again	2003-01-13	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"This movie follows in the tradition of other great super hero films such as the Batman Series and Dick Tracy.  Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, your typical high school nerd.  One day, Peter's science class takes a field trip to the Columbia University science lab.  While he's there, Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered spider.  Almost immediately, Peter begins to change.  His senses heighten and his scrawny body is transformed into that of a professional athlete.  Its not long before Peter is jumping between buildings.Soon, Peter enters an amateur wrestling match with the hopes of winning the top prize of $3000.  His opponent is Bonesaw McGraw, played by none other than legendary pro wrestler Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage. Spider-Man has been born.Its not long before Spider-Man is swinging from building to building, helping people and fighting crime.  But, Spider-Man also has an enemy, the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn, played superbly by Willem Dafoe.  He flies around on a type of hovercraft, all the while wreaking havoc on the city and its people.The acting is excellent throughout the movie.  MaGuire, Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) give top notch performances.  The special effects are stunning as well.

Immediatly after returning home Peter falls to the floor and hours after passing out he awakens to notice that his body is now more muscular, he doesn't need glasses, and he's able to shoot webs from his wrists.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AUF4NPBMOU0JQ	Jerry Yamamuro	I purchased this DVD because I went through a Marvel comic book phase when I was growing up. So I thought it might be fun to see. Reviews on the movie were reasonably good, too. However, like many movies of this genre (action-adventure-superheroes), it tries to overcome its inherent flaws in script with overdone and interminably long special effects sequences that defy all physical laws.I made the serious mistake of viewing the special features on the 2nd DVD disk first. They were very imaginative and interesting and it increased my expectations for the movie. Unfortunately, my expectations were clearly not met. My major complaint is that the script was just too thin and absolutely predictable. Are all producers/directors are still trying to recreate (copy?) the Titanic phenonmenon (see Pearl Harbor et al). Also, Kirsten Dunst looks ridiculous in a red wig. However, Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were well cast. Overall an average movie.	3.0	The special features on the DVD were better than the movie	2002-11-11	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AMPEIRONNDP4A	Jesper N. Christensen	When I first heard of the massive amounts of cash that this movie was making I was delighted. Finally, a movie with Spidey that might just live up to the task. Unfortuneately, I was wrong!I won't describe the movie's plot here, let's just say that everything is as it is in the comic.However, The Green Goblin (wonderfully evil Willem Dafoe) is a sad disappointment. Ever wonder why he wasn't shown in the trailers? It's because his suit makes him look like a Power Ranger (remember those?)! Damn, if they can make Spidey so cool, why not Goblin? In all truth, the villains are usually the most fun to watch... Anyway, the acting is apart from Dafoe horrible, especially Kirsten Dunst who is alltogether not very attractive.The next problem is the endless dialogue. Blah, blah, BLAH! You end around just waiting for the action sequences, which by all rights are just crazy!The film also lacks a real plot. This boils down to the fact that Goblin doesn't have a real goal, like taking over the city or something. He just doesn't like Spiderman for some reason, and they fight, that's it...All in all: 2 stars for the action, nothing for the rest.	2.0	Great expectations?	2002-05-31	8	0	8

It only had one problem that would have givin it 3 stars, but the plot, cast, special effects, and showdowns were too good.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AWN6ZMWWMUWLX	J. Friday	It is hard to turn a story based on a comic book into something thrilling, that's why I give the scriptwriter the benefit of the doubt. Despite the fact that the script was better than Spiderman 2 this script still stank.Don't get me wrong, the action and graphics were intense and thrilling but the story stank. It's about science geek Peter Parker who can't get his love, Mary Jane, to go out with him but rather he just acts like a puss and let's other jerks get her. He lives next door to her yet he's afraid to talk to his own neighbor. Jeepers what a douch.Peter's luck changes for the good when he gets raped by a radioactive spider turning into Spiderman. What happens to the spider is anyone's guess. Peter saves the day with cool moves and at the end has a chance is get some booty from Mary Jane but decides he wants to go home and masturbate to comic books underneath his bed. The real reason he doesn't get with MJ is because she's afraid she'll get hurt because of the dangerous life he leads.

It's also rare to see a mass-market movie that isn't laden with cliches.  The lead story, Peter Parker's coming of age, is surprising in its depth and sincerety.  Equally so is how developed Mary Jane's character was, particularly in light of the fact that the majority of the film's running time is reserved for Spider Man and Green Goblin's origins-and of course the action scenes.  The film merits four stars because it has heart, a rare element in Hollywood films of any stripe, let alone the action blockbuster.  How can you not root for a superhero that was a bigger dork than you were in high school?  Plus, this movie is really cool.	4.0	A spider with a big heart	2002-05-27	1	1	0

Superhero movies of late haven't been that great (The Hulk was an endless, rambling movie with no talent; the recent Batman movies have been nothing more than guano). And, to top it all off, I always thought Spider-Man was kind of a loser of a superhero..he is a spider, after all. But this movie changed that.Peter Parker was a normal kid in love with a flirtatious redhead named Mary Jane (just like the comics - wow!). He gets bit by a spider, meets the Green Goblin (a.k.a. best friend's dad), saves the world, and kind of gets his girl. It's a typical superhero storyline, but was directed brilliantly. Much of the time focuses on his transformation from normal to freak, which is very amusing and worth watching. There are dozens of characters which you won't be forgetting anytime soon. But I guess that's the point.. If you're going to watch a comic book-turned movie  made in recent years, this is the one to watch.

If you read Ebert's review or saw his show recently then you know what I'm talking about. For one thing I think those scenes with him web slinging look flawless. Even if it looked totally [bad] I still wouldn't give the film a bad review because of it.  Sam Raimi (Darkman, Army of Darkness) does a fantastic job of bringing Spiderman to life on the big screen. Raimi who is a big fan of Spiderman himself was perfect to direct this movie and I hope he directs each  and every sequel because no one is better for the job. I was a big fan of the Cartoon show in the 90's and everything I loved about is here.I was a little surprised that Newsday which is usually picky and loves giving low ratings actually gave it ****, I didn't expect such a high rating at all.  After seeing the movie I understand why though. It has everything, action, romance comedy and drama. It's the perfect date movie too I must add. The action scenes are incredible for one thing, the movement's quick and if you blink you might miss something but to me that's what made it fun. Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst are just adorable together, they share a lot of cute and heart warming scenes. Tobey's perfect in this movie, enjoyed his performance so much that I wouldn't mind seeing him get an oscar nomination. He has so much to overcome in this movie and each and every feeling he shows...you believe.  That's how good he is.William Dafoe is also very good as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. An experiment gone wrong creates this split personality for him which drives him completely insane. Although he wears this Green Goblin costume and raises hell with glider inside he's still a decent man that has a love for his son who he has been too busy for a lot of the time. It puzzles me how Raimi manages to throw all these things together so nicely in just a 2 hour movie.

The film itself, the image quality, and the audio specs all remain the same as the previous blu-ray release:Spider-Man [Blu-ray].Here are the main differences between the previous Spider-Man blu-ray and this newer version:- Bonus Material, including an audio commentary and several featurette (all of which come from the Special Edition DVD but were not on the previous blu-ray) have been included here.- There is new cover art for the blu-ray- Included is an Ultraviolet streaming copy of the film that works with various portable devices so that you can watch the film on-the-go.Obviously, the studio is releasing this new blu-ray to capitalize on/promote ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" film which arrives in theaters this summer.  But the least they could have done for this ""new"" blu-ray is give us some new material, whether it be an extended cut of the film or some new features.So while I love this movie, I really see no reason to buy it again because it doesn't add much to the experience that I am getting now with the previous Spider-Man discs that I own.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	APRU373UYVK2Y	J. N. Mohlman	"""Spider-Man"" as directed Sam Raimi, serves to prove that a movie can be greater than the sum of its parts.  There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.  However, when all of these elements are rolled in to one, you get a movie that is not just good, but great.  ""Spider-Man"" is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.  For example, it is my opinion that the X-Men movie took itself far too seriously, while conversely, the later Batman films weren't anywhere near serious enough.Driving this movie is the acting of its two main characters, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane.  While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.  Peter Parker is supposed to be withdrawn, a nerd really, and Maguire plays the role to perfection.  On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.  Much has been made of her scenes wearing a tank-top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.  However, she is also a very talented actor who conveys the full gamut of human emotion in her facial expressions.  I came into this movie not expecting much from her, and left very impressed.  The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.  He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.The story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider-Man comics.  That said, it was no less enjoyable for its predictability.  In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.  While deleted scenes are noticeably absent, they are more than made up for by outtakes, commentary, making of footage, music videos and DVD-ROM content.  You definitely get a lot of bang for the buck with this two-disc set.Ultimately, ""Spider-Man"" accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.  It isn't pretentious, or riddled with `inside' jokes, but it also doesn't descend into slapstick.  It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.  In conclusion, I guess the highest praise I can offer this movie is that I can't believe I have to wait another year for the sequel to come out!Enjoy!"	5.0	Great transition from the comics to the big screen	2003-01-25	3	2	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Joanna Daneman	&quot;Spider-man&quot; is a very good send-up of a comic book hero. The director Sam Raimi filmed many scenes in such a way as to almost seem like paging through a comic-book's storyboard while watching the exciting action and stunts. (For example, there's a scene where you see the DNA being mutated and this is what you'd see in a panel on a page in a comic book, explaining how Spider-man got that way.) Tobey Macguire is believable as Peter Parker, nerdy teenager who becomes a superhero, and Willem Dafoe is always reliably nasty as a villain. His facework in the scene showing the dual Dr. Osborn-Green Goblin is worthy of an Oscar. A bit role played by by J. K. Simmons as &quot;J. Jonah Jameson, Daily Bugle Editor&quot; was particularly amazing--he looked exactly like the comic book drawing.The surround-sound was quite distinct in this DVD--in fact, sometimes it seemed a bit contrived, as you could hear vehicles pulling up behind you, but they were clearly forward of the action on screen. However, for the explosions and special effects, the surround sound plus the wide-screen format made the action film very exciting on the home screen. We didn't regret that we missed this in the theater.	5.0	Widescreen Spider-man is great on the home theater	2002-11-17	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AEPJYN0NAX9N4	Jody L. Schoth	Our entire family enjoyed this movie. However, the love scene is a bit dry, and the relationships between all the characters are simply a bit sad in many cases. Some of the characters, especially Spider Man's love interest and best friend, are a bit shallow - and some of the scenes seem to attempt to prove otherwise, when the characters actions speak much louder.On a more positive note, I felt the reason for the characters transformation into Spiderman were quite interesting, the main character was enjoyable to watch as he grew with his new responsibilities.  The special effects were very good, not working so hard on realistic, but instead gave the old comic book feel.Though I did enjoy the movie, I felt there was simply too much left unexplored. I believe it could have been so much better, but not bad for a one time viewing. I would recommend renting it, not purchasing it.	3.0	Spider Man	2002-11-24	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A24JQTKGA5RAKX	JoeAZ92	Spider-man is a hugely popular film franchise, and it's not without good reason. The first film is great with good acting, great special effects and music, and a great starting point for the story. It involves Peter Parker getting bitten by some kind of genetically enhanced spider, giving him the famous powers Spider-man is known for. After that you get the green goblin involved (a guy who does a science experiment on himself... but it doesn't go so well) and you have some good fight scenes and some cheesy but funny lines. There are a few particularly memorable scenes, the cage fight near the film's beginning being one of them. So overall I highly recommend Spider-man to anyone who likes action movies and now that it's offered for such cheap prices you barely have any excuse to not see it!	4.0	A great superhero movie	2008-12-04	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A164XNH8MW3SF1	Joe	"With the release of TASM this past summer, and fanboys boasting about Andrew Garfield and the reboot, I can't help but remind others of the original Spider-Man movies. This movie and Spider-Man 2 unfortunately have gotten a lot of undeserved hate recently because of the reboot and also because of Spider-Man 3. But not to worry, I'm here to defend this one! I'm not here to rag on the reboot, I actually really liked it but I feel that this one needs the recognition it deserves.This movie really amazed me as a kid because before, I never really cared for superheroes that much especially Spider-Man. But all that disappeared as I watched this in the theater with my Dad. When those opening titles with Danny Elfman's music started, I knew I was in for something special. Even today, I still think this is an awesome movie. Yes some of it does get cheesy, especially with the Green Goblin and the damsel in distress act that Kirsten Dunst keeps playing gets annoying but overall I think this one still holds up.Shy and awkward science nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider and discovers the next day that he has these extraordinary powers such as superhuman strength, ""spider-sense"", wall-crawling abilities and the ability to shoot webs out of his wrists. He's so amazed with his newfound powers that he decides to use them to win money and hopefully to impress the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). It's only through the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) that he decides to use his powers to help those in need, and becomes Spider-Man. It gets even tougher when Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) looses his sanity during an experiment at Oscorp and becomes the Green Goblin.Tobey Maguire is outstanding at being the guy who can rarely catch a break, and perfectly embodies the 98 pound weakling becoming a changed man once he becomes a heroic figure. Kirsten Dunst is good and very easy on the eyes as Mary Jane even though the damsel in distress act gets very repetitive at times. Not her fault though. Willem Dafoe always plays a great bad guy, even though his character is over the top. I like how this movie accurately captures the estranged relationship between Norman and Harry much like in the early comics, and how Norman always seemed to favor Peter over Harry. The other actors such as James Franco, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson (RIP) deliver also, especially J.K. Simmons who was perfectly cast as Jameson.The movie looks great and feels like the comic book in a lot of ways, especially since Sam Raimi was a huge fan of the character as a kid, and honors the comics from the 60's and early 70's very well. I never read that many comics before seeing this movie, but now that I have read some I really like how Raimi sticks to the comics in a lot of ways in this movie by bringing a lot of scenes from Amazing Fantasy #15 and ""The Night Gwen Stacy Died"" to life even though he made a few changes. The effects are a bit dated, but this came out in 2002 so I can't really fault the movie for that but for me it's still cool to see Spider-Man in action along with Danny Elfman's great score which gives a great Spidey vibe.A lot of fans now hate this movie and the other two to death since the release of the reboot, and honestly I don't see the point in that. Yes the mechanical web-shooters aren't in this version and Gwen Stacy isn't in this either but everybody is always going to put their own spin on the story. I get that the web shooters are an important part of Parker's intelligence, but I don't think it made him stupid. Plus why can't he have the ability to shoot webs out of his wrists?It saddens me to think that this film and the other two are being considered as the ""Batman & Robin"" of the Spiderman franchise, and it angers me even more that fanboys will now talk so much trash about the original trilogy's legacy because they got the reboot they cried & whined for. Sure the series may have lost it's way with Spider-Man 3, but Raimi did great with the first outing, and aced it with 2nd time around. Do people not remember how great this one was? If it wasn't for this movie and the 2nd we wouldn't have TDK trilogy, The Avengers and it's tie-ins or the new Man of Steel which is set for release next year. Heck, we wouldn't even have ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" if it wasn't for this movie. Hopefully some people can watch this again and recognize what makes this a great film and maybe it can get the respect it deserves.Rating: 4.3/5 stars"	5.0	This still holds up	2012-12-14	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AM2DAYSS9H1OO	Joe	what can i say? this movie is horrible! the script, plot, and special effects are the worst i've ever seen in a 'blockbuster' movie.  when you compare this film to other films inspired by comicbooks such as the first batman film, x-men, and the first superman film, you will see that spider-man just dosn't hold up.  maybe your little 12 year old brother would like it since he wouldn't know a good movie ...- which i think is why this movie grossed as much as it did.	1.0	don't waste your money	2002-11-04	6	2	4
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	"Poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire).  He's an orphan, a put-upon science nerd, and has a lifelong crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the troubled, yet beautiful, girl-next-door.  His only friend is rich kid Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his meagre support structure includes his laid-off Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris).  While on a field trip, a genetically-altered spider bites him and...Spider-puberty!  Suddenly, Pete's got muscles and strange bodily emissions he has to keep hidden from his aunt and uncle.  The kid even starts blowing off household chores.  Of course, we know why.  He's turning into Spider-Man, the beloved hero created way back in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  It took years to get this lovable loser to the screen.  Anticipation ran high.Fortunately, Sam Raimi's version delivers the goods... for the most part.  It's an action adventure film with heart, and remains remarkably faithful to the spirit of those original Lee/Ditko comics; even Spider-Man's victories are left-handed gifts from the gods.  What's really wonderful about it is that it spends so much time in its characters' heads, brings them to life not with shorthanded script cliches, but nuances and the smallest moments.  Maguire's Peter is a truly smart, nice guy who suffers from painful shyness, his positive qualities completely overlooked by his peers (whose hate for him is palpable in the early going, and not just there for color).  Maguire manages to you hurt for the character in a subtle way not often seen in big-budget malarkey.  And Dunst's MJ manages to be both vulnerable and sexy, wholesome yet dangerous.  With her screaming parents and her winsome smile, it's easy to see how someone like Peter Parker would develop a secret love for her, maybe heightened by his need to protect her from the heartbreaks her future will no doubt bring her.  And Cliff Robertson conveys the decency of a man who still believes in doing the right thing, in being responsible, even as life slowly crushes him.It's in these very human, dramatic moments that it's easy to believe in these characters, but when the movie really needs to soar, when Peter Parker finds he's capable of amazing feats (wall-crawling, leaping, swinging from webs, sensing danger), we're shut out.  Peter really needs to open up and let loose (actually, so should the movie should), but instead of joie d'spider, we get a very unconvincing CGI mannequin.  We never get to sail along with Spidey in any real sense, and there's not enough veracity.  This is extremely odd, because usually it's the other way around- in the typical Hollywood blockbuster, we don't give a crap about the regular people; they get shorted so the hero can blow things up and toss off corny one-liners (something the comic Spidey does with aplomb, but rarely here).Another problem is the film's villain.  Willem Dafoe can play creepy, and he does make Norman Osborn (Harry's dad- look out Peter Parker!) suitably sympathetic as he slides into insanity.  It's just that the Green Goblin's suit, with its immobile countenance, looks more like a sleek costume for Rio's yearly Carneval than it does the garb of a madman bent on destruction.  Dafoe gets to make a few nefarious speeches, but instead of his fiercely angular face, we see the frozen rictus of a dimestore Halloween mask.  It becomes more of a voice performance, but keeps the Goblin from really coming to life.What's left is a very good film, tons of fun, and arguably the best super-hero flick since the first ""Superman,"" but one that comes so close to greatness that it's ultimately frustrating.  I can't fault them for plumping the soap opera; they reached for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" instead of ""Armageddon"" and any film that aspires to that, especially one that features a guy dressed like an insect, deserves props.  Too often giant films like this fall victim to gaudy excess, with explosions substituting for catharsis.  It's just that I enjoyed the Peter/Mary Jane/Harry scenes more than the Spidey scenes.  Most of them, anyway.  There's a moment in the middle of the film where Spidey's rescued MJ and tells her she knows him.  She's confused until he explains, ""I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" in a bouyant tone, and for that moment, he's exactly right."	4.0	Your Friendly Neighborhood Superhero Epic!	2002-05-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AD89XR3O6MKW9	john27	While I am sure this review is likely to earn flames from fans all around, I cannot help but be the thorn between the multitude of roses.  I will give the movie its due insofar as that the special effects, cinematography, and sound score were enjoyable.Unfortunately, for me it ended there.  The story line was designed to make people happy.  It served its purpose it seems (given the reviews), yet it is apparent that people do not stop to think how absurd the writing is.  You have young Peter Parker who knows all about the most complicated of microscopes and claims expertise on the various species of arachnids.  Yet...he hopes one day to make it to college...maybe by being a photographer for a newspaper (because there is no way he would get a scholorship with that knowledge?)Then one can settle into the warm feelings one gets as the romantic heronie (spoiler) confesses that as her life is in imminent danger...she thinks that she may never get to see her true love (is anyone else thinking...gee my life is in danger...what do I do?)  I understand it followed the comic closely, to which I am sure fans are appreciative.  So kudos for loyalty to the comic, special effects, and sound score, yet the writing gets a major yawn.	2.0	A little too easy	2002-05-13	8	2	6
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AIWRBCDSPCDRE	"John Adams ""Farley Flavors"""	"Spider-Man is a super hero that has been a part of my life for a very long time ever since I was old enough to understand the meaning of the words ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility."" Everything about Spider-Man was unorthodox, mainly due to the character's status in the world as both Peter Parker and as Spider-Man... Peter Parker is an outcast due to his vast intelligence, and eagerness for learning which, in effect ostracizes him from the rest of the human race.  Spider-Man, meanwhile has a problem, due to the constant paranoia of the people, due to their uncertainty of what to make of him. A paranoia that is fueled by an untrustworthy J. Jonah Jameson's propaganda. These elements have made Spider-Man such an appealing character for me to grow up watching, and believe you/me I have. I spent all my childhood watching reruns of the old 1960's cartoon, then it was the old 1980's cartoon, and finally the sublime 1990's animated series. Though there was also a touch of the overly silly 1970's live action series. So obviously I've been eagerly awaiting Spider-Man to web-sling into a new medium, preferably the cinema.... Well finally my wish has been granted and it's beautiful!!! I will admit this was a frightening wait for the movie to come along. Especially when I keep hearing about changes in the stories and even with certain tidbits of the production, I was on pins and needles. I mean come on! If Cameron directed DiCaprio would've been Spider-Man! I don't think so! So when I heard about the changes in personnel I was seeing the ray of hope. Firstly Sam Raimi as director. at the time the news was announced I was just becoming a fan of his thanks to the beautiful ""Evil Dead"" Trilogy, and so I knew that Raimi was a director with a disciplined visual style, a knack for character depth, and an appealing sense of humor. So ""Spider-Man"" was right up his alley. As for the man who would be the spider? Tobey Maguire had earned my respect the first time I saw him in ""Pleasantville"" I saw that he can play humble, while at the same time strong in both the mind and body, and to top it all off HE CAN ACT!!! Don't believe me? Watch ""Cider House Rules,"" watch ""Wonder Boys,"" you'll see what I mean. If there was any assurance about Spider-Man being great, the credit definitely goes to Raimi and Maguire. Don't fret there's more credit to be sorted out, sit tight. The next aspect of credit goes to Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn AKA The Green Goblin. I knew Dafoe was perfect for the role after I saw him in ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" and obviously I wasn't disappointed. Probably for me his performance was at it's most effective in the scenes in his room. Whereas Osborn speaks to the Goblin in the mirror which gives me a fond recollection of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which, in a symbolic sense is exactly what is happening to Osborn. Since we're talking about one Osborn lets talk about another. Let's Talk about James Franco as Harry. Franco automatically gained my sympathy at the first moment you meet him and truly gained the believability of being Dafoe's son.Oh, and speaking of believability, nothing filled me with more mirth than J.K. Simmons' Dead-on portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson, he's a fast talking, obnoxious, opportunist who for some reason or another trusts his barber as opposed to the plain facts. As for other obvious mentionables, there's Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben who show this beautiful commitment to their characters and you see their eagerness to ensure that Peter is raised right. Now if there was a surprise in this cast it was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. At first glance of her in the trailer, you think ""Oh, eye candy, just there to be saved all the time."" Not even! Her performance succeeded in giving the character the depth and dimension that must be expected in the ""Spider-Man"" world. Plus... she looks bloody good as a red head. Now onto technical aspects... I could really care less about special effects and CGI as long as they're believable and it succeeds in getting the point across as to what's supposed to happen. Fortunately these effects combined with Sam Raimi's wonderful cinematic vision deliver a completely energetic cinematic rush that has truly never been seen before. As for the script. David Koepp was the last guy I'd have wanted to write for it, but he ended up proving me wrong. He managed to tell Spider-Man's legacy with that same humanity and flair that embodies the characters, though I won't say the script is flawless. It does suffer moments where the characters say the occasional line that reeks of Saturday morning cartoons. Thankfully I can tell that Sam Raimi noticed this and took advantage of that to add in his genius input to make the dialogue less painful and more appealing. I'm not gonna get into the costumes... Spidey looks the way he needs to look, and Goblin looks the way he's supposed to look when the suit was made by a high-tech research organization. So stop complaining you silly obsessives and enjoy it.So, in conclusion I will say that Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire have done for ""Spider-Man"" what Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve did for ""Superman."" AND what Tim Burton and Michael Keaton did for ""Batman""(Figured I'd add that in.) But Finally A Hollywood feature with a load of hype that actually managed to support the hype. Could this be a glimpse of great things to come? I hope so! But basically I say SEE ""SPIDER-MAN!!!"" and SEE IT AGAIN!!!"	5.0	You'll Believe a Man Could Web-Sling	2002-05-27	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ANM4I38VRP1VR	John Bolier	"Since his inception onto the comic book scene in 1962, Spider-Man has enthralled two generations of teens and adults alike.  As a teenager I can vividly remember many days spent at my friend's house, seeing a Spider-Man comic book collection so large that it protruded from under his bed in a huge cardboard box.  He kept each issue individually wrapped in its own plastic case, treating them like exquisite artifacts that an archaeologist might dig up at the Great Pyramid of Egypt.  Despite who my friends were, I never really read comic books and thus failed to comprehend their appeal.  However, I found the new cinematic adaptation of Spider-Man invigorating, injecting an infusion of vitality into a comic book movie I haven't experienced since director Tim Burton's Batman in 1989.Spider-Man is a vast improvement over the recent X-Men movie adaptation.  Spider-Man didn't suffer from the superfluous dull exposition that plagued X-Men.  The first hour of the film entertained me more that the action packed second hour.  We are treated to many humorous incidences when Peter Parker is discovering his new powers.  At the screening I attended the theater erupted with laughter at them.The special effects worked because I felt I vicariously lived through Spider-Man as he spun his webs and swung across the canyons of New York City.  It made my vertigo kick in.  However, in certain scenes, Spider-Man appeared slightly too cartoonish and failed to blend into his non-computer generated surroundings.  The final scene of the film illustrates my point.Tobey Maguire proved to be a brilliant casting coup.  He perfectly captured the quirky nerdiness of the teenage Peter Parker.  After being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, Peter Parker wakes up the next day and discovers his new gifts; he at first, merely uses his powers for personal gain and does what any teen would do.  He enters a wrestling competition to earn $3000 to buy a car to impress the object of his desire, Mary Jane Watson, played effectively by Kirsten Dunst.Willem Defoe must have relished playing the dual role of Norman Osbourne and the Green Goblin.  Upon drinking the enhancement serum, his personality is split.  Defoe plays Osbourne's manic side to perfection.  Director Sam Raimi utilized adroit editing to depict the simultaneous evolution of Peter Parker and Norman Osbourne.  Defoe's a fine actor and proves it once again here with his villainous turn.  He'll go down in the comic book movie villain hall of fame with Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) and Jack Nicholson (the Joker).Supporting characters, J.K. Simmons and James Franco gave phenomenal performances as J.J. Jameson and Harry Osbourne respectively.  Simmons was hysterical and we can only hope his screen time is increased in the eventual sequel.  Franco's performance reflected the mild jealousy he had of Peter Parker because Parker gained his father's admiration.Spider-Man received an appropriate PG-13 rating because there were some scenes involving the Green Goblin that might be too scary for young children.  Composer Danny Elfman's score for Spider-Man proved to be the most unremarkable thing about the film.  I couldn't remember a note of it as I walked into my car in the parking lot immediately upon viewing the film.  Could anyone say that about John Williams's score for Superman?  I think not.  The ""Don't mess with New Yorkers,"" dialog near the climactic fight atop the Queensborough Bridge made me wince and cover my face.  Such a blatant display of political rectitude in the wake of the September 11th tragedy should have been left on the cutting room floor.Spider-Man ranks behind the first Superman film as the best comic book adaptation ever made.  It's genuine fun.  The thrilling actions sequences will quench the thirst of the summer moviegoer parched for excitement."	4.0	Spider-Man Swings	2002-05-10	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2TDASSOK8SHUS	John Brian Moran	How is a grownup to respond to silliness of sci-fi these days? Tune out of this review if there is nothing that can stop you from suspending your disbelief in today's computer generated action. Isn't this new technology supposed to make action sequences better? I LOVE great action. I WANT them to utilize the technology in a fun and exiting way. But if you have half a brain, then the childish, insulting special effects of this and many other recent movies has to depress you-it has to leave you wondering if you're just too old to enjoy this genre any more. ROT!! I'm not too old, this movie is bad. Granted, directors are up against the studios demands that every new blockbuster be more radical than the last, more DARING, more -- well, you know what I mean. What is the result of this philosophy? Obviously, it's a law of diminishing returns, in which we get increasingly more dynamic use of CG technology, and less and less useful substance, less and less responsibility for showing us something that we can sink our teeth into. Once the director establishes his lack of respect for the audience, he can proceed with the story with this caveat: any action sequence is valid. If we know they distort reality in the silly action sequences, we also now know that the story, characters, theme, plot, are all suspect. MAKE ME BELIEVE! That's the director's job. Spiderman is a major disappointement. If you are over 16 years of age....	2.0	SPIDERMAN	2002-11-24	3	0	3

I was hoping it would, but wasn't sure. Then it didn't. It went way beyond the hype it was given. While I liked the special effects and action, what really captivated me was the story and the performance by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker rather than as Spider-Man. As Spider-Man, he was definitley good, but as Parker he had a wider range of emotions to work with, and he had definite chemistry with Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane Watson. Her performance was excellent as well. In fact, everyone's performance was either good or perfect. Good see right away, you will not regret it.	5.0	WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2002-05-04	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2GF5IC9G15K3O	"John Q. Viewer ""godzillafan36"""	This movie is just that, pure fun.  Now, as a once avid reader of the comic books, I knew the story already, but I won't spoil it for people who've never heard of Spider-Man before.  Even though it was a moderately predictable movie for anyone who's read the story, it doesn't take away from the fun.  What DID take away only minimally was the obvious product placement.  I mean, Pete practices aiming his webs on a Dr. Pepper can, come on.  And when the Green Goblin attacks the people at the festival, they always show wide shots of him going around all of the billboards for Cingular, Samsung, and so on.  I mean, come ON guys.  But, what are you gonna do, right?  The acting and script are on par with the comic book, and that means that it's moderately lame.  But, then again, you're not gonna see this movie for acting, you're gonna see it for ACTION, and this movie's got boatloads of it.  Trust me when I say this, the Cinematography is EXCELLENT.  Especially when Peter's chasing the robber.  Absolutely brilliant.  And I am very pleased that they didn't change Spidey's costume, but the Goblin's costume is...very blecch.  People will not be disappointed with this movie, not even fans who've been reading Spider-Man for 30 years.  Thus movie's pure fun and you'll want to see it over and over as much as you can, which is exactly what those people with the product placements want.

But what I got was Spider-Man going through typical high-school problems, action scenes consisting of saving a woman's baby from a burning building and performing matrix-like moves to dodge homing-razors, stupid moments that were supposed to be funny but just fell flat such as Peter making stupid hand gestures trying to figure out how to use his web, and most of all--some of the CHEESIEST lines ever used in a superhero movie.  Here is some of thse lines that just make me wanna puke:1. Spider-Man to Macho Man Randy Savage during a wrestling match:-Spider-Man-- ""That's a cute outfit. Did your husband get it for you?""2. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin squaring off:-Goblin-- ""Are you in or are you out?""-Spider-Man-- ""it's you who's out, Gobbie, out of your mind!""3. Spider-Man to Mary Jane after rescuing her and swinging her accross the city to the top of a building:-Spider-Man-- ""Well, beats taking the subway, haha.""--AND THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THAT THIS MOVIE WAS INTENDED TO BE FOR LITTLE KIDS--4. Spider-Man to Mary Jane:-Mary Jane-- ""Who are you?""-Spider-Man-- ""You know who I am.""-Mary Jane-- ""I Do?""-Spider-Man-- ""Yep. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!""I'm sorry, but that kind of talk does not deserve to be in a superhero action movie, but instead in a little-kids superhero movie. This movie was not at all what I expected it to be. It was just way too light-hearted for my liking.Now the movie did have some good action scsnes and a few good parts. Willem Dafoe did a great job as the ""green goblin"". And the special edition DVD made the movie worth buying. But all-in-all, if you are looking for a top-notch, action packed, dramatic superhero movie, Spider-Man definately does NOT deliver. Watch Batman, Blade, The Hulk, or even X-Men.""SPIDER-MAN"" runs for about 2 hours. It is rated PG-13 for light cartoonish action violence. Really could have been rated PG--it is safe for any age really. Parents do not have to worry about letting their little kids watch this movie."	3.0	DVD=5 stars  MOVIE=3 stars	2003-01-03	0	0	0

This movie was horrible. I'm not a man who's that hard to please, and I can enjoy a good popcorn flick every once in a while, but this was just as bad as {another movie}.The movie as we all know is about a Peter Parker being a nerd, gets bitten by a spider, becomes a superhero, and has to save the world. Compared to movies of its own genre, it has NOTHING NEW TO OFFER, which is the main thing wrong with it. Atleast X-MEN's story was clever, and even had roots in history ...Also, I didnt think the acting was bad but it wasnt anything great. The main thing that bothered me is the movie felt like it was holding back. The movie tries so hard to please its kiddy audience and is so P.C. friendly... The movie also felt way to surreal. I mean, at least BLADE felt surreal to add to stlye, this just felt like a FAKE New York, unlike FAKE New York of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, or REAL New York of KIDS...The movies pace is also all wrong. The movie sets up way to many things that never pay off, but will in the next movie though, but your so not caring, you probably wont check it out.Also, Sam Raimi CAN'T DIRECT. I'm sorry, but i enjoyed a few of his other flicks but this one just flat out [failed]. Atleast all those who hated THE MATRIX thought it's action was okay but there is NO decent action scenes here, and the ending fight was so lame, I was glad Spider Man was getting his [rear] kicked. In the end, the movie let me down in A BIG WAY.FOR FUN "" CHECK BRAIN AT DOOR"" ...----- A negative review for SPIDER MAN, a movie aimed at my age group, TEENAGERS-------------"	1.0	Actually thought I was going to like it?!	2002-07-09	21	7	14

I guess I'm late to the party.  Overall, it's a very solid superhero movie with very good special effects by way of CGI.  The acting is good.  Spiderman's costume is cool looking.  The musical score is pretty good.  Overall this movie, in my opinion, ranks among the elite superhero movies ever made.  I wouldn't put it in the same category as The Dark Knight (2008), or Batman (1989), but it's definitely up there.Overall, I recommend this movie if you want to be visually entertained while watching a good superhero movie.	4.0	Solid throughout	2011-06-28	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2PGPWMAENCWUT	Jonathan	"I saw the movie opening night. I was expecting it to be good but kind of expecting it (with the way movies are these days) to be way to fast like Peter gets bitten by this spider and then in a matter of 10 minutes he becomes Spider-Man. But this movie had everything a classic superhero movie requires: Time. Time for the hero to be able to realize what he can do with his powers and maybe about a half and hour to 45 minutes into the movie he becomes the real Spider-Man. And that is exactly what this movie had.The movie starts of with Peter Parker, a senior in highschool who has been pretty much the classic movie ""nerd"" at the beginning. He has been in love with the girl that lives next door to him, Mary Jane. But you know the story: She has some big jock boyfriend and she dosn't even notice Peter. So then one day while they are all on a field trip looking at a spider exhibit, a spider with all of the abilities of different spiders put together gets loose and bites Peter. The next morning Peter wakes up and goes through the day learning that he has incredible strength, agility, keen spider scenses, the ability to shoot webs, and the ability to climb walls.His best friend, however, has a rich father who is working on a new kind of experiemnt: A type of superhuman thing that leads whoever it is tested on to become very violent and angry. He tests it on himself and eventullay leads himself to complete insanity. And as you probably already know he becomes the Green Goblin. But the problem is Spider-Man does not know that the Green Goblin is his best friend's father which comes out in an incredible ending that will definitly have a sequal.The Spider-Man movie made me think of all the different superhero movies that I watched when I was younger. All of the superhero movies now though just start to fast and end in dissapointment. But Spider-Man was just like watching the past superhero movies (Batman, Superman, etc.) Come back for a trip to the future. This was truly a great and fun movie and I reccomend it to anyone who is looking for an action packed classic superhero story."	5.0	Classic Superhero Movie	2002-05-03	0	0	0

I never thought I would like a movie that came from a comic, but wow, was I surprised! The plot was awesome, and it left me wanting to see more! From start to finish, it was perfect. This movie had all the good stuff...love, wisdom, responsibility, revenge, and awesome action scenes. In case you dont know, Spider-Man is about a graduating senior that gets bitten by...you guessed it...a spider! (no way!) And instead of it becoming seriously infected, it gave him super powers, so he could save the world from all evil, and just be a hero. There is so much more to it! Anyone that likes action movies should go see it! I so have to give this movie 5 stars. spider-Man is a perfectly spun movie, for anyone to enjoy.	5.0	PERFECTLY SPUN	2002-07-14	4	2	2

Zarco	"After 25 years in development hell, Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead, Darkman) and Columbia Pictures brought Spiderman to the big screen in the Spring of 2002. The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book. Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman. During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a ""Spideysense"" and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses ""prosthetic web shooters"". In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school.After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York.TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film.A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving.The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects. The late ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage plays a wrestler that Peter Parker fights in an arena. Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell, and director Sam Raimi make cameos in the film. Tobey MacGuire was an inspired choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He has to be mild-mannered, strong, and good-looking at the same time. Kirsten Dunst is quite good as Mary Jane. The upside down kissing scene is a classic. James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin. Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May and J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good. Spiderman was spoofed on The Simpsons and the ""Weird Al"" Yankovic song 'Ode to a Superhero'.John Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002). This Columbia/Tri-Star/Sony DVD is packed with extra features. Spiderman was one of the best movies of 2002."	4.0	Spiderman(2002)	2011-08-30	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A13KXWTN0DT878	"Josh ""Josh"""	I've never been a fan of the comic book, nor the animated series, yet, I found Sam Raimi's live-action Spiderman quiet entertaining and full of amazing (some) special effects and great acting.Everyone knows the story. High school nerd, Peter Parker (Tobey MaGuire) is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider, and his body changes to the likes of a spider. Enabling him to crawl up buildings, and shoot a webby substance. Peter takes full advantage -- in the positive way -- of his new found skills, and begins to solve crime for the city. When a villain (William Defoe), with superpowers also, begins to destroy the city, Peter must stop him. It's the simple good guy against bad-guy-who-wants-to-destroy-everything plot seen in every superhero movie (Except for X-Men which had a much deeper plot, but let's not compare). But the premise does work here, and keeps you entertained.The acting was great. Tobey MaGuire is Peter Parker to the core. Innocent, appealing, and a knack for small humor makes him a perfect lead. Kirsten Dunst is our female lead, and she -- as always -- is wonderful. I've never seen her play the damsel in distress part, but she pulled it off. And her smile lights up any day. William Defoe is the antagonist Green Goblin. Defoe handled this part fairly well and made it believable. Especially during the moments when he had to be Norman Osburn and The Green Goblin. But I just didn't buy his whole character. I found it more interesting when Peter was fighting off criminals. Except for the World Day Celebration scene. That was awesome. The rest of the supporting cast were great. Especially Uncle Ben, played by Cliff Robertson.The special effects is the place where it gets kind of hokey. You can absolutely tell when Peter is CGI and when he's not. The whole CGI bit is what puts it off, but still, it's topnotch. The scenery is great, and gave the movie a real comic book feel to it. But again, I go back to not liking the Green Goblin much. His costume looked like my kid cousin's Halloween costume from 5 years ago. But maybe that's what Raimi was going for.In the end, Spiderman was an entertaining movie that sucked you in. It's high gross rankings are certainly well deserved.	4.0	Movie's Great, Acting's Awesome, FX's Par. What A Movie!	2002-05-27	4	1	3

They focus primarliy on the relationship between Parker (Maguire) and M.J. Watson (Kirsten D.).  I have to constantly remind them that this is a movie based on a comic book.  And these are two teenagers.  Kids are not smooth, and I found the naive behaviour authentic and realistic.  The movie is character and story driven and not just a special effects show.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1XAVE5FXP1UGC	Joshua Besso	An avid fan of Spider-man for the past two decades, I had considerable expectations going into this movie. The good news is that Spider-man is not that bad. In fact, after the first hour I was prepared to surrender the comic book movie crown previously held by Richard Donner's Superman over to the web head. But, like a John Carpenter movie, Spider-man begins well and runs out of steam at the end. Peter Parker, a gangly science nerd with brainpower to spare and meek social skills, gets bit by a genetically engineered spider with enhanced abilities built into its genome. As a result, Parker finds himself mutating into a spider-man with the proportional abilities of the spider that bit him. Now the hopeless geek that nobody respected suddenly finds incredible powers at his command. This part of the film is done particularly well. As the truism goes, power corrupts. Peter employs his abilities to clobber a boy that frequently bullied him, Flash. It only begins there. In order to impress his childhood sweatheart he decides he needs a car. The best way to obtain one? Beat up guys as a wrestler and collect the prize money! Inevitably personal tragedy teaches Parker that with great power comes great responsibility and he decides to use his powers to help the innocent people of New York City. Spider-man is born. This is kept perfectly in line with the comic and won't disappoint any true believers out there. The problems begin when the villainous Green Goblin confronts Spider-man. From this point on Spider-man eschews any type of innovation and resorts to the simple 'good vs. evil' plot. And that simple formula becomes ridiculus culminating when Goblin decides that Spider-man is the only other person on the planet that is his equal and tries to lure the web slinger over to the dark side. I kid you not, the dialogue and even the physicality are a direct lift from Empire Strikes Back. It's scenes such as these that truly interrupt the flow of the film and they only increase in number towards the end of the movie. This could have been forgiven had the battle segments been spectacular. Instead they are a mix of outrageously overblown CGI and sub-par stunt work that are both unispired and lifeless. Perhaps the reason they are so inert is equally inert Danny Elfman score(Batman)that fails to energize or even create a mood. But all is not lost for Spidey, Tobey Maguire and Willem Defoe (Parker and Goblin respectively) give showstopping performances that overcome the plot's shortcomings. Maguire is the perfect Parker conveying both emotional frailty and boyish charm. Defoe is his match as the schizophrenic Green Goblin, a man consumed with the need to remove all obstacles to his success. Supported by a fine cast of costars you can't help but enjoy Spider-man even if you do experience a constant feeling of deja vu. I can't wait for the sequel and I suggest everyone who appreciates a healthy dose of fantasy see the movie. Only don't expect any surprises along the way. Spidey might not have any new ideas to spin, but his web is in the right place.	4.0	Spider-man gets the 'Hollywood treatment'	2002-05-03	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	Spider-Man, the Marvel Comics hero, has been adapted and changed for the big screen.  Peter Parker is an unassuming student who is smart, shy, and loves the girl next door (Mary Jane).  But a trip to Columbia University's science department changes his life.  There he is bitten by a genetically designed super spider.The bite causes genetic changes in Peter and he becomes part spider.  At first he wants to use his new abilities to make money so he can impress Mary Jane.  But when his own spiteful inaction leads to the death of his uncle, peter decides to fight crime.The movie does a nice job of setting the stage of the series while still brining in a super-villain.  In this film, the villain is The Green Goblin and his movie incarnation is nowhere near as silly as his comic book version.Casting was well done for most of the cast.  Dunst manages to give some excellent Mary Jane smirks, the Osbornes actually look like they could be father and son and J. Jonah Jameson looks like he stepped right off the comic page.  But is they worked so hard on Jameson's look, why were there no widow's peaks for the Osbornes?There have been changes to the character and story of Spider-Man.  Most notably, he actually generates webs (from his hands no less) so there will be no classic empty web-shooter plot twists.  Mary Jane is not killed off on the bridge as she was in the comics (an issue of What If showed just how horrible the world would become is Spider-Man succeeded in rescuing her).  We see how Peter's fingers can cling to the wall but, like in the comics, we still don't know how his shoes do it.This is a fun film and if you can get past the fact that it is not the comic book you should enjoy it.  The only real flaws I saw were a few inconsistencies in scale during some of the CGI scenes (that and the total lack of concern on the part of the University when it is pointed out that there is a super-spider missing).	4.0	Never a Dull Movie From Sam Raimi	2003-10-10	3	1	2

I love to see a red, masked man swooping through skyscrapers and taxi cabs, into burning buildings and busy bridges. I also loved the fascinating battle between good and evil, and the struggle within the characters between their human and superhero personas. Very intriguing and mysterious.However, I felt the ending was kind of weak. I realize it was a lead-in to a sequel, but really, something more has to go on there. I don't want to give anything away, but those who have seen the movie might know what I'm talking about.Also, I felt the additional content was rather lacking.

Spiderman/Peter Parker is suppose to be smart, funny, sensitive and caring. The whole potrayal didn't even get close (or maybe just bad acting).  The way he talked to his uncle at the museum is totally out of character. The movie went too fast, JJJameson and Robertson maybe had about 3-4 minutes of screen time, and these characters are vital parts of Spiderman. You never really get to know the characters and never really have the time to humanize them. And the special effects? There is nothing special about it. Not even close to the industry standard at the present, I wish some other studio made this movie (or director). It feels like you are in a studio yourself watching the night scenes, everything is so boxy looking, no realism at all. There was a scene that the shadow of a building  is going the opposite way the shadow of MaryJane against the same reference sun (lighting issue?).The whole movie is just a set-up for the sequel(s).

Your children will love it, even if they are grown and they have your grandchildren. They'll love it too! This film is a wonderful start to what could easily be a ten year series of films, if done right. If they avoid the Superman trap and stick to the stories Stan Lee spun during the first fifty issues that displayed such growth and maturity that became as much a part of the tale as the super hero conflicts. And always, the presence of Aunt May looms large. Spidey's greatest feats were always in protection of Aunt May. You just knew in the movie when Aunt May was in trouble that all heck was about to break loose. Remember, don't [mess] with Aunt May.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A10872FHIJAKKD	Just Bill	When I first read that Tobey Maguire was cast as Peter Parker, I was crestfallen. &quot;Tobey Maquire?!?!&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Surely, there's someone better than that for the role!&quot;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.Tobey Maquire plays Peter Parker in an endearing way that portrays both the human and the superhuman side of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman. He's perfect in the role!Having grown up with the Marvel Comics classic, I was a little skeptical of the whole project from the get-go. I didn't want another campy, cutesy movie based on a comic book that would ruin all the great feelings I had about the superhero. Thankfully, director Sam Raimi managed to pull it off -- with a little help from Maquire, Kirsten Dunst as MJ, Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin, and a few other great character actors.Sometimes, movies based on books (or even comic books) require a knowledge of the material before the movie makes sense. That's not the case with Spiderman, however. This movie can be enjoyed with no prior knowledge of Spidey whatsoever.If you're looking for a little light entertainment, and want a fun, entertaining movie that's head and shoulders above most others released this past year, give Spiderman a try. Don't let the comic book theme or the hype scare you off. It's not a childish or overblown movie at all.Spiderman easily qualifies as one of my favorite movies of the past couple of years.

Though once the legality was straightened out, a new problem presented itself, leaving Sony with the question of ""Who will direct and star in this picture?""  The answer took some time, and while the question loomed in Hollywood, the rumor mill was going crazy.  For a while most of the rumors surrounded who would star in the film, since James Cameron was tapped to direct for the longest time.  Names for who would star ranged from Leonardo DiCaprio to Luke Perry, I believe even Kurt Russell was rumored for a little while (though he would be too old).  Frankly all of the rumors for the cast stunk, I figured that Hollywood was just going to screw up what could possibly redeem the comic book to film genre, a genre that hadn't existed since it's untimely demise at the hands of ""Batman & Robin"" and ""Spawn"".  Thankfully, God had to have been smiling on this movie, as all casting rumors were debunked, including James Cameron as director (though I would have been happy with him behind the camera).  With this announcement it was revealed that director Sam Raimi (director of the `Evil Dead' series) would direct the movie, and Tobey Maguire would fill the dual role of Peter Parker/Spiderman (this choice scared many comic book fans, there was no doubt that Tobey could fill the geeky shoes of a pre-Spiderman version of Peter Parker, but once he got his powers, Tobey's weak, thin frame would not do the trick).  Needless to say all concerns were soon swept away when Spiderman was released to theaters amidst considerable praise from critics, movie audiences, and comic book fans alike.  With the success of ""X-Men"" and then ""Spiderman"" we had entered a new era in movie history, a time in which comic books could be adapted to film and treated with realism and respect.""Spiderman"" as both comic and non-comic book fans know, is the story of mild-mannered nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman), who during a science class gets bitten by a radioactive spider.  This spider bite sends the radioactivity into Parker's system, giving this puny man of science the proportionate strength and abilities of a spider.  Peter discovers his newfound abilities and embraces them, he sees them as a means to which he can win the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and also improve his lot in life.  However, Peter's hopes and dreams would soon come crashing down around him, when after competing in a wrestling event for money, Peter chooses not to stop a thief that ran right by him with the victim in close pursuit.  Unfortunately for Peter this decision will haunt him for the rest of his life, when his beloved Uncle Ben is shot down in a carjacking by the very same thief that Peter could have stopped.  This action causes Peter to learn his most valuable lesson, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and also leads to Peter becoming the web-swinging, wall-crawling hero, Spiderman.  As this all occurs, billionaire industrialist Norman Osborn (Wilem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin), is being forced out of his own company, Oscorp, by the board members, due to his failure to snag a multi-billion dollar weapons contract with the U.S. military.  The cause of the failed agreement was an unstable strength enhancing drug, Osborn overwrought with hatred and self-pity for being forced out of his company tests the drug on himself, creating the deranged, psychopathic Green Goblin.  With Norman as the Green Goblin he sees the need to eliminate those who wronged him and his company and then take control of New York City.  However, Spiderman isn't about to let this happen, not without a fight.After the huge success of Fox Studios' ""X-Men"", Sony Pictures really had their work cut out for them, as all eyes were on whether or not another comic book adaptation could succeed.  Needless to say Sony Pictures' ""Spiderman"" passed the test with great ease, giving audiences a thrill-a-minute adventure that they would not soon forget.  With an impressive story, superb directing, incredible casting (Tobey Maguire's awesome performance of the dual roles of Peter Parker/Spiderman, being the biggest surprise), and a great soundtrack, ""Spiderman"" was an incredible comic book adaptation and heroic origin tale, that did what all movies (comic book and otherwise) should do, that is, leave the audience craving more.  As I said earlier, ""Spiderman"" praised, not only by critics and general audiences, but also the ever-so picky comic book fans, which is not an easy task.  If you enjoyed ""X-Men"", or the `Superman' films or the `Batman' films, then this movie is a definite must-see.  I guarantee that you will enjoy ""Spiderman"" over and over again.""Spiderman"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language."	5.0	The Amazing Spiderman...	2005-07-19	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2B6RU25UKFLPB	"J. W. Deming ""Shenandoah"""	SPIDER-MAN and SPIDER-MAN 2 ROCK!! I've never liked &quot;superhero&quot; movies. In fact, most of them bore me to tears. On a whim and needing some R&R; I went to see Spidey 2. What a surprise! It is an incredibly romantic, moving film. After seeing it, I had to rent Spidey 1. It was almost (not quite) as good (but so much better than almost any other recent movie I can think of) and seeing it helps one understand several key plot points in Spidey 2.The guys behind these two movies know how to structure a story that delivers a powerful emotional payoff. Along the way they take you into a fascinating exploration of issues that will interest any person who aspires to...whatever you aspire to that's unusual and positive. There aren't many movies I can unreservedly recommend. These 2 movies are the exceptions. Special word of advice: in Spidey 2, if you find yourself getting very, very frustrated by Peter Parker's endless inability to resolve his situation (after all it is rather unusual!!) stick with it. The director, Sam Raimi, has got you in the palm of his hand. Trust me. You can trust Raimi. He won't disappoint. Won't say more except that I laughed til I cried when I learned in Spidey 1 how Spiderman got his name and his suit. And also in Spidey 1 when Uncle Ben tells Peter he understands what he's going thru...well, if you haven't seen it I won't spoil it but it's very funny and moving at the same time. One final thing: you can almost taste the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Deeelicious. Whoever cast those two deserves an extra percent or two of the gross.Okay, one more final thing: the values throughout this film are exquisite. What a difference from the decadent and/or superficial shrunken heart of most movies today. In both Spidey's there is never a sour, nihilistic note. They are edgy, non-sappy movies with a huge, romantic heart. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to any kid older than 12 or any grown-up whose soul hasn't shriveled into prune-like resignation at life's vicissitudes. Younger children may be troubled by the villains and some of the violence (which is truly and gratefully de minimis and not emphasized). All in all, I unreservedly recommend these movies for all those who like big-hearted movies that make you feel very, very good and stimulate you to think and wonder along the way.	5.0	An incredibly romantic & moving film	2004-07-20	2	2	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A207ETNAPKIHW0	kapil	I'm a long time fan of the Spider-Man comics, so I went into this film with cautious optimism. I'd been burned by comic movies many times before. I'm pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. This was an excellent adaptation of the comics! In fact, I'd say this is one of the best comic movies ever made. I personally feel it's in the class of the first Superman and Batman movies. I loved the X-Men movie, but I think Spider-Man surpassed it. I'm so happy they got it right. They got the perfect mixture of romance, action, humor, and drama in the film. It's a rare thing to see it all come together so well, but they pulled it off. You feel like you're a friend of Peter Parker's and you're following him on this incredible journey.I had several favorite scenes. The first of which was when he first discovered his powers. There's like a 20-minute stretch where you're just laughing and amazed at the same time. As he discovered his power to stick to things and shoot webs, it's really hilarious. His confrontation with Flash is fun and cool. There's nothing better than seeing the geek triumph. And Peter's first attempts to actually shoot a web and swing on it were classic. &quot;Up, up, and away, web! Shazam!!&quot; I know some people hate the organic web shooters, but I think they turned out perfect in the film. It was a good move to change it from the comic and it not only added some funny moments, but it made Spider-Man more like a spider.Another awesome scene is when Peter pursues the burglar in the movie. If you've read the comics, you know what an emotional moment this is. It's even more powerful and exciting on the big screen. When this happens, Peter has yet to perfect his powers. As he tries to chase down a car, he stumbles, fumbles, and almost gets killed multiple times. He's not yet the graceful superhero that he eventually becomes. But his anger, determination, and thirst for revenge drive him, and it makes the chase all the more desperate. It's one of the best action scenes ever in a comic movie. By the time it's over, you really understand his motivations for becoming a superhero.My third favorite scene is the final battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. It's a brutal knock down, drag out fight that is very impressive. While Spider-Man has been a dominant force throughout the film, he pretty much has his backside handed to him by the Green Goblin. It's his first real fight for simple survival, and it really feels like it. And the ending is faithful to the comics, too. It really sets things up for the sequel.What sets Spider-Man apart from bad comic movies is the characterization. For every action scene, there are two scenes of simple conversation between characters. Sam Raimi goes to great pains to make you care for ALL of the characters before he gets into the action. You feel sorry for Peter when he's picked on. You sympathize with Mary Jane's as she goes from one abusive relationship to another. You understand the tension and love between Harry and his father Norman. You really care for Aunt May and Uncle Ben. So when these extraordinary events start taking place, you have an emotional attachment to the characters. You really feel what they feel.Tobey Maguire is a great Peter Parker. He's shy and geeky in school, yet smart-mouthed and confident as Spider-Man. He was a questionable choice early on when casting the role, but he really proved himself. Kirsten Dunst is great as the girl next door. Just like the comic character, her happy exterior hides an unhappy soul. Dunst makes it easy to see why she'd start feeling attracted to Peter. Willem Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin. Then again, he's always been good at playing psychos. Dafoe is successful at making the Green Goblin both evil and sympathetic at the same time. He also dances along the line of being over-the-top without ever quite going over it like a lot of the Batman villains did. Finally, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is absolutely hilarious. He's actually the one that goes over-the-top and it's perfect. He's cheap, rude, and a loudmouth. You can't ask for anything more.Overall, Spider-Man is a wonderful moviegoing experience for people who love the comic and those who have no idea what &quot;Excelsior!&quot; means. Oh, and watch for cameos by Xena's Lucy Lawless as a punk rocker, Stan Lee saving a little girl, Bruce Campbell as the ringannouncer, and more.have to echo some of the gripes of other people who have reviewed this movie. The first is the soundtrack by Danny Elfman. The music is pretty good for this film, but there is no definitive Spider-Man theme. Batman had a great one. Superman had a fantastic one. Spider-Man got nothing. The music is rather unmemorable. I hate saying this in light of the fact that I generally love Elfman's work.My second gripe is the effects. They ranged from jaw-droppingly amazing to very, very fake. I thought the effects worked best when the camera was either sitting still or moving slowly. It was times like that which you could appreciate the gracefulness of Spidey and what he was doing. The rest of the time the camera was moving, twisting, and turning so wildly that it was hard to figure out what was happening. It made for more dynamic scenes, but all you could see was a blue and red blur wiggling on the screen. If it's between decent effects or a great story, I'd take the great story. But it would be nice to have both.My final complaint is that the movie felt like it skipped a beat in the middle. Peter goes from graduating from high school and being semi-competent with his powers to being a full-fledged superhero in New York. The only thing that bridges the two is a montage of scenes where New Yorkers talk about Spidey's exploits and we see flashes of him in action. It's fun, but it felt like something was missing. I wanted to see more scenes of Spidey fighting crime. I suppose it had to be shortened in the interest of time, but I would have liked to have seen more.'Nuff said.	5.0	this is a fun popcorn movie	2004-01-02	1	1	0

Truth be told, I thought it would be stupid, nothing but a bunch of hype. But I did rent, and I sat down and watched it, and when it was over, I said, ""Wow! That was pretty cool!"" The special effects were cool, and it was well directed. The acting was pretty good, and they didn't kill the plot from the comic books.The story, which probably everyone know, is a high schooler who is about to graduate, get bit by a geneticly engineered ""super spider"". The super spider's powers are transferred into Peter Parker. So, over night, he turns from a weak geek, into a strong man. He doesn't need his glasses anymore, either. Bit by bit he descovers his powers, climbing on walls, jumping really far, extra strong, shooting webs, and sensing danger. So he creates a ... costume, and goes wrestling for three minutes for 3000 dollars. But the guy only gives him a hundred because he pinned him in two, not three. Then a robber comes and steals the money and Peter lets him go. Then later, his Uncle Ben is shot by the same robber, so he devotes himself to fighting crime, and also he got a cool costume.Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a scientist takes a human body enhancer that is suposed to increase strength by 800%. But the enhancer isn't ready, and he suffers from the side effects, anger, aggression, and insanity. So he has kind of a split personality, one good, one bad. So he steals a high tech glider and creates a costume and becomes the Green Goblin. At the end Spider-Man and the Green Goblin have a show down, which is pretty cool.So all in all, it is a pretty cool action movie, with cool special effects, and they didn't ruin this movie, like they did with Daredevil, which was really stupid. So as comic book movies go, this is at the top with X-Men. So if you haven't seen it, and you think it will be stupid, go give it a try, actually, it was pretty cool."	4.0	Actually, It was pretty Cool	2003-06-24	2	2	0

Hunter	"You must hand it to Raimi for not only successfully translating this larger than life legend to the silver screen, but also toppling the George Lucas juggernaut.  I think the charm of this film is that it is a nerdy hero puts aside his pride and steps up to his duty and calling as a superhero.  It is a very intimate and emotional movie that hits all the right butons.Maguire plays Peter Parker perfectly.  I am glad that they found an actor who actually looked and played the part, rather than taking Hollywood's flavor of the month.  You believe that Parker is really a goof and a nerd, and you know that he revel in being Spiderman, the coolest of he cool.My favorite scene is Parker's epiphany, when he decides to take up the mantel and captures the man who killed his grandfather.  Parker is awkward and clumsy as he begins his chase, but he eventually get the carjacker, and gets a clue that he need to be a super-hero.  I think the nice touch is when Park swings on street level, he has to dodge the streetlights.  They paid that much attention to detail.Kirsten Dunst play MJ well.  She is caught between several men: Flash Thompson, Harry Osbourne, Peter Parker, and Spiderman.  Yet she manages to keep her head, and play a darn good scream queen to boot.  She is the love interest, but is able to transcend the role and bring life.Judging from the gag reel, I think Willem Defoe was having too much fun playing the Green Goblin and it hurt some of his performances.  He wasn't an menacing as he could be because he was laughing his head off behind the mask.As to the DVD, I am one of those people who likes the features disk over the film disk.  Seeing all of the behind the scenes  clips enhances the film for me.  I love the commentaries, and especially the gag reels.  I just wish there was a way to be able to reintegrate deleted scenes back into the film.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A22CGE3WAQC6P7	"Kenny Embry ""I'm a professor who's interested..."	"Since this is the highest grossing movie in an opening weekend (and one of the most profitable flicks ever produced), I realize that trying to get you to watch it is already wasted effort.  Who hasn't seen this movie?  If you seriously haven't, you ought to, even if you're not a comic book fan.  It really is a coming of age story, despite all the special effects.  Peter Parker is awkward, bad with girls, and obsessed with someone who doesn't know he exists.  In other words, he's completely typical.  Feeding on teen angst and lack of self-confidence, nearly everyone can identify with Pete, so we're more than ready to cheer him on when he suddenly gets some super-powers thanks to a genetically altered spider.  The wild ride is definitely worth the price of admission, and the special effects are awesome (although some are pretty obviously fake).Surprisingly, not much has been made of the way on-screen Spider-man differs from comic book Spider-man.  Granted, there's not a lot.  In the comic book he's bitten by a radioactive spider, and his webbing is his own creation and is delivered through little jets on his wrists.  In the movie his encounter with the spider gives him natural webbing.  Not a big deal.The action in the movie is great, although this is a flick with flaws.  First off, Tobey McGuire is an AWESOME Peter Parker, and a ho-hum Spider-man.  He's got this mumbling quality that adds to the geeky persona, but translates really poorly for the wisecracking superhero.  Overall, though, he looks young enough to pull it off, and isn't too ""heroic,"" which is what Pete needs to be.  I can forgive the Spider-man stuff.  The second big glitch, in my opinion, is Kirsten Dunst.  She's a nice girl, but she just doesn't look the Mary Jane part.  This is where Jennifer Garner might have been better used (rather than as Electra in Daredevil).  Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress, but I just don't buy her in this role.  On the other hand, even though he looks nothing like Norman Osborn, Willem Dafoe is absolutely perfect as the Green Goblin (even though the costume looks very little like the comic book character).  Other casting is well done, though.  Ben and May Parker, Harry Osborn, Flash Thompson--these are great.The DVD is definitely worth the investment.  The print is beautiful and it has enough easter eggs to keep you busy for hours.No matter how good your home set-up is, you won't be able to replicate the cinema experience.  But, if you enjoyed the movie, this is definitely a ""must have"" DVD experience.  It's a lot of fun, and you enjoy the story again and again (or at least until ""The Amazing Spider-man"" in 2004).Excelsior!"	4.0	See it already.	2003-02-21	1	0	1

Well, there's some amazing action sequences, yes, plus a hero and a villain that are equally enjoyable to see.  That's all pretty good.  But there's also another side to the movie that really adds to the enjoyment.  Spider Man is a human story, dealing with serious issues of loyalty, growing up, identity, and conscience.  Taking that into account, Spider Man is rather moving, aside from being kick-*ss.All in all, this is a well made movie.  It does have some flaws with the script and the CGI, but that doesn't take away from the fun.  It's got bawls AND heart!  Peace.	5.0	a satisfying, big-budget super-hero romp.	2003-05-06	0	0	0

Just as Keaton did in Batman, Tobey Maguire brings a refreshingly human aspect to his character.  Yes, he is Spider-Man, but he is also Peter Parker, your average, every-day teen, and he faces the same problems that real teenagers do.  And while Maguire brings emotion to the role, the movie would be nothing without the spectacular performances of Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe.  Dunst, as Mary Jane, augments the emotional side of Maguire's Parker.  Dafoe gives a truly evil aspect to the Green Goblin that not many actors could pull off and still make it convincing.  All in all; Spider-Man is a good movie with a great story behind it, and it has enough action to keep even the most difficult-to-please viewer happy.	5.0	Best Super-Hero Movie to Date	2002-06-06	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Let me start off by saying that ""Spiderman"" was my favorite superhero when I was a young child.  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this movie so much.  It brought me back to a time when I just loved being a kid.  Sure, I got picked on by bullies and I was a nerd, but ""Spiderman"" always gave me the hope that one day I would become something that no bully could ever touch.  That's the brilliant thing about this movie.  It reminds you that we have all been the geek or the loser at some point in our lives, but in the end, we always get the upper hand and become something great.  It recalls those days when the sky was the limit and reality was only as close as your eighteenth birthday.In essence, this movie is fiction at its best.  It makes you forget your troubles for a little while and leaves you with a good feeling.The storyline stays true to the comic, with the exception of Spidey's web-slinging ability.  Although that minor detail actually makes the character more believable as superheroes are concerned.  The movie isn't as dark as ""Daredevil"" or serious as ""X-Men.""  It's a whiz-bang thrill ride that just cuts loose in front of you.  It takes the campiness that the Kilmer-Clooney ""Batman"" movies tried horribly to utilize and mixes that up with the youthful idealism of every kid who has grown up in the good ol' U.S. of A. and makes a fun adventure that's not too violent for the little ones and just deep enough to lure in adults who may not have read ""Spiderman"" when they were younger.I'm not giving this movie five stars because I'm a Spiderman fan, I'm giving five stars because it makes you feel great after you've watched it.By all means, watch this film.

The 2-disc set is chock full of extras and even without a home theater system, the discs will still play smoothly and loudly.Cast is great. Maguire, Dunst, Dafoe all played their roles magnificiently. You'd feel sympathy for Dafoe's brilliant potrayal of a man with a split personality. But in the end, its either him or Spidey...so bye-bye Goblin. Kirsten Durnst is sadly only used as eye candy and for the typical 'damsel in distress' scenes. Hopefully a stronger MJ Watson role will be written for her in the sequel. JK Simmons was not used fully in his Jonah Jameson role. Thats an oversight that should be addressed in the sequel as well.Many scenes in the movie were adapted straight from the Amazing Spider-Man comics and Amazing Fantasy #15 and fans should be able to recognise them.Geeks rule (including those without the abilities of a spider)!	5.0	Pop those corns...its time for Spidey	2002-11-05	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2VUP5US1F5HG5	K. Jump	For years, Spider-Fans have been waiting for a movie adaptation of their favorite wall-crawler's exploits.  Finally, they have it.Spider-Man is everything it should be, and more.  Tobey Maguire excels as the ultimate Everyman superhero, capturing the full range of emotion as the character stumbles to transform from gawkish high school geek to media sensation to genuine hero.  Willem Defoe is the perfect Norman Osborne; his Green Goblin is both scarier and more credible than Jack Nicholson's Joker.  And Kirsten Dunst lights up every frame as the fiery-haired Mary Jane.  The effects are brilliant, the production lavish, and the script surprisingly intelligent and literate.  Moreover, the straightforward moral of the film--with great power comes great responsibility--is a welcome relief from the ugly amorality that too often fills modern comic books.  Faithful to the comics from which it was spawned, Spider-Man is an instant action classic.  In one word?  Amazing.  Of course.	5.0	WITH GREAT POWER	2002-05-03	3	3	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3OCIFHRB8F2XY	"""kri5tok7ni9i"""	"When I heard that Spider-man was going out in theaters, I didn't really expect a great movie. After all, the current adaptations haven't been the best in the world; Harry Potter, for example, was a huge let-down because of the enormous missing chunks and dullness. I've been a Spider-man fan for as long as I can remember, and I guess I didn't want to see some director screw up my favorite super hero's reputation by making a below-average movie. I'm just that kind of girl who can't stand a disappointment. And so, on opening day, I listened to my friends talk about how they wanted to see the movie so badly, and when they asked if I wanted to go with them, I refused the offer. But one of the movie-goers later told me it was an excellent movie and I should watch with him (he wanted to watch it again. I was surprised) again. And so I did, and my reaction was one of pure amazement.First of all, the casting is excellent. Tobey Maguire made a great Spider-man, much to my surprise. He played Peter Parker like Peter Parker should be. I don't mean the sharp-tongued witty sort of guy most super heroes are, but just a regular person who, of course, can mess up. He was able to make most of us cry, laugh, or just stare in awe at the person who had turned a 2D character into someone real. I thought Kirsten Dunst wasn't the right type of person for the part of M.J., but she played the role pretty well. Her little speech at the end was corny and mushy, and I didn't like that too much. The Green Goblin was the best of the actors and actresses. When you watch him, you can see that he isn't acting out his part well; he IS his part. His face even looks like an evil person! I thought the costume was a bit like something that would scare a 6-year old, but anyhow ... I really hated the people who would go, ""Oh! It's Spider-man!"" or a stupid line like, ""Oh gee! What's that in the sky?"" It got really annoying after a while and I was thinking, ""Yes it's Spider-man, you idiots."" The people in this movie were great nevertheless, whether they made the audience laugh, scream, cry, or fall off (or jump out of) their seats.The plot was a bit off. It's just sort of the regular good against evil sort of theme and everyone knows how that will end. I did liked how the director didn't make the entire movie about the action and the explosives and the kicking and the leaping from bombed buildings and all that extra action stuff some people add to their movies to increase an audience's excitement level. There was actually a back story and mixed in tid bits that gave this movie a harder punch. But augh! The special effects were really bad! The scenes where Spider-man is swinging around the city in his costume were okay, and most of the action sequences were okay, but otherwise (I'm talking about Parker's fight with the Flash guy), they stank. The impression the audience gets in certain parts is, ""Wow. That was really fake,"" and the people watching the movie won't believe the story anymore.>>>>>>>WARNING: SMALL SPOILERThe ending battle really blew me away. I was really affected by the harshness of both fighters, and it was of course exciting because, even though the death of Spider-man was not probable. It didn't matter though, because the audience was still worried for their hero. I also enjoyed and understood the ending when Parker turned down MJ. I'm not exactly sure why, but I have an idea. He wanted to keep her out of danger, because if future bad guys (and there will be future bad guys) knew who he loved, they would go after her like the Green Goblin did. It was an act of personal sacrifice, and it sort of celebrated the goodness of Peter Parker, further distinguishing the line between good and evil. I know there's going to be two more sequels, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed!These are only some of the points. I do think though, that this movie definitely deserves at least, if rated one out of ten, an 8 (I think it'd have to be one heck of a movie to get a ten ;-P)&lt;P..."	5.0	Warning - Very small spoiler, though it's already obvious.	2002-05-21	7	5	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	Comic book adaptations are a mixed bunch, ranging from the excellent (Superman) to the excremental (Batman and Robin). And thankfully the latest superhero film is right up there with the greats. Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman, swinging around buildings, saving the world from Green Goblins and so on. His transformation from geeky Peter Parker to the ultra-cool Spidey is outstanding. Kirsten Dunst is good as his love interest. Throughout the film's running time, the action set pieces are well paced and inventive. The action is brilliantly done and thrilling, and the CGI blends seamlessly with the live action stunts.Fans of the comic will not be disappointed, for the film stays true to it's origins, yet has enough adventure to make it new and attention-grabbing. Director Sam Raimi (the Evil Dead films) has created a world, which is fun and adventurous. There are problems; William Dafoe is limited in his performance as The Green Goblin, with the restraining suit creating a somewhat gauche characterisation. And Raimi sometimes goes a bit far with the retina-popping visuals. Regardless, it's first-class popcorn- munching entertainment, with enough action and FX to satisfy audiences.	4.0	Spiderman	2002-08-10	0	0	0

Everybody of course knows the standard plot line with Spiderman.  Peter Parker is the high school student who isn't physically overwhelming and is picked on by other students.  He has of course the woman he's seriously in love with in the stunningly beautiful Kirsten Dunst.  On a school trip to a museum, he's bitten by a radioactive, DNA hyped up spider and there's your story.  We see him going through the learning process of how to become Spiderman and use his newfound powers which is hilarious and amazing.  His foe for this first of probably several new Spiderman movies is the Goblin.  Willem Dafoe's performance is absolutely wonderful and probably the best acting job I've seen him do in some time.  The fight scenes in this movie are right up there with ""The Matrix.""This is an emotionally uplifting and wonderful movie that you can take your family to and everybody will enjoy!  Other reviewers have stated that some of the fight scenes might be a little too much for younger children.  The fight scenes in this great movie are no worse than many of today's popular video games and the shows on TV geared towards these same children.  For those that want a little more than what is put on the screen, I might also suggest the paperback, written by Peter David.  The second disk has scores of extra stuff with something of interest for everybody.  This DVD is an excellent addition to your DVD collection.

Maybe it was the comic books, or the cartoon series. But in any case, you fell in love with the Web-head. You wanted to be him. Climbing walls, swinging high over the busiling streets of the city that never sleeps. It was intriguing, beguiling, a dream within a dream come true. And now, it's just that, a dream come true...Sam Raimi, along with the talents of Tobey Maguire, Kristin Dunst, and Willem Dafoe, all courtesey of the colorful imagination of Stan Lee, have created the best comic book movie adaptation (dare I say it, ok...) EVER! All your expectations are dashed and surpassed in over 2 hours of nothing but web-slinging action. I was totally blown away. Sam Raimi certainly had a definite vision for Spider-Man, and it shows. He faithfully recreates a hyper-reality New York City for Spidey. His execution of the mythos of Spider-Man onscreen is simply flawless.And in these troubled times, isn't this what movie goers and film buffs want? Pure escapist fiction, comic books superheroes and exploits come to life. Stuff blows up, and throw in some computer-generated images for the kiddies, and patriotism for 9/11. Character and plot development, (the tormented superhero, and average joe who must struggle with the great power he has acquired and the great responsibility that he must deal with) along with exceptional talent and a director with a keen eye for the action flick to boot. Simply, it's pure movie magic.You're a Spidey fan, and to see these characters come to life on the screen, in such an excellent manner, and it's just TOO much. I was estatic, the entire film. Spider-Man stands alone by itself a remarkable picture. Why criticize it when there's so much to love about it? Spider-Man has it all. Columbia Pictures, Sony, and of course Raimi and Maguire have their work cut out for them for years to come, both financially, and professionally.It's Spider-Man, the comic book, the hero, the man, come to life.

Maguire makes a brave attempt at being the genetically altered Peter Parker, called upon by his sense of moral justice to clear up the city after his Uncle is killed by a robber.Dunst puts in an average performance as his beautiful girl-friend (who somehow manages to not notice the similarities between one of her best friends and the web-slinging superhero!).The film offers what we need sometimes in a world obsessed by introspection and pretention: some light relief.

And we now settle in for a super cinematic treat.I thought the Goblin was kind of goofy. A more dramatic foe would have been Venom or Carnage. Let's hope one of them will pop up in the next episode.I was happy to see that the movie's rating allowed for the little ones (kids) to view the film. On the other hand the death scene was much more graphic then any comic book Stan Lee or Todd Mc Farland had ever penned. It's a shame too. I really don't think our small-fry need to be exposed to violence in a super-hero film. Star Wars? I suppose it's inevitable.For non-stop action, thrills, and spills, Arachnoid-man has it and more.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"For starters ""Spider-Man"" is probably the most faithful translation of a comic book superhero to the big screen.  Throughout the movie I kept thinking, yes, this is in ""Amazing Fantasy"" #15, that is from the cover of ""Spider-Man"" #39, and that is what ""really"" happened to the Green Goblin.  Go back and look at ""Batman,"" ""Superman"" or any other comic book film and you will find that beyond the basic plot of their origin, you will not find anything reminding you of specific issues or great moments from the actual comic books.  On this score I believe the credit goes to director Sam Raimi, but there is always the possibility David Koepp's screenplay might have had something to do with it (note: Stan Lee and Steve Ditko get credit for creating Spider-Man but John Romita, Sr. deserves some credit too given that much of his artwork is invoked by the film as well).Of course there are differences, because film is a different medium from comic books (feel free to quote me on that one).  Some of the changes result from a desire to provide an appropriate rationale for Spidey's powers.  This means we get a scientist providing expositionary details during the visit to the lab where the spider (now genetically enhanced rather than radioactive) puts the bite on Peter Parker.  While this works for the ability to cling to walls and the good old spider-sense, I am less sure about the natural web spinning ability.  I mean, on the one hand, the invention of his special web fluid was how we knew Peter was a brilliant young scientist, while on the other, how does the web go through the costume?  No, this is not ""No Prize"" worthy, but it does bug me.My thoughts on other changes: Yes, it was good to forget about Gwen Stacy, go right to Mary Jane Watson and completely ignore Betty Bryant, given the history of Peter Parker's love life.  However, having MJ have a crush on Spidey smacks too much of Superman and Lois Lane for my taste, although since she is a high school senior they were right to tone down her sexuality from the bombshell Peter finally encountered in the comic.  The Spider-Man costume looks a lot better than I thought it would and I certainly understand why the Green Goblin goes heavy metal.  However, the yellow eyes on/off was a bit bothersome, although, again, I understand why you do not want two characters with giant eye blanks trying to have a lengthy conversation.My biggest complaint with the film would be that the computer generated sequences of Spider-Man web-slinging through New York City just do not seem real.  Granted, it is really hard to get a feel for watching somebody do that (compare it to Tarzan going through the trees in the old Johnny Weismueller films versus the Disney cartoon), but maybe they can do something in the future films.  Similarly, some of the fight sequences when Spider-Man takes on a gang seem (ironically) rather cartoonish and, again, I wonder if it is because this is computer generated action.The casting is fine, although Rosemary Harris never looks as frail as we all remember Aunt May.  Tobey Maguire tends to keep things a bit too sedate with MJ after his transformation, but there is undeniable chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst at key moments in the film.  Willem Dafoe does some of his best acting opposite himself (you will see), and James Franco does a nice job of reinventing Harry Osborn for the modern world.  Special kudos to J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who only has a limited number of scenes because he steals every single one of them.  Look real quick to spot Stan Lee in this film.""Spider-Man"" is one of those films you give 4.5 stars, because it manages to surpass expectations in some key regards while still needing to be improved in some other areas.  However, the basics are all here for extending the franchise and I have to think that the second time around they will fix all of these ""problems.""  Ultimately, the faults are not of the comic book story but of the filmmaking, and who would have ever thought that would be the case?  The main thing is that even hardcore Spider-Man fans are not going to be bitterly disappointed by this film."	5.0	"Maybe the most faithful ""comic book"" movie of all time"	2002-05-05	9	9	0

Awesome scenes with high-flying action.  The first scenes where Peter Parker is playing with his new-found abilities were great.  One reviewer here said that Willem Dafoe was over-the-top.

I'm not a comic fan so I don't know how closely the movie follows the actual comic. This movie tells the story of how Peter Parker, a nerdy (and therefore smart) kid, turns into Spiderman, the (probably still) smart, cool hero. Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman because he looks good. I don't know- is it Tobey Maguire in the Spiderman suit too? Or is it a stuntman. Well whoever it is in there looks nice as well. The conflicts within Peter/Spiderman are also conveyed, as well as the ""gift or curse"" aspect. The special effects are really great to watch, probably the best part of the movie. It's just a really fun movie, especially the ""swing from building to building"" and the ""launching spider webs"" parts.

Its not a horrible movie, but the only redeeming value in this movie is the special effects,  the action, and the bonus features if you're into that kind of thing. The acting is not amazing.

Maguire is good in the lead. All style and no substance, but it does do a good job of explaining the character's history. No one who reads the original Marvel comics will remember Spidey getting in the ring with Macho Man (but then again, they've probably never heard of the EVIL DEAD, which would be a blessing if they haven't), but this film is a worthy companion to the excellent animated series produced in the 90s upon which its based. Raimi's direction is not Oscar material, but at least he didn't use that god-awful shaki-cam (or Sam Ram-a-cam).

The story line was impeccable, and so were the special effects.  There was just enough romance to keep the interest of my completely female brain.I was glad to see that the movie kept the moral aspect of ""Spiderman"" instead of turning it into a pop culture nightmare like some producers do.

Fortunately i knew better to judege on a movie before seeing all of it so i reserved my judegement til i watch it on the BIG screen...To my surprise I actually enjoyed it very much, it had content, action, teary bits and yes whats a superheroes film without saving people... so as a superhero standard it has it all...The character development namely spiderman himself is well constructed in a hasty way i mean he got bitten by a spider(super smart) and then went home felt sick and next day he's spiderman and it didn't take long for him to enbrace his new super power so yes it was brief but only just any shorter spiderman creation would have been unsatisfactory...What i find the movie didnt' work for me is the dialogue/script its really cheesy at times but again i guess thats how its done in comics... afterall this is a comic made into movie... so its ok but script could be less lame like xmen or hulk... but that didn't do too badly for me...The story is very involving and i think in any superheroe film there should be theme or punch line in spiderman's case its ""WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLITY!"" thats a great line kinda remind me of lord of the ring fellowship of the ring when frodo said i never wish the ring came to me and gandof replied something like its not for you to decide, you should only decide with the time its given to you( sorry i think i butched these wonderful lines i am sorry )Special effects is good its good to see they have not only made spiderman fly on its webs but put in lots of energy when he swings from web to web... i guess these days all special effects are done very well impressive indeed...My favrioute aspect of the film is the perfermances... Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst puts on a good and solid acting thats believable and dramatic... but I will give the crown perfermance to Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin he's acting is superb to me he's the green goblin, in some of his scenes he really made you feel the terror from within... i think he stole the show!!!overall this film is very entertaining to watch this is a film made for fans and to make lots of money all of its qualities and end suggests a sequeal and spiderman has been very sucessful at the box office making millions so it should but thats all it will do for me a good 2 hour of entertainment... however watching the hulk has giving me a everlasting experience and spiderman only 2...A good action superheroe movie typical of its genre... but for me and only for me it could do with more depth and magic...i give ***** 4/5 ***** enjoywebs get sticky!"	4.0	Spiderman Cast its webs over you!	2004-11-21	1	0	1

But I knew I would love this movie, well me being compelled to anything with true and pure raw or unveiled emotions. It had good action I mean I haven't read the comics or really watched the cartoons, but my bro Bill has and he says they stayed quite true to the whole story line(course they did change some things to work for a movie and the web shooters, but I like the whole web coming right out of the wrist instead of those web shooter things better anyways.)But yeah...I *Love* it. I now most people wouldn't cry, but I did...In fact I've been crying alot today, I can totally sympathise with ""Peter Parker"" not being able to have the one he loves so much...I mean that really hurts, he could, but yet he can't. Of course if you've read the cmoics you'll know, but if you haven't then well you'll know when you see the movie. Definetely lives up to the hype in my opinion. There were deep emotional connections with each main character.  It was just so awesome. I heard their supposed to make 2 more, I dunno how they can top this one, but I'd love to see it done, or at least just as good!!! I don't want to see another ""Mummy Returns""!!!But this movie was just awesome, just don't have to many expectations. I may have, but I could feel the movie before I saw it, I could kinda sense it. And it gave my emotions the kick-start they'de needed for a couple of weeks(With God's work I use my emotions alot).So I definetely recomend it. Its not just an action movie, its a very emotional film(In a good way!!!), thoughtfull, good strong charcters, and well its just plain good!!!So *enjoy*, I honestly *HOPE* you will!!!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3NZVCL9N8CLHB	"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True"""	I give it 3.75 or just under 4 stars. Spiderman was a decent and enjoyable movie, but still suffers from the curse of the superheroe movies.First of all, I must say the fact that he had his webbing come directly out of his wrists bothered me. In the comics peter parker invented his webbing and used machines to shoot it, it wasn't one of the powers he got from being bitten by the radioactive spider. Also there are other inaccuracies. Stan Lee let the director and producers change things as they saw fit in both Spiderman AND Xmen (and probably will in daredevil and the hulk coming out soon too). I don't look kindly on to this. Why can't they stick to the original, perfectly good story? Every time a book or comic transitions into a movie people complain when they make changes... so why not listen for once??Anyhow, some other things bugged me. Spiderman himself looked pretty good, in that he didnt look like a complete idiot in his spandex suit. But the green goblin's suit was just completely rediculous. I've also never been much of a fan of the old spiderman enemies (greengoblin being the main archvillain), Im a child of the 80's and early 90's so I always liked the newer characters like Venom, Carnage and such much more that the corny ones from the 60's. So I am a bit biassed. I also dont really like comics being made into movies because, well... come on... when a guy is running around with super spider powers in a cartoon or comic its dramatic, fun, and can even be taken seriously. But when you have a real guy running from roof to roof in tights in live action video... it's tough to not find it corny or silly.Still this movie had many good points. It was generally an enjoyable experience. The special effects were great and it was much better all around than X-men was. The acting was ok, and while some points of the real comic story were altered many other details were kept in tact (at least sort of).Overall this isn't a bad movie, but I don't consider it a GREAT movie either. It's a great choice to rent on a weekend or to put on at a get together though. And watching it once will probably be atleast somewhat enjoyable for most fans.I cant give it 4 stars but it gets a solid 3 stars for sure.	3.0	almost 4 stars... but not quite.	2003-05-06	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the quintessential boy next door.  He is kind of geeky, more than a little shy, and really nice.  Of course he is also very good at science.  Peter goes on a field trip to a laboratory doing interesting genetic experiments on spiders, and one happens to have escaped during Peter's field trip.  Naturally the ferocious little critter bites Peter.  Soon Peter discovers that he is really strong, and can shoot webs out his wrists, and can climb walls with his bare hands.  Why, Peter has become a superhero!  As those of us familiar with the superhero genre know, there is a lot of angst in the superhero world.  In Peter's case, it is the guy that he could have stopped with his new powers that kills his Uncle Ben (played by veteran Cliff Robertson), a guilt that plagues Peter through decades of Spider-Man comics and now in this movie.Peter also has yearnings for the beautiful redheaded girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Given Peter's natural shyness and his feelings of inadequacy, he has a hard time telling Mary Jane that he is attracted to her a lot.  Mary Jane adds to Peter's angst.Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) gets to heap on the angst yet further since she has lost her husband of many years when Peter could have prevented it, though Aunt May has yet to learn this information.  Poor Peter.  If angst were money Peter would be rich.  However, Peter also gets a cool enemy, the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).  The Green Goblin has a cool sort of Jet Ski for the air that emits a smoky trail, so that environmentalists will hate him since clearly it is the good spider versus the evil industrialist.As corny as the plot sounds, this movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable.  The computer generated images are well done, with some of the scenes approaching phenomenal.  While the quality of the plot and the ambiance fall short of ""Superman the Movie"" and ""Batman,"" this movie still joins the select group of superhero movies that are sufficiently believable and sufficiently true to the original comics to allow followers of Spider-Man comics to enjoy this movie.  Spider-Man is not an invincible superhero, and there are points where you wonder how he can possibly beat the Green Goblin.  I kept hoping that he would tell Mary Jane how he felt about her, but that has to wait another day.Technology has advanced to the point where movies such as ""Spider-Man"" are more than technologically advanced B-movies.  Tobey Maguire can act, as evidenced by his phenomenal role in ""Seabiscuit,"" and he does well in this movie.  While there were a few places where I was a little frustrated, I think it was because Peter Parker was less predictable in this movie than I would have expected from the comics, and that is a very good thing.There are several editions of ""Spider-Man"" available.  I prefer wide screen, but the second disc of the special edition is, like most special editions, uneven in its extras.  Some are reasonably good, others are filler.  If you have purchased other special edition DVDs, you will probably like this one.  Otherwise, get a lower cost wide screen variation and pass the special edition by.  However, whatever you do, you should get this one if you like superhero movies, because as a superhero movie this one is a winner."	4.0	Does Whatever a Spider Can	2005-02-23	1	0	1

New York City is surreal, and yet the main characters are believable as natives ""from Queens"".Casting Tobey McGuire as Parker/Spiderman was a thoughtful choice, and helped to keep the film close to the origins of the Marvel comic. Critics said the same things about Michael Keaton before they saw him play the odd Bruce Wayne in the first Batman. Kristen Dunst sparkled. Character actors in the role of the newspaper publisher (this guy is also a villain on HBO's ""Oz"" and a shrink on ""Law and Order""; when does he rest?), and Peter's uncle (a cameo by Cliff Robertson having a bad hair day) were just cartoonish enough to help make the film.But, a film is only as good as its villain.The Green Goblin is more stylish than expected, and William Dafoe is a better actor than what you would expect to be cast. But, he goes over the top and seems uncomfortable no matter which of his two personas is up for a scene. Points to the original Batman, where Jack Nicholson set the standard for all villains to come.

Well, maybe I should leave out ""The Matrix"" and ""X-Men"", which were great entertainment flicks.  But here is one of the best movies of 2002: ""Spider-Man"".This is perhaps the best popcorn movie I've seen in years.  Great performers, great characters, fantastic story.  It's got almost everything that a good piece of entertainment should have.  The story of a young boy -played here to flawless perfection by Tobey Maguire -who is stung by a super radioactive spider, and his life is changed forever.  His battle with one of his arch-enemies, The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, in a scene-chewing performance), is fantastic considering the bond between their corresponding alter-egos.  Peter Parker's secret crush to Mary Jane (lovely Kirsten Dunst) is perhaps what drew me closer to the Parker/Spidey character, not to mention the twist ending that reminded of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca"".  I really love this movie.""Spider-Man"" came in the same year of ""Star Wars-Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"".  When I came out of the theater, after seeing Spidey in action, my heart was filled with fear because it made me wonder ""a movie about a web-slinging, wall crawling superhero is gonna be better than a ""Star Wars"" flick?""  And I wasn't mistaken: this film is better than Episode II.As for the DVD, all I have to say is that I love the documentaries; I love the profiles on director Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman; and I definitely love the gag reel with the bloopers.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ADVG53CA4FTWI	Macauley86	"This movie was boring. I really do not get why there's so much hype about it. The dialogue was terrible and the romantic story was ridiculous. Also, the plot was painstakingly predictable. Ok, all movies are clich&eacute;d one way or another, but that does not bother the audience if the characters look real and multidimensional and the story is well developed and paced. In this flick, instead, we have nothing but clich&eacute;s and clich&eacute;s, over and over and over again, and nothing else to make the story stand out. The second half of the movie was especially bad, with spider-man doing all the staff that superman would do: saving children from buildings on fire, saving the innocent girl from being raped, stopping bad boys from robbing money from-I-do-not-remember-who, I mean, you get the picture. But the worst is served in the final scene with Peter Parker and the chick whatever-her-name-was. I mean, talk about completely unbelievable and ludicrous dialogue. My friends and I were laughing our heads off, I mean it was really as bad as the dialogue in ""Autumn in New York.""  Only the action scenes were ok, but nothing I hadn't seen before. And you can't base a movie on special effects. They are fun for five or ten minutes, but, after a while, they bore you to death."	2.0	Boring and Highly Overrated	2002-05-13	9	2	7

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3G4HY8IZNQT33	MacDood	I took my seat in the cinema expecting to be disappointed. I wanted Spider-man to be special, but like many big movies in recent years, the potential of the source material was never realised when translated to the big screen. Well, I was anything but disappointed. If you love Spider-man then you'll love this movie. If you don't know anything about Spider-man, you'll love this movie. I watched this with my wife and daughter, both of whom I had to drag with me. My wife did not fancy watching a movie based on a comic book, and my daughter, aged 8, didn't really know who Spider-man is. Both loved this movie. We all loved this movie. Sam Raimi has delivered as much as could be expected. The movie isn't perfect, but its close. Yes, at times the pace slows, but that is required to develop character relationships, after all this is a movie not a computer game. The CGI is at times obvious, especially when Peter Parker is first enjoying his new found abilities, but that is forgiven by the totally awesome closing sequence. Just before the end titles, there is a final sequence showing Spidey, up close, swinging through New York which is truly amazing, and in my opinion flawless.From the acting standpoint Tobey Maguire really delivers, as does Willem Defoe. This was such an enjoyable two hours, that I am going to see it again tonight, and I just can't wait to see that closing sequence again.	5.0	Sam delivers!	2002-05-06	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I was surprised to find I enjoyed this movie even more than Attack of the Clones--and I'm a big Star Wars fan. Partly it was the novelty of the movie, since I didn't know as much about Spiderman man as I did about Superman and Batman, for example, when I was a kid and was reading comics. And partly it was the fact that this was a more intimate movie than Attack of the Clones, since it concentrates on many fewer personalities and goes much more into the development of the Peter Parker character and his immediate family and friends (as well as his enemies).The movie does a great job of realizing Spiderman's abilities, which are put to good effect in the movie. The fight scenes with the Green Goblin are really well done, and the movie seems to succeed without nearly the amount of special effects that the Star Wars movies are using.One minor detail. In the original comic strip, Peter acquires his amazing abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. In this movie, he's bitten by a genetically engineered super-spider, whose DNA interacts with his own to give him his new-found abilities.All in all a great movie for the summer.

Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people in awe, but they left me saying ""how cheesy..."" The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie. And when you think about the plot, you realize that there is no substance, no soul to this ""blockbuster"". It is merely Hollywood's newest excuse to capitalize on a franchise. That is all Spider-man is- an attemp to gain truckloads of money by making 4 or 5 sequels. And I dread the day the Spider-man II comes out, because I know that it will only lead to Spider-man 3,4,5,and 6. Lets face it- sequels are never as good as the original, and in this case, the original (isn't that great)."	1.0	Does not live up to the hype...	2002-09-18	4	1	3

The villain was almost as cool as Spiderman. The action scenes between Green Goblin and Spiderman will definitely make this movie something to be remembered. This movie was better than even the Xmen in my opinion and I liked the Xmen. The success of this movie will also make it possible for other superhero movies to make it to the theater.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AL6YKEMP93W72	Marcos Rodriguez	"""With great power comes great responsibility.""That line is the theme for the comic book adaption of the web-slinging, wall-crawling hero Spider-Man.The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Peter Parker lives with his grandparents and he's every parents dream child. He's a science nerd who knows too much about science. How much? Well, enough for him to get beat up in the hallway. Peter dreams of being popular, having a cool car and being the boyfriend of popular girl Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst), his next door neighbor. Peter's only friend is the spoiled rich kid Harry Osbourne (James Franco), whose father happens to be scientist and president of Oscorp, Norman Osbourne (William Dafoe).During a field trip, Peter gets bitten by a radioactive spider which escaped it's cage. That night Peter becomes ill and by day his gone through a strange transformation. His sight has improved and he no longer needs his nerdy classes. Also, Peter's chest and abs have become stronger and harder.After discovering his strange ability to shoot web from his wrist, Peter goes out to the streets to test his new found ability and enjoys them. However, this new power gets in the way of Peter's responsibilities. He skips his chores and gets into fights in school.After an encounter with a thief and killer, Peter becomes the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sticking out for the little guys in town and helping civilians in trouble. However, Spider-Man's biggest battle will be up against a mad scientist.After being told that his fired, Norman Osbourne decides to do a little experiment on himself which goes bad. Norman gets a split personality, a personality of a ruthless killer. Norman becomes the Green Goblin and heads out to get rid of Spider-Man.The movie has a great story to it. It's amazing how this once vulnerable boy becomes a brave hero almost overnight. It deals with a huge transformation that could apply to teenagers growing up. Once you transform into an adult you have great responsibilities and Spider-Man carries that message well. William Dafoe is magnificent as Norman Osbourne. Dafoe plays the villain very convincing and menacing. There's one scene where Norman confronts his other personality and Dafoe delivers it very well.There's also a love story between Mary Jane and Spider-Man. Mary Jane is in love with Spider-Man and Peter Parker wants to be with Mary Jane but as Peter Parker and not as Spider-Man. Mary Jane is an aspiring stage actress and Kirsten Dunst actually plays the character very well.There are many good things about Spider-Man, but of course there are some flaws. The special-effects weren't spectacular or amazing. Most of the effects kind of looked faked. There wasn't any ""wow"" moments where I was blown away. There's also a scene that's copied right out of the Matrix.There is no doubt that the Spider-Man costume is great, but the costume for the Green Goblin looked very cheesy. It looked like a villain from the Power Rangers. It didn't strike fear at all. The menace Dafoe delivers is gone once he puts on the goofy Halloween costume.At times, while watching Spider-Man, I felt like I was watching an advertisement. It felt like Spider-Man was trying to sell things while promoting a Macy Gray concert. The ending was sort of anti-climatic. The last battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin is very brief.Also, the soundtrack by Danny Elfman didn't strike my attention. It wasn't spectacular. It was actually forgettable. I didn't walk out humming the tunes like I did with the X-Men movies.Overall, Spider-Man is the classic and simple story of nerd-becomes-hero with some good performances and some good action. Fans will defiantly be pleased and non-fans will be entertained."	4.0	A good story with a web of thrills!	2004-04-15	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	Honestly, I didn't expect to like this film.  I'm from the original Spider-Man generation.  My roommate in college was a comic geek, and I was inundated  by the life and times of...  Spidey wasn't my favorite (I was more a Dr. Strange type), but he was a regular visitor.  As such, I have an entire set of preconceptions about what he would sound like and how he would act.So my first reaction when Tobey Maquire showed up on the screen was that this was going to be a very tiresome film.  While I changed my mind about the film as it went on, I'm still not happy with Maguire's presentation.  It feels overplayed to me, and stiffer than even Peter Parker's early shyness would justify.  Its not so much bad acting as it is that this Spider-Man doesn't match up to the voice in my head when I was reading the comics.In contrast, most of the other characters are dead on.  Especially the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons - who was perfect).  At some point, though, the quality of the film overwhelms any quibbles about an individual acting flaw, and the viewer simply forgets that this modern Spidey isn't a perfect reflection of the past.  It captures the spirit, and some of the wow factor of becoming and being a superhero while maintaining a near-perfect, comic book atmosphere.Spidey has always been one of the most human and accessible of the pulp do-gooders.  He has problems, makes mistakes, and learns as he goes along.  The film emphasizes this in a way that gives Peter Parker and his alter ego a vivid reality the Batman or Superman never quite achieved in their own films.  Maguire captures this struggle well, even if he isn't my perfect Spider-Man.This two DVD package has enough extra stuff to keep you busy for a day or two.  Lots of history, outtakes, and interviews at an attractive price.  I was very pleased with it, and I'm sure you will be too.	5.0	It's a Bird!  No a Plane!  No It's...	2003-12-06	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2JY7GADCSQ04T	margo morgan	"I took my 12 year old son to see this movie because we thought being PG13 rated, that perhaps it would be ok.  I normally do not allow my kids to watch PG13.  They are restricted to PG.  Spiderman is a perfect example of why I must continue to insist on this guideline.  During the movie, I heard small children (like 3 or 4 year old kids)screaming when Spiderman gets beat up rather severely.  One child cried out through the silence of the theatre, ""Mommie, don't let them hurt Spiderman!  They are hurting Spiderman!""  He was clearly distressed to see his ""hero"" being assaulted in a very violent way.  After the movie was over, my son said, ""Mom, don't bring my brother (who is 5) to see this movie.  I understand now why you don't want us to watch PG13 movies.  I liked the movie, but I thought it was too violent, and I think my brother would have nightmares if he saw it.  I'm not even going to tell him I saw the movie, so he won't be upset that he didn't get to come too.""I am so glad that I did not bring my 5-yr-old with us that day.  This is a movie geared toward adults, and as an adult, I found it very entertaining.  I loved the special effects.  I loved watching Spiderman soar through the skies and use his special powers.  I enjoyed the conflict between characters, although I found the ""save the girl"" routines a bit melodramatic and unoriginal.My bottom line is I would take my husband, but not my kids, to see this movie.  It's a shame Hollywood took an innocent cartoon comic book story and turned it into a blood and guts horror film.  It would have been fine as an R rated movie.  I think many parents are fooled by the innocence of the idea of this being a cartoon and take their kids to see it.  This is more like a Stephen King movie disguised as a cartoon.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Peter Parker is the class nerd.  One day, while on a field trip, he is bitten by a super spider and starts to gain super powers.  While he's having fun climbing walls and shooting webbing, his best friend's dad is undergoing a transformation of his own.  Norman Osborn has tried a highly risky experiment on himself, and it's made him crazy.  Transforming into the Green Goblin, he fights to bring down all those who oppose him.  When Spiderman gets in his way, the battle ensues.What really drew me to this movie was the emotions and struggles it puts the characters through.  Peter is forever longing to be noticed by Mary Jane, and his sudden transformation doesn't turn her eye.  Yet he's also aware that keeping who he has become a secret is highly important to the safety of his friends and family.  That last scene was dynamite!  I also enjoyed the Jekyll/Hyde relationship that Norman had with the Green Goblin.  That was filmed and written well, making the villain slightly sympathetic himself.  The actors do a wonderful job of drawing me in and making me care for the characters.  Much like the real world, not everything gets resolved easily, and this movie certainly left me wanting to know more.The DVD set is wonderful as well.  The film is preserved with clear picture and sound.  The commentaries are interesting and there are loads of behind the scenes things to go through.  I'm not that familiar with the Spider-Man comics, so I found the sections on the character especially fascinating.This movie tempers its action with wonderful heart, making it a truly likeable film.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	Most people who fantasize about being a costumed superhero usually focus on the upside of super powers: extraordinary strength, zooming through the air, and the adoration of fans.  Even back in 1962 with the appearance of the comic Spiderman, artists Stan Lee and Steve Ditko dared to show the flip side of a super powered hero.  When Spiderman was not in uniform, he was your ordinary geeky high school science whiz, who, unlike Clark Kent, did not have to pretend to be a walking victim.  As director Sam Raimi saw him, Spiderman is a walking mess of neuroses.  Simply donning a costume does not change the inner man.  Tobey Maguire, who plays Peter Parker, the Spiderman, does not allow his super powers to alter his basic sense of character.  As a counterpoint to Parker, another superpowered human, the Green Goblin (Willim Dafoe), serves as a twisted doppleganger.  Both Spiderman and the Green Goblin achieve their powers in such a way that tests them more internally than physically.  With Parker, he is bitten by a radioactive spider that alters his DNA to give him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider.  With the Goblin, he plays the Mad Scientist who uses himself as a guinea pig to test a drug that will give him powers roughly equal to those of Parker's.  But in Parker's case, he has the advantage of his wise Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who warns him that with great power comes great responsibility.  Parker refuses to heed this sage advice at first, but later comes to realize its validity.  There is no equivalent for the Goblin, who seeks only increasing power to fuel his own mania.Much of the charm of SPIDERMAN is visual.  There are numerous scenes of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin launching themselves through space and from building to building.  The scenes that accompany this visual treat bring to mind the similar scenes that Superman and Lois Lane played out in the earlier SUPERMAN movies, where Christopher Reeve saved Margot Kidder from falling from a skyscraper.  Parker's romantic interest is Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is both sweet and believable as a young lady who drifts from one man to another until she discovers that her true love (Parker) has always been right there for her.  The audience is never permitted to see the movie solely in terms of escapist derring do.  Although much of SPIDERMAN is exactly that, its more subtle charm is in its insistence that behind the glamor of a mask and power must beat a heart that permits the hero to remember that raw power used without consideration for others is seen ultimately as making its possessor as weak and as pathetic as any science geek before he gets bitten by a spider that offers him a choice about life and ethics.  Those like Peter Parker make the right choice and can still live a relatively normal life.  Those like the Green Goblin do not and the inevitable loss of both stature and power makes him stagger about the stage, like a wounded King Lear, bemoaning life's terrible ironies.	4.0	Spiderman: You Need Not be a Kid to Like It	2002-11-08	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ANOGHIXGCRKBX	Mathew Abraham	"Good, ol' Spidey he's just fabulous. Yeah the movie is great, I think it is going to be a blockbuster. Toby Maguire, he fits in naturally into Spidey's character, he does not over act has a wry sense of humor with a controlled emotional element. He is the right choice, but Kirsten Dunst ( a good looker indeed) well I think she is there just to add a female sparkle. Her character requires more development, especially emotional impact, maybe in the upcoming spidey movies.Technically I think the special effects are good but could have been much better. Some of Spidey's Swinging from building to building or crawl up the walls looked very cheesy and artificial, more cartoonish but let me emphasise it is only a few scenes.How Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) becomes spiderman was portrayed quite well, but I sure wish they had shown how Peter Parker actually made his Spidey costumeThe Green Goblin character build up was not dynamic and powerful enough to hate the guy. I think I felt some sympathy for him rather than treat him as a villain. The evilness was not powerfully evident in the Goblin's character and the premise of becoming the goblin needed more soul and realism.I went to watch Spiderman without any expectations and I can say that overall I am pleased with the whole package. I would give it a four out of five. I would not categorise it as ""par-excellence"" movie BUT a great fun movie with entertainment.Well, I'll just end by saying inspite of minor glitches it is a GREAT MOVIE, GOOD EFFECTS, EXCELLENT FIGHT STUNTS AND A SATISFACTORY STORYLINE.DO NOT MISS IT!!!"	4.0	Spiderman	2002-05-01	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	I have to admit when Spiderman came out, I was excited. This is what any comic book fan had been waiting for. After seeing it, I just didn't have the enthusiam that I did when I went and saw it.Spiderman tells the orign of spiderman almost to the exact that it did in the comic books. The same for the green goblin. I was impressed and loved that Sam Rami did that. A comic book movie has to stay true to its roots. If it doesn't it disrespects how it got to the big screen. Spiderman didn't do that.Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman and Peter Parker. He developed the character well and was most of all believable as Spiderman. Tobey has the look that Peter Parker had in the comics.Kristin Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson who is Peter Parker's childhood crush. She looks great in the movie. It's a better role for her than some of the ones she has played in the past. Her and Tobey have good chemistry together, but this is one of the places that I thought the movie got itself in some trouble. While Peter did like Mary Jane, his real love was Gwen Stacy. That's the only place were Sam Raimi messes up in this movie. Also the love scenes are to drawn out. Especially the one in the hospital.William Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin. He impressed me a lot in the movie. The guy has always come off to me as an intense actor. He plays an intense character and does it well. I also loved the shape the guy was in. Both him and Tobey got in amazing physical shape to play there roles.Another thing I didn't like in the movie was the fight scenes. I thought most of them were to CGI. I felt they should have put more hand to hand action in there. I also didn't like the power ranger like costumes.I did however like some of the special effects. Spiderman when he web slinged was impressive. Without CGI they wouldn't have been able to do a lot of that. He look as real as a Spiderman could.I liked Spiderman. I do it. I just felt it was long and drawn out in places. I'd reccommend it to everybody. It's a film the whole family can sit down and watch together. It's a movie I think everybody should see. I just felt the movie was to overrated and can' see how it grossed 400 plus million at the box office. I own and I like it, I feel you will too.	4.0	I liked it, I feel it's slightly over rated though	2003-10-08	2	2	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	&#147;Spider-Man&#148; is pure entertainment It buzzes along, quickly taking us from one thrilling moment to the next. The movie seems to as much fun to people like myself who&#146;ve never read the Marvel Comics series as it is to ardent comic book fans. On reflection, the film is filled with plot holes and serious lapses in logic. [For example, why does the hero take for granted his sudden new powers? How can a mere mortal slam through a brick wall virtually unscathed?] This criticism is hardly relevant, however, because any great escapist entertainment movie exists in its own world. Anyone who confuses its world with the real one needs a major reality check.Peter Parker [Tobey Macguire] is a quiet, nerdy high school senior. Intensely shy, he can not bring himself to tell Mary Jane [Kirsten Dunst], the girl next door, that he has been in love with her since he was six years old. Taunted and ridiculed by bigger, more athletic boys, Peter is miserable. All this changes when he is bitten by a genetically altered spider at a local science museum. Suddenly he is all muscle. He can scale buildings and weave webs that allow him virtually to fly all over New York City. After an appalling family tragedy, Peter decides to use his powers to fight crime. Real danger comes along in the form of a local tycoon who is himself altered in a science experiment gone wrong. Peter, now AKA Spider-Man, must uses all his powers to fight this evil tyrant.Tobey Macguire was the perfect choice to play Spider-Man. His quiet persona and his decent-but-not-great looks make his transformation exceptionally appealing. There is something about his performance that is quite touching, thus making his character a superhero that people can actually relate to.  Kirsten Dunst, one of our greatest young actresses, is perfect as Mary Jane. Willem Dafoe makes a marvelous villain.My advice? Set aside reality. Enjoy the show.	4.0	Superior escapist entertainment	2002-11-10	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2OM316GK7MPHT	"Matthew Kapsiotis ""mk915"""	'Spider-Man' does a fine job of introducing our web slinging hero as well as the character of Peter Parker.  Tobey Maguire captures Peter's personality well, in that he is able to convey his insecurities and helplessness in the beginning of the film.  He also does an excellent job of showing Peter's newly found confidence thanks to his new superpowers.As for Willem Dafoe, he too does an excellent job as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin.  His wicked laugh hits the character's behavior right on and Dafoe simply lights up the screen.Other than a few necessary inaccuracies (i.e. natural web shooting without Parker's self made web shooters), the movie stays true to the comic book both in its plot and in its character portrayal.Finally, the ending does the movie justice and sets up for an exciting sequel.Bottom Line: Good movie, worth buying the DVD.	4.0	An Excellent Start to the Series!	2005-03-30	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1X1CB49HZZHTV	Matthew Medeiros	Now when first seeing the previews for the Spider Man movie I didn't think highly of it. When the event on the twin towers occured many were touched on it and the movie was then canceled on its release date as well as others such as Trainng Day and Collateral Damage. Hearing that the Spider Man movie had a scene which they showed the two twin towers in I felt I must see the movie when finally releasing 6 months after its original release date. I have been a big Spider Man fan and have read many of the comics so still being a true fan I went to see the movie when released at theatres and when all was over Spider Man was one of the best movies I have seen in some time.  Now in the comics Gwen Stacy the true love of Peter Parker before Mary Jane Watson never existed to the movies story. Gwen Stacy dying by the same villian Green Goblin who also I didn't think could be a good villian compared to others such as Venom, Carnage, or the Lizard, William Dafoe played the Green Goblin to an excellent villian. There was some other changes to the movie from comics such as Flash Thompson the bully to Peter Parker though being in the comic a best friend but all in all Spider Man was action packed with a great story line. If you love other movies based after comics such as the Superman movies, Batman movies or even Wesley Snipes in Blade and Blade 2, Spider Man is a must have.	5.0	This was a great movie!	2002-10-07	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AWAIGWW3F6H0Z	Matthew Seitz	An above average movie version of a comic book superhero.  It is fun, exciting, and pretty true to the source material.  However, it is a bit lacking in emotional drama.  Toby Maguire does do a good job with Peter Parker, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben are both well-rounded characters.  There is both good conflict and good comic relief in the form of Flash Johnson and J. Jonah Janeson.  But Mary Jane is lacking in much depth, and The Green Goblin is almost a caricature of a comic book villian.  This seems a good start, but there will need to be more character development to make me really feel for these characters.While I am an avid comic book fan, and I enjoy the occasional Spider-Man story, Spider-Man has never really hooked me.  This movie felt the same way:  an enjoyable story and some good characters, but that's about it.  I will look forward to the next movie, but not as much as I will look forward to others.	3.0	Good, but a little thin	2002-12-04	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ARZQA769W3674	Max F. Exter	There was plenty to enjoy in this film.  The action sequences were good, and I felt that the character was treated fairly well.  However, the CGI could have used a little more work, and the dialogue was actually quite bad.It wasn't a bad film.  But it didn't really break any new ground.  Better than the live-action Batman films by a mile, worse than the first Superman film.  Also not as good as X-Men.	2.0	Very so-so.  Really 2.5 stars.	2002-12-08	3	1	2

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3ENN25NFADE1X	MBrian	"After viewing ""Spider-Man 2"", I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider-Man film. This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider-Man defeating The Green Goblin, and the final scen when Peter Parker tells Mary Jane that he can't be with her.THE WEEKEND THAT MADE HISTORYIn the summer of 2002 I watched every trailer of ""Spider-Man"". It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that ""Spider-Man"" would tank, and people would hate it and it would be the most controversial film ever, why was Sam Raimi directing this film, why was Tobey Maguire playing ""Spider-Man"". This didn't make any sense, Tobey Maguire is a dramatic actor, not an action hero. My cousin and I were thinking this film is going to suck, why didn't James Cameron take a chance to make this film, besides he wanted to write and direct ""Spider-Man"" ten years ago. Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's acheived everything that he ever wanted to acheive in cinema.Steven Spielberg, now there's a great director, ""The Color Purple"", ""Shindler's list"", what a director, HE'S ACHEIVED EVERYTHING, and changed cinema forever. But there's A.I., that film wasn't a dissapointment, but who can trust Spielberg now, he may kill Spider-Man by probably the third film, who knows. Martin Scorsese, well he would probably put gangster's in ""Spider-Man"" and that wouldn't be pretty. My cousin and I were contemplating until we had no choice but to wait and see for ourselves.114 million dollarsI took my mom to Regal Cinemas, and it was a great day, it reminded me of the day I saw ""Jurrasic Park"", and ""Titanic"", that peaceful silence, I couldn't even speak, I was so nervouse that this film would suck. In fact I was begging it to suck, I expected Maguire and Raimi to fail. My mom and I got there three hours before the movie started, the longer we stood there, the more the line got longer and longer, and longer. I saw people that were my age and baby-boomers that had waited for ""Spider-Man"" to come to the big screen. I walked in the movie and I was suprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years. I sat in my seat, the lights got dimed and the film began.After about 2 hours, I realized this was an incredible film, I said that at the time, but after seeing the sequal, ""Spider-Man"" was just an action film, there was no plot, I already knew the story. ""Spider-Man 2"" was a crowning acheivement, it will set the new generation of superhero films, and now I'm looking forward to ""Batman Begins"" cause I want to know more about Batman than any other superhero. ""Spider-Man"" made 114 million dollars in three days and it grossed 403 million dollars in its total run. I think the ""Spider-Man"" saga will probably end up like ""Harry Potter"", the darker the saga gets, the less money the saga makes. Roger Ebert's view of this film was false, this was just the tip of the ice berg, it was setting you up for the epic fights in the sequel and the dramatic scenes that have even surpassed ""Superman"", and will change cinema forever.PS: I was wrong about Tobey Maguire, he's gonna be the best Spider-Man until he reaches age 50."	4.0	Good, But Not Great	2004-08-29	3	0	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	I don't get as excited about a man swinging around a cityscape in tights as I would have at age eleven, but Raimi's film version of the classic Marvel comic character stands as one of the best film translations of a comic book to date. He manages to weave the classic Spider-Man origin story with an effective plotline, well-developed characters, and reality-bending special effects. I saw this in the theater in 2002, but my wife wanted to watch the DVD after the recent &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; trailers piqued our interest. Tobey Maguire is an inspired choice for the mild-mannered Peter Parker-turned-webcrawler, and Willem Dafoe plays a sufficiently nasty villain in the Green Goblin. It's almost enough to wash the terrible taste of Warner Bros. last three &quot;Batman&quot; movies out of my mouth...	4.0	Marvel Films definitely has their act together	2004-06-10	2	1	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A140ALJQC6RFGO	Meddie B. Finnegan	This is a great action movie. As an adult, I enjoyed it. HOWEVER, due to the wonderful marketing, and the very colorful DVD case, a parent might be inclined to get this movie for a little kid. Please watch this movie before you make this decision. It is rated PG-13 for a good reason. Spider man is a good guy, but the movie is ripe with violent scenes where good-guys die. It could be very scary for the 6 and under crowd. I only write this review because my little girl begged me to rent it at the video store. I almost did, until another parent told me to be careful, Spider-Man gave his four year old nightmares for a week.Parents need to make their own decisions about the level of violence in television that they expose their kids to.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	This was a total impulse buy. Plus, I recently bought a book on Easter Eggs on DVDs, and this was included - and I still haven't tried to find it!Like all first comic book movies (X-Men etc), I found this film to be slow, as you have to introduce the characters, and for this, discover how Peter Parker got his powers. Like X-Men 2, I'm sure the follow up to Spiderman will be a lot speedier, and will pass quickly. There didn't seem to be much action, and when there was, it was in short bursts. In-between, there's a lot of talk, and it gets a bit tedious.I just didn't see Tobey Macguire as Spiderman. Sure as the geeky little kid he is at the start, but when he removes his glasses, he looks like any ordinary guy. There's nothing special about him as an actor, apart from the fact he sometimes sounds like he's been sucking on helium. There have been many rumours about Jake Gyllenhaal replacing him before this was shot, as Tobey messed up his back, and I would have preferred Jake. But I guess we'll stick with Tobey.Kirsten Dunst struck the right chord as Mary Jane Watson, although she comes across as a bit of a damsel in distress. She'll hopefully have a bigger part in the sequel - it looks like it from the trailer. Her red wig is also extremely fake looking, and I hope she keeps to her word and dyes her hair for the sequels. (And gets extensions - her short hair suits her, but it's so boyish sometimes)Sometimes, I found the CGI to be absolutely awful in this. Sure, it probably would have looked better on the big screen (Titanic's another bad one for this - looks awful on the small screen, but that doesn't stop me watching it!). At some points, it looks more like a computer game, especially when Peter's practising his new found powers, and is running across the roofs of buildings. I didn't see it at the cinema, so I can't say how it looked on the big screen - but probably loads better.As with all these movies, there's bits taken from other comic books, and bits similar looking to other movies. Of course, you had Clark Kent &amp; Lois Lane, and it's the same with Mary Jane &amp; Peter. Also, when you saw Spiderman sitting on top of buildings, there was a strong sense of deja vu, as it's so similar to the shots you see in Daredevil.Of course, nearly every DVD I watch, I spot something connected with Friends. And I did in this! The Moondance Diner that Mary Jane works at, is the same that appeared in the early episodes of Friends (series 2 &amp; 3 I think), where Monica worked.There's absolutely hours of extras to wade through on this, but it's mostly stuff I'm not really into - I like gag reels etc, and the actors messing up their lines, I don't really like going in-depth into how they did the fight scenes etc. These extras are: commentary by director Sam Raimi, Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin and co-producer Grant Curtis; commentary by special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew; &quot;Weaving the Web&quot;: subtitled pop-on production notes and historical factsBranching web-isodes; Music videos: Hero (Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott), What We're All About (Sum 41); HBO Making of Spider-Man; Spider-Mania, an E! Entertainment Special; director profile: Sam Raimi; composer profile: Danny Elfman; screen tests for Tobey Maguire, J.K. Simmons and CGI Spider-Man; costume and makeup tests; gag/outtake reel; conceptual art and production design gallery; comic book artist pin-up gallery; &quot;Spider-Man: The Mythology of the 21st Century&quot; historical documentary; the Spider-Man Comic Book Archives; rogues Gallery; and the Loves of Peter Parker.This is a great DVD, with enough extras to keep you going, if you're that big a fan of Spiderman, and the comics. Otherwise, just a good DVD to wile away some hours.	3.0	Slow, and not keen on Tobey Macguire	2004-07-11	2	0	2

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1XIOOXV9LAZXZ	"Melissa Ann Minners ""wildkarrde3"""	I missed seeing this movie in the theaters and couldn't wait for it to hit the video stores so I could see what everyone has been talking about.  I'm not a big fan of CGI effects, so I wasn't buying all the hype about them.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that CGI effects have improved greatly.  Although it is still noticable when a digital actor is performing a stunt, the CGI actors are quite well-done.  I was also pleased to see that many fo the stunts were done by the actors themselves - most especially the fight scenes.  It's nice to see that the makers of this film didn't go overboard with all of the effects, remembering that there has to be some acting and a storyline to make the film worth seeing.It should be noted that this is not exactly the Spider-man of the Marvel Comics we all read as kids.  The spider that bites Peter Parker is not radioactive in this movie - just bio-engineered.  Some of the story was altered in a way to make this a modernized version of the comic book tale.  Some other things you should know before seeing the movie:  Spidey's web is not manufactured, but a part of his genetically altered self.  The time-frame of the movie requires that the Peter Parker - Mary Jane Watson relationship develops alot faster.  You know there will be sequels, but look how long it took for Parker and Watson to get together in the comics.Despite some of the changes made to the original story, I loved this film.  I especially liked seeing a more in-depth look at Mary Jane's life outside of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;.  Tobey Maguire's portrayal as the class-nerd-turned-superhero is excellent.  Kirsten Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane.  And what can I say about Willem Defoe's performance as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin?  Superb!  No one will ever top this portrayal of the Green Goblin!  The rest of the cast also does a great job in their roles as well!As far as the special items on the DVD, I haven't had the chance to check them all out, but I will say that the gag section was great.  I was only disappointed with the screen tests.  The only true screen test in the buch was J.K. Simmons' reading as J. Jonah Jameson.  The other scenes in this section are really practice scenes, not screen tests.  Otherwise, a great DVD!  You should definitely check it out!	4.0	Not Your Average Superhero!	2002-11-05	2	2	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"In 2002, theater audiences were treated to what is arguably one of the best superhero-inspired films of all time, ""Spider-Man"", based upon the very popular superhero character created by Marvel Comics.  Directed by Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire was very-well casted to play the shy Peter Parker, turned superhero via a bite from a genetically-enhanced spider.  A high school teenager working as a photographer for his high school newspaper, Peter and his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who is the son of the wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), travel to a laboratory/museum as part of a science class outing.  Trying to gain the attention of the girl upon whom he has had a long-time crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), Peter encourages Harry to talk with Mary Jane.  A missing genetically-altered spider then unexpectedly bites Peter while Harry (instead of trying to get Mary Jane to talk with Peter) starts to take an interest in Mary Jane for himself.  Returning home not feeling well, Peter begins to undergo some changes from the spider bite while Norman Osborn, in an attempt to save a multi-billion dollar government contract for his company, makes the ill-advised decision to undergo a military biochemical experiment upon himself.  Peter discovers his spider-enhanced physical abilities, while Norman Osborn develops a power-hungry alter ego in the form of the Green Goblin.  After graduation, Peter, Harry and Mary Jane seemingly go their separate ways, but the untimely death of Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) spurs him to become the crime-fighting superhero Spider-Man in time to fight the unscrupulous Green Goblin.With dazzling special effects, good acting and a well-written script, ""Spider-Man"" became an overnight box-office hit earning a record opening-weekend audience.  Tobey Maguire effectively brought to the big-screen the tragic hero figure epitomized by Spider-Man/Peter Parker, as did Kirsten Dunst portray the troubled teenaged girl next door.  Memorable scenes include the school bus, the outing, Norman's lab, Peter practicing, Uncle Ben's last night, the street party, Aunt May's (Rosemary Harris) frightful night, and the battles between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Overall, I rate the 2002 ""Spider-Man"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any fantasy/superhero aficionado."	5.0	"""With great power comes great responsibility."""	2004-11-01	0	0	0

From Peter's relationships with his Uncle and Aunt, his persuit of Mary Jane, and the valuable lesson he learns when he abuses his powers (with great power comes great responsibility).The special effects were amazing and the choice of the Green Goblin as the tortured Norman Osbourn was perfect.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AWHS1TFR7S1NL	Michael A. Quebec	"This won't be a long review, since a lot of reviews have been written.  All I have to say is....this is a GREAT movie!Having had to endure CBS' made for tv Spider-Man movies in the '70's, this movie is a long time coming.  Finally, the film-makers get the story & characters right, staying true to the comic-book.It helps that Sam Raimi is a Spider-Man fan & his vision & Stan Lee's/Steve Ditko's/John Romita's originals are very close.  (Raimi updated the story to the new millenium from the 1960's comic-book.)Most viewers & ALL comic-book fans will enjoy this movie.  (There was a recent viewer who put this film down while admitting that he's not a Spider-Man fan to begin with.  Well, with all respect, if you feel that comic-books are ""beneath you"", then this movie isn't for you.)  But if you want a mature approach to fantasy & action-adventure, then this movie is a dream come true!Let's see if ""Daredevil"" & ""The Hulk"", scheduled for next year, will be just as good."	5.0	Finally...Spider-Man Is Done Right!	2002-05-22	2	1	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A13NE6QC63CYZ8	Michael A. Vitale	Perhaps the best super-hero movie made to date, Spider-Man delivers on the hype with an updated and interesting take on the wall-crawler's origin and a wonderful performance from both Toby Maguire as Spidey/Peter Parker and Wilem Dafoe as the nemesis Green Goblin/Norman Osborn.The characters seem to stay true to their classic motivations as backed up by some 40-odd years of mythology. There is something for all movie fans in this film, as the love-interest played by Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson provides nice counterpoint to the battle scenes with Spider-Man and his various contagonists.Also, in a small but dead-on role, the actor that plays J.Jonah Jamison, the editor of the paper 'The Daily Bugle' looks like he could have been cloned right from the comic book page, if such a thing were possible. His part is fun and funny.It seemed like all the actors were having a good time with this project and it shows in the performances.I wouldn't take my 5 year-old, though. The Green Goblin would scare the teeth out of his mouth!Go see this movie as soon as you can.	5.0	Spider-Man swings to the top of the super-movie heap.	2002-05-10	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	While many critics complained that the CGI effects made the movie seem more like a video game, I found the effects jawdropping, awesome and quite fun.  Sam Raimi's fast-paced, lively direction perfectly propels the comic book hero onto the big screen.  Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker, showing his immense range (see &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; &quot;Pleasantville&quot;), and Kirsten Dunst radiates not only a beautiful physical presence, but the quite seductive beauty of a girl becoming a woman.  Willem Dafoe is the perfect archvillain, although it seems at times he gets too much the best of our hero, but in the end, spidey prevails.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris do nicely as Parker's aunt and uncle, and James Franco gives a moody James Dean turn (he played him in a TV movie) as Harry, Dafoe's neglected son.The whole production works mainly because of the heart the cast puts in, and the amazing effects.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AL4MKKO24563R	Michael K. Beusch	When Spider-Man was released in the theaters, I heard many people say that they didn't know why Tobey Magurie was cast as the Web Spinner. What they don't realize is that Stan Lee originally conceived of Spider-Man as an average sort of person with everyone could relate. As Rosemary Harris as Aunt May says in the film, &quot;You're not Superman.&quot; Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is of average height, underplays instead of overacts and is just as convincing at playing a high school nerd as he is at playing a super hero.Kirsten Dunst, likewise, is terrific as Mary Jane Watson. With her looks (and body), it would be easy for her to simply physically match the character. However she also manages to embody the character's vulnerability that she hides beneath her confident and charismatic exterior. Having seen very few of her adult roles, I never would have pegged Dunst for the role. However, having seen her in the role, I can't see anyone else playing it.There was much talk about the special effects in Spider-Man as there always seems to be with blockbusters like this. However, to me, the casting is the true strength of the film. Maguire, Dunst, Harris as Aunt May, Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne are all perfectly cast and show that a film can have all the latest technical wizardry, but still must depend on its actors to flesh out the characters and make the audience believe and care about what happens to them.	5.0	PERFECT casting!	2002-12-06	18	16	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A4Z9ZAV5WKZ3Z	Michael Lesch	Anxiously awaited by both comic and cartoon fans alike, Sam Raimi brings the extremely popular 'Spider-man' to life on the big screen which is true-to-form and a very rewarding rendition of this much adored action hero. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast and admirably pulls off the dual role of shy newsboy by day, crime-fighter extraordinaire by night with style and grace. Kirsten Dunst is equally endearing as Spidey's gal pal as there are more than one Kodak moments shared between the two which no doubt will be archived in cinematic annals if romance fans have their vote. Yet it is the title character's battle with the arch-enemy Green Goblin, effectively played by veteran actor Willem Dafoe, which provides the many suspenseful twists and turns evidenced in their high-flying acrobatic dealings courtesy of STA CGI. While the much welcomed side plot involving Spider-man's subdued alter-ego (the mild mannered newsboy Peter Parker) adds additional intrigue as he entangles with envious friend and rival Robert Franco for the affection of sweetheart Dunst, it is the humorous (borderline silly but still funny) antics provided by J.K. Simmons as Peter Parker's Daily Bugle boss that contributes a huge amount of laughs in this enjoyable adventure that certainly sets the standard for first rate comic book to big screen transitions.	3.0	In the still of the night, at the scene of a crime...	2010-11-24	0	0	0

The movie mainly introduces us to Peter Parker and how Spiderman came to be and how the murder of his Uncle Ben was the main turning point to become the hero Spiderman. We are introduce to the Green Goblin in Spiderman 1. The movie does stay focus; one hero and one villian, unlike Spiderman 3 where we have three villians. The one area this movie lacks is action. There are only two action scenes, maybe one more. When I was watching the video at home, I kept switching the off and on button.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ATNX84AGYIN39	"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard"""	&quot;You do too much, you're not Superman...&quot;No he isn't and thank God, as this super hero is as believable as it gets. What super hero? Your friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is. Peter Parker is Spider-man as everyone already knows and he's as average, even less than average. As branded the &quot;school geek&quot;, Peter Parker succumbs to a load of torment from his fellow peers. His parents died long ago and he lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York. In Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's &quot;The Amazing Fantasy&quot; we learn of the super hero and his origin. In the heart of a scientific lab with radioactive experiments, a spider transmutes with radioactivity and bites his last victim before it dies. This last victim is Peter Parker, the harmless student. Soon after basic encounters such as almost being run over by a car, Peter finds himself able to scale walls and have acute senses, let's not forget amazing agility. A twist from the film, Parker actually engineers web spinners with new cartridges to replace older. He then becomes the infamous Spider-man after becoming a wrestling and showing off his rare fighting abilities. Which leads to the major drama behind the reason for the crime fighting super hero to arise. A robber leaves the building without being apprehended and Parker does nothing to stop it. Little does he know, that same robber turns out to be the murderer of his Uncle Ben. From one he found out it was the thief that killed his uncle, he made a pledge to follow Uncle Ben's statement, &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility.&quot; And that is where Spider-man comes from.In Sam Raimi(Evil Dead, A Simple Plan)'s film take on the beloved comic book series, the premise is equally the same. Minor details are changed in that which Peter doesn't contact the spider bite from a radioactivity lab, but from a lab filled with amazing, genetic spiders. And he also does not create web spinners, but rather &quot;inherits&quot; them. As an avid fan of the comic series and a die hard fan of the character himself, I found these changes to be nothing for me. In fact it seemed more realistic, as I always gawked at the fact that a radioactivity lab would be produced for the likes of high school students. So the changes that everyone has arisen aren't a problem with me, but rather welcomed. But as the story progresses into the 121 minute film, we meet some very serious characters from the books. Norman Osborne(Dafoe), as the villainous Green Goblin, Mary Jane Watson(Dunst), Harry Osborne(Franco), and even Flash Thompson! I was quite surprised Thompson would even be in it, but the addition of him in it added a great variety of scenes. The whole film centralizes very well on each character as the film is basically the carving of the series. It's the true form of which Spider-man becomes and without these centralized themes that revolve around his evolving character, there would be nothing to base feelings toward. Parker's and Osborne's transitions were so wonderfully and delicately played out, you really felt for the characters and understood them to their maximum potential. Especially the very troubled MJ whose family life took a rough transition from her's in the comics. But this transition made her stronger and much more believable. I mean it is New York, not every family is happy go lucky as portrayed by the earlier comics. It's a different time period now, so the changes are necessary and Raimi took the right steps.I'm not going to explain the storyline much as everyone knows that it's the build up of the hero and the enemy on the horizon. But as mentioned before, I've read the comics, and I can assure you it's very true and very entertaining. Seeing Peter's teen angst against Uncle Ben was so remarkable and relatable. Mary Jane's troubled home life and Parker's resilience to let himself open up was so valid. Harry?s conflicting social life with his father, so heartbreaking. In the words of Homer Simpson, &quot;I guess it's all wrapped up in a nice little package.&quot;The directing and writing of the film was also captured brilliantly. David Koepp took the comics to script(with help from Cameron's &quot;treatment&quot;) and made what is thee best super hero film ever. The lines were of things people would ACTUALLY speak about and say. The people were so realistic and the underlines of Norman Osborne's 'change' were scary and ominous. Parker's childish joy and next door neighbor crush were as though I felt I had said stuff like that long ago. The writing really helped the film and even added some very memorable, creepy moments. I won't spoil any for you, but you?ll know when you see it. And let us not forget the &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; himself, &quot;Sam Raimi.&quot; His on the target directing provided some really beautiful shots, especially the ending, that put this film number one for me. The transitions, cinematography, action, etc were all so wonderfully strewn together as if a part of a web itself! Raimi's fine work on &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; which has some of the best cinematography ever really gave him a head start for this film. The choice for Raimi over someone like Fincher or even Cameron was a well adept choice and basically made the film.As always, I'm going to congratulate Danny Elfman on a superb score for the film. His work on &quot;Men In Black&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, etc have all had that eerie, yet unknown sense. The contraptions of Norman's sleek, sly and outlandish look were so overly enthralling due to the music that Elfman constructed. He captured the moment in each scene and I really feel he was the best choice for the film and should be duly noted.The themes from the books themselves are quite essential and very valuable to myself. The reflections I have made from the past 470+ comics have really crafted my way of using charisma, action, and inspiration to situations that I endure each day. Spider-man has and always will be my favorite super hero of all time. I would do anything to be in that position and to think of something like that really shows how believable and relatable the character can be. The movie itself moved me, physically as I moved around in the seats with excitement and fear. Yet it also affected me emotionally as I, and many other, could just understand the basic problems people faced in the film. For a super hero movie, which I hate to regard them as, this film takes the cake in the category. But for me, it takes the whole dish in itself. Thee best film I have seen in a long while and probably one of the more memorable ones as well. I not only recommend you to see this film, but I urge you to see it.	5.0	An older review...	2004-07-20	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"Look in the sky! It's a bird ... It's a plane ... Oops! Wrong comic book brand! Even without this comic catch phrase, one can easily say many things about the rising stock of Marvel in the movie industry. It is thanks to the successes of films like Blade and X-Men that finally pushed one of most highly anticipated comic-book adaptations over the top to completion. The movie version of the famous web-slinger has been in development for nearly ten years, mostly due to court battles as well as the lack of enthusiasm by the movie-going public for these types of films. But all the built up anticipation will find a rest as the famous comic-book superhero makes his way to big screen for the first time ever being played by a relatively unknown young actor. Will the fan base accept Columbia's film despite the lack of famous characters in front of and behind the camera? The only thing that can be said is that the ten years of built up hype and anticipation will finally come to end. Whether it will be a glorious success or a tremendous failure is not yet known accept to those that see the film and judge for themselves. Either way, it will be an exciting ride for all those involved.The story centers on the life of the young Peter Parker and the origin of the now famous comic-book superhero, Spider-Man. Peter Parker, a shy and geeky teenager, is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May after the death of his parents when he was little boy. As far back as he can remember, he has been head over heels for Mary Jane Watson, the girl next door, but he has never gotten the courage to ask her out, let alone talk to her. On what seems to be a normal class field-trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and his whole world is turned upside-down. He quickly notices that his body is changing but as time goes on, he begins to gain control over his new abilities and uses them to win a wrestling match. When he doesn't receive the money from the operator of the wrestling match, Peter ignores the burglar that robs the man at gun point. But when he discovers that the robber later killed his Uncle Ben, Peter devotes his new abilities to fighting crime. Now dubbed Spider-Man, the new superhero must master his abilities perfectly to take down the Green Goblin, who is actually his best friend's father who goes insane from an experiment gone wrong. The story for Spider-Man does a wonderful job of combining romance, action, comedy, and suspense all in beautifully well crafted script that remains consistent despite a couple integrating story lines.At the time of its release, the cast for Spider-Man was a relative bunch of unknowns but each member works well in their own way in this film outside of this handicap. It has to be said that there was quite a bit of hesitation on the part of Sony executives when Sam Raimi, the director, had chosen Tobey Maguire to take on the role of Spider-Man in this high budget feature film. This was quite reasonable considering Maguire had so little real acting experience outside of low budget films like Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules. But those fears can now be put to rest as the young actor proves that he can express vivid emotions even when his face is hidden behind a mask. Kirsten Dunst, who had gained some exposure in films like Jumanji and Bring It On, presents the perfect amount of ""girl next door"" charm that gives the story its real heart, which can only compliment her acting ability within the film. And William Dafoe, who takes on the duo role of Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, shows true acting talent especially in the scene where Norman argues with his alter self in the mirror and in his mind.Overall, Spider-Man manages to spin a web that is able to capture many integral story elements in an amazingly beautiful pattern that doesn't out do itself. Though the film manages to pull off great things, there are a couple of things to pick at here and there. One of the most prominent examples has to be the musical score conducted by Danny Elfman, who also worked on the soundtrack for another superhero film, Batman. The score is quite unmemorable and doesn't have quite the kick one would expect from this high-profile a feature. Another problem is that some of the scenes with Spider-Man, in costume form, seem too fake compared to other computer effects but this is quite a small complaint in comparison to the rest of the film. The highly anticipated comic-book adaptation has already been declared the movie of the summer before it even has the chance to get out of the gate. Whether the general public makes this statement true or not, Spider-Man is a prestigious effort that gives huge compliments to the filmmakers and all other parties involved in finally bringing this comic-book fanboy vision to the big screen."	4.0	The Moose Hole - 'Spider' Weaves a Web of Great Filmmaking	2003-12-31	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	"Watching ""Spider-Man,"" I was reminded of the first time I saw ""Batman."" I walked away from that movie awed by the visuals, but completely unmoved by the characters (even Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance was a caricature, not a character). But ""Spider-Man"" did something very unusual for films in this genre: it made me care for the people in it far more than I cared for its spectacle.And, in reflection, that's a good thing, since the spectacle here isn't all that spectacular. More about that later - for now, let's just say that ""Spider-Man"" is perhaps the most emotionally involving comic-book movie ever made.That is in no small part due to Tobey Maguire, who is absolutely perfect as the all-too-human Peter Parker, a nerdy young man who is bitten by a ""super spider"" and develops superhuman capabilities. At first, he simply tries to cash in on his newfound powers, as any teenager probably would, but he's reminded tragically that someone who has his capabilities should be using them to better the world, not to rule on ""WWF Smackdown.""This is, of course, the essential ""backstory"" that all comic book characters have, and this one really clicks. Batman is a borderline personality, and Superman is too good for his own good; in ""Spider-Man,"" we have a pretty normal guy who's only abnormal in his capabilities, which makes him darned easy to relate to, and admire.It's all about motivation when it comes to comic books. Batman is motivated by emotional pain, and Superman is motivated by his too-good-to-be-true nature; it's very difficult to see either character's life playing out much differently than they do. But Peter's destiny is chosen, not by his psychological problems or emotional programming, but by himself. He can be what he wants, and he wants to be a super-hero, but more importantly, he chooses to be a super-hero in a way that doesn't hurt his loved ones.This means sacrificing things that most young men wouldn't be prepared to do without, most prominently the love of his life, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). At first, Peter's too shy and insecure to do anything but pine away over her, but as his confidence grows, Mary Jane begins to see him in a different life, and eventually falls for him. But Peter chooses not to make himself avaiable to her for a simple reason: he's made all too aware that the only way to defeat Spider-Man is to hurt his loved ones.The comparisons to other superheroes come up again. Batman is too screwed-up to have a normal relationship, and Superman is physically incapable of one without giving up his powers. But Peter would be perfectly capable of having having a normal love life, and probably would be a heck of a catch for any woman with half a brain, and chooses not to because it would endanger her.There's real humanity and pathos in that decision, and Maguire's performance really brings that out.There's also real humanity in the central villain, Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a corporate magnate who inadvertently releases a lot more than his physical potential when he tests out his company's performance enhancing drug. His personality splits between the marginally likeable Osborne, and the Green Goblin, who's the kind of villain that likes to roll off long, evil laughs and lines like, ""he must be instructed in pain and loss."" Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend, and even after Spider-Man finally defeats him, Osborne's dying wish is that his son never finds out about his secret supervillain side. Of course, Peter, being the honorable guy that he is, honors that dying wish, even when Harry threatens revenge against Spider-Man.How long has it been since we saw a villain in one of these movies with real humanity? Only Lex Luthor, and perhaps Jim Carrey's Riddler, come close. All the rest, including Nicholson's Joker, are just cartoon characters - fun to watch, but ultimately empty and uninvolving.This all makes for a good basic drama, built on nice dialogue and fine performances - a rarity in films of this sort, which almost invariably succeed as spectacle and fail miserably as drama. But ""Spider-Man"" has the opposite problem - it succeeds as drama but fails a spectacle.The fight sequences play well, but whenever Spider-Man takes to the air, and the CGI effects cross the screen, it plays like a video game - flat, graceless, and obvious. Spider-Man looks no more real or graceful than Sonic the Hedgehog, and the effect is even more pronounced on a television screen. Many recent films, notably the latest Star Wars prequel, have shown that CGI can create animation that has real weight, realism and elegance. I don't know any other reason, save budgetary concerns, that would drive the filmmakers to settle for such obvious, silly effects here.In the end, the effects don't ruin this film - the basic goodness of the story and the quality of its telling preclude that - but with better visuals, this would have been a total triumph. As it is, I'm sure that the immense success of this film will enable the producers to hire a more competent visual effects shop for the upcoming sequel.And if that sequel is able to replica the human impact of ""Spider-Man,"" then that movie will truly be something to see."	3.0	Scores emotionally, but if only the effects were better...	2003-08-23	10	9	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1JMQ88IMH0XJL	Mike	"""Spiderman"" (2002)This year's summer blockbusters are actually looking pretty ship-shape! Last year we had the disappointments of such films as Rush Hour 2, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and so on and so forth, but to make up for those, in 2002 we've got Spiderman, Star Wars: Episode II and heaps of other intriguing films being released. Not only do I think this will be one of the best summer blockbusters of this year, I think it could turn out to be one of the most entertaining movies of 2002.I did expect quite a lot from this movie, but it surpassed my expectations beyond my wildest dreams. This movie is such a hard one in which to find fault! I was going to give it a slightly lower grade but then I just couldn't think of any reason not to give it the one I gave it (scroll down). Sure, the movie is cheesy in some places, but duh; it's a comic book adaptation! Of course there's going to be a bit of cheese n' corn. I must be the only person who liked the Green Goblin as a villain. To me he was perfectly menacing and his timing was right-on. I thought the costume would look horrible but it was actually OK.This movie keeps you in suspense (especially during the fair sequence) and surprised me with its genuine wit and heart. There is also one particular little part that made me completely jump out of my seat (watch out for when Willem Dafoe wakes up after being gassed!). The movie brings across some very important messages that not only superheroes should learn. I also liked it the way the movie built up Peter Parker becoming Spiderman because it put a bit of bulk on his character.The acting in Spiderman was terrific. In my opinion, all the actors were perfectly cast. Tobey Maguire is not the sort of guy you'd expect to play a superhero but he pulls it off stunningly, making a great hero and also turning Peter Parker into a likeable and memorable teen. Willem Dafoe reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson with his Green Goblin part. He has a great, evil laugh and his character (when he's not the Goblin) is sort of like a schizophrenic. The scenes where Dafoe is ""talking to himself"" are terrific and very well acted. I thought they would make me laugh but they were actually pretty creepy. Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane, providing her with a heart and personality. Dunst has exactly the right look for the movie, and has some fantastic chemistry with Maguire. I also adored Rosemary Harris in her role as Peter Parker's auntie.The special effects in this movie are terrific. I can't really pick out any key scenes where they were brilliant because I just completely forgot I was watching special effects. They are very realistic. The sound techniques are used effectively, especially in the last 20 minutes or so.One thing I would've liked is for Spiderman to maybe use some more gadgets? We pretty much got the sticky web thing and that was it. Maybe he just has that, I don't know, I've never read the comics (although I sort of want to after seeing this terrific movie). I look forward to seeing how Spidey's super-powers are improved in the next movie.Spiderman is a movie I think everyone will enjoy. It has a big heart and it is always entertaining to watch. It has terrific morals and messages and is able to mix genuine wit and comedy into an action-packed and intriguing storyline. This movie was a lot of fun and I think it'll be one of the biggest grossing movies of 2002, if not, the biggest! Bring it on, Spiderman 2!MY GRADE: A"	5.0	Spidey spins a stunning web!	2002-06-07	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3HQ0IIDO2HELF	Mike	Spider-Man first off, is a great movie. Sure it's not perfect but what is? It's really what a fun movie is all about and it doesn't feel like the 121 minutes it is. The first disc, actually has more of the fun extra-wise with the pop-up webisodes and MAKING OF vignettes along with two commentaries. One that's okay (the sam raimi one) but a really good one (visual FX Crew). The second disc is mostly promotional stuff except for the great documentary about the Spider-Man comic. My main complaint with the DVD is that the menus are a bit frustrating to navigate and that the second disc could've had alot more but this is still worth owning. Go for Widescreen though, Fullscreen crops off alot of the action.	4.0	Great Movie, Good DVD	2003-02-09	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A17G7WJKAJVKQW	"Mike ""Mike"""	I must admit, a comic book fan I am NOT. So, I'm not familliar with anything to do with Spiderman. Heck, I didn't even know the guy's name was Peter Parker. So, I came into this movie with no preconceptions and no expectations.I can say this: It IS a fun movie. It has some pretty cool special effects and I like the characters for the most part. It is a typical superhero movie, although I find &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The X Men&quot; to be superior films. Tobey McGwire does a very good job portraying the unlikely hero. I also liked Kirsten Dunst, but that goes without saying.I think I am just amazed at how cartoonish and bland some of the climactic action sequences were. This movie is a strange case where I found the plot and character moments much more satisfying and believable than the actual action.As much as I like Willem Defoe, the villan in this movie is HORRIBLE, and the villan in these cheesy flicks is basically a &quot;make or break&quot; point. Maybe this is why the action sequences did nothing for me.I'm amazed that this film outgrossed Star Wars. At the same time, I think a sequel done with a slightly better villan and a somewhat more serious plot might just work.	3.0	Not A Bad Flick	2002-11-19	3	1	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3M1NNDD95HR0R	Mike Smith	I was hoping they would come out with Spider-Man on the big screen.  I am a big superhero fan.  Well, the movie eventually did come out and I saw it in the theater.  It did not fall short.  Character development was right on.  You really get the picture that Peter Parker is struggling through life, and then gets these amazing powers that transform his life but do not remove hardship.  With his new powers, he has the added burden to carry.  A crime-fighting superhero is born.  Start here, then see Spider-Man 2.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	Full disclosure: I have never read a Spider-Man comic book, and I avoid reading the daily Spider-Man strip because it annoys me having to feel sorry for a superhero! Here he is with all these wonderful powers, and he gets nothing from them but grief; he's a paragon of goodness, and almost everyone in the world thinks he's a diabolical criminal. I have real people and problems to worry about! Nevertheless, Sam Raimi's movie version of Spider-Man made Spidey and his alter ego, Peter Parker, seem more real to me than I ever imagined they would. The sheer craft of this movie is, of course, incredible; Raimi really makes you feel Peter's astonishment at discovering his new powers, as well as the breathtaking adrenaline rush of web-swinging between skyscrapers. But it is the casting which is this movie's ultimate triumph. Like everyone else, I was doubtful about the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter/Spidey. Among other things, however nerdy he might be, Peter has always been drawn in the comics as fashion-model handsome, which Maguire most definitely is not. But Maguire is such a pure, emotionally direct actor that he makes you love Peter and ache for him. Kirsten Dunst, perhaps the most talented actress of her generation, is equally lovable as MJ. Willem Dafoe does a brilliant job of playing the Jekyll-Hyde aspects of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin; Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very moving as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May; and J.K. Simmons (in the absence of Jason Robards) makes a hilarious blowhard of J. Jonah Jameson. This unquestionably is the best superhero movie ever made. If you ever needed proof that, on the evolutionary scale, a spider is superior to a bat, here it is.	5.0	By far the best of its species.	2002-05-27	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3GNHU6FOAHGSJ	"""milla381"""	"The year's supposed Blockbuster hit ""Spider-man"" was neither high-ranking nor low-ranking on my list.I personally loved movies based on comic characters and honestly, seeing ""Spider-man"" gave me that 50/50 feeling of whether I liked it or not.Tobey Maguire was a perfect fit for the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman. And so was Willem Dafoe and that other dark-haired fella. Even the lady who portrayed Parker's...aunt was it?...she even gave one hell of a performance. Which character gave a rather ::blech:: performance? Kirsten Dunst, that's who.The lady who portrayed the character of Mary-Jane was nothing but a mere ""the-film-could-have-done-better-without-her"" role. With the occassional screams and shrieks all topped off with the cheesy way of saying, ""I love you Peter Parker"" in the end...I'm sorry, was I suppose to be touched at this part? Maybe if Ms. Dunst tried not to TRY so hard at acting, maybe then she'll be a formidable lady to portray Mary-Jane.As far as the actions were concerned. It's good, but I've seen better. Don't get me wrong; it was very well done, it's just that...seemed like I've seen one specific move near the end of the movie in the middle of the movie...get it? It seemed like the actions were played in a loop, causing me to lose that ""edge-of-my-seat"" awe of what was being shown in the big screen.So for those who doesn't really care much for the actual content of the movie and is just there to see SPIDEY fly...I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie...but for those seeking theatrical works and amazing ingenuity...look for it somewhere else."	3.0	Spidey review	2002-10-21	3	0	3

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1S0BOHBQBFXZN	"""miqque"""	This is not as much Sam Raimi's movie, nor Tobey Maguire's nor Kirsten Dunst's as it is a movie embodying the spirits of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko - the guys who created Spidey in the first place.A surprise is this film is actually quite complex when it comes to human emotions and motivations.  No one does anything without some reason (or something they truly believe is a reason), and in Spider-Man each person has their own set of complexity.  The acting is excellent, particularly the scenes between Maguire and Dunst.  J.K. Simmons as 'Daily Bugle' (the Flatiron Building) editor J. Jonah Jameson is truly terrifying in a bad-boss way.  All the usual suspects are present; the bullying jock, the girl next door, and Aunt May.  There is humor, and in a display of skill this humor grows naturally out of the situations, and does not feel forced.The action sequences are dynamic - to say the least.  Lee and Ditko imagined Spidey web-swinging across New York City at great speed.  They must be delighted in seeing Maguire (who did at least some of his own stunts) bring Spidey's speed and agility to the screen.Some may complain that parts of the film are slow (like the lead-up to the infamous spider-bite), but taken in the context that Spider-Man 2 and 3 are already in the works, we may well look back on the 'slow' scenes as a good place to catch one's breath.  The only true problem is the Green Goblin mask.  (I hated it in the spy photos, thru production, and especially right up there on the screen.)  Other than that mask, this is a film that rocks hard and fast any time someone in costume is on screen, and seethes with intrigue when the characters are in mufti.All in all, an excellently realised film.  Some very young viewers may be startled by the action sequences.	5.0	Lee and Ditko would be proud	2002-05-03	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AXURKQ6N6QS35	Miss Jenny	"Oh wow! ""Spider-Man"" is here! Yahoo! A movie I have been waiting to see for a long time- And I couldn't have asked for more! Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, a ordinary teenage boy who only dreams of winning the heart and admiration of the lovely Mary Jane Watson (Who is wonderfully portrayed by Kristen Dunst), his next-door neighbor. While on a field trip to a science lab, Peter is accidentally bitten by an genetically altered (Or is it  radioactive?) spider-and gives our protagonist the ability of a spider! It is enjoyable when we watch Peter discover and develop his special abilities. When his beloved Uncle Ben (Who, with May Parker, had raised Peter since he was orphaned as a child.) is killed, Peter learns that ""with great power, comes great responsibility"" and promised himself  to fight crime as the amazing Spider-Man! The movie is entertaining to watch because the storyline is well written-it is original, creative, and they don't tend to copy from anything. I like when the story has original elements (Unless it is based on a book.). The actors were well chosen. Spidey's web-slinging looked so real-I loved the special effects. The action scenes were awesome, but what I liked most about the movie-had to be Tobey Maguire's performance. No one could have done it any better! One of the things I didn't like-was the Green Goblin's costume. Hello?! It looks like something that came out of the ""Power Rangers"". But that wasn't so important. I enjoyed the movie-and I await the sequel and the DVD release with great anticipation! Arachnophobics beware!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1AFXJ8U72MD6L	"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie"""	As a kid, I read the SPIDERMAN comic books and, I'm glad to say that the movie followed the thrust of the comics quite well.Unlike many of the other marvel comics, Spiderman was really a teenager trying to do the right thing, yet still being viewed as a villain by powerful people (i.e. like the head of the major newspaper making Spiderman out to be a villain).  His choices resulted in hurting not only people he loved, but the common man and woman.  In addition, the villains always seemed to have more and be respected more than Spiderman ever could.All of these themes and hard points are also covered in the film, which makes it great for comic book fans.  In addition, to make it marketable we've got all the usual CGI effects, as well as some cool scenes and a popular cast (i.e. Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe).SPIDERMAN was suppossedly the highest grossing film for 2002.  The first movie shows how Spiderman became who he was and details his first set of challenges.  Note that SPIDERMAN 2 is soon coming out.	5.0	A GREAT FILM: DRIVE, PASSION, FLASH &amp; RESONANCE	2003-09-05	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AKJ9MEE93DG5O	mitchell5954	Sam Raimi&#8217;s Spiderman is a classic film ushered in a new age of superhero movies.  While X-Men was the film that paved the way for mainstream superhero films, it was Spiderman that truly proved to Hollywood that superheroes are profitable.  Without Spiderman I doubt we would have the chain of superhero films we have now.  While the film definitely has its flaws, in my opinion, the positives out-weigh the negatives.  This film (unlike the reboot) stays true to the spirit of the comics and the character (for the most part).  The film is well-cast for the most part.  It has great action and heart, and most importantly, is wonderfully entertaining.Everyone knows the story.  The first thirty minutes covers the origin story which everyone knows.  The origin of Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey McGuire) is about as famous as the origins for Batman and Superman.  Then he has to struggle between his everyday life and being Spiderman.  He is also struggling with feelings with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as well as stop Norman Osborne/The Green Goblin from wreaking havoc.This film many things right.  I like the story and how everything was setup.  I like that while had the origin they did not spend most of the film on the origin unlike Amazing Spiderman.  Plus it was the first live action Spiderman film so it is more forgivable.  The film stayed true to the comics for the most part from the origin to the rest of the film.  They captured Peter Parker&#8217;s life well.  He struggles to hold a job, he has a hard time keeping his promises, and he struggles between his normal life and his life as Spiderman.  These elements will be explored further in the sequel.  I also like the look of the film.  It has a very timeless feel to it that kind of reminds me of Tim Burton&#8217;s Batman though an entirely different style.  The score also reminded me of Batman with it being composed by Danny Elfman.  With the exception of a few things which I will cover later I think this film captures the spirit of Spiderman well.The cast was, for the most part, very good.  I actually do not mind Tobey McGuire as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  I do have problems with his character in this film, but I blame the writing more than him.  Willem Dafoe was a great choice for Norman Osborne a.k.a The Green Goblin, as was James Franco to play his son Harry.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were the perfect choices for Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  J.K. Simmons is J. Jonah Jameson.  The only casting choice that I did not care for was Kirsten Dunst.  I think she was miscast and really did not resemble Mary Jane from the comic that well.The action scenes are also very well-done and exciting.  Say what you want, but I think the action scenes in this film are far superior to the ones in Amazing Spiderman.  Not-to-mention you do not have to wait for more than an hour to get to the action.  The effects are also well-done for the most part.  Some of the effects look pretty dated but others hold-up well, like the effects of the webs and Spiderman swinging around.  I think the effects in this are just as good as most of the effects in Amazing Spiderman which is, honestly, pretty sad.However, there are several issues with the film.  The major one is Mary Jane as I said earlier.  As much as I hate to admit it there is one thing that Amazing Spiderman has over this film and the other Raimi films is Spiderman&#8217;s love interest.  Gwen is Stacey beats Mary Jane hands down at least as in terms of the movies.  Mary Jane is nothing but a pretty face and someone for Spiderman to rescue.  She is the Lois Lane of Spiderman.  She is like Lois Lane from the early days of Superman.  Even Lois Lane (current version) is a better character than Mary Jane in these films.  She actually has a character.  Mary Jane has no character and she comes off as very petty and kind of a bitch at times as well, especially in Spiderman 3.Plus, her and Peter have no chemistry.  The dialog between them is corny at best.  I do not blame the actors for this.  The script was just poorly written when it came to those moments.  Another problem with this film is some of the dialog.  It is not just the romantic dialog but some of the regular dialog comes off as corny at certain points.  For example, Spiderman confronts the Green Goblin at one point and says: &#8216;It&#8217;s you who is out Goby, out of your mind!&#8221;  Are you kidding me?  Is that the best you could do?  Even as a kid I found that line corny.Another problem is Spiderman himself.  Tobey McGuire plays a great Peter Parker.  Some people might say he is too much of a nerd and not the Peter from the current comics.  However, Sam Raimi is a fan of the old Spiderman from the 60s so that is what he based the movie on.  That is why the film looks the way it does, why all the villains up until Spiderman 3 were all from the original comics, and why Peter is more a nerd and very socially awkward.  McGuire does great playing Peter, but not the best Spiderman.  The costume looks awesome and he looks great in the costume.  However, he is not witty enough.  Spiderman, even in the early days was witty when he had the costume on and was fighting bad guys, because that is how he coped with his situation.  Every now and then he says a witty line but not nearly enough.  Unfortunately we would not get a witty Spiderman until Amazing Spiderman 2 came out.The final issue is with the Green Goblin himself.  I like the Green Goblin as a villain.  He is very fun, intimidating (without the costume), and Dafoe brings a lot of energy to the role.  However, I have two issues with him.  First is his costume, which makes the villain suits in Power Rangers look good.  I know the Green Goblin is a hard character to put in live action.  However, couldn&#8217;t they make something a bit better looking than that?  Secondly, he has no real motivation.  At first he wants to kill the Oscorp board members but he accomplishes that very early on.  Afterward he wants to recruit Spiderman.  Why does he want to recruit him?  We are never told what he wants.Overall, Spiderman is still a classic superhero film despite the reboot.  I do not like how people give this film crap now because of the reboot.  I still like this film and will gladly take it over Amazing Spiderman any day.  It is definitely not perfect, but it captures the spirit of Spiderman more than that film ever did.  If you are a fan of Spiderman, whether it&#8217;d be the comics or the animated series then see this film if you haven&#8217;t already.	4.0	Spiderman	2014-06-06	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1S64NSJMLXXIK	"""mljkb"""	Almost anyone associated with popular culture in America knows the story and hero of Spiderman; A nerdy teen named Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider thet gives him superhuman abilities.  Ever since the '70s, studios have tried to get the comic book hero made, but many snags in the process kept it from getting released until 2002.  But with this movie they got it right.  They chose a director with a energetic, comic book style in Sam Raimi and the right actors.  The best is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne, he can be creepy when he needs to be and fanatical when he puts on the Green Goblin suit.  Also a near perfect choice to star in the movie was Toby Macguire.  He fits the persona of the relavtively timid Parker, which is what the film needed, a dominate Peter Parker, not a dominate spiderman.The plot is basically the origins of Spiderman, and his first enemy in the Green Goblin.  But before we see them fight on the rooftops of New York, we get to know the characters,  who they are, and why they are important to the story.  Peter Parker is timid and unsure of himself, Norman Osbourne is a selfmade businessman who sees his company slipping from him, Peters' aunt and uncle are loving and want to see Peter succeed but find it hard sometimes to be the role of substitute parents and Mary Jane seems to be a carefree girl but maybe is really in pain because of a verbally abusive father.  We know them, before the action starts.Then when the action starts, it is eye filling, but not always perfect.  Spiderman swinging from building to building on his web is the best effect, along with his battle to save Mary Jane and a lift full of children on one of Manhattans' bridges.  But the scenes where Peter is jumping from rooftop to rooftop when he first finds out he can, looks a little like it's out of the video game, as with some other shots.But overall, this a movie tht is sure to please you.  The core of the film is rock solid, even if the some of the trappings are a little frayed.  Spiderman does the classic comic book hero justice, and they are many movies that can say they did that, and did it well.	4.0	It Exceeded my Expecations:  Quality Movie	2003-01-04	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2FS6OGMZMALTD	Mojo Jojo	Let me preface this review by saying I'm a comic book fan, but not a Spider-Man fan.  Scratch that.  I like Spider-Man.  It's that whiny little Peter Parker I could do without.  Now, in the comics this isn't much of a problem.  We spend far more time with Spidey than his alter-ego.  In this film though, Parker dominates.  And every time he stands on screen looking miserable I just start to zone out.Frankly, I just don't feel that bad for him.  The guy gets superpowers and keeps complaining about the terrible responsibility.  I know that's a theme of the comics, but Spidey in the comics always seems to handle it so much better.  His bad luck and poor me attitude never seemed excessively narcissistic.  Here Peter mopes through most of the film, and I reallly got sick of it.On the upside, there's some nice action in this film.  Just not nearly enough of it.  But the Green Goblin looks kind of lame.  And that's saying something in a comic book universe.  It's not a bad film.  Just not very good and overlong.  Am I the only one who's noticed that movies are getting longer without getting better?  Editing makes or breaks a film, and this one could've easily been half-an-hour shorter.Anyway, I've seen it twice and didn't hate it either time.  But I'd never watch it again, and I've absolutely no desire to see Spider-Man 2 based on this film.	3.0	Needs more Spider-Man, Less Peter Parker	2005-12-06	4	3	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"The 2012 reboot of the Spider-man saga has raised some questions in my mind as I read some of the reviews.  I'm not here to belittle the new ""Amazing"" version.  I actually liked it.  But I do have questions as to why it needed to be remade.  Then I started thinking of remakes of ""Let The Right One In"" and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" and all version are very good.  I hadn't seen the original film for 9 years give or take, so I decided to load the still virgin Blu ray disc into the player.Every once in a while I won't be able to help myself make a comparative observation.  For example, the ""Amazing"" version spends the first hour or so, telling the back story of Peter Parker's parents and their mysterious disappearance.  This is never addressed at all in the 2002 version reviewed here.  Parker (Tobey Maguire) is taunted at school for being a geek, much of that coming from Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) thuggish boyfriend Flash (""True Blood's"" Joe Manganiello).During a field trip to Oscorp's laboratories, Peter gets bitten by a genetically altered spider.  This happens early in the film.  Becoming ill, Peter awakens the next day with perfect eyesight, tossing his previously needed glasses.  He also discovers microscopic barbs on his hands which allow him great gripping power.  You might not remember this but Maguire is also quite toned and fit for this role.  As in ""Amazing"" some of the better scenes involve Parker's adaptation to the ""flying"" ability.  Unlike ""Amazing,"" Maguire's ability to shoot ""webs"" from his wrists is inherent in his genetic change.  For whatever reason the new version has Parker developing some form of mechanical wristband that shoots inorganic cables.  I haven't read the comics so I don't know which version is historically correct, but for me, I like idea of the ""webs"" being organic.Another difference is that Parker wannabe girlfriend in the 2012 version is Gwen Stacy.  In this original movie it is Mary Jane Watson.  Maguire and Dunst have great chemistry and it comes out in their moments together, irrespective of Maguire being Parker or Spidey at the time.  Willem Dafoe, like Maguire, plays two roles in the film.  One is the deposed head of Oscorp and one is the evil Green Goblin, Spider-man's primary foe.  Dafoe teams up once again with the great British actress, Rosemary Harris, who he worked with in 1994's ""Tom and Viv.""  Here Harris is Peter's aunt and she adds some real class to the film.  Her performance here and in Spider-man 2 is truly heartfelt, providing the moral compass to young Parker.J. K. Simmons (""Juno"") is on hand to add some comic relief as the newspaper editor.  His assistant is Elizabeth Banks (""The Hunger Games"").  Also watch for Oscar winner Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") as a clerk at the wrestling match Peter enters to win some money.  And blink-and-you'll-miss-her, Lucy Lawless (TV's ""Spartacus"") shows up as a punk rocker.  The bottom line is that I liked this original Spider-man marginally more than the reboot.  Maybe it was the now iconic upside down kiss between Spidey and M.J.The Blu ray disc has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p HD picture.  Although it shows a bit of grain it is consistent with the original film.  The colors are good and the blacks are black.  The audio is an excellent Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is really superb.  I have no complaints about the disc quality."	5.0	"4 1/2 stars for a revisit to the original ""Spider-man"""	2012-07-06	3	3	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2L7K7XFHS51V3	"Moses E. Allen ""mosesallen"""	It is about time Marvel stepped up to the plate with a big time superhero film. DC had Superman and Batman with tons of success and sequels. This millenium belongs to Marvel. Spiderman came out. Daredevil will come out next month. The Hulk arrives in June. I was also eager to hear rumors about another great comic character, Hellboy. A Hellboy film is in the making. Anyway, back to the task at hand, this movie was outstanding. I bet I saw this film +5 times while it was in theaters. When I first heard Toby Maguire was going to be Spiderman I admit I had my doubts. I did not take into consideration that Toby Maguire had to be Peter Parker as well as Spiderman. Toby was great for the role of Peter Parker, thus making him better for Spiderman. Everyone enjoys watching an average Joe accomplish greatness. His urge to triumph over the school bully, his desire for the girl he loves, these are elements important to every coming-of-age hero story line. Taking someone in a low place and raising them above everyone's expectations. These are components in making a great hero movie. Spiderman includes them all. This movie is definitely of the best of 2002 and a great DVD to purchase. It has loads of supplemental material. The extras are actually entertaining also, which isn't as common as it should be in DVD extras. This is a movie to watch again and again. Everyone should own it. I give it five out of five stars.	5.0	A Marvel Masterpiece	2003-01-30	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2TSNKXQGBMVAQ	Moven	"Wow. I never expected that Spider-man would be so great. ... After I saw the preview, I said to myself, ""Tobey Maguire is going to play Spider-man? The world must be coming to an end."" I guess I was just out of the mix, because Maguire did a great job, and the movie is more than I ever thought it could be. It's awesome man!The movie is better than the cartoon, and that's saying a lot. Spider-man's costume looks so cool, as does the Green Goblin's (Willem Dafoe). The action sequences are fast-paced and riveting, and Danny Elfman's musical score is rich and powerful. Well, here is the real reason why Spider-man is so great:Remember how it was easier to be entertained as a kid? I do. I remember that during every Power Rangers episode (at least the old-school ones), I would wait in suspense until the morph battle at the end. ...the Megazord would take one swift swing at the evil monster with his awesome blade, and the bad guy he would fall dead, helpless to the amazing power of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. See, what the power Rangers did for me then, Spider-Man does for me now. I didn't just pass the movie off as comic book nonsense. I was like whoa. Spider-Man is the real deal.And, hidden beneath all the wondrous action and comic book drama (which is by no means a bad thing), there's a message from the hero: ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" Spider-man is a modern myth. I just can't wait until the sequel."	5.0	Great fun, great movie	2003-01-08	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1EMZV2PY8AYL4	moviebuff	"This is the first time in my life that I am willing to say that I have watched a real comic book movie. It really succeeds in capturing the spirit of the comics. Most similar movies in the past have either gone too far over the top, like The Flash, or is a good film that takes itself too seriously and tries to hide its origins, like X-Men. No as much as I love the X-Men movie there is just no comparison to this film. Spiderman treads the fine line, it never goes to far into cheese, but is proud enough of it's comic book origins to show them. Some of the angles seem like they could have been taken as stills in the comics, like when Peter smiles directly  at the camera for no reason other than that's the way the comics would do it. It also keeps dialogue that you could have seen in the comics. Lines like ""I'm just your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman"" are lines that make this film what it is.Enough about the comics though, what is this like as a film? Put simply it rocks! The film has strong characters, good acting and some breathtaking action sequences, filled with  amazing effects. You should know the story by now, but just incase you've been locked up in a  rubber room for your whole life it is this. A high school geek named Peter Parker is on a school trip to see some spiders. The scientists proceed to show them some genetically modified spiders that have all the best points of the other spiders combined. One of these Spiders bites Peter, and this has the unexpected result of passing on these qulaities to him. He starts off using  these powers for selfish gain, by entering a wrestling match. However one day he has the  opotunity to stop a theif from escaping but he ignores it. Said thief then kills his uncle and he decides that from then on he will use his powers to fight crime. At the same time the father of Peters best friend experiments on himself to become superhuman. This has the side effect of driving him insane and he becomes the super villain The Green Goblin.I would like to point out that the character development in this film is not as high as it was in X-Men, but this works in it's favour. You see it's all in the spirit of a comic book movie. The reason that a comic has such strong characters is because they are developed over years. Each  story will develop another aspect of the characters personality and then focus on the action. I felt that X-men wanted to get the most character development into the first film but this had the unfortunate side effect of causing the film to drag slightly in a few places. This is not the  case with Spiderman, they provide you with all the development needed to show how Peter changes from geek to hero, and the events that caused it. I personally feel that any-more would have spoiled the film.The majority of actors in this film are first class. Toby Maguire in the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman is brilliant, managing to convincingly convey both the geek and the hero. William Daffoe was an inspired choice to play The Green Goblin. He is just over the top enough to be a comic book villain, but still knows that he doesn't need to resort to cheese for the role. As for Kirsten Dunts as Mary Jane, she's perfect. A lot of people say that she didn't have a lot to work with, but most of these are women claiming that women don't do enough in films. All I can say is that she has no super powers, so she couldn't be expected to fight green goblin could she. She was the love interest, and for her personality I'd like to add-Ladies and gentlemen my fantasy girlfriend.- The scene in the rain has nothing to do with it, honest. The only actor I will complain about is the guy who Jameson. He seems to be trying to hard to emulate  the cartoon series and as a result does not convincingly portray any emotion.Finally the most important part, the action. The action in this film Rocks. The effects are  simply amazing. Even the web swinging scenes that have come under so much critisism don't look that bad. Yes they're not perfect, but I don't think it is possible to portray human movements with a computer yet, and it looks way better than the similar effects in Blade 2. The fights  with the, green Goblin are all amazing though. My fave being the first one.Now while you may have noticed that this review contains a lot of praise and not much critisism. I know I've done this a few times, this time it's different. When I review a film I concider a  classic I like to be optimistic and focus on the good. This time though the film is basically perfect. Yes Jonah may be over the top, and some of the FX a little unrealistic, but a 100% perfect film will never happen. Yes there may be more intellegent films around, but as a comic book film this will not be held against it. It's not meant to be serious. I definately feel that not only is this my fave comic book movie, but it is among my fave movies in any genre.Overall if your a fan of the comic, then stop whinging about organic webshooters, and go watch  this film. It's faithfull in all areas that matter, and if you like super hero movies then don't miss this film, but if you're one of those who hates super hero's and believe that all films should, be beleivable then why the hell did you just read the review, you should avoid the film."	5.0	best comic book movie ever	2002-06-29	0	0	0

He is amazed to discover that the bites gives him spider abilities, such as web-slinging, climbing, and having a spider-sense which warns you of danger.. However, after a deadly experiment makes Peter's best friend Harry's (James Franco) father into a sick villain called the Green Goblin, Spider-Man is forced to take on his enemy. Also featured is Kirsten Dunst, who is Peter's next door neighbor Mary Jane, the only girl that he has ever loved. The movie features many great action sequences with some great special effects and a good cast featuring Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, the man who turns into the sadistic Green Goblin.

If the special effects are supposed to be so great, why does Kristen Dunst seem like she's flinging around like she's made of clay while the Green Goblin holds her hostage?And besides that, how does our hero recover his power so quickly when the Green Goblin pretty much knocked him out?Looking past this, the movie is pretty much predictable but still okay as far as acting and how they can carry it out. One startling moment in the whole film doesn't amount to much, but it's not a thriller, it's an action movie, and if you want to see action, you're in the right movie.Too bad they hired a teenage heart-throb to play Spiderman.Moving on.If they need this many special features in a DVD to sell it, then maybe they aren't as confident in Spidey over there as we figure they are.

Raimi has done an excellent job and clearly is/was comic book reader/fan and has done a very good job and stayed mostly faithful to the Spiderman comic book readers know and love.  My only quibble, and this applies to the superhero movie genre as a whole (not necessarily this particular movie), is that the movie gives varying levels of ability or strength to fit the story line.  It gives a weird disconnect to have Spiderman struggles with something that should be well within his capability in some situations but is able to perform extraordinary feats easily in others. His webbing is stronger than steel sometimes and easily broken or cut other times.  Spidey should be able to lift up a bus but struggles to hold on to a car.  Stuff like that.  I realize that the strength could become a sort of deus ex machina, but that just means the story needs to be better thought out.	5.0	Very good flick	2012-09-18	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2Z9FXHC1L66EW	"Mr. ""alan5973"""	Well, I saw Spiderman on opening day and I thought it was good.  Not great, but good.  See when it comes to superheroes, I'm very critical of Spiderman.  I grew up reading Spidey comics thru most of my youth and really have a connection with him.  He's unlike all these other famous superheroes.  Spidey was tempted by material gain and suffered because of it.  But lets talk about the film.  Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker great.  I really thought his performance was very strong.  But the funny thing is, when he changed into Spiderman, something was lacking, and I'm not talking about the costume.  See, Tobey has this sort of wimper in his voice that's great for Peter Parker, but you still can hear it at times when he's Spidey, and that doesn't sit well with me.  Spiderman is a superhero with a sense of humor.  While he's fighting bad guys he uses lots of funny one liners, and I'm not talking campy now.  It's just his way of lightening up the tension of the fact that he could be injured or killed.  At least that's the way I perceived it.  I loved it in fact.  Spiderman is not really cocky, persay, but he's of course not a cream puff either.  I didn't care much for Kirsten Dunst's performance as MJ, but I guess to the average person she was ok.  I just thought see missed out on a lot of who Mary Jane Watson was.  Yeah they included the problems she had growing up with her family, which is true in the comic book, but something was missing in her performance.  Let's talk about the asthetics.  You know, when doing a film about a comic book superhero, things are gonna be condensed.  Hence, many things that took place hundreds of comic book issues apart from one another are used in the film on the same day or practically the same week.  The origin of Spidey was done well.  In fact it was one of my favorite parts of the movie.  I'm still a little unsure about the decision of having his web fluid come from his own body instead of him creating webshooters and web cartridges himself like he did in thecomic book.  Maybe it seemed too farfetched a concept?  I'll give 'em that.  But they do change certain reasons for doing things.  In the film, Peter, now with his newfound powers, wants to impress Mary Jane (MJ) by getting a car.  He sees an add in a newspaper saying &quot;$3000 to wrestle&quot;.  So he goes to take on this mammoth wrestler and beats him, but only receives $100 because he beat him in the first round and the underhandedness is he had to last 3 rounds to earn the $3000.  Well, in the comic book Peter decides to try the wrestling gig to make some money and become famous.  In the comic he receives the full amount of prize money.  They changed it to incorporate this whole love thing between him and MJ, who did not live right next door to him growing up.  Actually she wasn't the girl Peter was interested in during the timeframe that most of the film takes place in.  I guess that's what really annoyed me...the disclusion of Peter's first real girlfriend, Gwen Stacy.  The part in the film that they did get right is that Mary Jane did date Harry Osbourne, but that was while Peter was with Gwen.  To be honest I enjoyed Gwen Stacy a bit more, but I guess I was in the minority in that opinion since she was killed off in the comic book by the Green Goblin, no less.  They changed this in the film of course.  In the comic book, the Green Goblin kidnapps Gwen and taunts Spiderman, holding him at bay, until finally deciding to drop her to her death.  Spidey does get to her before she hits the ground, but the shock of the fall was what killed her.  This was taken from one key comic book (Amazing Spiderman #121) followed by the next issue (#122) where the Green Goblin is killed, by his own doing.  And they did get this right in the film, so that was good.  Some things were dead on, like Norman (Green Goblin) Osbourne discovering Spiderman's secret identity and then making the people Peter loves suffer (he traumatized Aunt May, who did end up in the hospital in the comic book).  I guess I'm such a purist that all these things bothered me more than it would a person who doesn't necassarily read the comic books.  Like I said, it was a good film, but not great.  I'm sure there were a lot of factors involved on why Gwen Stacy wasn't used.  Perhaps three deaths in the film would've been too much (Uncle Ben, Gwen, and the Green Goblin).  I don't know.  But I guess this is the perfect example of what you get when you condense a comic book into movie form.  Oh yeah, and Willem Defoe was quite good as Norman Osbourne.  The costumes were nice, though in the comic book the green goblin's mask was more attatched to his face and not some big helmet that he wore.  Spidey's costume was very impressive.  I also enjoyed the cameos by Bruce (Evil Dead) Campbell as the wrestling announcer and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as one of the workers at the Daily Bugle.  I'd still recommend seeing it and buying the DVD which has a lot of nice bonus features.  The nice treat for me was towards the very end of the credits the actual Spiderman theme song from the 60's animated series was played.  It sure beat the crappy rap song that preceded it.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1XJUJC14MPPML	Mr. Al Price	The first thing that comes to mind when a Superhero film is made is how much is releated to the comics and how many element changes were made.Though I am a Superman fan, by putting down this Spiderman movie your probably thinking I am comparing well ok Superman 2 is a classic that will always remain top of the pile.But lets concentrate on this film, some element changes have been made to this comic hero, for starters his suit, the darker red and blue, kind of pulls that comic book feel out of the film and lacks beauty of the original from the series.The story was good but the movie in my eyes moved past to quickly for me, everything kind of was happening at once.Green Goblin's suit was made of armour in this film, in the comics it was a tight costume which looked much better.The special effects were well done, but from someone who is computer minded like me, I kind of felt that a lot of the web swinging and climbing up walls looked unreal.Spiderman opened in cinemas 14th June in the UK here and lets just say that a few of us were kind of disappointed.Hollywood its back to the drawing board.	3.0	GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, GOOD STORY, NOT WORTH THE HYPE!	2002-06-20	4	1	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3J029KBNG5MNP	Mr. Bey	This was a great movie as you probaly know. The story follows Peter Parker through his life as a genetic wonder. He made a couple stupid moves but he turned out a super hero. The only problem is the Green Goblin's suit was dumb and Peter shouldn't have turned Mary Jane down. The end fight was pretty cool to. I give this one 5 stars because this was a great movie. You will like it a lot.	5.0	Move over Batman Spider Man is on the big screen	2002-11-28	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A15W70BFY26KIA	Mr Ghostface	What can I possibly say that someone else hasn't already? This movie is truly a dream come true for a long time Spider-man fan like me. After so many comic to movie adaptations, it's hard not to become a little bit weary of 'the next one'. But, here we are, and here we have a movie that actually succeeds in rising above the rest. There hasn't been a comic adapted this successfully since Tim Burton did Batman back in 1989, and Superman before that in 1978 (which sadly bodes that the next one will be in 2011!).Many directors and artists in Hollywood claim to be fans of comic book heroes, but when it comes time for them to actually put it together they fail miserably. But not here. Sam Rami did what a true fan would do - stayed true to the source material - while maintaining the objectivity and realistic approach of a film-maker. But, while cinema demands certain structural devices for reasons of plot and pace, he has captured the essence of Spider-man and his history accurately, and instilled through Tobey Maguire a sense of the excitement that any teenager would feel in Peter Parker's situation.  Perhaps the only thing that disappointed me was the Green Goblin. The design is didn't have it's own identity, instead rendered like a stock ILM creature. There was no need to venture away from the comic designs of old, as the CGI generation of movies are all converging towards the same point of style. The older Green Goblin designs might have imbued a retro feel that set them apart from the rest of the current fare. Raimi, incidentally, also seems to suffer from Burton's inability to shoot clear, cohesive action scenes that last for any sustained period. It's not that he's a bad film-maker, it's just not his thing. One thing I absoluetly LOVED, though, was the inverted kiss, between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, which just oozes with sexuality.The DVD is packed with extras, as you can see. Most of them are interesting enough, although personally, extras have almost lost their appeal, like a novelty, and I find myself simply going for the films that I like, rather than the rest.	4.0	Not perfect, but a very good try.	2002-12-16	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ	"Mr. JKW ""jkw"""	"For Spiderfans in know this movie project was something a good 10 to 20 years in the making and I'd dare say, Spider-Man has lived up to its expectations.  Featuring a solid storyline, AWESOME action sequences, CGI and regular special effects this movie, which stayed fairly true to Spider-Man canon with some minor changes, does not disappoint and fully delivers.THE STORY:The movie basically is loosely based on two major Spider-Man storylines:1. The Spider-Man origin story which recounts how Peter Parker, the typical high school nerd receives great powers when he's bitten by an irradiated spider and how, through a horrible personal accident that he could have prevented learns the ultimate lesson of how ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" and2. The Green Goblin Saga which discusses how a crazed billionaire industrialist becomes the homicidal and maniacal Green Goblin, Spider-Man's greatest foe bent on destroying our favorite superhero by any means (including some PERSONAL, close to home attacks) necessary.THE COOL THINGS:1. The action.  First and foremost it is the action that drives this movie.  The first and subsequent fight scenes between Spidey and the Green Goblin are what make this movie a winner.  The action choreography and accurate depiction of both men's fighting styles stay true to the book, including Spider-Man's awesome limber limbs.  The fight scenes between both men (especially the first one) are among the best you will ever see in ANY action movie.2. The effects.  Definitely ranking up their in any Hollywood production are how Spider-Man's web-slinging powers are rendered in this film.  Again, very true to his comic-book depiction you'll marvel at how Spider-Man swings from building to building and how he uses his web powers in battle or to merely ""hang around.""  The DNA effects were cool too.3. The story.  Obviously looking towards future sequels and building a franchise it's a great treat for long-time Spidey followers at how the plot threads are still kept loose with Harry Osbourne and Spider-Man and the budding relationship of Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker at the end.  Also included are brief potential looks ahead for future villains with the mention of ""Dr. Conners.""NITPICKING:Looking at some discrepancies between the comics and the movie we have:1. The Web Shooters:  In the movie Peter generates his own webs internally.  In the comics he builds web shooters to shoot webs.2. The origin story.  The movie features a robber/carjacker.  The comic has a robber/burglar.3. The origin story.  The movie features wrestler Bonesaw McGraw (played by Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage.  The comic features wrestler Crusher Hogan (which undoubtedly somehow influenced legendary wrestler Hulk Hogan).4. The Goblin Saga.  The comics featured Spider-Man's first true love Gwen Stacy getting caught up in the super-hero struggle.  The movie revolves around eventual Spider-Man resident female love interest, Mary Jane Watson(-Parker).THE VERDICT:Overall, this is the film that Spider-fans have waited their whole lives for.  The action, effects and story are solid with enough hanging plot threads that will make long-time fans anxiously await the sequel.While some of the changes between comic and movie may have hardcore fans a little uppity, the changes are minor enough to let by and the rest of the movie's great points should put aside any other worries.Overall, Spider-fan or not, this is definitely not a movie you'll want to miss.Highest Recommendation"	5.0	The Wait Was Worth It	2002-05-14	6	5	1

The characters were cast fairly well with Tobey McGuire being the possible only question mark.  Willem Dafoe is solid as the Goblin and the rest of the cast does their parts pretty well.  I like the build-up of the Spiderman story and how things came about.  The film was paced decently and didnt rush into anything too quickly or drag on too slowly.  The action scenes were OK, nothing great but I've seen worse.  The CGI was acceptable but the transitions from CGI to Live action were a little hacked up.  Basically, the special effects were borderline acceptable but this didnt hurt the film too much.I did enjoy the story development and the characters did progress enough to keep it interesting. Of course the ending was setup for the next film.  As others have said, the ending was not the best.... oh well.... nothing is perfect.Despite a few scenes with some violence it is kid-friendly as well and the reviewers that trash the film need to understand that a PG-13 film needs to fall within certain criteria and they simply cannot go overboard with violence or sex stuff.  The action scenes are softer than some other films and the bad guys are not geniuses either.  Again, its PG-13 follks... go watch some R-rated bloodfest if thats your desire.I would have preferred 3.5 stars but gave a it a 4 just because films like this are NOT easy to do well since there are so many ""bombs"" out there. Overall, this is well acted, well executed, and keeps you interested which is pretty good for Comic Book movies that usually are awful ( Hulk, Batman ).So go ahead and watch it, maybe even buy it if you're into the genre.Recommended!"	4.0	Better than I thought, Good overall Comic-based movie....	2006-07-13	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	"Spiderman was one of the most eagerly awaited movies of 2002, which is a lot of baggage to carry when setting out to make an adaptation of one of the most popular comic strips ever.  However, with Sam Raimi safely entrusted with the responsibility of Directorial duty and the excellent casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, this movie always looked a sure-fire winner and indeed it is exactly that.As everybody knows Spider-man's alter ego Peter Parker is that anonymous boy next door, the boy who never gets the girl and whom the girl doesn't even notice. He's as pure as the driven snow, devoted to his Aunt and Uncle, the boy for girls to take home to their mother, safe, kind but somewhat unexciting.  Bullied at school, he is the butt of everyone's jokes and regarded as something of a nerd, a bit of a loser. However, after being bitten by a genetically modified spider, Peter transforms overnight from anonymous boy next door to super hero in this good guys can come first comic-book tale.There are so many good things about Spider-man it is hard to know where to start. First off, what I found most impressive and refreshing was the screenplay, which unlike most major Hollywood studio major event movies actually relies on narrative, plot and character development to tell the story instead of just loosely sewing together action scenes with meaningless dialogue (Simon West are you listening?). Credit for this should go to writer David Koepp and Director Sam Raimi for avoiding this obvious pitfall that has spoilt many a summer blockbuster (such as Tomb Raider to give but one example). Raimi's direction is sure-footed and subtle and the decision to give him megaphone duties has proven to be well vindicated. The casting of Tobey Maguire is another masterstroke because Tobey Maguire is undoubtedly one of the most talented young actors around with a CV of critically acclaimed performances in critically acclaimed movies, that seasoned veterans would be proud of, such as; Ride With The Devil, Pleasantville, The Ice Storm, The Wonder Boys and The Cider House Rules. With Mr Maguire as Peter Parker we get performance of depth and subtlety of a teenager struggling with more than the normal transformation from boy to man. Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous, The Virgin Suicides) is also a spectacular success with her girl next-door looks and range and depth of emotion and ability, as is Willem Dafoe (Platoon, Light Sleeper etc.) in the villainous role of the Green Goblin, carefully avoiding too much ham.All that said there are some faults. For example, some of the web-slinging CGI is a disappointment and up close the green goblins headgear is a bit rubbish.  Spider-Man is also apparently (according to all the geeks) littered with continuity errors but much of that can perhaps be explained by the devastating happenings of September 11th and several scenes featuring the twin towers, including an apparently superb sequence with the villain's helicopter getting caught in webbing between the Twin Towers had to be cut, along with the relevant narrative. Plus the final scenes where a crowd of New Yorkers hurl objects at the Green Goblin has a definite tagged on feel to it but the who can blame them for it's addition is entirely appropriate and rightly captures the spirit of NYC in the aftermath of 9/11: ""Ya take one of us on, ya take us all on!"" shouts one patriotic New Yorker. Ending with our favourite web-slinger against the backdrop of the stars and stripes, Spider-Man is a resounding success and with Raimi, Maguire and Dunst all signed up for the sequel, I personally cant wait for Spider-Man 2."	4.0	SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER WITH AN IQ!!!	2002-08-24	27	21	6

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1KI6L82M5RAHQ	mr. snrub	There's no need to discuss the plot of SPIDER-MAN, and that isn't because the story is secondary to action in the movie. It isn't because even people who have never picked up a SPIDER-MAN comic book know that Peter Parker got his powers from a bite from a radioactive (or, in the context of the movie, mutant) spider. It isn't because the popularity of the character made sure that every living person on the planet would sooner or later see the SPIDER-MAN movie.It's because what's worth talking about in a review of the SPIDER-MAN movie is the fact that the characters as well as the comic itself have been done justice. SPIDER-MAN is one of the most iconic, beloved, and enduring creations in comics, and in many ways, embodies all of the most essential qualities of a superhero. A movie based on his comic could only work if it were taken as seriously as anything Shakespeare wrote.It taken seriously, and just in the nick of time too. SPIDER-MAN mave have had more difficulty getting made than any other comic book adaptation ever. If it hadn't been made when it was, Spidey may very well have lost all hope of making a live action, big screen appearance.But after seeing SPIDER-MAN, it' pretty clear that the web-slinger won't be going anywhere for a long time.	5.0	With great power, comes great responsibility	2007-03-20	0	0	0

This movie was exactly what I expected from Marvel, and I am not dissapointed whatsoever.The Similarities from the Comic to Movie transition were as follows:1.  The story line of how he decided to become a super hero.2.  His love for M.J.3.  His problems he faces for day-to-day living.The differences from the Comic to Movie transition were as follows:1.  His web throwing is not in any way similar.  In the Comic Book he had capsules he connected to his arm, and in the movie, the webbing came from inside.2.  M.J.'s and his relationship growing up.  She didn't live next to him growing up in the comic book.  Even though this makes for an interesting story in Dramatic Romance.3.  Spider Man was an actual photographer and worked for a company instead of being a freelance photographer in the movie.Even though there are few things that were portayed differently in this movie, Sam Raimi(director) did an outstanding job.  I bow down to his excellence.  The only other problem I had going into and leaving the theatre, was the fact that the Animation(Graphics) were a bit dissapointing.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A32IE8DEVF2EAY	Nathan Abrams	"Spiderman: the MovieSpiderman. What a disappointment. And from the director who made The Evil Dead and Darkman which makes it doubly disappointing.  Just as another promising director, Tim Burton, fell by the wayside when he made a big budget, summer blockbuster remake of Planet of the Apes, so, too, has Raimi with this adaptation of the comic.Based on the Marvel comic strip and updated to contemporary New York, Tobey Maquire (The Ice Storm) plays Peter Parker, the inept, bespectacled, bumbling nerd who is bitten by a genetically modified (in a reworking of the original, radioactive and no doubt reflecting our contemporary fears over GM as opposed to postwar fears of nuclear apocalypse) spider during a field trip to Columbia University.This story is a conventional love story. As the opening voiceover says, ""like all good stories, it's about a girl"". Parker - all spectacles, spam and centre parting - has loved his next-door neighbour, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), since the age of six.  Once bitter, Peter grapples with the overnight transformation to his body, a very obvious metaphor for the hormonal changes all teenagers go through.  He develops muscle tone, the ability to jump, climb walls and, in another reworking of the original, shoot webs out of his wrists.Things seem to be going well for Peter - he impresses Mary Jane, he beats up her bullying boyfriend - until his uncle is shot and the Green Goblin (played excellently by Willem Dafoe) arrives on the scene.  Peter internalises the last words of his uncle: `with great power comes great responsibility' and, as Spiderman, he sets out to fight crime, prompted by the knowledge he could have prevented his uncle's death.  His crime-fighting, though is compounded by the entrance of the maniacal Goblin, who is determined to persuade Spiderman to join him or kill him if he won't. The Goblin is the alter ego of Norman Osborn, an arms manufacturer, and the father of Peter's best friend who, it turns out, is also dating Mary Jane.The sequences of Spiderman demonstrating his skills are by far the best. Spiderman leaps, swings, jumps and so on. The battle sequences with the Green Goblin are exciting, particularly against the backdrop of the re-edited New York City (sequences depicting the World Trade Center were recut).  J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson, the Daily Bugle editor who gives Parker his first job as a photographer, was great (particularly when compared to his role as a neo-Nazi on the cult series Oz). And Kirsten Dunst looked cute as the gal.Overall, though, the parts did not equal the sum. The CGI wasn't adequate: when Spiderman climbed walls I did not willingly suspend disbelief.  The narrative pace was jerky. Long-winded romantic scenes slowed action sequences down and the overall pace was not maintained.  Perhaps big-budgets do not suit Raimi, but then he has a hard act to live up to because his Darkman was, and probably still is, the best comic-book style adaptation on film.  This does not bode well. If Raimi can't handle such an adaptation, then what hope do we have for the forthcoming Scooby Doo and others?"	2.0	What a Disappointment	2002-07-12	8	2	6
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3VY5UA24EZT72	Nathan Dickey	"First, I must admit, I have never been a fan of, or readSpider-Man comics, so I can't compare the comics with the film. In my opinion, this movie was so hyped up in such a way that it could not possibly live up to expectations, including my expecations. The storyline reminds a B movie.The storyline concerns high schooler Peter Parker, who is definitely not on the ""A-list"" at his school. He is unpopular, and feels out of place as he tries to impress the girl of his dreams. Then, one fateful day, his life is changed forever when, during a field trip through a spider-breeding lab, a genetically altered spider bites him. He then finds that his physical body has been enhanced, and eventually, he becomes half spider. He harnesses the ability to climb walls and skyscrapers, and leap far distances. He also finds he is able to shoot extremely strong web strings. Then, an archenemy arises, the Green Goblin, who is determined to kill Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. Meanwhile, the media going wild with news stories of strange appearances Spider-Man and the Goblin. Throughout the movie Spider-Man uses his powers to rescue his girlfriend from various dangers. The climax features a big showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, a hand-to-hand combat sequence. The film ends with a somewhat bittersweet ending. The ending makes it obvious that the doors are wide open for a Spider-Man 2.Although Spider-Man wasn't a movie that met expectations exactly, it's still worth seeing. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing it again.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	When going into adapting a comic to film, there are usually two routes.  The first route is the movie will be utterly disappointing and lacking any of the intensity from the book it is adapted from (see the Spawn live action film for example), while the second route is a riveting, very well put together film that carries the essence of the comic (the original Superman and Batman and the Blade series).  Spider-Man isn't the best comic adaption to film, but this long awaited movie more than delivers the goods.  Tobey Maguire is rather good and believeable as Peter Parker and Spider-Man and seems to be a great choice for the role in the future films, while Kirsten Dunst is as stunning as ever as Mary Jane Watson.  James Franco perfectly captures the personality and insecurity of Harry Osborne, while Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very good as well as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  But the best casting and performance goes to Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne, he is absolutely perfect as the maniacal schizo and is clearly having a lot of fun in his role, while an almost as perfect performance by J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who is perfectly cast and looks just like the character does in the comic.  Director Sam Raimi (director of the cult classics Evil Dead Trilogy and the original Darkman) directs with his usual stylish flair (along with some shameless corporate promotions) and is a great example of how to make a comic adapted film with a director who knows the comic...  All in all, Spider-Man may not be up there with the original Superman, Batman, and Blade, but it is more than worth a look...	4.0	A more than solid superhero blockbuster	2002-11-22	22	18	4
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3MRYDE0XSU5LE	Neal E. Miller	"The movies ""Shrek"", ""Superman"" and ""The Fifth Element"" are among my favorites because of the animation and special effects.  Based on the reviews of the critics and other viewers I anticipated that ""Spider-Man would excel in some of the same attributes as these movies such as interesting and engaging storyline and good acting as well as first rate special effect and animation.In ""Spider-Man"" the special effects were so repetitive that I wondered if they were the same ones used over and over.  The story line, for me, droned on with little purpose or interest.  A soliloquy by Spider-Man in the last scene typified the acting in that it was wordy, delivered like it was from a middle school play and spoiled the possibility of a satisfying ending with an obvious setup for a sequel.  Finally, the villain wore a solid mask which looked, to me, like a way to avoid the expense of additional animation.With all due respect to the critics and others who loved the move, what you all saw, I missed.  I wrote this because I find the negative reviews equally helpful, often even more so when I disagree.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ	Negative Comments	"What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say ""Oh hey!!!"" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the ""oh hey!!!"" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, ""hey what's up,"" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment."	5.0	what a refreshing step back to a time of innocence	2009-01-03	1	1	0

It's annoying, especially geeks like me, to see a favorite hero being portrayed by your typical teen movie star. Well, i saw the movie and IT ROCKED. I threw away everything i said in the beginning of this review right away. I thought the cast was great. Everyone was good in it. Toby McGwire is Spider-Man, i thought he would SUCK, he doesn't, he's great as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. William Dafoe was over the top, but fun as The Green Goblin. I'm not getting into plot because it'll piss off the hardcore fans who DIDN'T get to see the movie yet. Sam Raimi did a TREMENDOUS job directing the movie. Visual effects were top notch, even though sometimes they look fake, but it gives it the comic book feel.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A20ZFWGBY4REFX	"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan"""	"Who is he? You sure you want to know? Tobey Maguire (""The Cider House Rules""), one of the finest young actors today, is...""Spider-Man""! I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it! ""Spider-Man"" is smart, funny, and action-packed all the way from start to finish! The director of this film, Sam Raimi (""Darkman""), did not just a great job, but an outstanding job in bringing this Marvel comic book adaption to life on the big screen! I am sure that everyone knows the story of Spider-Man and that he needs no introduction. But for those who don't, then here it is. ""Spider-Man"" focuses on Peter Parker (Maguire), a mild-mannered high school student who lives with his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) in Queens, New York. Peter is in love with a beautiful, yet stunning young lady named Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who has lived next door to Peter since they were little. One day, during a field trip to a laboratory involving the research of spiders, Peter accidentally gets bitten by one of the spiders. But to me, this was a blessing as Peter started to develop these powers and abilities to move and think like a spider, such as shooting webs from the wrist, climbing up walls, etc. And before you know it, Peter Parker is now the amazing ""Spider-Man""! During the movie, Peter learns an invaluable lesson from his uncle Ben: ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". And soon enough, the abilities of Peter/Spider-Man will be put to the ultimate test as he faces his greatest challenge yet...the villainous Green Goblin, whose alter ego is an ambitious, yet ruthless businessman named Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who also has a somewhat frustrated son named Harry (James Franco), who is also Peter Parker's best friend. And the movie goes on from there with lots of explosive action and then some! Let me just say that I think that they have picked the right actor for the role of Spider-Man, and that I have to give a lot of credit to Tobey Maguire for his physical abilities and his unique sense of acting that brought him to the role of a lifetime. I also have to give a lot of credit to Willem Dafoe for his role of the Green Goblin. Dafoe is at his villainous best since Ian McKellen's Magneto in 2000's ""X-Men""! And the credit also goes to Kirsten Dunst for her very sweet performance as Mary Jane, and to Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's guardians throughout the years. With state-of-the-art special effects, a great soundtrack, ground-pounding action and suspense, laugh-out-loud humor, lots of emotion, a top-notch cast that is hard to beat, and storytelling that is just perfection in every way possible, ""Spider-Man"" is, to me, 20 times better than what ""X-Men"" gave you 2 years ago! This is not just the best film of 2002, this is the greatest blockbuster of 2002! ""Spider-Man"" is, without a doubt, a DVD must-have for any Spider-Man fan! I cannot wait for the ""Spider-Man"" sequels!"	5.0	"""Spider-Man"" is Tobey Maguire's most deserving role yet!!"	2002-05-07	12	9	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3RJ6TVFRS0TQK	Nick Huizenga	Spider-Man is a really good movie if you ask me.  I went to see it twice and got the DVD the day it came out.  It's a great film.  Tobey Maguire plays a good Spiderman.  He's pretty dorky as Peter Parker, but that makes him seem even more unlikely to be a super hero, which makes it so great.  The first fight scene, when Peter is fighting with that guy, Flash, is really well done, especially when Maguire is dodging the punches in slow motion.  Also, I think that the costums of Spiderman and the Green Goblin are really cool.  The Green Goblin's mask is awesome.  My only problem with the movie is that it takes a while for it to really get going.  It's not until about half way through the movie that Spiderman begins to battle witht he Green Goblin.  But once it gets going, it's a really good movie.	4.0	quality film	2002-12-31	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3713PP4MADKED	"Nick Watkins ""Nick Watkins"""	I was shocked by how good this movie is. When I first heard about it last summer, I thought it would be a cheap PG kids movie that only costed [$] to make. I was so wrong. Turns out they actully paid [$] to make this movie, and it is PG-13. Not just for kids. The special effects are great. I could watch Spider-Man web-sling all day. It looks so real, the movements of his body and the way his muscles move. I mean, it probably IS REAL!! Which is what I would've believed if it weren't for Green Goblin. Don't get me wrong; he's one of the best supervillians I've ever seen. But, his costume looks PLASTIC! But, still, he looks really good when he's flying with his glider. Another thing I was suprised at was the action-sequences between Goblin and Spidey. I thought Spidey would just web Goblin up and punch 'em a few times and take 'em to jail. But no. Think Mortal Kombat meets Rocky...dramatic.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ATI88FQCKANGI	Nicolas Lavigne	When SPIDER-MAN came out in 2002, I never taught that it would be such a big deal. But when I saw it, I realized that it's a very good movie. The story is about Peter Parker, a normal teenager who's in love with the High School's sweetheart, Mary-Jane Watson. When he gets bitten by a spider at a research center, he starts noticing that he has special powers. He uses his powers to avenge his Uncle Ben and to fight the Green Goblin. The movie is very good because of the script that holds perfectly throughout the movie and the performances of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe are excellent. The special effects are very elaborate and are in fact the best in years. SPIDER-MAN is the best superhero movie since 1989's BATMAN, which is also very good. The DVD of SPIDER-MAN is excellent and I would say that it is the best DVD of 2002. SPIDER-MAN is also the best movie of 2002 by far, since that STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES kinda sucked. The DVD contains many documentaries about the movie and the comic book, interviews with the cast and crew and many other features. SPIDER-MAN is truly a DVD you must own.	5.0	The best superhero movie in years!	2003-12-31	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3KIQ7YZ765WYU	Nomee Ansari	Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a movie which may actually appeal more to casual fans of Spider-Man, than fans of the comic book. While writing this review I thought of casual and hardcore fans, though I did not think of non-fans. I mean, no one will accidentally walk into the Spider-Man movie.The movie follows the earlier legend of Spider-Man rather than the revised story of the Ultimate Spider-Man comic books. However the storyline the Spider-Man movie follows, follows well, and establishes the origin story of Spider-Man very faithfully to the comic books. Toby Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, and is very convincing as a young man coming to terms with his superpowers. Kirsten Dunst is also quite good in her role as Mary Jane, while Willem Dafoe is quite a good Norm Osborn. However the best acting performance came from J.K. Simmons as J. Joanah Jameson, who is quite hilarious in his performance.The script is also well written; at times very funny and at other times very touching. When it comes to establishing Peter Parker and Norm Osborn, the Spider-Man movie succeeds fantastically. It is amazingly touching and its characters feel surprisingly human. However when it comes to establishing the character of Spider-Man, the movie falters a bit. Spider-Man in his costume never feels joyful or at all like the smart mouthed Spidey we know. Unfortunately he hardly speaks, and is far too mysterious. I mean this attitude is great for someone like Batman, but certainly not suited to Spider-Man. Any fan of Spider-Man knows that Spidey is full of one-liners and wisecracks. Unfortunately in the movie, Spider-Man is too quiet and believes in action rather than words.I must admit to the fact that the special affects are fantastic. And even though the joy of being Spider-Man is never fully established through dialogue it is thoroughly established through action. Spider-Man looks fantastic swinging past fast moving vehicles, and doing Matrix like moves. The scenes where he utilizes his abilities, are especially well done. All in all the Spider-Man movie is a visual feat, and its unmasked characters are extremely well developed.If I compare it to other superhero movies, I'd put this one behind the Superman and Batman movies. What those movies had though, was a great soundtrack, which the Spider-Man movie sorely misses. Also, those movies' superheroes had a lot of heart when they were in their costumes, while Spider-Man seems too robotic, much like Al-Gore. Like Batman, Superman, and The X-Men movies, Spider-Man does a good job when it comes to the character development of its unmasked hero. In fact I'd take it a step further, and say that Peter Parker is as well developed as Clark Kent was. Unfortunately as Spider-Man, he is more like Al-Gore than Spider-Man. Perhaps the problem was that Peter Parker was still new to being Spider-Man, and had not yet developed his Spider-Man personality. I think that that was the movie's only problem, it's Peter Parker lacked character when he put on the Spider-Man suit.I don't want to close on a negative though. The Spider-Man movie is quite good. It features some good character development, some superb action, witty dialogue (from everyone except for the webslinger), and great direction. This movie will do for superhero fans, what the original Superman movies did.	4.0	Behind Superman and Batman as a top superhero movie	2002-05-11	1	1	0

I thought the whole ""secret identity superhero"" thing was just too cool for words.  Well, here I am a quarter century later, and behold! my favorite comic book hero has hit the big screen.Now, I'm not normally a big fan of comic book movies, and in fact this one (and its sequel) are the only ones I have watched.  I don't want to be like some reviewers and read too much into this movie.  I doubt the producers were all that concerned about delving into Peter Parker's psyche as they were in just telling a good story.  They have definitely succeeded on the latter count!I think this movie is a wonderfully entertaining adaptation of the comic books and cartoons I loved as a 12 year old boy.  Sure, the serious afficionado can find some details to quibble over, but overall I was very impressed with the way the Spiderman legend was brought vividly to life.  I especially enjoyed the way the actors were made to look just like their comic book counterparts.  Even better, the outlandish story lines from the comics were actually imbued with an air of -- dare I say it? -- plausibility.  In short, it's everything I had hoped for in this kind of film, and then some.For all you ""serious"" movie critics out there who want to overanalyze this movie, just get over yourselves!  This was intended to be pure fun and fantasy, and it was definitely that.  It's a wild ride from the beginning to end.  Enjoy it!  I certainly did."	5.0	Spidey hits the big screen.

The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. On a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst).This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3E0MSKBIWMU6F	obryanstars	Back in May when I first saw Spider-man, my jaw dropped at the incredible graphics, acting, story, and emotion put into this comic book brought to life movie. I saw the movie 2 more times in theaters, then rushed and bought the DVD on opening week (sold out the first few days). After viewing everything, here's what I thought:First off, the movie: I loved this movie, and is one of the top 3 of my favorites ever! The story goes a lot with the old comic books. A kid by the name of Peter Parker is the main character. Through his whole life, he has had a crush on a girl next door named Mary Jane. He's always been a bit shy and for that matter; geeky and never really talked to her. On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a geneticly enganeered spider. The spider gives him super-human powers like a spider, and he doesn't know what to do with them. That's when one night, his uncle (he lives with his aunt and uncle) is shot by a burglar and dies on the very street. That's when Peter knows who he must become. He uses his abilities (web sling, incredible strength, and super-human speed and senses) to fight evil. His first openant: his uncle's killer. From that day on, Spider-man must fight off evil. A trully great start.Now, after getting his powers, a person (a few miles away) by the name of Norban Osborne is testing a human enhancer drug. The drug makes his mind go mad, and while he does get the enhancers affects, he also gets a criminals attitude. The whole movie is basicly these two fighting. Pretty boring right? No, not at all. Because the villain (green goblain) is willing to do anything to win, and in this case, finds out Spider-man's true identity and...you'll have to see.What made this movie so great was A. The romance between Mary Jane and Spider-man and wonderful acting all around and B. Perhaps the best graphics ever seen in a movie. Everything seems so real that you can't really tell it's special affects. I, toward the end of the movie, really felt like it was possible (which it really isn't). Like there could be a Spider-man out there somewhere. The city landscacpes and swinging is just incredible. Explosions, realism, web, destruction, everything makes this movie so real and exciting...So if u like a good romance, lots of action, incredible graphics, and a ton of fighting (with a little humor) Spider-man is for u. Millions of people did not flock to theaters again and again for nothing. This was a great movie, with a great ending that sets up for...should I give it away?...Spider-Man 2 (set for realease about 2004)The extras: Tons! The making of the movie, messups, a free demo of the PC game of Spider-man, staff thoughts, and a lot lot more. This DVD was awsome, and brings u the blockbuster hit that rocked theaters all over the world last summer.Overall, u should get this DVD. For the movie, the extras, and because of just how good it is. If your still not convinced, rent it on video. Then you'll c y u have to get Spider-man: The Movie; a classic of the future (in my opinion).I hope this helped, and I know that I love and can't get enough of Spider-man	5.0	Awsome Movie!!!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	"This is pure candy-floss: well marketed, somewhat cynically timed, but fundamentally an unimaginative adaptation of cartoon strip which itself was a pretty bare-faced rip-off of Superman. There are a number of reference points for Spider Man, and it doesn't measure up to any of them:Firstly, adapting a comic strip to the big screen: Since Christopher Reeve brought us Superman-con-fromage, action heroes have all but infested the cinema, mostly with substandard results: The best of the bunch was the Batman franchise, which (at least while in Tim Burton's capable hands) took a fairly cornball & camp idea and extracted a far darker, more gothic essence. Sam Raimis does nothing of the sort here: Spidey is straight, wholesome, dull, and ickily adolescent: I'm not sure what Raimis had in mind, but watching scenes where, at the flick of his wrist a infatuated 17 year old shoots sticky white stuff around his bedroom wasn't exactly the superhero experience I  bargained for.Secondly, the ""celebrity Bad Guy having the time of his life"" gambit doesn't pay off: Having a serious thesp play the villain is hardly a new idea. But where Jack Nicholson, Anthony Hopkins, Alan Rickman, Dennis Hopper and so on have animated (and in some cases carried) pretty cheesy films, in Spiderman, Defoe never really gets to grips with his part, and he certainly doesn't ham it up the way it screams out for. Partly I think this is because the green goblin part is poorly conceived: I don't know whether that fault lies with Marvel or Raimis' scriptwriter.And lastly, the special effects aren't that much chop: I rented The Matrix last week, which is practically a senior citizen in the Special FX world, having been around since 1998 or thereabouts. But it still leaves Spiderman for dead.And those are about the only criteria on which a film in the format of Spiderman could have hoped to justify itself. It will never be Citizen Kane, certainly, but given the hype Spiderman received (and its box office receipts) I was a little surprised this picture didn't at least subvert one or two conventions. It (ham-fistedly) set itself up for a sequel, so I guess there is another chance out there for some aspiring director to make a mark.But I'm not holding my breath."	2.0	Raimis paints by numbers	2002-12-21	6	5	1

I also liked the waythey highlighted the importance of Mary Jane by making it 'her story'in a way.Another standout aspect was the way they showed Peter Parker coming toterms with his new-found gifts and learning how best to utilize them.His transformation into a crime fighter is also shown in a realisticmanner, rather than showing him as a guy who's always been geared toturn into Spiderman, and needs no 'breaking in' period or motivation.Toby Maguire turns in a winning performance as Peter Parker/ Spiderman,which should really turn him into a big, big star. Kirsten Dunst isattractive in a warm kind of way rather than ravishingly pretty. WillemDafoe proves yet again that he's capable of fine villanious performances.The other support actors are good, too.A special word for Sam Raimi, who's done an exceedingly good job ofadapting a popular superhero series for the silver screen, a feat notso easily achieved.The special effects, sets etc are all quite good and add to the impact.All in all, very well done indeed - i'll definitely watch the sequel !!	5.0	Bring on the sequel !!	2002-07-04	1	1	0

Ohh yes, the terrible CGI...But Mary Jane falling off the bridge? next time read the comic, Mr. Raimi, or you could watch X-Men (I have to say that I'm not big fan of them) or Batman and learn how a good comic book based movie should be done. Take this from a 22+ year reader of Spider-man......to quote J. Jonah Jameson (BTW him was excellent) from the movie: ""crap...crap...mega crap"".

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"The best thing about Spider-Man is the fact that Hollywood has managed to catch Sam Raimi properly and stick him with a better budget. He does have a string of well made movies behind him (Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Darkman, The Gift) but nothing that says he can handle a Summer Blockbuster movie. However his resume does speak volumes about his trek through the world of superheros and the supernatural and so deservingly and rewardingly they have allowed this man to finally spin a golden celluloid web of mystery, intrigue, action and dark justice.Spider-Man is the first foray for the new ""Marvel"" co-production team. Here they have managed to pick up a fan boy director who is committed to translating a comic book hero onto the screen. Not only that but he is also translating a whole comic book onto the screen. Fans, of both Raimi and Spider-man, should feel very happy with the final result.This film is about the character Peter Parker as much as it is about Spider-Man (Great casting and played to form by Tobey Maguire although I think Jason Patrick would make a good older version of Spider-Man.). Here we see him acquiring his skills, learning his skills and then finally using them. The movie takes almost one hour to get cooking in the Spider-Man vs Bad Guys department, but you do not care because much of what is on display here is a good old fashioned teenage drama about the short-comings of adulthood, love and geekness. Parker, his family, his school friends and his wanna-be-girlfriend are all fully fleshed out. Much of it matches with the reality we live in and it is all played out very realistically and at times with lots of humour. However when Spider-Man turns dark, and it does turn dark, it is very twisted, emotionally challenging and does swing between that fine line of lynch mob revenge and real justice.The premise is simple but complex in the execution. Kid gets bit by radioactive spider, transforms into superhero, meets an anti-superhero (The Goblin) with similar problems who wants revenge for crimes committed against him by the government. Where Spider-Man scores in aces is with the fact that the two Superheros know each other well but do not know each others alter ego. This makes for an emotionally charged ending when all is finally unmasked.Spider-Man does suffer some setbacks. The budget is not quite as high as expected and the special effects can be a little lacklustre at times, however expertly done at other times. The special effects here are hit or miss and at times do look like the CGI we had seen back in the early 1990s.However all of this can be panned aside quickly by the sheer display of action and acting with all... and I mean ALL... that this genre can offer with ample amounts of family values and teenage dilemmas. There is even a final shot of a half-masked Spider-Man where Parker is a reflection of his torn self proving that this character carries lots of psychological fun to boot.This actually has a way more depth that you would expect and to its credit the character department is expertly handled.**As a note the action in the film transcends its PG-13 rating. The action is at times extremely violent and somewhat bloody. In fact the ending is closer to an R rating but because this is fantasy violence in the same vein as Lord of the Rings it gets the PG-13, but maybe pre-viewing by concerned parents should be adopted before showing it to their kids.**"	5.0	Sam Raimi, Sam Raimi!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2HVJI30MLFFMD	"""owillis"""	"Spider-Man is the best superhero movie of the past 20 years.It's closest relative in the success of translating both the immense scale and intimate characterizations of the character is 1978's Superman. When Superman was released, Christopher Reeve was an unknown who took that blank slate and brought Superman to life, his Clark Kent was a bumbling and stumbling fool while Superman was heroic and majestic. I thought Tobey Maguire was a good choice to play Spider-Man but worried that his fame may dominate the role - so it would be ""Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man"". Well, file that away in the cabinet of bad ideas, because Tobey Maguire is the living embodiment of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Instantly you sympathize with the character, the lowly everygeek who gets pushed around at school and dares not approach the girl he's loved since he was six, filled out beautifully by Kirsten Dunst.X-Men was a good comic-to-screen execution but had the unfortunate need to explain several characters' origins in a short amount of time, Spider-Man takes the advantage of a solitary origin and allows us to see the character evolve with time - stunningly faithful to the source material but moving at a good on-screen clip. When Peter is bitten by the spider and receives his powers, you jump with him roof to roof, laugh as he tries out his new abilities and marvel as his motions loosen up and become like the human spider who's existed in our minds and in two dimensions for these many years. Instead of dark and brooding, we get a hero who takes tragedy and becomes heroic and a symbol to the people he helps. The credo of ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is translated by Maguire into the ""Friendy neighborhood Spider-Man"" who makes the skyscrapers of New York his home.The Big Apple should get some on-screen credit as well, Spider-Man is able to simultaneously swing above the people but weave his web from building to building - never skipping a beat as it becomes second nature to wind his way through this world unto itself.Willem Dafoe does a good job as industrialist Norman Osborn who makes the transition to the maniacal Green Goblin. The scenes where he struggles with his madness are both funny and sad, while the explanations for his appearance are actually made more logical within the context of the film than in the comics - usually the opposite. My only complaint is that he is a little too much of a wisecracker than menancing villain, but his actions in the films final third make up for it.Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben come across as a loving couple, but not as hickish as Ma and Pa Kent - which is quite accurate. The scenes with Peter and his Aunt are nicely done as well, rooting the fantastic world of Spider-Man with the very real world of Peter Parker. J.K. Simmons is brilliant as newspaper magnate J. Jonah Jameson, perfecting the art of cigar chomping bluster - the scenes with him were way too short, please more JJ in the sequel! James Franco did well as the neglected Harry Osborn, making a unique dynamic in which his best friend and his father are both superpowered beings on flip sides of the coin who must sit down to dinner together.Kirsten Dunst is superb as the sexy, yet damaged Mary Jane who is part of the fabric that makes Peter Parker/Spider-Man discover his true purpose and find himself with her behind him. Her performance is subtle, but the scenes with her and Tobey Maguire are well done.Spider-Man does its source material proud, and is a film that can be enjoyed by both diehard fanboys and the general public. It is what Superman was, and the first Batman continued. Watching this makes you wonder what Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher were doing when they destroyed the Batman mythos in the cinematic disasters of the three Batman sequels. Ditto for Superman 3 and 4. Spider-Man and Superman are the benchmarks for excellence in comic filmmaking, proving that you can take these Amazing and Sensational characters of two dimensions and faithfully create an entertaining and engaging film without dumbing it down."	5.0	A Four-Color Masterpiece	2002-10-04	4	0	4

That's the problem with comic book movies, they try to be an origin story and an ultimate showdown between good and evil and cram it all into 90 minutes. There's no ongoing story throughout most of the movie, every marked out plot point is hit and then forgotten, none having an elaborate enough resolution to engage you before they're over.	3.0	Please enter a title for your review	2007-09-10	0	0	0

Oh well, it is a fun film and everyone I know wants to see it so......Tobey Maguire is great, as usual, as is Willem Dafoe.  Even though I'm a huge Kirsten Dunst fan, I thought her performance was a little weak.  Her lines seemed to forced and ingenuine. David Koepp's screenplay was also weak in the dialogue department.  Pretty corny stuff, even for a 'comic book' style film.  The film's animation effects, at times, are so blantantly noticeable, I feel that I am literally watching a cartoon.  But overall, it is a fun story and it was entertaining to watch Maguire's discovery of who he has become as it unfolds. *** 1/2 stars	3.0	Not Typical Raimi....	2003-04-27	1	1	0

I looked forward to seeing Tobey Maguire (one of Hollywood's greatest at the moment) portray the web-slinging / wall-climbing friendly neighborhood Spider-man.  Although his performance as Peter Parker by day, Superhero at night is right up there with any he has done, I was disappointed in the movie as a whole!  The story line, even though true to the comic book and animated series, was too predictable and put me to sleep.  I wish there would've been more twists in the plot or maybe an attempt for movie producers to create their own.  Although my disappointment will not deter me from seeing the obvious sequel, I do hope that more effort is put into entertaining true fans.	2.0	SPIDEY FAN DISAPPOINTED AT THE BOX OFFICE	2002-05-15	7	3	4
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A375HRSCYFF71	Paul Anthony Hagl	I've noticed the bulk of these reviews are very positive. Now I'm not reviewing the dvd because I haven't got it. I want to talk about the film itself. First let me say I love superhero movies and I did enjoy Spiderman to some degree. BUT!!! There are a few reasons why this film could have been better. Point one - Movies these days don't seem to unravel at a good pace. The narrative seemed rushed, like the film makers were making this for a generation of people who need action all the time or else they'll lose interest. Parker got bitten by the spider and was climbing buildings 5 minutes later. Point two - There is some pretty corny dialogue in this. How did Toby Macguire say some of these lines without bursting into laughter. I refer to the banter between him and Dunst, involving how beautiful he thinks she is and BLAAAHHHH!!! Point three - The Green Goblin guy looked really fake. CGI can either be good or really bad. In this case it stank. The hollywood film industry is becoming like fast food. Quick, processed and leaves you feeling a bit empty. But I'm gonna leave this review on a good note. Macguire was well casted, DaFoe was hilarious, Dunst is georgeous and there's always a chance the sequel might be an improvement. Thank you, I'm done.	3.0	Quite good but not great	2002-08-18	7	3	4

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AHO4CCRLK343T	pauli	it always amazes me how a movie studio can spend millions of dollars on a film and miss on so many levels.  despite the hype and box office sucess of this film, it falls far short in terms of an artistic statement.  it is obviously packaged for general audiences and like so many other productions of our time, this movie caters to the whims of our children at the expense of adults.  this is NOT spiderman but spider-BOY.  tobey maguire is much too short and boyish to portray a superhero MAN.  he is barely taller than his co-star kirstin dunst and if anyone should get an oscar, it's her for pretending to love him.  he is like every spoiled yuppie geek u might come across during business hours or catch playing hackysack at some state college campus.  i cant believe that HE was the best one for the role.  NO WAY JOSE!  on top of that his acting is dull and stoic.  there is barely a vibe of adrenaline to be found anywhere in this film.  i didnt feel inspired to get behind one of my favorite comic book heroes whom i've loved for years.  and as a fan of the serial, i feel jipped.  the spider bite scene, which is  supposed to be the turning point in the life of this character is passe and forgetful.  i have other issues as well with this film.  i think with better casting(notably maguire), and a more inspiring directorial vision, this story could've been a five star movie, instead, it's just another cgi moneygrabber.	3.0	who am i?  spider-BOY!	2002-12-10	6	2	4

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2TNEYVYHY3C4C	Paulybrooklyn	Having grown up reading Marvel comics, this movie drove me nuts. The visual effects were really dreadful, comparable to a cheap video game--I can't understand why so many people were impressed by them. Spider-Man moves like a puppet, the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger...they should have tried to do a little bit less with CGI figures, and shot more of the action with acrobats. Also, I can't understand why they put that raised plastic ribbing on Spider-Man's costume; it looks awful and it is unfathomable how a broke teenager could manufacture such a thing. Killing the Green Goblin was a bad dramatic choice--in the original comic book series Norman Osborn remained alive for years, alternating between amnesia and psychosis. This put Peter Parker in a state of perpetual anxiety and moral conflict and created great suspense in the storyline; one never knew when Osborn would slip into his mania again.In spite of these problems, I liked the melodramatic aspects of the film a lot. The actors were likeable and the story was touching and well-told. It seemed strange that in a film like this the action scenes ended up being the weakest elements!	3.0	Decent Movie with Some Very Disappointing Elements	2006-11-23	2	1	1

The storyline covers in good measured detail Peter Parker's path from high school teenage period to a hero with a burden and a matured mind.""The story is about a girl ..."", a great story-focus, M.J. and the pure and committed love expressed throughout by Peter Parker. Such noble and pure feelings of a introverted boy for a girl next door, old fashioned but in such a manner that proves that a love theme is always powerful and above every action packed sequence.The Green Goblin character demanded more attention since such a modern Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde theme is essential to the dramatization of the story.The soundtrack was exceptionally subtle and did not go for the easy musical trademark setting of the superhero. Well played out and well put through out the movie.The story of Spider-Man is a modern tragedy. The character is going through a roller coaster of emotional changes due to unpredictable life turning events. Not your average superhero story. The director along with the writing team must have consciously aimed to that effect.The tragedy though does not give away to an ending, because sequels need to be made, all of them welcome if properly done. The ending provides the base of Peter Parker's tragedy. The girl that he loved since he was six year old must finally be deprived of his true feelings for her. How come though? Simply, because he cherishes her life much more than his love gratification, he understands that Spider-Man can not allow any future Nemesis to hurt the people in his heart. His heart is turned to wood instead, amazing and furthermore beautifully sad how unselfish love manifests on such occasions.Congratulations to all the people involved in the movie. We all hope for a great follow up that is based on the very same ethics of story telling and of course new and more developed evil characters."	4.0	Spider-man	2005-12-19	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3V61K0EF38GP4	Philip Scholz	Please note that I've never read any Spider-Man comics and am simply judging this and any other Spider-Man film on their merits as films in a superhero film series.  Thank you for your understanding.We've all seen how heroes like Batman and Superman came about.  Peter Parker's story is a bit different, mainly because he doesn't have a seemingly unlimited bank account, the best martial arts training in the world, or an alien origin to work with.  He's simply a random kid who was randomly bitten by a genetically-engineered superspider (How come that spider didn't bite anyone else by the way?) and ultimately made the best of the situation by becoming a superhero.  With that being the tale, it's a pretty good tale as told in this film.  Toby McGuire plays the role quite well and even makes the more sappy and cliche moments sound pretty good.  His love interest, Mary Jane, played by Kirsten Dunst, is someone I could have done without...she was just so bland that any random girl could have been hanging off that bridge at the end and I would have had the same reaction.  Apart from Spider-Man himself, my two favorite characters (they're tied for this honor) are Uncle Ben and J. Jonah Jameson.  Cliff Robertson wasn't in the film for very long, but his performance was so powerful that you couldn't help but feel sad when Uncle Ben died, making him a beloved and influencial character, which is what the filmmakers were surely going for.  Well filmmakers, a job well done.  As for J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, I could never get enough of that guy.  He may be funny and perhaps a bit over-the-top, but it all only contributes to this character and makes him unique among the newspaper editors that so many superheroes seem to have in their lives.  Plus, J. K. Simmons is just a great actor and always worth watching.  And finally, the thing most debut superhero films do, the one and only villain.  Willem Dafoe played a power-hungry Norman Osborn and a completely creepy Green Goblin...a combination that ought to land this character in Arkham Asylum.  Like Toby McGuire, he makes the sappy and cliche moments work for this film and its tone.  James Franco, playing Harry Osborn, was a bit more complex and this set him up perfectly for the coming sequels.  This film portrayed a superhero's origin as well as any before it and stepped up a notch, making any audience truely care about where this web-slinging kid came from and where he's going.  Whether you're a Spider-Man fan or not, it's a must-see.  Enjoy.	5.0	A New Superhero	2014-05-30	0	0	0

The film explores the origins of the transformation of Peter Parker from nerdy high school student to the web slinging superhero Spider-Man.  Tobey Maguire is quite good in the title role.  He plays the character with the right amount of torment as an outcast who has been put down all his life, but injects pride, joy and happiness into the Peter from his newly bestowed powers.  Kirtsen Dunst is Peter's next door neighbor, Mary Jane Watson.  Ms. Dunst is not given much to work worth in the character, she is the requisite love interest, damsel in distress but she is appealing in the role.  Willem Dafoe is plays the Green Goblin who is the villain in the film.  The Goblin's alter ego is Norman Osborne who is the rich father of Harry (James Franco), Peter's best friend and roommate.  Mr. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Goblin and he handles the character's schizophrenic outbursts with creepy aplomb.  Mr. Franco plays Harry sullenly and he appears as if he is moping through the picture.  J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson as a pushy, demanding blowhard who listens only to himself with hilarious results.  People have criticized the fighting and action scenes, but they are really no better or worse than most current action films.  There are some Matrix like sequences with the slow motion, but these scenes actually help show Spider-Man's spider senses that allow him to anticipate and react quickly to danger.  The film was a box office smash and we should expect to see numerous sequels that will hopefully be as appealing as the first installment.	4.0	Spinning A Worthy Web	2003-05-12	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AIRHRV3D8X4J1	"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina"""	I have to say Spider-Man is one of the most refreshing comic book hero movies to ever come out. When I was a young kid, I was a huge Spider-Man fan with the action figures and comic books. As time went on and as I grew older I forgot about him, but that changed when I saw the previews for this movie. I finally saw the movie tonight and it brought back those care free days I had as a kid. Seeing Spider-Man was just one of the most amazing movie experiences (along with E.T.) ever. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did an amazing job. He brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. Another great performance was by KIRSTEN DUNST who brought the Lois Lane like quality to this movie, and gave one of her best movie performances to date. Together the two just ignited the big screen and as the sparks flew it gave the movie a romantic twist. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, thats what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride i highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the Hype of this movie. I went to see it cause I wanted to. SPIDER-MAN is breaking Box Office Records! Spider-Man was the #1 Movie at the box Office for the weekend of May 4-5 and had the largest opening gross ever its first week with $118 million. It broke another record in its second week of release on May 11-12 with grossing $72 million, which is the most any movie has ever grossed on its second week, and if thats not enough it is the fastest movie to pass the $200 million mark in only 9 days. I can see why because this movie is just AWESOME! I will be waiting in line when SPIDER-MAN comes out on DVD! Check Spider-Man out! Tobey and Kirstin you both rock!	5.0	SPIDER-MAN - the #1 Movie thats breaking box office records!	2002-05-05	22	18	4

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q	Priscilla Stafford	"I actually got to see Spider-Man on May 3rd! In Japan it is highly unusual for a movie to come out on the same date as in America, there's unusually at least a 3 month wait. But surprisingly, I was able to see ""Spider-Man"" on May 3rd by getting reserved tickets! And I must say, the movie was so much better than I expected (and I had expected a lot!)High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is while very smart is the school freak. His only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), son of scientist Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe). He is also very much in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) though he won't approach her. So he goes through life ignored and made fun of. But Peter's life is about to be turned upside down when at a high school excursion to the museum he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super spider. At first thinking none of it, he goes back home where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). But the next day, he wakes up to find himself with perfect vision and also a more muscular body! Stranger things happen in school where he finally realizes that the bite he got has given him special abilities which spiders have, from amazing agility, strength, extraordinary senses, and web flinging powers. He soon finds out though that with his new powers comes great responsibility. Norman Osborne has got a split personality, the other side of him being the evil Green Goblin. Peter knows that someone has to stop him... could that someone be 'Spider-Man'?I must say that ""Spider-Man"" has got it all! *ACTING*: Kirsten Dunst is very believable as the not-so-perfect Mary Jane with her family and love problems. You can't help but feel for her character. Then there's Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/Green Goblin. His scene where he confronts 'himself' in the mirror was remarkably well down, it takes an enormous amount of talent to be able to portray two different personalities like that. And I mustn't forget Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. He can show his expressions so well, from his shy smile to Mary Jane, his turmoil of grief, his determination to stop Green Goblin, and his excitement when he first tries out his superpowers. You can't help but become attached to his character. Though I have never read any of the Spider-Man comics, my father has and he was so delighted to find that the editor of the newspaper seemed to be right out of the comic book, from his looks to his attitude.*PLOT*: Intriguing plot, making the two hours of the movie seem to flick by so fast. The story has plenty of surprises and twists, making the whole entire time very enjoyable. The first thirty minutes or so was very light, I was laughing a lot on the mishaps of Peter Parker's previous life to becoming Spider-Man. But from then on it became a little bit more serious, the ending climaxing to explosion of action and excitement! The end might put off some people but I found it highly satisfying. I can't tell what happens but I must say that the end definitely calls for a sequel! As for the humor and seriousness of the film, I always believe that most all movies should have the right balance of these two points. And Spider-Man was great, having plenty of humor to keep my laughing yet a serious tone to it which was essential to the movie.*ACTION AND F/X*: The action is so well done that through the last hour or so of the movie I was on the edge of my seat! All of the confrontations of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were very exciting, the last 'battle' (as there usual is) the most tense. As in the trailers, Spider-Man does not only get to fly and fling himself through the air, he also gets to do a lot of hand-to-hand fighting and kung-fu. Applause to the fight coordinator. The F/X were pretty real yet had a sort of comic book feel to it making it very easy to watch and enjoy. Watch Spider-Man fly through the air, send out webs, twist in the air in what seems like impossible moves, and fight evil with the agility of... well you know, a spider!*PG-13 RATING*: The film is rated PG-13 for 'stylized action and violence' but I think think there should be added 'and for some language'.So my conclusion is, ""Spider-Man"" is a GREAT film and I most definitely will be getting the DVD as soon as it comes out! Maybe see it in the theaters a few more times :-). I also recommend two other super-hero movies which are my favorites, ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve and ""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin. ""Batman"" was also interesting though it didn't make much of an impression on me."	5.0	Spider-man, a movie with an intricate web of fun!	2002-05-03	17	14	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A29L2RN5D8C0HM	"Prism Light ""Prism"""	I saw Spider-Man 2 before the original Spider-Man, and I have to say, I think the 2nd movie was a big improvement of the 1st.  Not that the original movie was bad, but I personally think the 2nd movie was better.  You have to see the 1st movie to understand quite a bit of the 1st movie, though.I think Tobey Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker very well in this movie, as does Kirsten Dunst with Mary-Jane.  I personally love Kirsten's hair red, and I think it looks much prettier long then cropped.  Anyway, I found the Green Goblin's outfit to be rather poorly made, and quite fake in appearance.  The Green Goblin himself was a tad unreal, too.  But the movie still had a lot of action, adventure, and what made the 2nd movie so good, romance.Overall, I would say that if you plan on seeing the 2nd movie, enjoy movies about superheros, are a Spider-Man fan, or are a Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fan, you will probably enjoy this movie.	4.0	A Good Movie	2004-10-25	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2GEBXWGCYGHQG	Psyche86	Yes, this movie has received a lot of criticism for being overly hyped, too cartoony, or too predictable. There is a plain reason for this - it's based on a COMIC BOOK! I think people really need to relax and just enjoy it once in a while, not everything has to be Academy Award-worthy. I do admit that Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin mask was just a bit corny looking, but the awesome special effects pretty much make up for that. I still think he was a great choice for the part, as were Tobey Maguire and James Franco for theirs. Some think it adds too much of a teen factor, having two of the biggest teen stars in the leading roles (Maguire and Kirsten Dunst), but the fact that it was derived from a comic book that has been read by many people more than twice their ages helps to weigh out that belief. All in all, it's a great action packed movie that really pulls you into the story, and I for one can't wait for a sequel.	5.0	of course... because it's a COMIC BOOK	2002-10-06	8	5	3

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A31U2QT7SAL7K	"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man"""	"Of course there are going to be similarities inasmuch as both are based on the origins and exploits of beloved comic book heroes. However, there are so many that one could assume that the same individual did them both.Both feature a hero that becomes an obsessed vigilante against crime upon the death of a loved one. Both have a character that is eons removed from his mild-mannered ""alter ego"". The two films feature over-the-top performances from the ""villain"" (Nicholson as Batman's ""Joker"" and Dafoe as ""The Green Goblin""). Both have an elderly ""sage"" in the form of ""Alfred"" and ""Uncle Ben"", respectively. A mammoth citywide celebration with music provided by contemporary stars is one of the commonalities in both (""Batman"" had Prince and ""Spiderman"" has Macy Gray). The pair features state-of-the-art special effects and a very similar score penned by Danny Elfman.But the main ""bond"" between the movies is in the casting of the least likely of performers in the title roles. Much was said about Michael Keaton's selection as the Dark Knight. But, he pulled it off superbly.Thus, Tobey Maguire, surprisingly buffed and confident, dons the tights nicely and believably as ""the web spinner"". His should be a long run as the very popular comic book icon.The movie is entertaining and is reverential to the spirit of the magazine on which it is based.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A6IAANZCSHK9Q	"Reginald M. Lumagui ""green_lantern_2814"""	"I still think Superman 1 & 2 with Christopher Reeves tops the charts as one of the best superhero movies. After all, who doesn't want to fly? But Spider-man takes a more down to earth hero from the comics successfully unto the big screen. Sam Raimi did a great job in bringing out the character as he's supposed to be unlike those tragedic Batman movies. They did take some liberties in Spiderman's origin and powers but it was still told quite nicely and, in some cases, like his organic webbing was a better change. I didn't think I would have liked this movie after having seen X-men. X-men was an ok movie but the mutant thing has been done to death. Didn't like their costume change either. Now, Spiderman shows that if you just portray the character seriously enough, you can still use those colorful comic costumes on screen and still be believable.I think Tobey McGuire did an excellent job as Peter Parker. You really felt his anger at his Uncle's untimely demise. You really felt like swinging with him as he learned on the fly how to websling from rooftop to rooftop. And Kirsten Dunst, another character who I didn't think I'd believe in, portrayed a great Mary Jane Watson. Didn't even think her red hair annoyed me in the entire movie unlike Storm's godawful fake hair in X-men.The dvd widerscreen is definitely the way to go. The black bars on the top and bottom aren't as big as other widescreen movies so you still have great picture even at a 27"" TV. Lots of extras on the two disc set. Great animated menus although the interface is kinda weird with their shortcuts selection method. Takes awhile to figure out what does what. The movie itself is a great transfer. Clear picture and sound. Didn't see any artifacting or heard of people with faulty discs as of yet. Definitely a great movie at a great price. Kid's will love it.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen.  And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character; someone who can right wrongs, stave off injustice, assuage fears and give people a sense of security in a world seemingly gone amuck at times, and thanks to the magic of the movies we have him now.  His name is ""Spider-Man.""Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a normal, if not typical teenager; mature beyond his years, he would rather attend a science fair than go to a rave, he lives with his aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson) and has been in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl who lives next door, since about the first grade.  ""MJ,"" however, doesn't even know he exists; except for an occasional ""hello,"" they barely know one another.  But though Peter doesn't know it, all of that-- Peter's life-- is about to undergo a radical change.On a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a spider-- not just any spider, but one that's been genetically altered.  And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed; it's not exactly Kafka's Metamorphosis, but he does have new life and new energy, and beginning with his vision (he suddenly can see clearly without his glasses), he gradually discovers that he has certain physical abilities that do not necessarily coincide with the kind of changes consistent with a young man of his age.  Like being able to spin webs from his wrists and climb up the side of buildings.  And now all he has to do is learn how to control and use his newly found prowess, and decide what to do with it all.  Which he does very quickly, when circumstances provide him with a motive and a personal agenda that leads him to become, as Peter himself puts it, ""Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.""With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero.  Like Burton did in the original ""Batman,"" in which Michael Keaton played to the man, rather than to the ""bat,"" Raimi takes Maguire down the same path, having him play to Peter, rather than the ""spider.""  And it makes all the difference in the world.  Instead of merely thrusting a full-blown superhero onto the screen, Raimi first develops a plausible storyline (screenplay by David Koepp) complete with a central character to whom the audience can relate, and once that is established it enables the audience to suspend disbelief and go with the flow when Peter emerges as Spider-Man.  The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular.  It's reality based, but imaginatively presented-- Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here.  And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet.When it was announced that Tobey Maguire had landed the role of Spider-Man, you could almost hear the collective audible gasp of fans everywhere.  Tobey Maguire?  Spider-Man?  !!!  But-- as it turns out-- it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web-slinger.  In fact, hopefully he's been signed to a multi-picture deal, because now it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  Without question, Maguire IS Spider-Man.  His appearance, the way he carries himself-- his entire countenance-- combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life.  Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""The Cider House Rules,"" has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter.  He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that ""ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances"" scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful; and Maguire nails it with a performance that is introspective and affecting, and it makes the character-- as well as the film-- work.Willem Dafoe also contributes to the film's appeal with his portrayal of Norman Osborn, aka, the ""Green Goblin.""  Not since the Joker sparred with Batman has the screen had such a memorable villain; and again, Dafoe first plays to the man-- to Osborn-- and then to the ""Goblin,"" which puts a real face on Evil and gives the character the depth that makes him more than just superficially ""bad.""  Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface.  The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly.Kirsten Dunst had something of a challenge with her role of Mary Jane, as the character is somewhat ambiguous; on one hand, she plays a pivotal role in motivating Spider-Man, while her own part in the grand scheme of things remains uncertain until the end.  And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst.  In the final analysis, ""Spider-Man"" is a winner that is going to attract a huge following; this is one film that definitely has legs."	5.0	Maguire Brings Spider-Man to Life	2002-05-05	2	2	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	It was, I suppose, inevitable, that 'Spider-Man', one of Marvel Comics' best-established and longest-running comic books, would eventually be given a Magic Of The Movies Makeover.Like the X-Men, Batman and Superman before it, 'Spider-Man' is a loud, adrenilane-fuelled romp through over sixty years of characterisation and carefully developed characters. Put simply, it is a cut-down version of a Pop-Culture Legend, dumbed severely down for the benefit of the moviegoing masses.Taking the lead as peter Parker is Toby Maguire, an actor, whose career, if this original is anything to judge the impending two sequels by, has taken a severe turn in the direction of 'Typecast'. As Peter Parker he is suitably weedy and nervy, but as Spiderman lacks any of the believability or sense of Cool that has made the character a comic Titan. He is grating, immature and whiney. The truly abysmal quality of the 'special' effects does not help this. Spider-Man in action is mostly a computer animation, and is noticably poorly-realised. Put simply, the character does not come across in the least way believable.Runnung a close second to Maguire in terms of pointlessness is Willem DaFoe in the role of the Green Goblin. Both as Norman Osborne and the Goblin himself, DaFoe's total lack of sympathy and understanding for his role leaves us with a villain as unconvincing as his costume - which, in this day and age of astounding creative design, is unacceptably boring.Kirsten Dunst is relatively good as the winsome Mary Jane Watson, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May.Direction is run-of-the-mill fare for this sort of blockbuster, but thanks to truly lousy special effects and a huge sense of the pedestrian impregnating the whole picture, the visual impact made by 'Spider-Man' is not enormous. A real missed opportunity for director Sam Raimi.Boring script (nothing unexpected, very little character development), boring visuals and uninspired performances team with lousy characterisation to make 'Spider-Man' a huge waste of glorious potential and excellent source material, and a total exercise in mundanity.Avoid!	1.0	Preposterous Drivel	2004-03-11	21	9	12

Now, New York's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man will face the wrath of the maniacal Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and win the admiration of sweetheart Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). ""Spider-Man"" is a sensational box-office spectacle that combines rousing comic-book adventure and strong human drama. Director Sam Raimi has captured the spirit and heart of the comic that surely satisfy audiences and fans of the genre. The action scenes are straight out of the comic-book and the special effects are good but not quite ""amazing"". Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast for the role of Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe delivers a devilish performance as the Green Goblin. Fans of Sam Raimi's work will notice Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi in small roles and expect a small cameo by Lucy Lawless (Xena).Columbia definitely scores high marks for their latest DVD release. The crowd-pleasing comic book blockbuster hit is presented in a 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a bright video transfer with rich detailed colors. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is clear and very enjoyable. ""Spider-Man"" Special Edition comes fully loaded with two audio commentaries with director Sam Raimi, cast member Kirsten Dunst and visual effects crew, three informative behind-the-scenes documentaries, theatrical trailers, TV spots, screen tests, two music videos, a short gag reel, comic book archives and the 25-minute ""Spider-Man: The Mythology"" featurette. The DVD menus are colorful but not always easy to navigate. Overall, ""Spider-Man"" scores an ""A-""."	5.0	From Zero to Superhero	2002-11-02	8	7	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AHBNPMHDWZ7SB	RJ Smoove	Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X-Men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters. Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics. The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good. The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores). Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead series. I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.Neither did the cast. All of the actors were fairly new to me. I had no idea who most of them were, except Kirsten Dunst I knew from Small Soldiers (I was a child). But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names. Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying. To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider-Man, is definitely JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. If ever there were an actor born to play a specific supporting role, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn. As the serum changed him from a desperate businessman to a conflicted monster, the not so subtle nuances of Dafoe's performance really began to shine through. If only Green Goblin's costume had less of a silly looking design, then his character would be one of the premier villains in Marvel film history. As it stands, Goblin's costume only hurts the film by making it seem more campy than it really is. It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out. Nevertheless, Spider-Man should definitely be creditted as the film that sparked the hype and interest that comic book adaptations get today. If it were not for Spider-Man (as well as Blade and X-Men), I doubt that movies like Watchmen, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Dare Devil, or any of the other countless comic book and superhero flicks would have been taken seriously enough to be converted from script into film.And the Blu-ray presentation of this old favorite of mine was night and day upon my discovery of the disc. I had seen the DVDs countless times, but it wasn't until my eyes were laid upon the BD that I appreciated every inch of every frame as they were shot. Detail is remarkable. Color is rich. It truly is like watching the movie for the very first time. Now this re-release features extras that the first release lacked. It has pretty much all the essentials, and leaves behind some of the more fluff extras from the DVDs. Highly Recommended!	5.0	Revolutionary in its Time	2012-08-13	2	2	0

I almost bought the DVD without first seeing it because I always liked Spider-Man as a kid and had heard so many good reviews about it. I am so glad that a friend lent it to me so I could see it wasn't worth it. Wish I could get the time I wasted watching this overhyped and overrated film back! I sure hope the sequel isn't this flawed.Also, this is the only DVD ever to completely freeze up in my Toshiba DVD player part way through (out of well over 100 discs I've played in it).

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1T3CTSM0B3IZA	Robb Boutros	"This movie has been in the making for the better part of 20 years. Through all the trials, tribulations, bankruptcys and legal wranglings, director Sam Raimi has delivered the goods. And he's done so in a BIG way!!Having read Spider-Man when I was younger I had high expectations for this film. My expectations were not only met, but they were exceeded. Spider-Man is now, and I say without hyperbole, the benchmark that all other comic book movies will be measured against.Tobey Maguire, plays Peter Parker. Our reluctant, shy and unassuming hero. What sets him apart is that he doesn't fit the super hero mold. He's awkward, and a bit on the nerdy side. But all that's about to change. On a class field trip to Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. He then undergoes a remarkable ""metamorphesis"". He takes on a spider's strength, speed, agility, and even a sixth ""spider sense"". From there on his world is turned upside down.What makes Spider-Man work is that, at it's core, it's not about super powers or villains or costumes. It's about a person. A person who makes decisions and has to deal with the reprecussions of his actions. A person who is also at times uncomfortable with being a hero. That's what sets him apart from the rest of his super hero bretheren. The human element is what really sets the film apart from many of the other comic book movies. As in Superman you feel somewhat removed from the character, you really feel for Peter Parker and his predicament.For Parker, the choices are not always as simple as black and white.Kirsten Dunst is absolutley radiant as Mary Jane Watson. Peter who has secretly been in love with Mary Jane since he was a child. There is a certain sweetness to the underlying love story that is genuine. Peter is, afterall, just a shy, awkward young man. But it's those underdog qualities that endear you to him.Wilem Defoe turns in a riveting performance as one of Spideys oldest foes, the Green Goblin. The armor may look a little hokey but it's Defoe's mannerisms that really make this an inspired choice for him.The CGI effects really make you believe he can do whatever a spider can. A few years ago this film would have had a completely different look. All the legal troubles were in fact, a mixed blessing. Fortunately, technology advanced enough to the point where the CGI really allowed the web head to swing effortlessly between sky scrapers with the greatest of ease.This is one hero for the ages. See this movie. I can go on all day about this film. To him life is a great big bang up, wherever there's a hangup you'll find the Spider-Man!!"	5.0	Who am I?

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	"For those of us who have been waiting literally years for this, one of the greatest comic book series ever, to come to larger-than-life enormity on the big screen, this film is a godsend. One of the very few 'event movies' to actually live up to its hype, SPIDER-MAN (2002), as brilliantly directed by the wonderful Sam Raimi (one of the most successful cult directors in film history), delivers BIG-TIME!! It is perfectly cast, from Tobey Maguire in the title role--probably the role he was born to play--to Willem Dafoe, as his dreaded arch-enemy, to the beautiful Kirsten Dunst, the girl he would love to ask out on a date.Actually, I knew that Tobey Maguire would be perfect as the nerdy, super-shy Peter Parker, who of course turns into Spider-man after being bitten by a genetically altered, and very colorful, red-and-blue spider in a science lab. I've seen Maguire in both PLEASANTVILLE (1997) and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999) and I just knew that he fit Peter Parker to a T. Also perfectly cast is Willem Dafoe, as well-meaning corporate head Norman Osborne, who of course gives in to his evil side to become the fearsome Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst, as sweet-but-troubled Mary Jane Watson, finds just the right note in her performance; her M.J. is pretty but not overly glamorous, talented but underachieving, desirable but not inaccessible. I've been following Dunst's career ever since seeing her remarkable debut, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (1994), for which she should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and I can say that she is every bit as deserving as Tobey Maguire for starring in such a wonderful film, which by the way just smashed all box-office opening-week records ($115 million). Now both actors are finally getting their due recognition!Also finally getting his due recognition is director Sam Raimi, who first made the splatter-fest THE EVIL DEAD (1983), and the even better (and funnier) EVIL DEAD 2 (1987), before going on to direct the wonderful DARKMAN (1990) and then finishing the EVIL DEAD trilogy with ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993). More known to a wide TV audience as the exec producer of the ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"" series, Sam Raimi is now making his triumphant return to feature films. And what a triumph this film is!SPIDER-MAN has action, fun, brains, brawn, suspense, and most importantly, a great storyline which blends the traditional comic-book story with modern-day realism. Sam Raimi and the screenwriter found a way to not alienate the original fans, while incorporating today's hip humor and attitudes. Plus, it was filmed in my original hometown of New York City! :)To sum up: Great cast, great acting, great action, great story, great direction, great visuals, filmed in NYC. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait to own it on DVD! Now, the questions that may be on your mind if you haven't yet seen it: Does Spider-man conquer evil? Is he conquered instead?? Does he get the girl??? The answers to these questions are not so obvious; you have to go out and see it, and find out for yourself!!!! MOST RECOMMENDED"	5.0	AWESOME!!!!	2002-05-07	16	13	3

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A306Z6Q4YV0DDC	"Robert Torres ""Bobby Shaddoe"""	This was possibly the most highly-anticipated comic book movie adaptation ever, next to the X-Men, and it may have taken years to bring this about, but it is definitely worth the wait.  initially I wasn't sure who they were going to cast in the title role, but when I heard the name Tobey Maguire, I initially scratched my head in confusion, considering the fact that I would've never thought that a guy like him would take part in something like this, given his Hollywood track record.  But after this, I don't think I would picture anyone else as Peter Parker.  He really brings the character to life, embodying many of the deep qualities we love and admire from the comics and the cartoon, but in a majorly human way.  Kirsten Dunst was excellent as Mary Jane, I initially thought she would play Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man's FIRST love interest, but then I saw that Kirsten had dyed her hair, so it pretty much indicated that MJ was in this film.  this movie was excellent on so many levels, it was intelligent, it was funny, it was touching, it was dramatic, it was action-packed, everything you would love in a movie.  On top of that, it's Spider-Man for crying out loud!  Everyone loves that wall crawler.  I'm definitely excited about the sequels!	5.0	Spidey Lives!	2002-10-03	3	3	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	SPIDER-MAN raked in another ... million in just the first three days of it's home video release.  That brings the world-wide gross to about a billion bucks.  An off the chart figure.  So what is it about this story that connected with a global audience on such a stratospheric level?  Was it the marketing, the name recognition from the seemingly endless series of comic book incarnations or something else?If the film does not hold up as well as one might guess on repeated viewings, the metaphors for the frustrations and fantasies of male puberty come though even clearer.  Perhaps more than anything, this film is a romantic rite of passage; almost tribal in its subtext (the ritual spider bite and the shamanistic hallucinations of flying and fighting demons) but in a post-modern garb.But does it all add up to anything?  Not really.  Perfectly directed by super-visualist Sam Raimi (a master of the floating camera), and with nice, understated, naturalistic performances by Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.  These two actors exude a rare and apparently authentic chemistry in their scenes together.  Inexplicably, Maguire is missing on the entertaining audio commentary with Raimi and Dunst. Interesting but rather ordinary making-of and behind-the-scenes extras on the second disc.	3.0	BIG FUN TRUE TO COMIC BOOK	2002-11-14	1	0	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AM4ZQJ0IORVWG	"Rob ""Revuman"""	"The Basic Plot: Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire), the school whipping post, gets bitten by a genetically altered super spider.  Almost overnight, he gains wild spider-like powers.  While at first he uses them to attempt to get into Mary Jane's proverbial pants (played by Kirsten Dunst) he realizes that he should use his new found powers to put a stopper in local crime after his uncle and parental guardian is killed by a car-jacker, a crime which he himself could have stopped.  At the same time, a strange creature named the Green Goblin has begun terrorizing the city.  Who is this ""Green Goblin"" character, and will Spiderman be able to stop him?The Movie:  It has a very comic book feel at times, which is a good thing.  The acting moves back and forth from very good to rather hokey.  The best acting comes from Willem Dafoe, whose scenes as the split personality Dr. Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin stand out as some of the best in the movie.  Kirsten Dunst, while great to look at, is nothing special as Mary Jane in Spiderman.  Even in the very emotional scenes I don't buy it.  And Toby, perfectly cast as Parker, and although some say he isn't the one they would have pegged as Spiderman, he's a perfect Peter Parker, and since Spidy and Parker are one and the same, it would only make sense.  As for Direction and Cinematography, don't expect anything really new here.  It's your clear-cut action movie with the classic Raimi touches like his brother being in the movie, the Cadillac makes a return appearance, and Bruce Campbell makes a cameo as the Ring Announcer.  All in all it's not a bad lil' flick.The Video:  Talk about a great transfer.  Although I only buy Widescreen for the most part, this DVD comes in either the widescreen or fullscreen version.  I would have to push for the Widescreen, especially if you got the home theater for it, or if you're just a purist movie buff like me!The Audio:  This is where 5.1 audio is key.  Every little sound byte comes through crystal clear from the metallic whooshes during the spidy sense scene to the big explosions during the Oscorp Gala scene in Midtown.  Yay to Columbia Tri-Star and the Spiderman Team for this audio!The Disc one Commentary:  For the love of GOD, do not put Kirsten Dunst on a commentary with Sam Raimi.  Shoot me in the foot, put a skirt on my head, and call me Sally Struthers before you put anyone with ears in front of a set of speakers and force me to listen to that girl talk.  It's ok when you have a good script behind her, but I'll tell you, in 2 hours, every time I heard her say something, I couldn't help but feel dumber.  As for the rest of the people on the Commentary, including Raimi and producers Laura Ziskin and Grant Curtis, they all said stuff that was interesting and worth listening to (in reference to the visuals of the movie).  But please, know whom you are putting on a commentary Columbia Pictures.  Some actors aren't meant to do improv!The Extras:  First off, unless you actually care about Sum 41, you're not going to care much for their music video.  So exnay on that.  As for the other extras, there is no original behind the scenes from the cast and crew of Spiderman.  The only thing you do get is the HBO and E! behind the scenes, which are ok, but half of it is all about stuff that you probably could have figured out from picking up a copy of ""The Amazing Spiderman"", doesn't matter which.  The screen tests of Toby and J.K. Simmons, while at first glance sound great, aren't very long or really all that worthwhile.  There are some ok DVD-ROM features, but unless you have a DVD-ROM in your computer, it doesn't really matter because you can't access them.  The outtake reel is sub par.  I'll say it again, IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AN OUTTAKE REEL, REALLY DO IT!  However, there is a lot of interesting background info on the Spiderman Comic book and it's leap from comic to screen.The Bad:  If there is one thing that killed the extras disk, it's the horrible layout of the menus.  Very hard to navigate and easy for you to miss parts of the extras that you might have overlooked.  When I buy a DVD, the extras are key, and they have to be laid out so that someone can access them.  Now, if I can build a computer, but have a hard time accessing the extras on a DVD, something is wrong.  Oh, and Kirsten Dunst in the Commentary (I can't mention this enough!)The Final Word:  Buy the DVD for the movie, stay for some of the extras and come back to it every now and then when you need to watch a straightforward action movie.  But don't expect Spiderman ""THE EPIC""..."	4.0	It is what it tries to be, a comic book action movie	2003-01-02	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	This film did a better job bringing Spidey to the big screen than Superman did for the Man of Steel.  The reason is that &quot;Superman&quot; took itself pretty seriously.  This film doesn't.  It is, quite simply, the comic book come to life.As far as I know I read every Spider-Man comic book from its inception until 1968, when I discovered girls.  So I speak here with authority.  This film **is** the comic book.  If you liked the comic book, you'll like the film.  If not, you probably won't.I watched the DVD expecting to hate it.  Within 10 minutes I was hooked.  OK, fine, so the special effects don't look 100% authentic (they're great, just not believable).  OK, so the Green Goblin is a little hard to believe.  So what?  Like they were authentic and realistic in the comic book?  Give me a break.  This is a great movie for what it is.  And unlike so many dreary films these days, this one has an actual storyline, a love interest, a dash of humor, and overall is great fun.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending.  Come on, Mary Jane is gorgeous, and Peter seems like a normal guy, excepting that he's Spider-man.  So what's the deal?  OK, I won't spoil it for you.Great fun.  My whole family just got done watching the DVD, and it was a fun evening.  My 4 year old son, 10 year old daughter, and their 48 year old dad all loved it.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"**1/2 Perhaps it isn't all ""Spider-Man""'s fault that it was released 24 years after the original ""Superman"" or 13 years after the original ""Batman"" movies.  But the fact is that those films beat this new film considerably to the punch, which probably explains why ""Spider-Man,"" for all its sophisticated special effects, feels decidedly Old Hat - especially compared to the infinitely more complex and sophisticated ""X-Men"" from a few years back, not to mention the brilliant ""Darkman"" from way back in 1990.  That last comparison is particularly apt since"" Spider-Man""'s director, Sam Raimi, virtually cut his teeth on that film.  In ""Darkman,"" Raimi brought a seriousness of purpose and a uniqueness of vision to the project that helped to carry the comic book movie genre to new artistic heights.  ""Spider-Man,"" though inoffensive, seems bland and benign in comparison, calculated to reach the widest audience possible (which apparently it has succeeded in doing, a fact that says less about the quality of the movie, perhaps, than about the undemanding tastes of modern moviegoers).""Spider-Man"" seems so by-the-book in its narrative, tone and purpose that it never soars much above the ordinary and never carries the audience to the kind of exciting, visionary world one would expect from a film of this type.  The movie is blessed in one all-important respect though: its inspired decision to cast Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, a mild mannered nerd who becomes a super hero after he's bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Maguire's winning and disarming performance is the film's one incontestable virtue.  All else seems problematic, beginning with the storyline, which plays virtually by rote.  One needn't list all the conventional elements, starting with the poor, picked-on geek who can't get the girl he loves to even acknowledge his existence, the loving, older guardians who support their boy in everything he does, the tortured super villain (in this case, the Green Goblin) who is both the hero's alter ego as well as his arch nemesis.  All this is, of course, par for the course, but I guess the thing I object to the most is that the tone is simply too innocuous and sunny.  The film can't generate any real suspense or excitement because the threats seem so halfhearted.  By the same token, the film doesn't have much of a playful spirit either.  The love scenes between Spider-Man and his truelove, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), work only because the actors themselves are so likable in the roles.  Otherwise, the romantic element is as underwhelming and clich&eacute;d as virtually every other feature of the film.  Probably the most unaccountable aspect of the plot is that, despite the fact that Spider-Man does only good for the citizens of Manhattan, we keep being told that the citizens are ambiguous in their attitudes towards him.  Yet, we are given no reason to credit this possibility for even a split second.  It is an arbitrary plot device thrown in to try and generate some desperately needed suspense in an admittedly pretty lackluster screenplay.Which pretty much leaves us with the special effects.  Though adequate at times, many of the shots of Spider-Man swooping along the streets of New York City, his web suspended from the tops of skyscrapers, seem strangely unconvincing.  Perhaps since we feel no immediate involvement in the proceedings, the special effects sequences never manage to catch us up in the excitement of what they are showing us.  One keeps hoping and expecting to be carried away by the film, but it simply never happens.""Spider-Man"" simply does not rate the box office revenue it has earned."	2.0	not up to the level of other comic book films	2002-06-15	6	1	5
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1B3NP9BYLXX36	Ronald Bruce Meyer	"Why wasn't this film a cartoon?That's the question that nagged me as I watched Spider-Man. I'm beginning to believe that Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) is a narcotic in Hollywood (second only to the addiction of exporting film industry jobs to Canada). Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi (who did so well directing A Simple Plan in 1998), represents the worst of both worlds.As with all movies taken from comic books, this character created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for MARVEL comics - we are unpleasantly reminded of Marvel at the very first frame of the film - the story starts with the creation of our super-hero. A nerdy high school student (Tobey Maguire), with a passion for photography, is bitten by a genetically modified spider and gains spider-like abilities. These include great strength, agility, the ability to shoot webs from his wrists, and to kiss gorgeous babes while hanging upside-down. Well, maybe not that last one. As befits the super-hero tradition, his name begins with the same consonants (Peter Parker), and he is an orphan, brought up by kindly Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben Parker (a geezerlike and underutilized Cliff Robertson).The human story (screenplay by David ""Jurassic Park"" Koepp) is not so bad: Spidey, er, Peter, longs for the unattainable Mary Jane Watson (the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, who I last saw in Crazy/Beautiful in 2001), who longs to be an actress. Trouble is, she sees everybody but Peter because Peter won't ask her out. She only notices him when he becomes Spider-Man... most guys know how that goes. But there's trouble in Gotham City - er, sorry, wrong super-hero! - a soon-to-be-mad scientist (Willem Dafoe, who I last saw in Auto-Focus, 2002), faced with a funding cut-off, transforms himself into an evil alter ego known as the Green Goblin (repeated consonants again). GG doesn't seem to have much purpose aside from urban mayhem, and he can't even move his face, but he does put MJ (Dunst) in danger a couple of times, providing Spider-Man with the occasion to save her life, and to give her that memorable kiss (actually, looking at MJ's rain-soaked sweater was more memorable for me). It's all filmed in New York and LA, too! So far so good.Granted, these are super-heroes portrayed by human actors and real people can't do these things, but I was seriously put off by the CGI/animation of the hero-villain fights. I'm not opposed to a little digital tinkering with reality, but I think the overuse of these effects (the CGI credits list is as long as Spidey's web) reduced the human element to infinitesimal. The characters might as well have populated a cartoon: there was nothing remotely realistic about them, especially their apparent weightlessness. There was never a moment in Spider-Man when I wondered if I was looking at a CGI effect or if I was looking at human actors; it was all fake. For me, this destroyed the verisimilitude, my willing suspension of disbelief mired in a suspension of belief.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2WGQC991DXBEA	ronald koppinger	I really enjoy spiderman because this was pretty much the first hero about a Marvel character that Stan Lee actually got to be a part of and help direct and you can see it easily.if you compare this to the tv series of spiderman they did back in the day when the 2nd season got canceled, back then those old captain America and hero movies they never let Stan Lee help them at all and that's why you never hear about them now a days, there were horrible cause tv people added their own story to it which ruined it.This movie though you can see it like a comic book came to life in pictures it was awesome, it goes into the life about peter parker, his uncle, it shows how he first started learning about his powers and figuring them out, drawing a costume a few different ways till spider-man is the costume, all the scenes are just amazing, I guess that's why he's &#34;the amazing spider-man&#34; and the actor who played spider-man is the perfect spiderman, after seeing the new amazing spiderman I hated that movie compared to this one that other guy they have playing spiderman I hated he looks like darth vader.This was def the best spider man movie easy, and for being over 2 hours it is worth watching again, actually after every time you read a spider man comic book you should watch this movies, its that awesome. I really wish Stan Lee helped more in the Captain America movie or if Jack Kirby were alive and helped out in that I believe it would have been better then this and every other movie, to me anyway.	5.0	one of the best super hero movies ever	2014-02-28	1	1	0

It is funny, exciting, thrilling and (unfortunately) romantic. The only big negative I had was the gratuitous wet t-shirt shot. It just wasn't necessary, and given that this movie will draw a lot of kids it was actually quite tasteless. Outside the first wall climbing sequence which was pathetically bad (obvious wire work), the rest was excellent (albeit obvious CG).

I loved all the superhero comics.Spider-Man was introduced in the early 1960's, along with several other Marvel Super Hero comics.

They have their own emotional problems, and their own challenges in their personal lives.I anxiously awaited this first Spider-Man movie. I wondered how they could handle a character who's been a part of the comic scene for over 40 years. How could they appeal to ""comics veterans"" like myself, and to younger people who might be seeing Spider-Man for the first time?I just loved the movie. It reached me on so many levels. Yes, I loved the thrill of action. I loved Tobey Maguire as Spidey, Kirstin Dunce, as MJ...  All of the actors seemed just perfect for the parts they played.Yes, I can't say it enough.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"Peter Parker is a nerd barely accepted by the in crowd of his school, when he's bitten by a radioactive spider during a class trip.  Though he begins noticing changes immediately (whoa - I thought I was past that phase!!), he's too infatuated with the lovely Mary-Jane ""MJ"" Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to pay attention for long.  Soon he's planning on capitalizing on his new found post-puberty.  As Spider-fans know, Peter pays for his capitalist intentions, and learns the hard way how his new power brings new responsibilities.  Meanwhile, Norm Osborn, the embattled head of a high-tech defense contractor, goes slightly loony when subjecting himself to a chemical process designed to turn men into perfect killing machines.  Donning a mask and acquiring a split personality and an arsenal of high-tech, Osborn becomes the evil ""Green Goblin"".  As Peter remakes Spiderman into a crime-fighting hero, Osborn's Goblin eliminates his business rivals.  While not in disguise, Osborn is the somewhat off-center CEO and kind-hearted father of Peter's best friend - which fatefully brings him close enough to learn Parker's deepest secrets.  The movie works up to a climactic battle near Roosevelt Island where Peter must battle until their masks are stripped away.Though I haven't bought an issue of ""Spiderman"" this century, this fast-moving flick brought the whole experience back.  Though a lot of ""Spiderman"" draws on the comic series (and also turns up the fun for Sam Raimi fans), and much of the rest is generic comic book-turned big flashy movie fodder (hero must learn that much power brings loads of responsibility; the bad guy must destroy the hero, but not before trying to turn him to the dark side in the standard ""we've got a lot more in common than you think"" spiel) there's more than enough fun left over for the rest of us.  Sam Raimi keeps the action pumping, while never losing sight of his main characters.  The script surrounds Parker with characters that figured heavily in Parker's comic-art life - and even if you won't recognize Betty Brant or Robbie Robertson's characters, or think that ""Flash"" Thompson is just a school bully tossed in for Peter to get the better of, you at least get the sense that Raimi has something in mind for them.  Not to nit-pick, but it's also that unending sense of imminent surprise that grounds this flick - especially in the second half.  It's a problem because, Raimi touches aside (Bruce Campbell in a small but pivotal cameo; Raimi's trademark power-zoom camera-work; that Oldsmobile from ""Evil Dead"" and ""Army of Darkness"") the story is more faithful to the superhero formula than the original comic was.  Willem Dafoe is good as Osborn, but the character is not - once he's split, he's less than the sum of two parts (if Goblin is his own persona, what's the point of having him give pointers to Osborn?).  Though the original Spiderman relied on some detective smarts, the script here doesn't even attempt to put Parker on Osborn's trail (you'd think he would have seen a connection between Goblin and his murder of Osborn's business rivals).  But, like I said, there's more than enough fun here even for those who never picked up a copy of ""The Amazing Spiderman"".  This is obviously the same movie Raimi wanted to make about a decade ago, when he helmed ""Darkman"" (the last few minutes of each film are essentially the same) and it was well worth the wait."	4.0	He webs, he scores!!	2003-05-08	4	2	2

SPiderman has long been my favorite superhero, and this movie does good justice to the comic book.At first, I was skeptical to having Tobey Maguire play Peter Parker(Spiderman).  But after seeing the film, I have a little more respect for him, and comparing him to the comic photo shootin' action hero, I could definitely see the resemblance.  And on a side note, Mr. Jameson was ON PAR!As far as extra features, this DVD is packed.

Obviously, they had to show how Peter became Spiderman, but that doesn't have to take the whole movie, as we can clearly see. In fact, one of the things that really works here is that the origin of the hero and the origin of the villain are both developed as fast as they can and at the same time. The audience doesn't feel rushed at all in the process, and you may not even notice at first that the Goblin is created the very same night as Spiderman. Each wakes up a new man and then sets out to get to know their new abilities.Some of the Goblin's lines are hackneyed (""We'll meet again, Spiderman!"") but with Dafoe's delivery, you can see the theatrical megalomania as a natural part of the character. A few of the effects using CG characters could use a bit more polish to make them feel real, but they thankfully use real actors whenever realistically possible.On the whole, there are a few missteps here, but mainly on the technical aspect, which doesn't truly detract from the story. It is largely personal preference whether you prefer the first or the second in this series, but it's hard to say that this first outing was anything but a success."	4.0	Sling us a web, you're the spider man. - Weird Al	2008-06-03	0	0	0

The Green Goblin/Norman Osborne actually has some dimension to him.  In other super hero films, the bad guy often overshadows the good guy, but not so here.

Easily one of the best comic book films ever, spiderman is nothing short of a right place, right time film.. As we all know, 9-11 took place, and after that, people just needed something to get them happy, and spiderman just happend to be out at the time, so that helped its HUGE boxoffice turnout.  I love how film didnt show off all of what spiderman can do, which will make spiderman 2 even more kick ass.  I also love the fact the they didnt not really use universally known actors in the leading roles.  I think it makes it more real then say.. Daredevil, in which a HUGE bignamed star was the hero, a huge named actress was the leading lady, and a BIG actor in Micheal Duncun for the villien.  This movie was more realistic and more correct.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1ERDXS0QLEVKB	rzaster	"""Spider-Man"" is the second of three projected movies based on comic book characters from Marvel. This film is easily one of the best action movies that I've ever watched. The acting was phenomonal, the stunts great, the action superb, and the plot was outstanding. The plot of this film basically sets up Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man's life. It shows how he is not popular and is a geek in school and doesn't really fit in with the ""in"" crowd. It shows how he got bitten by the super spider and how his whole entire life was transformed from a high school kid into a crime fighting superhero. The main conflict in this film is between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin.This film is so monumental and had such a huge success at the box office because of the character of Spider-Man. Spider-Man has been around for about 40 years and this is the first live action screenplay featuring the loved superhero. Moviegoers and comic book readers can identify with Peter Parker because he is just an ordinary guy until he is bit by a spider. It is very easy to spot Peter's weaknesses and stengths and to compare them towards your own. Sam Raimi, the director of this film, succeeded so well in the production because he accurately portrayed Spider-Man, and all of the other characters for that matter, so well. Credit should also be given to the talented actors and actresses that starred in this movie. Those are the reasons for the huge success of this film.The portrayals of each character was done brilliantly because of great actors. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker and suits the role that he is playing very well. Kirsten Dunst made a name for herself in this film as she played Mary Jane Watson, Spider-Man's crush. Dunst, Maguire, and all of the other actors in this film deserve much credit as the film would have been no where as good as it is if these people weren't in it.The action sequences were done marvelously and these scenes helped make the movie what it is. The costume and makeup team did a fabulous job and they did a great job of bringing Spider-Man and everybody elses' costumes alive. Finally, the drama was great and in every scene you will be able to feel for the characters. What made this film so great was that it was very realistic and it seems like the events in this film actually happened.""Spider-Man"" is definitely the best film that I've seen all year and this now holds a place in the top ten of my favorite films. This film will not only be enjoyed by comic book readers but by kids and adults that have never read a Spidey comic before. This is defintiely worth seeing many, many times.

Not only is this better than ALL the Batman movies but it's the best Comic Book movie adaption ever! Toby Maguire is perfect as Spider-Man! He is totally believable in the role and he is one of the few comic book movie heroes that have depth. Kirsten Dunst is perfectly cast as Mary Jane and her fine acting also brings depth to her character. And Willem Dafoe, Wow! This is surely William Dafoe's BEST on screen role ever! His Green Goblin is the coolest villian ever! The rest of the cast is great as well! Sam Raimi again shows his suberb talent behind the camera and it all assembles together for the Perfect Summer Movie! I am surprised that everybody did not love this great movie!

I was very wrong. I'm not a comic buff, or a sci-fi/fantasy nut, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.Tobey Maguire plays the nerdy Peter Parker, who gets bitten by a spider, which in return transforms him into a superhuman being with superhuman powers.The special effects in this are quite stunning, and the acting performances help to maintain a poignant and dreamy atmosphere throughout. Kirsten Dunst is a complete doll as MJ, Peter/Spiderman's love interest, and Willem Dafoe is the menacing Green Goblin.I don't want this to be a long review, so I'm choosing to end it abruptly. If you want a dreamy, poignant, heartwarming film to watch (with all of those excellent special effects to spare), I highly recommend this.	5.0	Very pleasant and enjoyable!	2003-06-17	1	0	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2CLRVPNOGZEMH	samuraipenguin	After seeing the Spiderman motion picture for the first time (certainly not the last) I must say that I am impressed.  The casting of this film was perfect and offered a refreshing spin on the characters of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson especially.  The movie truly shines in its adaption of the origin story, capturing aspects of the tale that I honestly thought had no hope of getting screen time.  I was amazed at the way the origin story was pulled off and how it was added to.The character alteration of MJ was actually a mix of Peter Parker's girlfriends throughout the series.  The resulting character is excellent and we end up caring for MJ and her conflicts.  Thus it may be said that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were brilliant in this film.The one disappointing aspect of this film was the character of the Green Goblin.  Dafoe is not to blame for this flaw though.  As you may already have guessed, that rediculous looking costume and helmet did the character in.  Throughout the Goblin scenes I could not help but laugh at soem of the things that should have been dramatic.  If anything marred this film, it was the Goblin storyline and how poorly it was brought into the film.  It had potential, but that terrible costume and a rushed feel made the plotline a low point in the film.But when the film is good, its great.  Highlighted by a great romance plot (the real plot in my opinion), and a bevy of amazing webslinging scenes, the movie is highly entertaining.So in conclusion:THE DOWNSIDE:1.) the Green Goblin scenes  2.)A few tacky scenes that are meant to be dramatic, but end up looking rather ridiculous.  3.) Scenes with Uncle Ben kind of cause the mystery behind his character to dissolve...but it would not have worked without him (a little gray area, here) 4.) The ending seems rushed and is only slightly disappointingTHE UPSIDE:1.) Tobey Maguire in the best portrayal of Spiderman and especially Peter Parker I have seen.  2.) Kirsten Dunst as a very likeable MJ  3.) A very well adapted Origin story  4.) great action scenes  5.) J. Jonah Jameson is hilarious.  6.) When the comedy is good, it is charming and entertaining.  7.) The final scene, although slightly rushed, leaves you anticipating the next film in the series.All in all, this was a great movie and one that will draw a returned audience.  I know I'm planning to see it again tomorrow.  It may now be said that Spiderman is the film series to watch for.  As much as I love Batman, that particular series is awful.  Now Spidy should prepare to take his throne as king of superheroes.	4.0	An Excellent Adaption	2002-05-03	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A26WVK274IA7DN	Sarah Bellum	"For me, this is the best superhero movie yet (including ""Superman(1978),"" ""Spider-Man II"" and ""Batman Begins""). It is true to his origins, develops the characters well and it connects very well on a human level. While there is humor, it is not the corny ""action hero"" humor that plagued so many Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and other superhero movies such as the Batman movies. In fact, the Spider-Man comic books themselves always had a good deal of humor and this movie is consistent with that. Even though Sam Raimi had established himself as a director prior to making the Spider-Man films, he is the perfect choice for this because he understands the character and the nature of this comic so well. So rarely is a superhero movie made by a director who fundamentally understands its subject. In that sense, this movie is a dream come true for fans of this comic. Until ""Batman Begins,"" this was really the first superhero movie to accurately portray its character onscreen. As with the comic books, it makes the violence seem as though it really should hurt, yet our hero is practically unscathed. This seems counterintuitive, yet it makes the movie faithful to its comic hero source and ultimately more realistic. And then there is the love story, which is realistic because Mary Jane dates Harry Osborn, the good looking, wealthy jerk actually unworthy of her. True to life, she dates him for all the wrong reasons and unwisely stays with him despite common sense. She is the unattainable for Peter Parker, the intelligent, thoroughly decent kid who has the misfortune of being penniless and average looking. Once he attains his powers, he knows he will forever endanger those close to him. This turns his ostensible blessing into a curse. Not an enviable position because it affects those closest to him. The movie features excellent graphics and effects, very good acting, a terrific story and script, and just about everything one could want in a movie. The sum total is a film so entertaining and so good, even my wife left the theater proclaiming it her new favorite film. (While her regular viewing entails Bollywood films, her other favorite films include ""Titanic"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."") High praise indeed."	5.0	Highly appealing	2006-09-08	2	2	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A29UH0DCVXQ0VB	sarah lackey	This movie was awesome! The story followed the comic books very closely. I thought it was well made and had only two small problems with it. First off- Some of the computer generated effects (i.e., Peter jumping from building to building), were very cheesy. It looked pretty fake, and I wasn't impressed by a lot of the computer generated effects. Second- I know they're making two more SpiderMan movies, but c'mon, the ending was terrible! I won't give away any details, but lets say the ending wasn't what I expected. Don't be discouraged by this... the movie, the story was great and this film is surely worth it. Oh, the Green Goblin looked a bit funky, but that's what made him the bad guy, I guess.	3.0	Great Story, cheesy effects	2002-05-19	5	2	3

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1	"Savant11 ""Savant11"""	What can I possibly say but WOW!  This movie is truly a dream come true for a long time Spider-man fan like me. Not only was the movie made but the movie was made RIGHT!Many directors and artists in Hollywood claim to be fans of comic book heroes, but when it comes time for them to actually put it together they fail miserably. But not here. Sam Rami is a TRUE Spider-man fan-- and he did what a true fan would do. He stayed true to the source and to the material. He captured the essence of Spider-man and his history. He didn't decide to pretentiously add his own mark like Tim Burton did with the laughable Batman movie. Rami stayed true to the comic.  This is the Spider-man I read about month for the last 13 years.I really did not think that anyone could top the X-Men, but Rami has and I don't just mean because of the special effets.  I also mean in terms of the plot and character development. This is not a long drawn out  movie filled with pointless violence.  It is a well plotted story that moves effortlessly from point to point. Who would have thought that so much could be fit into two hours?  And the end, I won't give it away , but who on earth would have thought that it would have ended that way. Instead of going for the same old boring  cliche Hollywood ending--Rami tacks on an original one which hints towards the future.Tobey Maguire was not my first choice to play Peter Parker. But boy does he deliver! I understand that he worked hard to get this part and boy does it show! He plays Peter just the way he was portrayed in the book! Kristen Dunst also was excellent,I did not think that she could pull off the part of Mary Jane. She's a lovely girl but not the super-model that MJ is in the comic book. But I was pleasantly surprised with what was done with the character.After being disapointed with the unseeminly endless rubish that Hollywood has produced lately I am now, in the words of Mr. Stan Lee, a true believer. Thanks Sam Rami for not butchering a character I consider to be like a brother and restoring my faith that there are film makers out there who actually care about film making!	5.0	Amazing Spider-Man!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AX52ULYSK82AF	scifiman5	Not being a spiderman fan, i went into this movie expecting nothing more than 2 hours of entertainment -- what you expect from similar blockbusters. And yet, as I watched the movie from beginning to end, I was startled at how predictable and boring the plot was. (on a side note, what is with the Green Goblin's costume? Almost laughable!) And they could have done so much more with it! Tobey Maguire was Ok acting-wise, but certainly not great; Kirsten Dunst was equally mediocre; The Aunt and Uncle weren't too bad. Although, while watching it, it is interesting to note how many times the characters wear black gloves.  I am embarassed that the top five U.S. box office hits ever include Titanic, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and this movie. ... I am really surprised how much this movie has been praised - I thought (contrary to what I expected) that Episode II was more entertaining. ...However, there were a few redeeming aspects.  All in all, it is an enjoyable but not *special* movie.  The most disturbing thing is that there was so much potential to create a really stunning film, and what is delivered is instead adequate entertainment in the form of a summer blockbuster seemingly only concerned with making money.  Hopefully the sequels will be better.	3.0	Unfortunately, this movie did very little for me	2002-09-14	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	"2002 saw the start of the era of the comic book movie, one that was heavy on tight storylines, great special effects and cunning direction.  Spider-man fit that bill.  Marvel Comics prime superhero, his story is interesting, his facts everyone can relate to.Everything Peter is, Norman Osborn is too, except the Goblin is not a hero.  As the Goblin said, ""We are what we choose to be!""Norman's company is about to die a slow death.  He's not getting the military contracts he needs to keep the business going.  The board of directors is stonewalling him and demanding his resignation.  He must do something.Peter's life in high school is full of humiliation and fear.  He's not getting the respect he needs to keep his life going.  His ""friends"" are stonewalling him and demanding he get out of their way.  He must do something.Through the fate of a radioactive, genetically enhanced spider, Peter gets the power he needed to make some changes in his life.  Ah, what the Goblin would not do to possess such power.There is humor in the piece, but also a lot of raw human emotion.  If you have ever gone through teh grief process, you can relate to Aunt May and Peter's loss of Uncle Ben.  However, you can also relate to Harry Osborn's grief process with his father (not knowing Norman is the infamous goblin).Favorite scenes include the kissing scene, MJ's wet shirt, some funeral pathos, some New Yorkers getting angry, and Peter clueless about women.Sam Raimi put together a great story here, taking the basic elements of the original Marvel Comics tale and made some changes.  However, I still miss Gwen Stacy!The double-disc of the widescreen edition is really hot.  You have the film in Disc 1 and the usual scene selections.  In Disc 2, it's full of interviews, screen tests, special effects mysteries revealed and so on.  It's a cool package.A must-see.

Spiderman is the most impressive comic book turned to movie yet. I remember seeing Superman:the movie and in awe about how interesting it was. Christoper Reeve was Superman and I thought no one could have played him better. I feel the same way with Michael Keaton as Batman and now I can say the samething about Tobey Muguire.He stealed the show with his nerdish and cunning acts as Peter Parker Honestly I was never really was a Spiderman fan ,but I knew that there were comic books out that's really all I needed to know ,but the movie has changed my reasoning about Spiderman. I savered every second of that movie and hoped it would never end!!!Cheers for director Sam Raimi, who is known for his famous Evil Dead series (I've seen all of them at least a million times!)He has brought a lot of heart and compassion to this movie. When I realized last year he was making the movie, I said to myself he will make the diffinative Spiderman movie. Cheers for Kirsten Dunst as the girl next door, Mary Jane (M.J. for short). Cheers for William Dafoe who took this challenge and rose up to it.He was my favorite charactor throughout this movie!What a pro! Anyways go see Spiderman and have a good time...

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AIBRTGBN07D6A	Scott	"As an old fan of the comic book for 15 years, I was eagerly awaiting the release of this film.  Sam Raimi did not dissapoint and it has since become one of my favorite movies.  Not only is it one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of my favorite DVDs.  in typical Marvel style, this DVD is loaded with extra features that are just as entertaining as the film.The DVD features two excellent audio commentarys.  the first is by director Raimi, Producer Curtis, Actress Dunst, and producer Ziskin.  While a lot of DVD commentaries can get kind of confusing with 4 people talking, this commentary is actually split up, as Dunst and Ziskin recorded theirs at a seperate time than Raimi and Curtis.  The audio will switch back and forth between the two depending on who had the most interesting comment about a scene. I actually watched the film with the commentary immediately after watching the movie, something which I can never usually do because I get bored too easily.The second commentary is by the visual effects team.  I wasn't as entertained with this one but it is fairly interesting to hear their stories about what went on with the stunt work and some of the scenes.Two music videos are included, as well as HBO and E! ""Making-Of"" featurettes.  One of my favorite DVD extras are the screen tests with Toby Maguire and J.K. Simmons (JJ Jameson).  These are always a lot of fun to watch.  The DVD is further fleshed out by a short outttake reel and trailers.Then Marvel comes in, and includes all kinds of comic-book extras that explore the history of Spider-Man in the comics, Peter Parker's girlfriends, some common Spider-Man enemies, and an excellent comic book archive.Even with all of that, there are still features I haven't mentioned, like a ""Spider-Sense"" navigational feature that lets you click on an icon at certain points in the film. This brings up mini featurettes that explore things like how a production set was designed or an interview with the ""Spider-Wrangler.""This is a fantastic film, and an even better DVD that has just enough information and fatures for the most hard core Spider-Man fans.  For the price, it's definately an excellent buy."	5.0	Not only a great movie, but a great DVD	2004-01-23	3	2	1

The movie goes into great detail about the how's and why's of spiderman without letting it slow the story down.  The action scenes were seemless between computer animation and real footage.  Add in a love story and a story about a boy just trying to fit in.  Near Perfection.  Plus with all of the bonus material available on this DVD how could one pass it up.  This movie is also suitable for most children, there are very few curse words if any and some mild violence, which could make it too rough for very you children.  This is a wonderful movie that I must recomend.	5.0	Best Movie of 2002	2002-10-25	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A25FDODAR9GFRA	"S. Crudup ""Sid"""	Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire is definitely one of my all-time favorite superhero movies. I wasn't certain what to expect of the film, particularly being a huge Spider-Man fanatic as a kid who was hooked on the cartoon. This film pleasantly met all of my expectations as a Spider-Man fan and as a novelist and screenwriter. It is a wonderful story about young Peter Parker who is bitten by a high powered genetically enhanced spider, which transforms him from a nerd into the crime fighting, web spinning Spider-Man. The main storyline is accompanied by a touching subplot that involves the childhood love of Peter's heart, Mary Jane(MJ) played by Kirsten Dunst. As these two storylines interweave, Peter expresses his long overdue affection for MJ in dramatic fashion by springing to her rescue as the high flying superhero. As in all superhero stories, it would not be a good story without a formidable adversary. No one could have played the role of the &quot;Green Goblin&quot; better than Willem Dafoe, who gave an absolutely superb performance. This film pulls the viewer into a nail-biting conclusion as the Goblin and Spider-Man clash in the finale, bringing the audience to a breathtaking and satisfying climax. I recommend this feature to all Spider-Man fans and to those who enjoy a good story. Kudos!	5.0	Still My All Time Favorite Super Hero	2002-11-13	1	1	0

Then came X-Men(2000) which is also a great and one of my favorite movies but still wasn't quite as good as Batman but very close.  After watching this movie I have proven myself wrong.  Spider-man topped Batman.  The movie was nothing but excellent.  The acting was great and Tobey Maguire was perfect for the roll as Spider-man.  Special effects were phenominal.  Danny Elfman did great composing the musical score, just as he did in Batman and Beetlejuice.  I did not look away from the movie screen not once.  This movie kept me hooked from the moment the titles began until the ending credits.  I really don't think I have anything bad to say about.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2UGVZFKH8O5X4	Sean Parauka	This real-life comic book movie, Spiderman is outstandingly fantastic. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spiderman. Along with him was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, who Peter is desperately in love with. Willem Dafoe did great playing the evil villan, the Green Goblin. The movie is full of action-packed special effects, great action scenes and full of adventure.The movie starts out with Peter Parker (Maguire), a high school science nerd who everyone constantly picks on (even the bus driver). The first scene is Peter chasing his school bus down the street and the bus driver keeps going just to annoy him. On his fieldtrip with classmates to a science lab, a genetically altered spider that escaped from the lab comes down from a web and bites his hand while taking pictures. Now he goes home to get some rest. The next morning he wakes up and the first weird thing he notices is when he puts his glasses on he can't see. When he takes them off he can see perfectly (Remember: Spiders can't see with glasses). The next thing he notices is all of-a-sudden his body is ripped. He is suddenly very muscular like. Imagine that. The next weird thing that happens is when he chases his bus AGAIN, his hand touches the sign on the bus and it rips off with his hand. His hand is sticky (Spider's have sticky hands for gripping). It's pretty cool what happens at school with these powers. See what happens there. Now he leaves school in shock and starts to climb an alley wall with his bare hands like a Spider. Then he jumps over twenty feet building to building and then tests his web by flying with it over a gap of fifty feet. Cool! To put his powers to the test, he enrolls in a wrestling match against Macho Man Randy Savage. Will he win?Here is where the stuff hits the fan. Peter's friend Harry's father Norman Osborn is the founder os Oscorp, a science lab that invents weapons for the military. After a he does a experiment on himself to enhance human strength, it goes bad. He has an evil side now and he becomes the Green Goblin. He first blows up a test sight for some military hovercraft. Now at a huge fair that Oscorp sponsors he attacks everyone. He attempts to destroy a balcony full of people, including Harry and Mary Jane. Here comes Spiderman. The start to bash it out. Right now Spiderman wins and saves Mary Jane. Next, at the Daily Bugle where Peter works as a photographer, the Green Goblin comes and demands to know who takes the photos of Spiderman. Spiderman shows up and the Green Goblin makes Spiderman fall asleep with some kind of gas. Goblin offers Spiderman a truce to join forces and of course he turns it down.Now that Spiderman turned the offer down, the Goblin finds out who he is and goes after the people he loves. Here is the final bash. Goblin has Spiderman at his knees because on top of the Brooklyn bridge, Goblin holds Mary Jane over on edge of the bridge on one side. On the other side, he holds a wire that is connected to a transportation cab full of people. He drops both. NOW HERE GOES SPIDERMAN! Can he actually do both? Now I'll let you know Goblin is really angry that he lost. Now they finally have it out. First Goblin drops a small bomb next to Spiderman and cuts him badly and rips half his mask off. Now he has to use his Spider webs to pull a wall down on Goblin and it comes down to the last straw. To the DEATH! Punch after punch Spiderman attacks Goblin. Now, I'll let you see for yourself how Spiderman saves the day.I hope this review is very helpful to you. If you like Spiderman you have to see this real-life movie. Excellent Special Effects! Excellent Action Scenes! Also an EXCELLENT job by the actors. Especially Maguire and Dafoe. See how Spiderman went from being a nerd to a Superhero.	5.0	Climb Web-to-Web With Spiderman.	2003-05-12	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A8NQZ1E3IX7GM	SeriJoke	This is a very good movie. The story is good, the characters are solid, the fighting and effects are good and I liked it. They have a lot of talking in this movie as well. It isn't just some all out action movie with no words at al, which is common in superhero movies. I think this is the best superhero series there is. Overall, I'd say its even better than X-Men, which was another solid superhero series that I personally enjoyed. But enough of the good and in with the bad. The action sometimes looked fake, and they made it too obvious that the scenes where he is swinging on the webs are fake. Also, the Green Goblin costume wasn't very well designed, and looked like something more from Zoolander. But it was still a good movie. So if you like superheroes, or if you just want to see an unsually good action movie that has more to it than just plain action (such as love, friendships, and struggles for power) than this is the movie for you. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested. It is good.	4.0	Spidey's web is easy to be caught in	2005-07-10	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1SX6IMZFXFM6I	Servo	"DC comics has had it's days with the Superman & Batman movies. Now finally, Marvel brings out it's big guns with Spiderman. Oh sure, ""Xmen"" was a good effort. And so was ""Blade"" (with its sequel due in March). But Spidey is Marvel's golden boy. Like Superman & Batman, kids are BORN knowing who Spiderman is. It's going to be ""Batmania"" all over again. As an adult, I tend to be more cautious when it comes to movies like this one. When all you see is the eye-candy effects and no sight of a real story. I hope to Stan Lee that I'm wrong and we actually get a great plot as well as great effects & action. Probably won't, though. Spiderman will be a hit, regardless. With all of the factors the other reviewers mentioned such as the actors, director, & effects, it will definitely give Star Wars: Episode II some serious competition.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1849F9YYYURV1	Sexual Harrassment Panda	"I didn't expect to like Spider-Man at all when I saw it in theatres. I am not a big fan of superhero movies and knew nothing about the story or the comics. I prepared to be uninterested. Well, I prepared wrong. This movie was EXCELLENT, and it wasn't just another superhero movie with lots of action scenes. I really cared for the characters here and sympathised with all of them.I thought the motive for Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was very well done. I really hate sitting through the scene where Peter finds his uncle shot and realises that it was partly his fault. That must've been brutal. Tobey Maguire and Cliff Robertson are both excellent in that scene. The last scene is also heartbreaking to hear Peter have to say that to Mary Jane (I won't spoil here), it kind of pisses me off at the same time as being very sad.All of the performances here are great. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is a sight to behold. I didn't think Maguire could pull off a superhero, but he is amazing as both the nerdy Peter Parker and as the wall-crawling hero. I also loved Willem Dafoe. He is a great actor, and chooses very diverse and complex roles. Here he has to be scizophrenic, evil, leader of a successful business and a father. He mixes all these things up in some scenes and the outcome is one great performance. Kirsten Dunst is also stunning and makes her character more three-dimensional than I bet any other actress could. She was perfectly cast and I love her hair like that.There were some outstanding action sequences in Spider-Man, including the final battle between the Goblin and Spider-Man, which showcases some brilliant sound effects. The scenes at the parade and also on the bridge were intense, scary and unpredictable, and especially the one at the parade had me practically falling off my seat in tension.If there were things I didn't like about the film they would just be stupid little things. I don't like how the Goblin says ""Itsy bitsy Spider came up the water spout. Down came the Goblin and washed the Spider out!"" It is a lame, cheesy and unneeded line. The end really gets on my nerves but brings across the motto of the movie in a brilliant and heartbreaking fashion - so I wouldn't call it a flaw.Overall - a brilliant movie. If you don't like superhero flicks that's OK, because I don't and I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie. I now own the DVD and watch it often. This is more than a superhero movie, much much more, and I can't wait to see the sequel.--- DVD REVIEW ---I own this DVD as I mentioned up there and I really love it. The special features are a sight to behold, there are many that really inform you on the movie. Unlike most films, the DVD has a lot of information and featurettes on both discs, whereas with most movies there's usually two discs, one with the film and one with the features. But this movie is packed with lots of features to enjoy. I love watching gags and there is a short gag reel. There is a few documentaries on the casting choices in the movie. It was an excellently put together package that is most definitely worth your money!"	5.0	One of my favourite movies and DVDs of 2002.	2003-04-16	5	3	2

From the begining of the movie, you pity Peter Parker because he is treated like dirt and is bullied by the whole school bus (even the driver). After he is bitten he as a whole is changed including his body, his abilitys, and even his looks(no more glasses and even a more sophisticated look). This movie has it all action, adventure, and even a slight love story. Oh and also the most innovative kiss seen in movies.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1X9RJQ5IM4LGE	Shain Edge	I happen to love most of the comic based movies that come on screen. I liked spider man a lot. Tobey M. does a good job of being a 'nerd boy' who wakes up one morning being better at everything.There are a few details I didn't care for in the movie. Peter Parker is is supposed to be a genius. He is the one that stays up late at the lab and studies and researches when everyone else is asleep. In the movie, the most that his intelligence  is used when he mentions some trivia on spiders and mentioned to Norman Osborn that he understood the paper that Norman had written on Nanotechnology. (Originally he was bitten by a radioactive spider in the lab he was researching at.)The finger bristles used for climbing is ok. His climbing wasn't explained in detail by comics. But I HATED that he was shooting webs directly from his wrists. Origin is that he invented wrist mounted cartriges to go along with the rest of his spider abilities. If he was getting the DNA crossed with a spider, his wrists would not be the part of his anatomy spinning webs.The movie itself is fun to watch. It is just the little details that get me.	3.0	Great movie but off from origin.	2003-08-26	3	2	1

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A18IK6YI6T3RK2	Shannon Deason	I was not thrilled when i saw that Maguire had been picked to play Peter Parker..i can't stand him, usually..all simpering, weird looking, and bug eyed, but he's not bad in this film..still he looks nothing like Parker from the comics..Parker is brown eyed and much better looking in the comics, but i digress, anyway, this movie worked for me..Kirsten Dunst was ok as mary jane again she looks nothing like the hot Mary Jane from the comics, but as Maguire does not look like Parker it works, now i did like Dafoe as Green Goblin, he was perfect, though i do wish his mask had moved with his facial expressions..they could have done alot more with that...but his fight with Spiderman at the end is spectacular, as for Falco as Harry..yawn...If your a fan of Spiderman, you'll like it..if not well, maybe not, i just saw the third one..and id rate the films..Spiderman 2, the best..then Spiderman 3, then this film..i gave it four stars but it's really more like three and a half at the most.	4.0	SPIDERMAN	2007-05-06	0	0	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1OH14UR1AF78U	Shannon Symons	"I begged my husband to take me and the kids to see Spiderman for at least a week before he finally succumbed.  I was prepared to see an only slightly upgraded depiction of the old 70's version, but was completely knocked flat by what they'd done to Spidey's web-slinging character.  I mean, he REALLY slings webbing!  It's not a device attaced to his wrist that he fills with a web chemical.  It is one of the profoundly coolest effects offered by the movie.  All that from a genetically altered spider, eh?  Makes me want to visit a lab too.If you like heart-pounding action scenes, unrequited love, mystery, adventure and just a little touch of fantasy (like the fact that humans generally do not defy the law of physics and hang onto the side of a building with wee hairs on their fingertips) then this is the one you don't want to miss.  I actually made noise, a ""wow"" here and an ""oooh"" there.  It was great.  If I could talk my hubby into it, we'd go see the thing again!Tobey is not one of my all time favorite actors to be sure, and I really expected his nasal, whiney-butt voice (Pleasantville) to make Spidey seem more of a lad than a grown man, but he pulled it off.  Miraculously, he pulled it off and Spidey was a masculine character after all.Will be purchased on DVD when available FOR sure."	5.0	A movie for all ages	2002-06-04	3	3	0

This bright, energetic film stays true to the spirit of the comics. The story is easy to follow and is full of fun campy moments that will have you laughing, and on the edge of your seat with the action packed scenes that were ripped from a comic book. Fanboys may grumble that some things are modified (Organic webshooters, Mary Jane is in Gwen Stacy's place during the final battle) but these minor cosmetic changes only improve the story. Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as does the rest of the cast. (Fans of Raimi films should Look for Lucy Lawless and Bruce Campbell in hilarous cameo roles.)

Did it live up to the hype? My answer is a resounding yes. Was it better than Episode 2? No question.This may be considered a super hero movie, but what make's this film so good is it's more about Peter Parker and his feelings for Mary Jane than anything else. Of course there's lots of action and special effects, but it's the story that really shines and that's why the movie was seen by such a wide variety of age groups. The soundtrack is great too.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	It's hard to dislike a movie that made comic book adaptations cool to the general public again. X-Men raised interest, but it was Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film that really showed people what could be done, both in terms of narrative and special effects. So while I don't dislike the movie, and recognize its importance in opening the floodgates for other superhero flicks, it's still not one that particularly sticks out for me.I feel Spider-Man is too workman-like. It excels at putting all the pieces together, but it lacks the stylistic touches that Burton brought to Batman, or that Donner did with the old Superman films. The film gets everything right, from the origin story to the crush on Mary Jane. Some liberities were taken with the Goblin and his costume, but I felt they were acceptable for translating the character and getting his part of the story rolling. And yes, the web-slinging sequences are amazing. But mostly, the film just lacked character for me. It impresses because they got it right, but thats only in comparison to the dozens of superhero adaptations where everything was totally wrong. Once I got past the faithfulness to the source material, Raimi didn't seem to put his personal stamp on the film.There was also way too much of the romantic triangle for me. I think the stuff they had here could've been played out over 2 or even 3 movies, and it comes off feeling very rushed. Considering they rehashed it for the sequel, they really should've slowed things down here.In all, Spider-Man is a good film. It lacks a certain distinctive quality for me and isn't my prefered superhero film to watch, but I'm glad I own a copy of it. The dvd offers decent picture and sound, and some okay extras. Commentary is boring, and the documentaries focus more on the spider-man mythology than the film's production. Worth grabbing now, or wait till movie 3 is released next year and the en evitable box set.	4.0	It mostly does what a spider can	2006-07-04	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AAQ75C4BJUQLO	Sixto Limiac	"*Warning: Spoilers Abound*After sitting through this movie, mixed feelings kept flooding in me.  Needless to say, at 12:20 a.m. I decided to call it a night and crash out.  I drove home, crawled into my bed (not in a Spider-Man fashion, mind you), and I wondered, I pondered, and I wondered some more.  Was I fully content with the movie?  Was it as maddeningly irksome as Episode II?  But ultimately, what did the comic-to-film adaptation of Spider-Man warrant score-wise?  Unquestionably, it left an impact on me, confirming me to get off my kister, get all fired up, and subsequently ripen a review.  The initial rating would have maybe landed on a 2 or 3-Star rating at best, but as slumber began taking its toll on my eyes, I heard the exceptional musical score reemerge into my eardrums, I remembered those number of ridiculously amusing scenes instigating an outburst of guffaws throughout the audience, and when I began to visualize the incredibly nimble Spider-Man slinging throughout the golden Manhattan, my first impulse dramatically altered.  Despite its enjoyable instances, the flaws began to supplant the finest moments.  The Green Goblin's costume comes across an unworldly and outlandishly getup that'll probably never see a light in the distant future.  I'm not a big fan of Spider-Man comics, but for the sake of comic book quibbles I have to admit that Gwen Stacy should have been implemented in the film, because after all she was Parker's first love.  Was she not?  Moreover, Kristen Dunst just doesn't cut it, she doesn't portray the highly sophisticated Mary Jane Watson.  Although the scene where Parker is figuring out how to work his web-shooting was hilarious, why did Stan Lee and his gang give a thumbs up to revise the original method of Spider-Man using web cartridges?  I'm not too big of a fan of comics but when stories begin to get modified for the ""rules of Hollywood,"" I get infuriated.  However, in spite of  the cases that I categorize as flaws, they are all MINOR.  Most importantly, Spider-Man retains the tone of the pages where he originated.  The movie is not supposed to be dark and isn't.  It takes itself seriously when the situation calls for it, thus it closely correlates with the comics.  The day after Peter Parker was bitten by the genetically enhanced spider (by the way, it actually doesn't skitter away in the Spidey pages, it fell lifelessly to the ground after it sunk its incisors on Parker), was a excellent scene as Parker invests time to master his powers and simultaneously worsens his relationship with his Uncle Ben.  The wrestling match was just as brilliant, as Macho Man was ill-equipped for the totality of Spider-Man's fleetness and his chain of gut-wrenching kicks.  Full of sarcastic humor, ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-man,"" digs up all the glory for accomplishing an extraordinary adaptation on the big screen.  The movie stirred up excitement, engrossment, and overall kept me satisfied for spending serious dough on costly tickets.  Even though I thought a 3-Star rating would do the justice, my comic book fancy and sensibilities were bursting in elation, and I was finally decisive to give the wall-crawler the whole package.  That's right.  Forget that 4-Star rating at the top, this movie merits all of them!  It's not easy to pull of such a feat in which Spider-Man has pulled off, Marvel rips up the competition and I'm roaring in delight!  I was repulsed by the corny X-Men, I loathed all the Batman movies when Keaton retired as the Dark Knight, and lastly I absolutely detested the Superman Saga, but for the first time, I have fallen for a comic-book-flick that nearly meets all my expectations.  As for the sequel, I pray that it won`t revolve around the Legacy of the Green Goblin, but of Spider-Man's more sinister villains such as Venom, but for that to happen is next to impossible because of all the background story and not to mention a trip to the cosmos.  Maybe the return of the Goblin won't be so bad after all, but as history repeat itself, sequels frequently drop below the achievement repute of its predecessor, yet only time and the fortitude of those behind the future design of Spider-Man 2 will tell.  Let's all  hope it reaches Terminator 2 status, and not moldy Episode II baloney."	4.0	Was it as maddeningly irksome as Episode II?	2002-05-29	6	1	5
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	Spiderman is better than 3 stars but its not a 4 star movie. It starts well enough and Peter Parkers discovery of his new found powers is well done both in the School scenes and later in the wrestling/cage fight. The fight in the school is very well done and Parker's discovery of his new much faster reactions remains perhaps the highpoint of the film. Its in this section of the film that the director Sam Raimi's touch is most evident.However the film loses momentum and gets more and more predictable as it progresses and in the end was certainly too long. The leading actors did a fine job and the best thing in the film is Tobey Maquire, whose portrayal is spot-on. There are extras galore on disc 2 as well as commentaries on on disc 1. So it is certainly worth seeing (and at the Cinema it was very impressive) but it loses quite a lot on the small screen and I would only buy if cheap.	3.0	Flawed entertainment	2008-01-14	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1DUIWDZCNJIHA	"Slade Simon ""slade37"""	"When I see over 500 reviews on a title, I normally won't write one. However, I felt I needed to comment on a couple of items. I hope I don't repeat too much of what's already been said.First off, this is a great movie. I relate WAY too much to Peter Parker, and I'm reminded of many personal issues while watching the movie. Yes, the characters have some depth in this movie adaption as well as in the comics. J. K. Simmons is great as Jameson!!Only one Spider-Man trailer is on the DVD, and it's one I had never seen. It's not the trailer that showed Peter on the school trip taking photos of MJ. I think that one was the original trailer (not teaser) that was on the Spider-Man web site. The trailer on the DVD used the same music that was recently used in a Toyota Camry ad. The Spider-Man TV ads are also ones I had not seen. Not all of the promotional ads are included. The Cingular ad that used Spider-Man is here. Trailers for other movies are included: XXX, Men In Black II, Mr. Deeds. ...and a couple of others.I do feel the DVD menu could have been done better. It's not very clear which item is currently selected on the main menu. On the sub-menus, it's better except for items at the bottom that match the format of the main menu. You have to look for the little dots next to the item which will show it's selected. Nothing is highlighted, just those dots.The Pop-up Factoids are nice. They provide much background information about the movie and comics. Different graphics are used depending on which is being discussed. There is a black & white drawing based on the comics used as a border for anything related to the comics. Everything else uses a blue box with a color drawing of Spider-Man on one of the borders. There are a few typos like a ""w"" missing from the word ""wrestling"" on one. Proofreading could have been better, but it's not that bad. The typos mainly involved missing letters.There was one error that I found in the Factoids. Just after Aunt May mentions that everyone knows how Peter feels about Mary Jane, there are a few facts about the use of phone booths in comics. The BBC series, Dr. Who, used a police box, not a phone booth.Technical issues aside, Spider-Man is a great movie. Things that were changed for the movies can be debated, but I can understand the reasons for the changes. Green Goblin's suit was changed because it was the suit worn for the glider which was for a military contract. It needed to look like armor, not the original purple and green fabric. The glider suit didn't seem to include any helmet in the earlier shots. Although it wasn't as obvious, the Goblin wore a mask in the comic too. The idea of the mask becoming more of a helmet for the armour makes sense.It would have been nice to see the comic book version of everything, but I'm not totally against the updates. (I'm only familiar with the older comics - mainly reprints of the original ones from the 1960s.) Some details need to be changed because of the times. The public attitude toward radiation isn't the same as it was in the early '60s when the movies would show us all kinds of monsters and mutations created by it. Today, genetic engineering makes more sense.This is a great movie for fans, and the human issues make it more than simply a comic book movie. I would recommend the movie highly to fans and non-fans.Trivia: Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) also appeared in the Batman TV series as the villian, Shame."	5.0	Some Extra Comments	2002-11-07	0	0	0

It still feels like I dreamt that they made this movie so good! The casting was great. I'm so glad they didn't throw in the latest teen whose hot at the time to help sell the movie. Tobey Maguire is very believable and gives a powerful performance as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. Spidey's suit for the most part is unchanged, thank god, and didn't go the Batman movie route! Dafoe is excellent as the Green Goblin. Both halves of the movie-the origin and the scenes as Spider-Man are very exciting and are given equal time. The origin allows enough time for Peter to discover his powers and to see how he deals with them. One of the complaints I had is that Spidey's webs are natural and do not come out of web shooters designed like in the comic. This should only be Venom's ability. I also wish they would have stuck with the goblin's original outfit and not the mecha version he has in the film. If it was good enough for its' readers through 40 yrs, it should be good enough for now! Dafoe would have looked dead-on like the goblin with the green mask and pointy ears! I thought that's why he was hired! The action scenes were incredible. As in the trailers, the swinging through the city scenes are amazing and are worth the price of admission along with the aerial battles with Spidey and the Goblin on his glider! I honestly wasn't expecting the fights to be so good! Some fights were almost too brutal, but awesome. Spoiler: When I saw Spidey dodge flying razor pumpkin bombs, and later have his mask blown apart, I knew this movie had already outdone itself! Spidey's signature moves and classic flagpole acrobatics from the cartoon are all there! I also saw Ebert's review and was expecting thumbs up! He complained that the CGI action sequences looked too fake, when he gives Iron Monkey(great film) thumbs up even though the wires are clearly visible! X-Men was great, this blows it away! I would have liked to have seen those characters in their comic costumes, especially Wolverine. But the makers felt it looked too ridiculous. This movie had the costumes, and proved that it could work! The reason I went to see this movie is because I knew that Sam Raimi was behind it and he exceeded my expectations! This movie would have made money no matter what, because it's Spider-Man. Heck, Jason X is making money! The reason Raimi's version of Spider-Man is making so much money is because it's actually GOOD! Face it folks,Hollywood doesn't usually make films like Raimi's Spider-Man.

My son didn't even touch his candy or popcorn through the whole show!(all you mothers recognize this is rare). I took him to this film three (3) times, and every time he was wide-eyed, and amazed. The graphics and special effects in this film were definately very well done. The story line followed the original story and tastefully depicted a real superhero that I am glad my 3-year-old looks up to.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2TE0G5V0IGC0Z	Spencer White	"Spider Man is a 5 star flick directed by Sam Raimi based on the first Spider Man comic story from Marvel.  In the movie, Peter Parker,(Toby Maguire, Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules)the spectacle-wearing newspaper geek at his local Queens high school who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, takes a field trip with his class and best friend, Harry Osborn,(James Franco) the son of Mr. Osborn(Willem Dafoe)the owner of Oscorp, to the museum.  While there, he is bitten by a genetically advanced super spider.  When he wakes up, he discovers he doesn't need the use of his goofy glasses and his body looks like its about to break out of his skin.Mr. Osborne, meanwhile, discovers his own powers when he takes a company performance enhancer and his strength increases almost 800%.  Unfortunatly, it also turns him into an occasional psycotic killer named the Green Goblin.  Not a great trade, huh?Getting back to the good guy, Peter later discovers other incredible abilities, like being able to jump across buildings and the famous web shooting trick.  When he decides to use his powers to buy a car to impress his crush(Kirsten Dunst, Bring it On)his plan backfires and leads him to discover the true meaning of a quote from his uncle, ""With great power, comes great responsibility.""This movie is everything I impatiently waited for 3 months to see.  The casting is superb, with Dafoe doing an especially good job in a scene where he has a conversation with his two personalities.  Toby Maguire put aside all doubts in my mind about Raimi's choice for casting him as Peter Parker/Spider Man.  Kirsten Dunst also does a great job, showing the audience a depth which before now has not been shown in her characters.The ending is a nice twist, leaving me hungry for the sequel which will surely come.  The special effects were good enough to be liked, but may have been overused.  Same deal with the fighting.  But overall, Spider Man should get an Oscar nod or two, especially for Dafoe.

And don't worry that you don't know anything about Spider-Man, you don't need to.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3T0V4GMC23P7K	"""spideyy"""	"I wrote a review of X-Men two years ago, and said that I hoped that they did not screw up the Spider-Man movie, because he is my favorite comicbook character.  Well let me say one thing.THEY DIDN'T!  This was the greatest comicbook movie ever.  Step aside Superman, Batman, and X-Men.  There is a new hero in town, and he's kickin' some major rear-end.  I've seen this six times so far, and so far it hasn't gotten boring.  They started right by getting Sam Raimi to direct.  When I heard that I knew it would be good, but then I heard DiCaprio's name being thrown out to play Peter Parker, and I was scared.  Luckily they came to their senses, and cast Tobey Maguire, who did a fabulous job.  He was Peter Parker.  Then I heard there would be no Doc Ock, instead Norman Osbourne, The Green Goblin.  At first I heard John Malkovich would play this part, which would have been interesting, but I think they picked correctly when they chose Willem Defoe.  He was creepy as Norman Osbourne.  Kirsten Dunst was great as Mary Jane, but I think Julia Stiles may have been better, I just think she's a better actress.  But Kirsten did a great job.  The story was fantastic.  There was action, comedy, sadness, and even a love story for the ladies.  So it touched all your emotions.  And a two hour movie in an age where a movie that lasts an hour and forty minutes is long, was great.More bang for your buck, and it didn't drag.  They stayed pretty true to the comic, not exactly but who cares, it was still the best big studio movie I've seen in a while.  If you haven't seen it, What the HECK are you waiting for?  The DVD?  You gotta see this one in the theater.  Get out of your house and go see it ya net-nerd. Jeez, what's wrong with you?  There's something other to do than screw around on your computer all day!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2LICSQ2IFE3C5	"SPM ""scott_maykrantz"""	I can't stand this movie. Why? Let me count the ways. (1) First and foremost, Peter Parker's love for Mary Jane comes up WAY too many times. He tells us at the beginning that he loves her. Then he says it again. Then he shows it in his actions. Then Aunt May mentions it. Then Harry Osborn mentions it. Okay, okay. We GET it. One time would have been enough. (2) Why cover up Willem Dafoe's face? Once he has the mask on, it could be anyone under there. And he has a good face for the Green Goblin. (3) The special effects are bad half the time. Yes, that's a CGI Spiderman beating up bad guys in the alley. It's obvious. (4) Macy Gray? Why? (5) Mary Jane's protuberances in the rain are, let's say, out of place. But they ARE memorable.There are a few good things. It's not all bad. (1) The casting is good. Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker. Even Aunt May is well-cast. (2) Randy Macho-Man Savage makes a cameo. Right on! (3) The organic webshooters are a good idea, so is the sequence in which Peter Parker explores his new powers. (4) Finally, the plot sort of made sense, which is rare for superhero movies. This is a solid two-star movie. I didn't want my money back, but I never want to see it again. Hopefully the sequel will have better effects and less love story repetition.	2.0	An unsatisying blockbuster	2003-12-09	8	4	4

And event like that happened to me; I can't get my eyes of the  movie.  The same thing will probably happen to you, too.Though appearing to be cool and breathtaking at first sight, Spidey (Tobey Maguire) didn't start that way.  As a regular guy, Peter Parker has lived an ordinary life, until now . . .  While visiting a laboratory, Peter is bitten by a genetically mutated spider - and now, he gains super powers as well as the amazing abilities of the spider, transforming him into the web-swinging hero that we all know a love.Spider-Man - now that is a word we all know.  We've seen his cartoons, and we've all heard about or read his comics.  And with this Hollywood adaptation of the classic comic book, we can see Spidey in real action, as well as relive the story.  Though not 100% accurate, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; follows the storyline carefully and faithfully.Recommended to action and movie fans everywhere.	5.0	Spidey's web is upon us . . .	2003-03-04	2	1	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A30A5I8FG82M2E	SpookyChick	Willem Dafoe, oh, he was perfectly cast as the Green Goblin.  He gets the job done, better than any comic book movie villian ever has.  Tobey Maguire as Spidey?  Well, I've see far studlier action heroes but he is pretty good.  Ladies, I'm sure you'll agree with me when I say he sure looked buff once that little arachnid sunk it's teeth in!  I like Tobey as Peter Parker a lot, but they could have had two people play the role (it's been done before and would have worked here): one as Peter Parker, and another actor as Spiderman.  He's too old for it, but fifteen years ago Arnold would have been ideal.The special effects were absolutely thrilling.  Everything looked great with the vital exception of Spiderman himself.  In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that Spidey looks like a cartoon character swinging around.  They should have used a real person.The DVD looks and sounds totally acceptable.  I have no use for the second disc, as I see no point in watching what are essentially advertisements for a movie that I already own.  Yes, there seems to be lots of stuff on the second disc, but what's the point?Recommended for both girls and boys under 16.	4.0	Totally awesome, even with many problems	2003-04-16	4	2	2

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1GTGH4Z1M77BU	"""stardurst"""	Much as I was excited to see spiderman, having enjoyed the comics and cartoon series, I am sorely disappointed with the film. It was not the plot that was bad, in fact, it stayed pretty accurate, but the really lousy dialogue that accompanied it. If I can spend more than half a movie cringing at cheesy lines and not enjoy the cringing, it probably wasn't a good movie. I mean, cheesiness can be fun and memorable and oftentimes so quotable, but this was quite painful. The hospital declaration of love scene made me look at my friend and ask when the movie was ending. Perhaps the redeeming quality was the action sequences, I did love how Peter Parker flew across the buidings, unfortunately, sometimes, I felt that the special effects seemed choppy and stilted, as compared to the other scenes. Perhaps this is intentional, but I thought it made the film more disjointed. And much as I do enjoy fight scenes, while Spiderman's showdown with the Green Goblin was exciting and all, I felt that is wasn't very tastefully done. But kudos to William Defoe for being such an outstanding brillant. His portrayal of the Green Goblin was exactly how I envisioned it to be. Mary Jane, however, was badly cast. Kirsten Dunst is quite a lousy actress and the red hair is just awful on her! Her acting seems contrived at times and I don't think she brings out the character of Mary Jane at all! Perhaps another young actress, like Claire Danes would make a better Mary Jane. Now, to our title character - Spiderman. When I first found out that Tobey Maguire was playing Spiderman, I thought it was again, another bad choice, but now, in restrospect, I think he did a marvelous job. He captures the innocence, nerdiness of Spiderman so well, and plays our down to earth hero with much aplomb. Despite the awful awful dialogue that plagued the entire film, he managed to deliver his lines as credibly as he possibly could. Overall, despite having a pretty good plot and a believable Spiderman and villian, the film was marred by the less than stellar supporting cast, bad bad script, and not ILM standard special effects.	1.0	Overhyped...	2002-05-17	12	6	6

One must remember he is not a Clark Kent or a Bruce Wayne,or even a Scot Summers. He is the must human out of al the super heros. Defoe was all very good as the Green Goblin. Kirsten was good as well (believe me I had my doubts). But J. Johna Jamson was perfect!!! He was my favorite partof the movie. The action was simply jaw droping. In the fair scene, when you see Norman on the glider in the distance I felt like I was emersed in Steve Ditko and Stan Lee's world.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AZCDCO6KK2T81	"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan"""	"I have to admit that I was not one of the legion of fans that was blown away by this film even though it was based on my all-time favorite comic-book hero, but I did see lots of potential for this latest comic-book to film series and history has proven me right there as I am writing this review after its first two sequels have come out.  Yeah, I know, I'm cheating a bit here and Monday morning quarterbacking.The film is cast well, overall, especially Peter Parker's aunt and uncle played by Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, and MJ is played with surprisingly pleasing spunk and charm by Kirsten Dunst who can normally be ""distant"" in whatever role she plays.  All other supporting cast members are equally good and memorable; however, the main stars Tobey Maguire as Spidey/Parker and Willem Defoe as The Green Goblin are a little problematic.Tobey is perfect as Peter Parker, a young nerdy kid with a crush on the school's popular girl.  He is also very convincing during the sequences in which he is discovering his new-found abilities.  It is in the voice-overs of the CGI Spider-Man that we run into problems.  For me, he just wasn't convincing as he was often monotone.  That nasal quality he has when he speaks works well as Peter Parker, but as Spider-Man, he lacks the punch of a hero in his voice and his sense of comic-timing, a Spider-Man trademark, seems way off.In addition to the problems with Maguire as Spider-Man, I am even more dismayed by Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin.  I just couldn't accept him in his ""normal"" role as a world leading scientist.  He seems too much like a lunatic from the get-go and although he eventually becomes a wonderfully sinister Goblin, with the perfect voice for the role, he is a bit over-the-top in that part of his role as well.  He's like the Incredible Hulk on steriods.  It was absolutely laughable in a few segments where I don't think it was intended.As with all ""introduction"" episodes of a new comic-book transfer to the silver screen, the exposition of the film is long-winded and it takes quite some time to get the story rolling, but when it does, it is a compelling, and at times, moving plot, especially when it focuses on Parker's various relationships.  I give Sam Rami, the director, and his writers kudos for that balancing act.Speaking of balancing acts, the effects are way over-the-top in that the CGI effects simply move too fast for the human eye to keep up with and when they do slow down, you can clearly notice that it is all CGI, and that really annoys me.  I would like to see more actual stunt work, a la Superman and Batman, than a ""virtual"" Spider-Man.  They need to seriously work on that aspect of this series.Okay, Steve, then why 3 1/2 stars for this film where you have so much negative to say.  Well, it has a lot to do with being glad that Spidey finally made it to the silver screen.  I grew up on this comic-book and seeing him on the screen just brings a smile to my face in spite of whatever flaws may be present.  Some of the casting might be flawed, but they are good overall and Tobey Maguire may grown into the role as time marches on.  The film is fun to watch as any comic-book to film should be, and the effects are good enough to sustain the film although they need to work on the realism factor.  As my headlines read, this new series has promise."	3.0	3 1/2 Stars for this Promising New Comic-Adaptation	2007-05-07	3	1	2

And in the end, the effects don't look as real as they should (nor give us anything we didn't see in the trailers).  Fortunately, ""Spider-Man"" is saved from being just another big-budget Hollywood blowout by the guileless performance of Tobey Maguire and the lightly humorous touch of Sam Raimi and his writers.  A darker tone and a more complex story might have made this more interesting, but they can wait for any one of the numerous sequels which are undoubtedly well on their way.  It isn't a great film, but it's an entertaining start to what should be a highly entertaining franchise."	3.0	The start of something better	2002-12-12	2	1	1

Soon he is isolated from his family and friend Harry Osborn with a shocking result. Harry's father Norman has a company on the verge of losing a giant government contract to create a super-soldier.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2M1MNG7G40V85	Surface to Air Missle	PROS- Entertaining comic book adaptation with excellent action sequences sure to provide some visceral enjoyment.

There are some other strong performances as well and Dafoe is excellent as the over the top Green Goblin (his sufboard is cool!)  The old man who plays Gramps brought a tear to my eye!  Raimi does a good job of giving the comic book aura to the movie and props to him for staying real to the comic book.CONS- the movie can be a bit uneven at time and keeps going for about 15 minutes too long.  The final funeral scene was sooooo painfull.  Unfortunately Franco comes from the Hayden Christensen school of acting.Bottom Line:  you have been living in a cave if you don't know what to expect with this one.	3.0	Does whatever a spider can........	2003-06-30	3	1	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A266S48N5Y6BU5	"""swingoutsisterguy"""	This was an excellent adaptation of one the best super heros from the comics. I thought that Tobey McGuire was a great choice. He played the nerd turned hero with style (however a little stiff as the nerd). Kirsten Dunst was good-she had a better turning in Dracula. However Willam DeFoe was superb. He played the super rich scientist, turned villian/split personality with a style matched only by Jack Nicholson in Batman. The minor players such as J. Jonah Jamison, Aunt Mae and DeFoe's son were okay.The story was fairly true to the original story. The only difference is that this Spiderman can shoot webs from his skin (wrist) and not man made cartridges. I like the idea of shooting webs from his skin more fessible than the latter way.The only problem I had with the whole thing is that, it relied on computer generated effects (for Spidey) too much. Most of his acrobatics were too unnatural for human movement. &lt;You lose the sense of humanity when you rely on the computer more than stunt players. I would have rather seen a stunt man in the costume than a computer effect.> The reality of the story is to believe that a human has spider like strength, stamina and heightened senses.But I do tell people this movie is worth the overprice of tickets.

Spiderman rocked the socks off of movie goers everywhere. It was everything it should have been and more. I couldn't have been happier with the product released in theatres that great summer ago. Now to the real meat of this review, the DVD release.Could this DVD have been any more rushed?1)Navigating the on screen menu is VERY hard when your guide is a tiny red dot you can barely even notice.2) Features that were already shown on TV to do nothing but promote the film do not count as features taking you &quot;inside&quot; the making of the film.3)While it may appear that there are alot of features they are very short and you will go through them so fast you'll wonder what the big hype was about.After viewing this DVD I feel my spider senses going off, just as with the X-Men DVD I feel they are secretly planning a bigger and better release in the future. So proceed with caution, I on the other hand am content with just owning the movie.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2KXNBKMXOAOQY	Synchrotone	Wow. That sums it up. Just wow. I've been a Spider-Man fan for years and this movie just blew me out of the water. The special effects were amazing. The scenes where Spidey was swinging through the city were intense, exactly how it should be. The movie was casted perfectly . . . Tobey Maguire was the prefect Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst the perfect MJ, Willem Defoe the perfect Green Goblin. The movie captured the Spider-Man essense a lot better than I think anybody thought it would. Yes, some things were changed, for example it was a genetically altered spider instead of a radioactive spider that bites Peter Parker, but all the changes were made to keep up with the times. I saw the Spider-Man first day, having to scramble for late night tickets after all the earlier shows were sold out. The atmosphere was great, first day, everybody excited about the movie, and it lived up to the hype. The movie had something for everybody, since it wasn't an full-blown action movie, neither was it an all-out drama. Many of the scenes are hilarious because they're supposed to be funny and other scenes just got me laughing because I was giddy with excitement. Without giving away too much, I like how the movie focused a lot on Peter Parker's life and not just the Spider-Man side of the story. It tells the story of how an ordinary person, Peter Parker, nerd and school paper photographer, becomes thrusted into extraordinary circumstances. The story almost becomes believable and with the incredible special effects it makes the movie the best adventure escapist film ever. Walking out of the theater I felt how Peter Parker felt and I wanted to be Spider-Man. There was one thing that struck me as wrong, however. The Green Goblin's suit. I know I just finished saying how the story had been tweeked to correspond with modern day life, and I guess the Goblin's techno suit is one of those tweekings, but I didn't like it. I think they should've kept the original mask, costume and cape of the original Green Goblin. But never mind my haggling, just go see the movie, it's definitely worth your money. Add your eight bucks to the [money] it made first weekend (that's a record you know).Just go see Spider-Man. Now.	5.0	Incredible . . . just, wow	2002-05-05	2	2	0

Bembenek ""yankee drummer"""	As a person who grew up during the era when comic books served as a primary media for entertainment nourished by the weekly Saturday serial and matinee, I am drawn to the tales of the legendary superheos. The Phantom, the Shadow, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman have all been transferred from the pen and ink print to the &quot;silver screen&quot;. Spider-Man is not quite as seasoned in the superhero folklore genre, but it has been a fascinating tale about an interesting character that I've followed along with my children over the years.The Superman and Batman series had some great character portrayals and exciting special effects... but nothing like we have been given in Spider-Man. This is a superhero that I had always believed would be impossible to portray in &quot;real&quot; life. The abilities possessed by the &quot;Webslinger&quot; seemed as though they would be impossible to recreate by someone in the &quot;flesh&quot;.Well, color me super surprised and totally flabbergasted. This talented group of people have done a superb job of replicating the &quot;action&quot; from the Stan Lee character. Tobey Maguire is a very believable Peter Parker and a super Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is superb in developing his character as always. Kirsten Dunst captures the charm and beauty of M J, and J.K Simmons is great as the cynical J J Jameson.BUT!! The real credit for the stupendous success of this superhero character portrayal goes to the people behind the scenes that have created a masterpiece of fantasy that transcends reality. The antics of the Green Goblin on his &quot;flying surfboard&quot; and spidey's acrobatics and swinging through the city streets on web strands attached to skyscrapers are mindboggling.This is truly one of the most exciting and entertaining films of this decade. I have watched Spider-Man several times and each time discover something new and amazing that previously escaped my scrutiny.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2CCJ3O5Z0LURQ	"""tequilajake"""	That's the bottom line ... Spider-Man is the best of all the super-hero movies to have come out.  One of the key reasons is the writers did not spend way too much time on the hero's origin.  This is the downfall of the first movie of any character.  They hit the key elements -- bit by a spider, realizes his powers, his inaction results in a dire consequence (no spoiler here), and he goes on to become Spider-Man.  Peter Parker's enchantment with Mary Jane Watson is handled well -- the teen-age angst with the beautiful girl and rivals who are bigger, stronger, and richer.  All of the plot points come to a head and are resolved through the film.  Spider-Man is not my favorite super-hero but this is definitely the best film.	5.0	The Best of the Super-Hero Flicks	2002-12-02	0	0	0

The story follows a young man named Peter Parker. He's a brilliant young man, but is picked on and considered a 'geek' at school. He strives for the attention of the girl he has loved since 'before he even liked girls' (as he said in the film), Mary Jane Watson. On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and the results are history. The next morning he finds that he has amazing powers. He can leap higher than a normal man, he has incredible strength, he can climb walls like a spider, he can spin webs from his wrists, he has amazing reflexes, amazing speed and balance, and a 'spider sense' that warns him of danger before it happens. At first he uses his powers to achieve his own personal gain, but when tragedy strikes he learns that with great power must come great responsibility, and he decides to use his powers to help people. But soon, his best friend's dad, Norman Osborne, preforms an experiment on himself that increases his strength but drives him to insanity. He becomes the Green Goblin and now Spider-Man's vow to help people is put to the ultimate test.This film is truly incredible from the opening credits to the ending credits. Both kids and adults will love this film. The special effects are...amazing, I couldn't even tell what was real and what wasn't in terms of CGI.

I had high hopes on it, but the film just didn't seem to mesh well. It would take a light tone but then at the end it takes such a dark turn which doesn't make the film work well with the different drastic tones in one film.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2DFQHQ6FLD6V2	The Freak That Likes Metal	"Nerdish Peter Parker [Tobey Maguire]is bitten by a radioactive super-spider on a trip to a spider museum or something like that. This gives him all the powers of the spider, including being able to shoot webs, jump from building to building and the power of Spidey Sense.Norman Osborn [Willem Dafoe], a businessman at the head of a company, wants to test the same genetically enhanced spider on himself. It ends up turning him into the Green Goblin.That's sort of the plot for the movie ""Spider-Man"". It is based off of the comic book ""Amazing Spider-Man"".Given how the Superman and Batman franchises had their movie debuts in the 80s, it's kind of amazing how the Spider Man comic book held off making a movie for this long.But you don't care about all that stuff. You care about... Was this movie good? And the answer to that is yes. Tobey Maguire was not any fan's choice to be Peter Parker/Spider-Man, I don't think, as a lot of people have complained about him playing Parker.He did a fine job, however, as did the rest of the cast. I don't see what all the complaining is about.The action scenes leave a little to be desired. Although the fight scenes are less dark than ""Batman Begins"" or something like that, they are just okay.The movie stays true to the comic book for the most part, but the movie is too long for its own good and some parts are pretty boring.That being said, I still think this was pretty good. I have yet to see ""Spider Man 2"" so I don't know how that squares up to this movie, but if it is better, it will definitely deserve 5 stars.I will ultimately give it a 4.5/5.PROS: Good acting, stays true to the comic book, Okay action scenes.CONS: Just okay action scenes, a bit long."	4.0	A Very Good Comic Book Movie	2006-08-03	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2ICYTQK3ZCX0Z	The Great Rocky Hill	"I was afraid to see this movie. I was afraid that I'd be disappointed,afraid that this would be a farce or a live-action cartoon with no human interest and that it would kill everyone's perception of everything that the comic book medium could be.I wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst being in the movie. I was concerned when I heard they were making Spidey's webbing organic and threw out the web-shooter idea. I became dismayed when I read that Roger Ebert only gave it 2 1/2 stars and at this point,almost had to be coaxed into seeing the film.You see,I'm a lifelong comics fan and Spider-Man is my all-time favorite comic book hero.I have grown-up with him. Peter Parker looks like me,and I've always felt that I was him. He was the first comics character I felt I could relate to. The comics have had their ups and downs creatively throught the years,but all in all,I've remained loyal to 'ol Webhead(J.Michael Straczynski and John Romita Jr. are really working wonders with the character these days) I almost thought we were going to see ""Spider-Teen"" or ""Spider-Dude"". I was afraid to see this movie.Boy, were Ebert and I dead wrong! There were minor problems with it,I felt,but overall,""Spider-Man"" was everything I had hoped it would be:the best darn comic book movie ever made. Roger Ebert felt that the action sequences were fake-looking and said that ""Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon"" handled this type of superhumanity more effectively.I felt ""Spider-Man"" captured Spidey's actions perfectly. In the movie,Spider-Man and the Green Goblin have the fluidity in their movements that reminds one of the Lee/Ditko Spider-Man era. Spidey fights like he does in the comics(throwing guys around,double-punches,etc.)and the Green Goblin is as sinister, dangerous,and cunning as a large predator on the loose. The fight scenes are choreographed well,evoking the fantastic and the brutal all at once. Any comics fan will be reminded of the immortal ""Death Of Gwen Stacy"" storyline during the chilling,final confrontation between hero and villain.New York becomes a character in its own right. Watching the film,you really get the impression that Spidey owns the Big Apple.The city is like an old,familiar friend to him as he effortlessly swings from rooftop to rooftop,looking for vermin that would soil or irritate NYC and the good people who live there(the scene where all of the citizens start pelting the Goblin with debris and such almost brought a tear to my eye). ""Spider-Man"" is as much a tribute to New York and its residents as well as the comic book form and Spidey himself.I had been pulling for Freddie Prinze Jr. to get the role as Peter Parker,but Tobey Maguire's performance made me forget about all of that. Maguire evokes Parker's quiet,shy,sensitive personality perhaps better than any other actor out there and balances it masterfully with cocky,devil-may-care attitude of Parker's alter ego. Now, I can't imagine anyone else playing Parker other than Maguire.The same can be said for Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. I originally thought that she would have made a better Gwen Stacy(Parker's first true love in the comics). After seeing her as Watson,I became convinced that she was the correct choice. Dunst really tapped into the fun-loving,starry-eyed yet troubled working-class girl that MJ has always been. MJ's a flirt and a dreamer,and Dunst made her come to life(I wish she would have said the line ""Face it tiger,you just hit the jackpot!"" like she did in the comics,but oh well).I jumped for joy when Willem Defoe was pegged to play the Green Goblin,and Defoe doesn't disappoint. I was hoping that the filmmakers would build the costume and mask around Defoe's chisled visage(just look at that face,he is the Goblin! I love it!),however they opt for a ""body-armor"" look that works pretty well in its own right. Defoe's portrayal of Norman Osborne's madness is frightening. Defoe didn't turn the Goblin into a buffoon like others would have. Defoe's Goblin is deadly,swift,and truly an alter-ego. Defoe makes you believe that Osborne and the Goblin are two separate people inhabiting one mind. The Goblin mask speaks to Osborne,and Osbourne speaks back to it. He makes Osborne seem sympathetic,and in a way,almost tragic in the tradition of the great Marvel comics villains.Under different circumstances,Parker and the senior Osborne could have been like father and son,and Defoe as well as Maguire show that through their stellar performances.All of the other performances are great too. From James Franco's Harry Osborne(poor,little rich kid),to J.K. Simmons' J.Jonah Jameson(I wanted to see Dabney Coleman play him,but Simmons fleshes him out well),and even Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw(The Macho Man is jakked in this one!). Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben is as loving as the comics character was,and Rosemary Harris turns Aunt May into the grandmother we all had or wish we had.My beefs about this picture are minor. The score was totally wrong for this one. Danny Elfman sounds like he was doing another Batman film by mistake. There is nothing quirky about ""Spider-Man"",and the music should have reflected this. Spider-Man was to me the first ""rock 'n' roll"" superhero. Think about it,he defies authority,debuted in the early 60's(a turbulent time in American history),gets chased by cops,is misunderstood by elders,is full of bravado,is a smart-aleck,and is loved by the people. I wanted to hear electric guitars instead of a bouncy,pretentious orchestra. ""Spider-Man"" is set in New York,not a fictional city like Gotham where Elfman's music fit in better.The Green Goblin's costume also takes some getting used to. Like I said before,I wished they would have taken advantage of Defoe's face(oh that face gives ya the willies,no pun intended). I would have rather seen a form-fitting mask,rather than the bulky helmet the Goblin is given here.I have always loved heroes and heroism,fictional and otherwise. ""Spider-Man"" only reinforced that adoration. Spider-Man is our folk hero,an American myth,our everyman,and I think is in everyone of us. Peter Parker is the kid who we think is geeky,but is cooler than we will ever know. Spider-Man is the mousy librarian who plays in a heavy metal band by night,the housekeeper with a bestselling novel in her head,the accountant who dreams of being a director,hell,the construction worker who dresses in drag and sings Ethel Merman tunes while off-duty. Spider-Man is rock 'n' roll,romance,youth,daring,creativity,and anything anyone ever wanted to be when they grow up. The movie made this all clear.I hate to admit it,but I'm finding myself getting as choked up writing this review as I did while watching the conclusion of the film when I realized that they actually succeeded in making my favorite hero of all time come to life in masterful fashion.Watching the movie made me take a look into myself and realize more than ever that I too am Peter Parker and Spider-Man or at least wish I was.""Spider-Man"" is a sometimes harrowing,but ultimately wonderful film. Everyone will find something to enjoy in it. The action fans will rejoice when the battles take place,the romantics will fall head over heels with the love triangle,and those who just plain like a good flick will come away wanting to cruise the skyline of their hometown via webstrands.I want to personally thank all who were involved in the making of this picture. ""We""(meaning comics fans) really needed this movie to be excellent. Not only did you all deliver,but you all seemed to have the time of your lives while you were at it.I want to see a franchise. I want to see Jack Black as Dr. Octopus,Henry Rollins as Venom,Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kraven The Hunter,Kevin Spacey as Electro,Ben Kingsley as the Vulture,Portia de Rossi as the Black Cat,Ed Harris as the Scorpion,and I could go on and on.Go out and see this movie."	5.0	Someone Finally Does Justice To A Marvel Character On Screen	2002-06-16	16	13	3
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	"""Spider-Man"" is the best movie based on a comic book hero since 1978's ""Superman - the Movie.""  That's not to knock the first two ""Batman"" flicks, but Sam Raimi's film based on the school geek turned crimefighter packs a greater punch of thrills and magic unlike anything I've seen in a while.  Also, like ""Superman,"" ""Spider-Man"" has a charming innocence that can make even grown adults believe in superheroes.  Tobey Maguire has a reputation for bringing to life offbeat nerds, whether the films are ""Wonder Boys"" or ""Cider House Rules.""  But here, Maguire hits the bullseye as Peter Parker, the brainy student who has the hots for the girl next door (Kirsten Dunst).  When Parker gets accidentally bitten by a spider, his body changes and he learns of his true calling.  But every hero has his nemesis, and in this film, Spider-Man's sworn enemy is the nasty Green Goblin, played to the hilt by Willem Defoe.  Raimi does what many other directors fail to do: make a compelling summer movie that doesn't reek of corporate stench.  The special effects are cool, but they take a backseat to the storyline and the cast which make up ""Spider-Man's"" greatest strengths.  On its own merits, this film really earns four stars, but the loaded quality features force me to give it an extra star.  However, the picture quality for a movie this recent is fairly disappointing.  Many of the images look a bit pale and washed out, though the surround sound is sure to rock your system.  I had long avoided ""Spider-Man"" because it looked less like a movie than a shameless money making machine.  But it's far better than it appears.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	The first SPIDER-MAN film had a long gestation period, passing from director to director (James Cameron was probably the best known), before landing on Sam Raimi--who does an awesome job of pulling it all together.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3OPDQPLZI2EAR	"""theodora_productions"""	"Those of us whose childhood fantasies were fed by superhero comic books -- instead of television -- always looked forward to superhero movies, and often came out of the theater disappointed; but not this time. Sam Rami succeeded where generations of directors and endless, like-minded TV series often failed. He found and inflamed the dormant desire for awe in admiration of the strong, yet tender, heroic male; the one we read about in adolescence, and whom we secretly kept close to our hearts as adults.Yet this is not a nostalgic movie with old fashions or a middle-aged audience in mind. It is as fresh as a teenager movie and as action packed as any Hollywood blockbuster, while at the same time it is an excellent film in every respect. It is exciting, funny, touching and perfectly paced. In other words it is great adventure entertainment, and I highly recommend it.I will not go into the details of the story, one that, after all, is not so different from others, in order to not spoil it for those who have not seen it.I do want to single out Alvin Sargent, a seasoned screenwriter, and his team, for writing a script that makes characters interesting, believable and sympathetic. The action is measured, the suspense is tolerable and the plot is interesting, tight and unburdensome. No superfluous talking here. No long-winded car chases or overly brutal fights. In fact, I was glad to see one of the criminals fall by accident, rather than to be killed by such a gentle superhero.Tobey Maguire, whose memorable performance in ""The Cider House Rules"" propelled him to super stardom, is the surprising and fortunate casting choice for the role of Peter Parker, the high school boy turned Spider-man. He gives a sensitive rendering of a young man who, having been bitten by a genetically modified spider, develops superhuman abilities. His portrayal of this dual, human and supernatural character is not only convincing, but given the actor's own likable personal traits, it is very sweet and moving as well.Kirsten Dunst in the role of Mary Jane is as likeable as Maguire, and well cast as Spider-man's long - and widely -- sought after sweetheart.The villainous character's incarnation, in a subplot that involves the US Dept. of Defense, is unexpected, spectacular and amusing. It adds just enough spice to an otherwise predictable outcome.The manner of updating the decades old context of Spider-Man is inspired, and it includes a lot more than biologically re-engineered arachnoids. One of my favorites was WWF wrestling as his first proving ground. This, and many other aspects of the movie will endear it to young viewers. (Never the less, keeping in mind its 2-hour length and some violence, I would not recommend it for young children.)""Spider-Man"" is a feast for the eyes. The producers' choice of locations, colors, special effects, costumes, and even make up, deliver a hint of comic-book sketching, just enough to make us surrender to the screen, only without any of the gaudiness or spooky retrofuturist gimmicks that would easily turn off sophisticated audiences. The hero's aerial acrobatics are, as one would expect, more fantastic than those of Olympic gymnasts, but delivered with the smooth interpretation and subtle touches of skillful choreography. And behind all this we see New York in all it's earthly glory, as if the choice of Manhattan for the film's backdrop was intended to present this legendary city of ours from the perspective of a box seat in one of its great venues for the performing arts."	5.0	Great Entertainment.	2002-05-12	0	0	0

The images are great, so is the soudtrack. However, I found the actors and the dialogues very unconvincing in several scenes (one of the dialogues between Peter and MJ is really dumb). That is not too serious though, because this movie is essentially an action movie, and there are plenty of excellent action scenes ; all the fights between Osborn and Peter-Spiderman are fabulous, especially the attack on the Roosevelt Island cable car. One of the interesting points of the story is the fact that many people wandered if Spiderman was doing good or evil, in spite of all his good actions... even the Police was against him in an incredible -but real- scene. Also interesting is the scene near the end when Osborn realizes that he is losing, he starts to lie to confuse Peter's mind (he tells him that he never wanted to harm him or MJ etc.). Altogether, this movie is really enjoyable.	4.0	Enjoyable movie, good entertainment for all	2003-02-05	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2V2XRUGEYYCGG	Thomas Glebe	"I have mostly been disappointed by ""super hero"" feature film attempts.  The first ""Superman"" movie was cool, as was the first ""Batman"" flick, but both still had problems.  As a Spiderman fan (okay, I guess I'm a bit biased), since a kid, I was wondering if they could do justice to this, probably the most truly interesting and unique superhero comic character ever created.  They did it!  And best, they did it right!  This is a great movie and works excellently on almost all levels.I have never been so surprised and taken aback by such a well done movie since I saw The Matrix for the first time, and Fight Club. I haven't seen a Spiderman ""comic book"" for a decade or so, and though I couldn't help to hear some pretty positive feedback on this film, before I actually finally watched it (on cable), I wondered.  Would they really get Spiderman ""right?""  Truly though, this exceeded all my expectations.I have read other reviews which complain about too much obvious CGI and a ""video game"" feel overall to most of the action scenes but hey, I see nothing wrong with any of that.  First, what's wrong with video games anyway?  Some can be quite entertaining, and some can contain excellent special effects and storylines.  This has both, and second, no ""controller"" is needed.  Just sit back and relax and enjoy.  Anyway, how the heck DOES one translate a colorful costumed superhero swinging from skyscrapers and bridges and such, without almost ""video-game"" effects?  If anything, I was and am astounded at the effects, and how they translated ink and paper into 24 frames per second, and almost flawlessly.Tobey Maguire is and was flawless casting.  He brings the down to earth, nerdish-ness of Peter Parker, transformed in heroic times into a web slinging crime fighter, to the big screen perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst, is okay, but imo, played just a bit too sexy and very UN-girl next door from the character I remember from long ago, but I guess we're in new times and a new millenium.  It was also nice to see Cliff Robertson, semi-blacklisted for a time in Hollyweird, get a nice part here, that of Peter's uncle Ben, Parker's ""father"" he never had.There are two distinct stories here, one of Peter Parker's life, and then the special effects blockbuster scenes.  Both mix well throughout, and I never got bored at all, even by the slower, quieter, dramatic scenes.  In fact, there's really not a dull moment here, and it's obvious equal attention was given to the non fx parts of the movie just as much as the eye-popping and exciting action parts.Even non-fans of this general genre will find a LOT to love here.  If the thought that a movie called ""Spiderman"" based upon a comic book turns you off immediately to even giving this one viewing, you're really missing something special.  If you're expecting a heavy-handed, ""dark"" type of ""Batman"" experience here, you won't find it.  If you're expecting an over-the-top and almost self mocking comics/movie translation ala Superman, look elsewhere.However, if you're looking for a great story, plot, acting, and amazing special effects, if you're looking for 2 hours of pure amazing entertainment, this film version of the AMAZING Spiderman is hard to beat.  A five star triumph, and my thanks to those who made this, and made it so right."	5.0	An AMAZING film for the Amazing Spiderman!	2004-07-04	1	1	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A25I2BDIWLHVLO	thomas miller	I have to say that after going to see spider-man i really don't see how episode 2 can top it as the summer's best film. This film had everything i look for in a movie granted i am probably not the best film critic around but i look for the simple things in a movie and this delivered well above my expectations. i want a movie that has good special effect's but not overdone one that actually has a good story or one in spidermans case that sticks to the story of the comic book as close as possible and spiderman does this quite well. And if your a big spider-man fan i don't think you will be disapointed at all with this film. As for actors and actresses WOW nice to see hollywood put it's trust in a differen't group of actors than you would normally see for a film of this nature and does it deliver. Toby Maguire is an excellent spider-man and one i think kids who will watch this film can relate to. He does an outstanding job as peter parker and spider-man. Kirsten Dunst who said this lady could not be Mary Jane she sizzled I for one thought she did an outstanding job as spider-man's love intrest. And who can forget the green goblin played by Willem Dafoe i must say they have the perfect cast for this picture. I want to also add that Sam Raimi is the director for this picture i had actually never heard of him before this picture but i really do feel after seeing this film you will be hearing alot about this man what a director WOW. Hey sam please don't change any of the cast for part 2 the talent here is fantastic. This film is definately a must see 5 stars easy as for episode II we will see if it can compare with the nice suprises of spider-man.	5.0	Spider-man may just top episode 2 for summer's best flick!!	2002-05-09	0	0	0

This said, it follows that this review should be fairly unbiased and good for the majority of people who don't spend days studying the brightly colored panels and speech balloons. (No offense to one of my good friends who does, or anyone else of that nature.) And that said, this follows: the movie was most thoroughly excellent. That's all there is. I'm not going to run down the plot; by now, you should know it, and if you don't, go see it and find out. Acting? Good. Quite good. Toby Maguire, except for a couple bad lines, falls into the character perfectly, and all the other actors hold up well. The exception is Willem Dafoe, who goes above and beyond the rest. He gets the play the insane bad guy, the Green Goblin, and he does the role with flamboyance, humor, and a perfect touch of drama. Storyline? Excellent. As said, I don't read the comics, so I can't make a comparison. What I can say is Spider-Man's story is focused totally on the characters rather then a wild destroy-the-world plot, and it makes for a much stronger movie. The greatest asset is the interplay between them: Peter Parker and his best friend are in love with the same girl, the best friend's father sees Peter as more of a son then his own son, Peter and the father are friends on the surface and their alter-egos are enemies; it's intricate but stops at the perfect point before ""bad soap opera"". More so, the ending was very strong; it's not quite what you expect, and it manages to add both a good sense of closure and an opening for a sequel. The action? Ignore that elitist fool Ebert's review. He complains the action scenes lack presence and look fake. I reply they are frequent, fast-paced, exciting, and absolutely perfect for a movie like this. Few things beat webslinging around the streets of NY for coolness. It is here, however, that my one tiny complaint arises. In the moments where Spider-Man goes mano a mano with Green Goblin, there is only one time when the blows are going back and forth; the rest is of one beating the other up. Now this still looks very cool, but the fighting between them could have been done a little better. The action scenes also feel a little short. Fortunately this is made up by them being fairly frequent and looking incredibly cool. The camera work is used to maximum effectiveness, racing after the masked man has he zips around the streets, slowing down during explosions, and generally adding to the limitless energy contained in the movie. Special effects look just right. Spider-Man is great beating up four bad guys at once; he can jump and flip circles around them, and unlike say, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I would love for Ebert to read this) it look real, as though he is strong enough to leap that high, and it does not look like he has two or three wires linked to a hidden belt. Watching him swing through the streets takes the feeling ""How cool would that be"" to new levels. The movie also adds a touch of humor at just the right points, and a touch of drama at just the right others. And watching Peter evolve from a social outcast to a kid with a new toy to a new type of social outcast, one with responsibilities he cannot share, adds a very human depth to the film. Spider-Man is a great movie, mixing action and drama in just the right levels. Now if they can just do a sequel, and soon."	5.0	Exhilarating in every sense of the word	2002-05-04	1	1	0

I'm not so sure that Tobey Maguire was the best actor for the role.  Let me just say, he's not spidery enough, if that makes any sense.  Christopher Reeves was superman, Jack Nicholson was Joker, Maguire is not Spiderman.  The plot is somewhat duller than I expected, more of an introductory than anything, like Star Wars Episode 1.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1RSWL2RTKGYZE	Timothy Donavan Russell	"Q. What kind of lab is it that's letting (a) genetically engineered spiders (b) escape (c) without sounding some kind of alarm and evacuating?A. A lab funded by the same (a) government that's (b) funding the development of superhuman drugs! Wow. Now that's not a grim take on the moral status of our society, is it? Read: politicians are all just (a) a bunch of greedy klutzes, who are (b) in mismanaged cahoots with evil, EVIL corporations. Come to think of it, take out all the questionable science and gross caricatures and it's probably a pretty accurate depiction. Too bad, sob, there're no superheroes to foil evil corporagovernment plots in the real world. Or, maybe there are.....hmmmm. Yes, that's right, the real heroes are ordinary people just like you and me. (Cue strings.) (Thank you, Ms. Brockovich.) But then Spidey's not ABOUT ordinary people (and arguably neither is Erin B.). With the exception of course of the cheer-begging scene in which a group of ""average"" citizens (who for some reason look a bit like gangsters) throw sticks and stones at the Green Gobby. There, this one's for you NYC: ""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us."" In an era without conscription, it may be the closest thing we ever get to a draft-peer pressure - which, relatively speaking, might just be a good thing.Q. What kind of film has a geeky 17-yo late bloomer suddenly (a) get muscles, stamina, coordination, pubic hair, and The Girl (but also the power over raging hormones to reject a Girl like Kirsten Dunst) and (b) realize that he can, um, well, er, shoot white bits of stuff out of his body in spurts? (Sorry, but I couldn't help read it that way. Watch again if you're not convinced.)A. Why, a coming of age film, of course. The mantra: ""With power comes responsibility."" Or something like that. Brought to you by the writers of other such meaty works as Gone in 60 Seconds and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Spidey seems a little more keen on moralizing about what it might actually mean to be buff than most movies with explosions. It may be that it doesn't even come close to contributing anything substantial to the post-9/11 talk of heroism; heck, boil them all down and the kernel concept of Batman, Superman, and X-men, et al. is really just to have a guy go out and rescue kittens out of trees (in which helpless citizens caught in a cruel world stand in for the kittens and trees). As always, the real world, a great deal of which-perhaps even the most important part of which-takes place at home, is a lot more difficult and complicated. Even so, after seeing the coming attraction for yet another Adam Sandler bit of tripe in which he plays yet another 35-yo regressed ""big kid"" who acts irresponsible all over everyone and tries for yet even more uncomfortable chuckles with yet even more oops-I-pooped-my-pants looks, a kind of entertainment in which the overall idea seems to be that a young man should try to act his age and try to have some consideration for other people was yet even more welcome.Minor complaints, file under ""Violations of Realism Above and Beyond the call of Entertainment"":1) Uncle Ben gets shot and killed in (a) (I know...it goes with the genre) a seemingly constantly violent city in which (b), sadly for dear Aunt May, the authorities don't seem to make a practice of informing the families of homicide victims.2) Longtime uncoordinated school (...) Peter Parker does a triple summersault in midair from a standing position and punches a guy halfway down the hall...well, you see where I'm going with this, or maybe where he would have gone in a real world: into restraints.3) Oh, and while I'm at it, there are obviously witnesses to the cafeteria tray incident as well (webs and all), and then this Spider-Man guy starts appearing all over the city? And no one stops to think, hey...could it be...maybe. Okay, okay. Now I'm picking apart the whole genre. I guess ever since we collectively agreed to believe that all it takes is a pair of fake glasses for Superman to fool everyone.... Shows you what we think of ourselves, doesn't it!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2Q13PHEXGR48Q	T O'Brien	Spider-Man is a great action movie based on the comic book that has an excellent story to back up the action.  Peter Parker is your average high school student until one day on a field trip to a museum, he is bit by a genetically enhanced spider.  After being bitten, he begins to notice things have changed since he is now toned and does not need to wear glasses anymore.  Peter then discovers that he can shoot webs from his wrist.  Soon enough, Peter has morphed into Spider-Man as he begins to battle crime in New York City.  Along the way, he must battle Green Goblin who begins terrorizing the city.  At the same time, he must try and live his life while also concealing his identity.  This was a great superhero action movie with great fight scenes, especially the showdown between Spidey and the Green Goblin.  What makes this movie better than your average action movie is the story.  You get to know the characters rather than just seeing them as comic book stereotypes.  Highly recommended viewing.Spider-Man has an excellent cast whom all give excellent performances.  Tobey Maguire stars in the title role as Spiderman/Peter Parker.  The transformation he makes on screen from high school student to superhero is fully believable.  Willem Dafoe is great as Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, who is torn between himself and his evil alter-ego.  Kirsten Dunst is perfect as all-American girl, Mary Jane Watson, Peter's secret crush.  In a very good supporting role, James Franco plays Peter's friend Harry.  The movie also stars Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Also look out for Spider-Man creator Stan Lee in a scene where the Green Goblin attacks the city.  Rather than go through all of the extras on the 2-Disc DVD, I'll just say that if you enjoyed the movie you will love the huge range of extras offered on the DVD.  For a great superhero movie with a great story, impressive action scenes, and an even better cast, check out Spider-Man!	5.0	One of the best superhero movies	2004-06-21	2	2	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	Spiderman (2002) is a refreshing flick that offers a little bit of everything in terms of action, romance, suspense, tragedy, and adventure. It has a simple yet very effective storyline that draws the viewer in from the beginning. Young Peter Parker is a guy with a crush, but must suppress that temptation as his new powers become apparent. He instead embarks on a commitment of being a public servant. Woven into the story is the perfect villain (Green Goblin) who turns out to be Peter's best friend's father. If you like crime-busting action at its best, then this movie is for you. If you like a little romance sprinkled in, then this movie is for you. This movie also fully captures the essence of city life, and how a character like Spiderman can bring about a mysteriousness in the eyes of skeptical people as well as those who believe in what he's doing. This movie exemplifies the division between good and evil; Parker as Spiderman must win the hearts and minds of his people while trying to bring down Green Goblin. I like the widescreen format, as well as the extras included.	5.0	Cool Movie	2011-12-09	0	0	0

It has since been surpassed by three films, one of which is its outstanding sequel, ""Spider-Man 2"".  ""Spider-Man"" is still amongst the very best superhero movies, though, behind ""X-Men"" and in front of ""Superman"".Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, a nerdy high school student who undergoes a series of unusual changes after being bitten by a new species of spider.  Parker eventually becomes web-slinging superhero Spider-Man, in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately for Peter, Mary Jane is dating Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose father (Willem Dafoe) is the latest threat to New York City.Sam Raimi, who previously had directed only cult films (most of which were excellent), proves that he is more than capable of directing big-budget pictures.  He does a great job of focusing on the adventure of the Spider-Man legend, as well as Peter Parker's impossible romance with Mary Jane and his need for secrecy.The cast is very good.  Tobey Maguire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker, making him a very likable character, as well as one that we can feel for.  Willem Dafoe is enjoyably over-the-top as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, while J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as J. Jonah Jameson.  ""Evil Dead"" fans: Bruce Campbell is the announcer at the wrestling match.David Koepp's script remains faithful to the comics on which it's based, while never being too cheesy or unbelievable.  It's funny and well-written.Danny Elfman's soundtrack is excellent.  At times it's reminescent of his magnificent soundtrack for Tim Burton's ""Batman"".  The music really heightens the level of excitement for the movie.""Spider-Man"" is a fantastic, fun, and well-made superhero film, but it's also much more: it's a great movie.

From what I have seen of Spiderman comis this does do a good job staying true to the spirit of the comics.So many movies today rely too heavily on special effects. This is definately one of those.  Plot exposition and character development come second to displaying great, though overused CGI graphics.The CGI spiderman jumps from building to building with reckless disregard for any sence of physics of laws of gravity.  It looks too fake.

Don't even get me started on the insistance of Hollywood on having zones in the first place. If someone likes to see foreign films and wants to get a DVD from another zone (i.e. Europe, Japan, etc.), well, too bad for you, because where multi-zone players are common in other countries, they are relatively hard to get in the U.S., and you can't play a foreign DVD on a regular American DVD player.  So, say you teach a foreign language/culture. You are out of luck if you want to show your students real films from other countries, not just the ones distributors deem profitable for U.S. release.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A6VXZ1EEPRTLV	trebe	For its time, Spider-Man (2002) is an impressive technical achievement, as well as an entertaining, straight ahead action film.  Director Sam Raimi's interpretation of the vanguard of Marvel Comics, while a pretty good thrill ride, is open to much discussion, as he reconfigures the Spider-Man universe.Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Dikto, back in 1963, and has become an icon among comic book superheroes.  In 1967, Spider-Man appeared in an animated series, that captured much of the basic essence of the character, and helped to boost his popularity.  The short lived 1978 TV series, demonstrated that realistically translating the character to live action, would be a major technical challenge.  It would not be until after another twenty years had passed, that technology would advance far enough to make bringing the webslinger to the big screen possible.With nearly forty years of history behind Spider-Man, the challenge was to decide what to focus on, and how to present the characters.  While the screenplay gets some things right, there are other matters that do not play as well, as Spidey's life story gets a major makeover.  The film takes the traditional route, starting at the beginning, with a retelling of the origin of the character, and after setting the stage, Act II focuses on Spider-Man's battle with the Green Goblin.Casting was a crucial process, and after appearing as Spider-Man in three films, I have mixed feelings about Toby Maguire.  Not so much with his performance as Spider-Man, but mostly as Peter Parker.  His voice sounds too boyish, and his portrayal does not match my conception of the character.  The writing is a major contributor to this, as Maguire's Parker comes off as more of a shy, clumsy, lovesick goof, rather than as teen struggling with coming to terms with being a superhero.  The angst and inner conflict that Parker had in the early days (the first 100 issues of The Amazing Spider-Man), as well as Spidey's irreverent sense of humor, is completely missing.  As is having to deal with financial troubles, and Aunt May's health concerns.  While going in that direction might have dragged down the movie, even a critical element like Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), is glossed over.In the 1960's era comics, Mary Jane was an outgoing swinger type, and bears little resemblance to the confusingly written 'good girl' character we have here.  Peter is her neighbor for 12 years, yet she hardly knows him, and then he suddenly becomes her soulmate?  Kirsten Dunst does a good job with the role as written.  The issue is not with her performance, but again like Maguire, with the writing.  Peter's love interest in the early comics was Betty Brandt, followed by Gwen Stacy.  However, involving those characters would have probably been too complicated, particularly as the focus in the film is on Parker's high school life.  Peter is made to appear to be afraid of girls, but in the comics he was more preoccupied with other matters, and regarded as a 'square', rather than being afraid.  While the rationale for some of these decisions is understandable, the mixed up timeline, and the jumble of partial truths with fiction, can be hard for aficionados of the older comics to accept.Listening to the comments by Raimi, John Dykstra, and others, it often sounds like they are selling a bill of goods.  Repeatedly we hear things like Norman Osborn is like Peter's 'surrogate father', and that he favors Peter over his own son.  Osborn offers to help Peter as Harry's roommate, but actually does nothing for him on a personal level.  Willem Dafoe is an exceptional choice for the Osborn/Green Goblin role, but the Goblin's costume is ridiculous joke, looking like a shiny vinyl lizard that is hard to look at without laughing.  It's too bad, because the Goblin maneuvers very well on his glider, and his pumpkin bombs are extremely stylish.  When the Goblin knocks Spidey unconscious, in what universe is it possible, that while helpless, the Goblin didn't take the opportunity to peek under his mask?  Wouldn't you?Unlike the Goblin, Spider-Man's costume looks fabulous, although it is apparently not very durable, and the mask seems very prone to damage.  Later in Spider-Man 2, the mask comes off so often as to be completely ridiculous.  The special effects do a good job of recreating the kind of radical movements Spidey is capable of.  He is almost flying across the skyline of New York.  Peter's ability to create his own webbing, versus man made web shooters, is more in line with the DNA angle to his origin, and simplifies things for the filmmakers.Revealing some of the deficiencies of Spider-Man, is the sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is a much better film, particularly from a technical standpoint, where both Spidey and Dr. Octopus, do some amazing things.  Unfortunately all three Spider-Man films, display an unfortunate pattern regarding the mortality of super-villains.Sam Raimi definitely deserves a lot of credit for what he has achieved with the Spider-Man franchise.  The films are spectacular, and very entertaining, and have forever lifted him from the ranks of cult horror films.  With a history so long and rich, there will be issues regarding Spider-Man, no matter what road is taken.  Raimi seems to have carte blanche regarding the character, and the films are rewriting Spider-Man's history in quite significant ways.  It is apparent that the PG-13 films, are targeted squarely at a young audience, who have different tastes, and may have never read a Spider-Man comic.  The decisions made here were crucial, as they established the framework for the films that follow, and will become 'reality' for those who have no other frame of reference.Raimi had great power in deciding what to do, but did he live up to the responsibility of doing justice to Spider-Man?  In the end, while the film successfully delivers Spider-Man, it falls very much short in depicting the lives of the real life characters.	4.0	power and responsibility . . .

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"Sam is back!  The first show that started 9:10 a.m. was not a very happy experience for me, but it's good to see Sam Raimi regain his flair for rousing actions that has been laid aside since the 1990 ""Darkman.""  And looking back from now, it was very fortunate that Cameron didn't take the helm of the production for the hero-image of ""Spider-man"" is more unconventional than all-American one, which Leo or Arnie might have been struggling to handle.  No way.Anyone with some knowledge about comics or TV should have been already seen this wonder boy Tobey Maguire who gains his incredible power of hanging from walls and buildings.  Unlike other superheroes, however, ""Spider-man"" emphasizes on his personality as an ordinary boy, who thinks of his extraordinary spider-like ability as a curse.  And I bet you do, even if you got a kiss from Mary Jane in the form of Kristen Dunst while you're hanging from up above, showing only your lips!Yes, Sam Raimi shows again his deft skill at mixing those incongruous elements -- darkness behind heroism and romance between a boy and a girl -- and he even throws unexpected comical moments into this hero's adventure, making his Peter ""Spider-man"" Parker's character more human than you expect.  There's no machismo, no obligatory love scene.  But that's what Raimi's style all about, which curiously matches this unusual hero from Marvel Comic.So, don't try to find something similar to ""Superman"" here (though you get some funny allusions to this popular hero; watch how Tobey discloses his costume baring his breast on the street, the same way Christopher Reeve once did in the first ""Superman"" film.); the touch of the film is completely different, and though the film itself never forgets to entertain us with its exciting high-speed action sequences, the strength lies in its slightly off-beat presentation of this hero's life in America, and especially New York City.  I was greatly amuzed to see the city depicted from a new perspective, that is of course, from high up above the city.Supporting cast is also very good, and my special mention goes to ever-getting gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, whose eccentric beauty goes along well hand in hand with Tobey Maguire's oddly amusing, droll superhero image.  And it is only natural that Ms. Dunst's past filmography helps greatly -- you know, she was in ""Interview with the Vampire"" (she was a child vampire) and ""The Crow -- Salvation"" (wow ... with another dark hero).Though it doesn't have the groundbreaking special effects that impressed us in, say,  ""Matrix,""  ""Spider-man"" is a great achievement after all, which can be done only by first-rate crew and cast, and this case again, kudos to Mr. Raimi, to whom I really want to say: Welcome back, Sam, and please, please,  don't make any more baseball film."	5.0	No, That's Spider-man!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	SPIDER-MAN rocks! It has something for everyone in the family: some action, cool effects, a little romance, and even a couple of moral messages. Most people are at least familiar with the origins of Spider-man and since that's a large part of the movie's plot, it isn't worth discussing here. The movie stays fairly true to those origins. Granted a few minor adjustments have been made to make the movie flow better in it's modern setting, but those differences aren't worth quibbling.There are only a two flaws I could see with the movie. To begin with, the action sequences weren't long enough especially the climatic battle at the end. The movie would have flowed a little faster with some more action. The other flaw is that Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst just didn't have any chemistry between them. It appears as though their characters were acting like they were attracted to each other instead of appearing as though their characters were in love.Sam Raimi has been a Spider-man fan for years and his passion for the comics is what lead to his being hired to direct SPIDER-MAN. He hasn't let anyone down. Other than ARMY OF DARKNESS, SPIDER-MAN is probably his best movie yet.The acting is extraordinary for a comic book movie and Tobey Maguire is right on the money as Peter Parker. Kristen Dunst is a great Mary Jane Watson, except when she and Maguire share romantic scenes. I was also impressed by the actor who played Harry Osborne, his portrayal was superb.Overall a great movie that the entire family will probably enjoy. There isn't any sex, only one bad word, and the violence is almost cartoony so I really don't know why this is PG-13 instead of PG. The MPAA really screwed up with the rating of this one.	5.0	A Comic Book Movie Done Right	2002-05-08	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A7GSGC0G8R6PW	Tyler Tanner	"This has been a favorite in my library since I got it. Not only does it treat an american pop-culture icon with the respect that it deserves, it is one of the most well balanced action-adventure movies to come out in a long time.This is what happens when a fan gets a hold of the material and does it right. Sure there is action, but an action flick is just flash and explosion without strong characters behind it. Sam Raimi is the perfect choice for the film. His Hitchcock like style and tongue-in-cheek humor lends itself well to Spider-Man. He has never been conventional, and he doesent disappoint here either.Tobey MacGuire is also an ideal choice as Peter Parker, Spider-Mans alter ego. The movie never lets you forget that there is a awkward teenager underneath that suit, and in order to pull that off, you need a decent actor. Yes there could have been others but I shiver to think what would happen if Freddie Prinze Jr. got the role.Willem Defoe was also aptly cast as Norman Osbourne a.k.a. The Green Goblin. But it also brings me to the only real issue I had with the film. His costume and I am being very picky. I loved Defoe's performance and see the reasoning why that the way that they did, but I was hoping for something a little bit more organic and less high-tech.Kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Mary Jane Watson, Peter Parkers love interest and I was surprised at the depth and maturity that went into the performance.But the show stealers are Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and J.K. Simmons and J. Jonah Jamison. Even the most skeptic Marvel die hards will agree that these two knocked out of the park. No matter how many times I have watched this, I always am amazed by them.The DVD is very impressive. The favorite feature of mine is the pop up option for the movie. It's the same as ""VH1's Pop-Up Videos"" just done with a feature film. Very informative and funny. The is also a commentary which is okay and you can also choose to have a spider icon option than, when it shows on the lower right of the screen, you press enter and a behind the scenes vignette shows up. Very similar to ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""X-Men 1.5."" The difference being, while still distracting, these vignettes are actuall interesting to watch. There are two music videos, concept art, and an interview with Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Not to mention a really cool short featuring Todd MacFarlane and John Romita Jr. Two legendary Spider-man artists. My wife, who is not a comics fan, was surprised how much she liked the bonus material. So for you non-believers, this is a great way to see why the wall crawler has such a widespread and loyal fan base.All in all a really well put together film with a really well put together DVD. The only thing I would say is that parents of young kids should really heed the rating on this one.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A20QETTR8VAVW1	"viktor_57 ""viktor_57"""	Dear Fellow Spidey-Fans,As a young boy, I always imagined the fun I would have if I had the abilities and commensurate strength of a spider, so in college I studied genetics and biochemistry in the hopes that one day I would have the skill to transfer the powers of a spider to myself. Unfortunately, I had to find work quickly to support my young family and took up a job selling insurance, but in my spare time I set up a molecular genetics and biochemistry lab in my garage.Thinking back on my youthful fantasies, I created a mutated strain of spider having all the abilities mentioned in the movie. I then infected the spider with a virus that incorporated the spider's genome into the virus's own DNA.Much like in the movie, I allowed the spider to bite me and inject the virus into my bloodstream, and also paralleling the movie, I felt woozy and collapsed to the floor. When I woke up later the next morning, I looked in the mirror with high hopes, but found my vision was distorted. On closer inspection, I realized that my vision was distorted because I had grown six extra eyelets, like a real spider. At first, I was horrified, but then I gradually came to accept the change as the price of greatness. But that was not the end to the transformations.I too, can spin a web, but it doesn't shoot out of my wrists. Instead, like a real spider, my spinnerets are located in my anus, so I have to pull down my pants every time I want to create a web.I also have a deep craving for the blood of insects, and my family has left me because my favorite food are live flies I catch with my web.  I eat them as a real spider would, by injecting my venom and digestive enzymes into their bodies to liquefy their innards and then sucking out the deliciously bitter and creamy soup.Anyway, I wanted to warn all you spidey-fans out there who are thinking of allowing yourselves to be bitten by genetically-modified super spiders that you may get more than you bargain for. I no longer resemble anything human, and soon I will need to banish myself from human society for the sake of all that is good and holy. Please take heed, fellow spidey-enthusiasts, of my tale of Faustian woe.Your arachnoidal friend	5.0	The Genetic Truth	2005-10-17	3	2	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2JA7C0WEMB1M7	"Virgil ""Virgil"""	I highly recommend Spiderman.  Hollywood did something right for once and Sam Raimi was the director to do it.Tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker.  A bright but somewhat shy and insecure orphaned teenager being raised by his aunt and uncle.  In fact it's doubtful anyone could have played the role better than he.  The action scenes are well done but the movie is at it's best while it shows Parker coming to grips with his powers while at the same time coming to grips with being a teen.  Raimi stays true to the original Marvel storyline with great effect.William Defoe is very good as the Green Goblin.  Some have claimed his role is less than stellar but I disagree.  In typical Marvel fashion even the bad guys has some humanity as in the last scene featuring the Green Goblin (I won't give it away).The absolute best supporting role is that of the newspaper editor played by J.K. Simmons.  If Macguire's own role wasn't so well done he might have stole the show.  Cliff Robertson does a fine job as Parker's uncle and Kirsten Dunst is the love interest MJ.All in all this is a surprisingly entertaining flick.Highly recommended.	5.0	Entertaining and true to its source.	2002-05-28	2	1	1

I thought he did good work on the Darkman movie, but I think he lost some of his edge, because this movie was just plain bad. If it had been a debut of a new filmmaker this movie would be forgivable, but Mr. Raimi should be very, very ashamed.The story is basically non-existant, the bad guy is just plain stupid (why didn't they choose Doc Octopus as the bad guy), the acting is awful and even the CGI is sub-subpar.Let's just hope they won't make more of these or give it to someone with a little more depth.

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A12UJXAEJ9VPF9	"W. A. Patterson ""Billiam86"""	I'm reviewing both the movie and the DVD here.  Let's start with the movie.MOVIE - It seems like the story of Spiderman would have been played better dark, and with Sam Raimi at the helm I was expecting a much darker story, but it almost seemed too cartoonish.  A lot of the critics liked it and don't get me wrong, I like it too.  I was just expecting a darker version of the story.  Willem Dafoe is just loony, and Green Goblin should not be played like the Joker or the Riddler.  The casting there was iffy, but everything else was on par.  An enjoyable Saturday night rental is the best I can give the movie.The DVD - Well, first things first, the video and the sound are top notch.  I won't knock it on the A/V quality.  The picture has a 3d look to it and it's very vibrant and the soundfield comes alive in many places of the movie.  However, the extras are lacking.  This whole DVD (much like the actual movie) feels very rushed.  You get some fluff material and some music videos, but nothing of real value.Overall, I'd only reccomend a buy on this if you're a die hard comic book fan or spiderman fan.  Other than that, it makes a great rental, but not a great buy.	3.0	So/So Outing For Spider-Man	2004-02-29	2	0	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1YQHSA66FHS2P	Warren R. Ehn	Here we go... (5) DANNY ELFMAN's dark, jittery musical score. Think of the roiling, angry energy of Elfman's music for the first 'Batman' movie [if you've forgotten, you can also hear it at the beginning and end of the Batman 'animated series'], then add the sound of an army of spiders scuttling across your living room floor, and you'll get the idea. (4) Director SAM RAIMI's wonderfully hyperkinetic visual style, propelling the action forward while emphasizing the larger-than-life feel of a comic book. (3) The much-maligned SPECIAL EFFECTS, CGI and all. The widescreen format preserves the 'rush' as Spidey swoops headlong through the city streets, barely missing cars and pedestrians (and nearly running into buildings) in hot pursuit of the bad guys. It's a GREAT ride. (2) TOBEY MAGUIRE's understated performance as geeky high school kid Peter Parker. When Peter realizes that he has superpowers, you feel his joy as he leaps from rooftop to rooftop through the gritty city, empowered at last. Yet, even after becoming Spidey, Maguire never lets you forget the scared kid underneath the superhero, ready to break through at any moment. AND FINALLY... (1) J.K.

I did not see the film in the theatres, so I miss some of the roller coaster ride you get from the giant screen.  Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker.  I enjoyed his almost clueless personality; an direct opposite of Spiderman's heightened senses.They could have found someone else for Mary Jane.  I am not a big Dunst fan, and it was hard to get past that.The supporting material on the DVD is great.  I enjoyed the interviews with the previous artists and writers of Spiderman.  Also I really enjoyed the bio of composer Danny Elfman (one of my favorite musicians).

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"Well, actually, he's better than Superman. I should say the movie is. Superman was probably the best comic book adaption (although with some minor flaws) until X Men and Spiderman came along (I have to also give credit to Batman Returns and Blade--both were very good adaptions). Spiderman manages to recapture all the wonder I remember reading the comic when I was a kid. Screenwriter David Koepp (who worked on Jurassic Park among many another films) does a marvelous job of fleshing out Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's characters. What is most impressive is how the mythology is incorporated into an action story. Most film directors would have spend half the time dealing with Peter Parker's transformation or origin. Instead, we get it all reduced to the first 20 minutes and Spidey actually gets introduced within the first hour. We also see many of Spidey's exploits through a montage.The direction by comic devotee Sam Raimi fits in perfectly with the character and story--which is no surprise given Raimi's comic book visual style (see Darkman, Army of Darkness or any of the other Evil Dead movies for a demonstration of his ""panel"" visual style). The direction is also informed with a love of comics which radiates throughout the picture creating much of the power of the film. Credit also goes to Raimi for not trying to ""mainstream"" Spidey and make him respectable. He doesn't pander to highbrow critics by making this into something more than a spectacular adventure film. Although it lacks the impressive backstory of X-Men (the motivation for Magneto is established very clearly in the film version and it has resonance beyond comics), Raimi more than makes up for it with a stunning series of visual set pieces.The visual effects with the CGI Spidey are pretty impressive. Their not 100% convincing as of yet but are pretty darn close. You do believe (for the most part) that a man can climb a wall. John Dykstra's (Star Wars, Star Trek: TMP) visuals are fluid and well integrated into the action. There are some sequences where it's difficult to distinguish CGI from the real actors. An example is the scene where Parker tracks down Uncle Ben's killer in as the ""Human Spider"". Most of the sequence is CGI with Tobey Maguire's eyes the only real thing in the shot.Willem Dafoe crackles and cackles as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. I was afraid that he might overpower Maguire (a la Jack Nickolson's Joker from Batman). He doesn't. He plays the dual role with enough conviction and with a touch of madness where we can almost feel sympathetic for Osborn. The rest of the cast including Kristin Dunst as MJ are credible and seamlessly weave themselves into the fabric of the story.I actually would give Spiderman 4 1/2 stars as there were some areas of improvement in the visuals (the CGI Spidey). I also felt that the characters were well developed (J. K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jamieson is a hoot--exactly as I would have imagined him). I felt that killing Gobie was premature (although it does set up Harry Osborn's hate of Spidey and the potential for him to don his father's outfit in a sequel)but the sequence works.The extras are just icing on the cake. The screentests for Maguire (a great action sequence similar to the one where MJ is attacked by goons in the film)and Simmons reading Jameison's lines)are great. The gag reel/outtakes are a chuckle (particularly Willem Dafoe's scenes where he proves how over the top he could have been as Gobie). I would have loved to see more of the CGI screen tests (including earlier tests) but the single example included here is impressive. It's easy to see why the film got the greenlight given all of this.I don't think James Cameron (who had wanted to direct Spidey) could have done this film any better. In fact, I personally feel based on Darkman that Raimi was the only director really up to the task of directing Spiderman. Hopefully he can keep the quality high for the second film (Parker was fired by Dr. Morgan who later turns into a villan in Spiderman so that could be the set up for # 2). I have the feeling that Columbia/Tristar will be releasing a Ultimate Spiderman boxed set with more material later down the line but, unless you're a completist, this all the Spidey that you'll need. Definitely one of the top 10 films of the year."	5.0	"""You're not Superman you know"""	2002-11-02	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3RPRJ6G4I0ZB5	"""westwardhaunting"""	I'm really frustrated with those who 'don't expect much' from a movie about a Superhero. Maybe you don't like these types of movies because you expect too much.As far as superheros go, I'm ecstatic that they've finally brought Spider-Man to the big screen. He's the one superhero that posseses substance and uniqueness. He's not some alien from outerspace with powers or a billionaire that can afford a suit with gadgets. He's just an average guy that was changed when a genetically-engineered spider bit him. In todays world, something like that could happen-and so it seems Spider-Man is the most realistic superhero.I expect an amazing movie and am happy that they did not pick Freddie Prinze Jr. or Brendan Fehr to play Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire is the perfect choice to bring forth Spider-Mans human nature and troubled reality. He'll show the depth that Spider-Man has. To add with the great special effects and what looks to be a great plot-this should be an awesome movie. I am, however, disappointed that Kirsten Dunst was chosen to play Mary Jane. I will say she is a good actress but it is too bad Kate Hudson had to back out-she would have fit the puzzle perfectly.I can't wait til May 3rd.P.S. Does anyone know the name of the songs played in the Spider-Man previews?	5.0	Not just another Comic Book Movie	2002-04-15	15	5	10

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"Anybody expecting a triumphant, ""Fellowship of the Rings""-style epic from ""Spiderman"" will be pretty disappointed.  However, for a comic-book superhero movie, ""Spiderman"" acquits itself quite well.  In a smart casting move, the movie stars the legitimately geeky-looking Tobey Maguire in the title role as Peter Parker, the high-school nerd who gains superhuman powers from a spiderbite.  Willem Dafoe ably mans the villain role as Norman ""The Green Goblin"" Osborn, and as Peter's love object Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is, well, hot.This movie is a far cry from the old-fashioned superhero movies, typified by the ""Superman"" of twenty-five years ago, where a hero perfect in body and soul takes out one-dimensional villains with no moral conflict.  Befitting these more complex times, ""Spiderman"" presents a more complex version of the superhero, a young man with special powers who has to make the difficult decisions about how to use them.  Before he's murdered, Peter's uncle Ben tells him ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" and Peter carries that weight with him the rest of the movie.  He has to think about how his superhero role effects those close to him, and his decisions aren't easy.  Likewise, the villainous Green Goblin is literally a two-dimensional character, with a split personality caused by his performance enhancers, and the movie lets us see the conflict between his good and bad sides.As an action movie, ""Spiderman"" is a mixed bag.  The pacing is excellent, with action scenes nicely interspersed into the drama, but the action sequences themselves leave a bit to be desired.  They're pretty well choreographed, but I think they're a bit TOO slickly produced.  Much like in the two ""Star Wars"" prequels, everything's just a bit too glossy and fake-looking.  I found the grittier look of Michael Keaton's ""Batman"" to be far more effective, and I don't really like the direction these special-effects extravaganzas are moving in now.That said, ""Spiderman"" is still a pretty good movie.  It's a lot more intelligent and ambitious than I had expected, and for thatalone it should get at least three stars.  It also has an absolutely terrific ending, not the ""mega-happy"" conclusion I was expecting, so it gets an extra star tacked on.  If there are more installments of this series, and this one's huge grosses all but guarantee there will be, I hope they live up to this one."	4.0	A better-than-average superhero flick	2002-12-16	11	5	6
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2JOCPR4EPYOP0	"""whitetiger732"""	I did not have the chance to go see this at the movie since I was moving from Fla to Tx at the time that it was released.. Which does make me sad.. I would loved to have seen this audio/visual extraveganza on the silver screen!First.. I heard that lots of people ditzed the movie for being corny.. And my answer to them is.. Get a grip.. obviously they have never read or seen the original comics.. The humour and dialogue where so Stan (the creator of Spidey)..They could not have gotten a better spider man.. Seems that Jerry must have done some research on the character.. or was himself a fan of the wall crawler..And speaking of the comics.. I am soo glad they chose the Green Goblin as the first villian.. it was outstanding the way they played out the interaction between these two long time enemies..In the long run.. if you have not seen this movie and you are a fan of spiderman the comics then you must do it.. rite now!  You will love it as much as I did..All hail Peter Parker!	5.0	The wall crawler is back	2002-12-05	5	4	1
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A1LFO1KACPVARQ	Will	"This Blu-ray title has been around for a little while, but finally got released as a solo disc (rather than a box set) in mid-November.  You only get the movie (no extra disc with special features).  I already own the DVD version, so I could probably go back and watch the extras.  From what I understand, the box set version also didn't have any extras.  If it did, they probably weren't recorded in HD.  Basically, it's not worth deducting a star if you know you're getting just the feature film.If you haven't seen a Blu-ray movie before, there's really no way to describe it with only words.  Assuming you have an HDTV (720p or above), and connect your player with an HDMI cable, the picture will definitely be an upgrade from what you're used to on any DVD (even using upconversion).  The 24 frames per second (make sure your TV can accept those signals) makes a difference.  Colors will be improved.  Faces and clothing look very crisp and detailed.This movie was supposedly filmed in a 1.85:1 ratio, yet filled the whole screen on my TV (which has a 1.78:1 ratio).  That's rare for a Blu-ray movie (a 2.35:1 ratio will show the familiar ""black bars"").  I can't comment on the HD sound, since my receiver only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD quality).  You can still get good sound with Dolby Digital on most Blu-ray discs.The movie itself is one of my favorites, since I can relate to Peter feeling nerdy, shy and awkward.  They did a great job of developing the characters before jumping into any heavy action (which comes mostly toward the end).Overall, a great buy, and at a lower price than most newer releases (which usually sell for $25+ in retail stores)."	5.0	Blu-ray = The Next Best Thing to the Theater!	2010-12-04	5	5	0
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3F8B1KMOCROUH	William Acorn	With the recent resurgence of comic book popularity, it seemed only a matter of time before Marvel's classic heroes got their movies, just as DC's did.  First came the spectacular blockbuster X-Men.  After that rousing success, who could doubt that Spider-Man would be just as amazing?Unfortunately, while the movie was a smash hit, it is not nearly up to the standards true fans set.  The actors are competent, but with the possible exception of Defoe as Norman Osborne and the man who plays Jameson, none are outstanding.  The visuals are sweet, but again, no surprises.  The story is well-done, but not brilliant.  See what I'm getting at?So, while this isn't an exceptional movie, it IS quite good and a good gift item.	3.0	Spider-Man	2005-12-02	4	4	0

So, we hired the DVD the other night expecting to be dazzled.  The film is so 'formula Hollywood' it's not funny! And to top it off, full of digital effects.  It's not the worst film to come out this year, but far from the best.  The only reason it has done so well is because it's a childrens film.  Kirsten Dunst is miscast in this film, by the way.	2.0	What's all the fuss about?	2002-11-10	1	0	1

Stan lee did not even spoke of the original idea of creating spider-man, not showing some basic arts. nothing!second, HBO Documentary! some interviews with cast and crew. they talk, they laught but don't say anything useful. there is nothing about production of the movie! only talk about themselves. Kirsten dunst says Sam is good and Sam Raimi says Kirsten is good and they both laugh! dude! approx 30 minutes, waste of time!Third, entertainment channel exclusive! same as HBO but longer, approx 45 minutes. and the quality is awful!and there is some minor documentaries too plus some photo galleries. NO SIGN OF DELETED SCENES!You'll find some real behind the secenes documentaries on disc 3! it's approx 25 minutes but worth to all of the contents of disc 2!In my opoinion, if you want to have spider-man and only the movie is important for you, buy ""SUPERBIT EDITION"" which has no special features, but superb picture and sound quality!If special features are important for you, buy 3 disc delux edition with no doubt, cause in 2 disc special edition (I don't see anything special here!!!!), you'll get nothin. really nothing!

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3HUCP898IRTZ6	"Zachary Ng ""~Z~"""	The movie itself is great. The problems of the gift set are, well; No.1, I think the interview of Stan Lee's is extremely lengthy and boring and I'm actually typing this very review as I can't stand watching it but couldn't turn it off as this is the first time I'm playing the dvd(and probably the last). My advice is, you have to be a die-hard Stan Lee's fan rather than Spider-man's(or other characters') in order to live thru watching the stupid interview; No.2, The litograph would have made us so much happier if it had had been autographed personally and not printed; No.3, how would the 35mm film cell be made 'collectible' if everyone gets to have the same segment of the same scene from the film? Basically, it's still OK to buy the gift set if you are not too fuzzy and not mind paying a little extra. Otherwise, just stick to the movie.	3.0	Just stick to the movie	2002-11-15	0	0	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	I couldn't have imagined the imprint this movie would have. I have seen Toby Maguire in Pleasantville and was rather confused as to why he was chosen for the lead role. This lasted until the scene in which he looks in the mirror after the spider bit him. From that point on I became convinced he was the 'born for the role'. The special effects appeared a bit C.G. in a couple of scenes, but this was overshadowed by the brilliance of the special effects as a whole. The message from Ben to Peter in the care 'with great power comes great responsibility' is an axiom. The movie with all of the action has a dare I say 'moral' message that all of us need to hear. I could go on and on. Just get the movie and you will see.	5.0	Spiderman	2004-11-01	1	1	0

B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A2CQHJ2TTV54MH	Zigra777	With everything from action to suspense even romance, Spiderman has everything for people of ALMOST all ages. You may want to keep the kiddies away from all the violence and occasional swearing, but it is overall a great movie. Staying true to the comics, this Spiderman film is due for two more sequals while the comics keep coming out. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko are the original creators of the Spiderman comic series that Marvel released in the mid-60's, and it has spawned tv shows, spinoff comics, memorabilia, and movies. Tobey Maguire(don't think I spelled that right) and Kirsten Dunst(don't think I spelled that right, either) are incredible together. Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and falls in love with Mary Jane, until the Green Goblin seeks revenge on the company rivaling his. Spiderman and his friends become intertwined into this incredible storyline of betrayal, suspense, and .... evilness.	5.0	Just Plain Awesome	2002-08-16	2	0	2
B00005JKCH	Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)	A3RMXOM5RYIA4I	Z. Mann	"If you want to see a good film, see ""SPIDER-MAN"", if you want to see a great film, see ""INSOMNIA"". The only reason I gave both 5 stars is because ""SPIDER-MAN"" is good film not because it's missing things, but because there are things that could have been added to make a great film. Do you see where I'm going with this?Anyways, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is about Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), he's pretty much the school nerd, he's also an orphan who lives with his aunt and Uncle Ben. One day, he goes on a field trip with a group of other highschool kids to a spider exibit. amongst the group of kids is the most popular and beautiful girl he has met(Kirsten Dunst). She points out that one of the super genetic spiders is missing, but no one is listening as the group progresses. It's that same time, that Peter gathers the nerve to talk to the girl(It's been a month and half, I hardly remember thier names, so bear with me).""For the school paper?"" Peter asks, holding up a camera.""Sure,"" she responds. As he takes the pictures, the missing spider spirals down on his hand and bites down, inserting its super genetic powers into his DNA.After a day or so Peter begins to explore these powers. He knows he could use them on criminals, but at first he chooses not to. Then suddenly, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed and Peter devotes his life to stopping crime as, Spider-Man, but he is taken the wrong way and is thought to be a criminal.Throughout the movie Peter budgets his time as himself and Spider-Man. Soon, the girl forms a relationship with BOTH Spider-Man AND Peter. Also, around the same time, Spider-Man meets his rival, Green Goblin, who really is the father of Peter's best friend. But he doesn't know.Soon it becomes a deadly game of sabotage and The Green Goblin tempts him to fight by putting his aunt in the hospital and taking hostages. Spider-Man only figures out who The Green Goblin is until the last fight.So, overall, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is a good movie at the fullest, but not a great movie. The only other way to explain this is that ""SPIDER-MAN"" is a blockbuster, not an Academy Award-Winner."	5.0	A GOOD Film.	2002-06-10	0	0	0
