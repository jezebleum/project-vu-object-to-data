This show has everything necessary to be the best show on television. After every viewing of these awesome episodes, i leave feeling great and want to share the Sopranos with everyone i know.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A26NP96OTW6GW3	Aaron M Stenehjem	If you're looking for a good mob story, congratulations, you've found one of the best.If you're looking for something more, stick around, this one has depth.  A long, unflinching and often brutal look at the changing nature of family in the 20th and 21st century, Tony's story gives a window into the new needs and changes in american culture in general.  The old ways are old, the new ways are unknown, and all of the characters struggle to find new paradigms to guide them into the unknown.  For both Tony's family and for his &#34;family.&#34;That's just the tip of the iceberg.  Motherhood, men and women, ambition, the american dream and more are all indicted, investigated and dissected.	5.0	A good mob story with vast depth and complexity.	2014-06-30	1	1	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1NGZ529J2CWNK	"A. Covati ""@covati on twitter"""	This show stands the test of time. It's well written and has great plot with believable characters. I also appreciate how they don't shy aware from violence, but still manage to not become gratuitous -  though this may be more a factor of the era in which it was made.Either way, this is definitely in my top 10 of shows.	5.0	A classic	2014-05-30	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	The Sopranos, Season OneThis show created a sensation when it was shown on HBO [similar to what &#8220;Peyton Place&#8221; did around 1965]. They both discussed events that were censored in the corporate media, then. Both gave people a topic to gossip about at work. Even today there is little said about &#8220;organized crime&#8221; and its function in today&#8217;s society, except on rare occasions. Did America have a problem with organized crime before 1877? I didn&#8217;t read about it in any schoolbook. One reason may have been the existence of the citizen&#8217;s militia, and a more rural life. One reason for avoiding this topic is the usefulness of organized crime by the ruling class, such as union busting or taking over a union. I once read a newspaper article that told how the Teamster&#8217;s Union was formed in the Mid-West by socialists in the 1930s only to be taken over by organized crime when the US Government prosecuted the founders. The corporate media rarely features the workings of organized crime, except as history.This First Season is contained in five VHS tapes.Volume 1 has episodes 1, 2, 3:&#8220;The Sopranos&#8221;; &#8220;46 Long&#8221;; &#8220;Denial, Anger, Acceptance&#8221;.Volume 2 has episodes 4, 5, 6:&#8220;Meadowlands&#8221;; &#8220;College&#8221;; &#8220;Pax Soprana&#8221;:Volume 3 has episodes 7, 8, 9:&#8220;Down Neck&#8221;; &#8220;The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti&#8221;; &#8220;Boca&#8221;.Volume 4 has episodes 10, 11:&#8220;A Hit is a Hit&#8221;; &#8220;Nobody Knows Anything&#8221;.Volume 5 has episodes 12, 13:&#8220;Isabella&#8221;; &#8220;I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano&#8221;.Was this story of a mob leader based on reality of just a clever story to attract viewers? I think a mob leader who sought psychiatric help would suffer either from his own gang or rivals who sensed a weakness. What leaders in business or government do this? Did this show have any imitators? &#8220;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&#8221;	4.0	Based on True Crimes	2014-03-20	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2QTU5CFK5I4VY	"Adam Elgabri ""gabri2"""	"The Sopranos is probably the greatest TV series ever. Each actor in the show plays a complete human being. Filled with layers of psychological depth complex relationships, which are combined in a way which mimics life in such a way that anyone anywhere can see a bit of themselves in middle aged mobster, Tony's ""other"" family and in every other character on the show. Because the Sopranos takes the time to capture the little things which make us uniquely human. Every character has flaws and is filled with contradictions, each character lives with their contradictions and ignores those of others. David Chase once said the joke of the Soprano's was ""that America has become so selfish that even a mobster they guy who invented the idea of me first needs therapy."" I think that is defiantly a central theme of the Sopranos especially this first season. In latter seasons the characters will develop further in the eyes of the viewer as they face life and all of its trials and tribulations. All deal with it differently some to great success others to their ruin; but in the end this system of theirs sustains itself a general balance remains. The show comments on the questions the modern American is often forced to consider. I do not think history will forget the Sopranos the show which redefined what many expect when they sit down to watch TV. In all likelihood you will be totally captivated. Each epidode builds on episode various tentions are layed down and are pulled as the season builds to its final climax. The final episode of this season stands in my opinion as one of the best episodes of the Sopranos."	5.0	Without a doubt like no other	2004-12-17	3	1	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AK2Q7ML2RANDN	A. Eby	&quot;The Sopranos&quot; received a huge amount of positive press when it debuted in 1999 on HBO and viewing the first season will show you why.  A superbly written, flawlessly acted show, it is, hands down, one of the best shows on TV, if not the best.  Soon to begin its fourth season, the first takes one back to where it all began.  Unlike other shows that require a season to find their way, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; immediately took off and, within the first few minutes of the first episode, solidly established every character and presented an enthralling plot, with various fascinating subplots.  With hardly a misstep in the first thirteen episodes, the first season is a riveting piece of television history.	5.0	The Best Show on TV	2002-06-26	4	3	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ATHNYP7D3RW1A	A. Gavin	"For whatever reason The Sopranos remained the only real HBO drama that I hadn't seen. I've been a huge  HBO original programming fan as far back as Dream On, but I just never got around to Tony and crew.Until now.It's interesting to see it after the fact, after having watched Rome, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, Carnivale, True Blood, The Wire, Big Love, Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, etc. This is an intermediate stage in the development of today's long form visual medium. The Sopranos, like all HBO dramas, is very well written. Where it shines is in character building. Not development per se, but in the creation of unique and interesting personalities. The casting is spot on and nearly every member shines as distinctive and amusing individuals. But inherently, this is a recipe HBO has really mastered, blending casting, writing, and acting to make seamless characters.It isn't (in this first season) as well plotted as some of its sucessor shows. Less happens, and the events are a bit less dramatic. This isn't to say that nothing's going on, but we don't have the momentous and shocking events every fifteen minutes that are the hallmark of the mid 2000s shows. I suspect later seasons may grow into this. The net net of this was that I wasn't quite as riveted by the events, and certain subplots dragged, but the characters certainly kept me watching.There is something to note here, which is the odd dichotomy of the like-ability of most of the cast and their ""trade"" as cold and murderous mobsters. The show strikes a slightly comic and not entirely realistic tone with regard to this, making it easier to disregard the violence and keep on liking them. And like them I certainly did, particularly Tony. James Gandolfini shines in this role, nailing his particular brand of goomba charisma. His mother is perfect too (although fun to hate) as the manipulative bitch that she is.I was also a bit ambivalent about the central premise of the mafia boss in psychotherapy. Although I did like the shrink, and I liked the amusing way in which Tony would sometimes describe a happening in mild mannered terms while the visuals showed it ""the way it really was."" I often enjoy this this sort of humor. At times the overall conceit felt a little forced, but it basically works.So I'll start in on season 2, particularly as I've heard the series only gets better."	4.0	Mob revisted	2011-05-27	4	3	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1KZRCS8VP6FBZ	"A. Hebert ""digit@l embryo"""	This is an exceptionally riveting series and an excellent portrayal of Italian-American organized crime.  However, in my opinion, the DVD set is way overpriced.  Talk about price-gouging! Even though I didn't pay the MSRP, I still ended up paying about $7 per episode! That's the most expensive series I ever purchased.  Is it worth it? Even though I feel I'm getting ripped off, I can't see how I will be able to stop myself from going out and purchasing all five seasons.

After viewing the season that I purchased from Amazon, I was surprised to see just how much it they had altered if once the the show went into syndication on A&E.;  Finally seeing the show as it was intended, I am amazed and very entertained.The characters possess a depth that few do on any television show I'd ever seen.

However, not being rich denies me certain priveleges, such as owning this series on dvd.  I mean, come on!  The first season is going for $40-50, used!!  I just can't afford it, and you're lucky if you can!  This would get a much better review if HBO made it more affordable.  No matter how good it is, it doesn't make me want to go bankrupt buying it!

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2F7KIN0SL00I6	"Amazon Customer ""Proverb"""	The first season of the Sopranos sets the stage for an amazing drama of life in a crime family and life in a rather disfunctional family.  Not having HBO myself, I heard all these great things about the Sopranos.  Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it without paying for HBO.  After literally years of hearing people rave about the show, I decided to rent the first season on DVD and see what all the fuss was about.  After the first episode, I couldn't figure out what the big deal was.  Being a fan of Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, and Casino, I was disappointed with the first episode.  I decided that even great shows have bad episodes and all these people raving, must have something to back up their cheers.  I watched the second episode and was in awe.  I found a new love.  The second episode blew me away, and there was no turning back.  I watched the last 11 episodes of this season in two days.  Needless to say, I didn't do anything else.If you haven't seen the Sopranos and want to know what the hype is, this DVD is for you, but be careful, you too could become addicted to this show.	5.0	Setting the stage for greatness!!	2002-09-11	3	2	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ASHSB2HYXKTUJ	Amy Ebert	Blu-ray packaging is nice, with fold-out access to all 5 discs in their individual 'push' button hub.  Great price on Amazon, too.Video quality does, occasionally, become fairly grainy and lackluster during various scenes throughout all of the episodes (similar in the way the DVD versions did).  At other times, it's pretty darn good.  Overall, however, a great video upgrade to the old DVDs in every aspect.  No problems with audio quality, with a nice selection of subtitles and audio tracks (5 audio choices, 12 subtitle choices).Audio for English uses DTS-HD MA 5.1 Ch.  AVC 1080p.I agree with the English subtitle complaints from a previous post, and had come to the same conclusion.  They do a good job with the subtitles overall, but it could be more accurate and with better attention to detail.The last disc includes a seen-before interview with David Chase and Peter Bogdanovich, with 2 behind-the-scenes featurettes.I really hope HBO doesn't take forever to release seasons 2-5 on Blu-ray.	5.0	"""Meet Tony Soprano"", first season at 1080p."	2009-12-05	5	3	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I've been debating for some time now on actually writing up reviews for the six seasons of `The Sopranos', the hands down greatest show to even be embraced by television.  I didn't want to do it an injustice by not giving the review's everything I had and I feared I didn't have the ability to really do this right.  Then, last night while watching the Emmy's I was hit with this surge of determination.  Watching the show win top honors I felt the need to reemphasize its legendary existence.  Watching both Gandolfini and Falco get robbed of their awards I felt the incessant need to rant and rave about their godlike acting abilities so that the rest of the reviewers here at Amazon would know that it was a complete and utter travesty to have two of televisions most impressive and orgasmic actors walk away empty handed.  So, this review will mark the start of my `Sopranos' rants.  I doubt I'll write and post these back to back, but they will all come sooner or later.From the very beginning `The Sopranos' was an eye opener.  It was the most innovative show on television and it continued to improve from its first to its final season.  Not very many shows can attest to that, to truly enriching itself with each passing episode.  In fact I really don't know if any dramatic show can claim that apart from `The Sopranos'.  I had this conversation with my wife last night as we watched once and for all the show come to an end.  `The Sopranos' was for dramatic television what `Friends' was for the comedic sitcom.  It's a show that was so brilliant, so effortlessly captivating and influential that it will never be recreated.  There will never be another television show this impressive, this universally lauded and appreciated just like there will never be another comedy to top and or reach the cultural phenomenon that was `Friends'.  They are two iconic pieces of television history.In the first season we are introduced to the Soprano family.  The most impressive thing here is that we're not just introduced to `the family' but we're introduced, quite intimately, to Tony Sopranos immediate family, wife, daughter and son.  Like the show creator David Chase said last night, this is a story about a gangster who is living the same life we all are, taking his children to school and putting food on his families table.  That's what makes this show so culturally valuable.  It doesn't just illuminate the clich&eacute;d assumption of crime families but it really strips these human beings down to the rudiments of their very existence.  We get to experience Tony Soprano for the man he really is and not the faade that he may want to put up, the tough guy exterior that all gangster assumedly possess.The first season exposes struggles within the family, both immediate and professional.  With the death of one family boss comes the birth of a new boss, and while Tony may be the overall favorite for the position he must decide if taking the job is worth the distain between family, namely his Uncle Junior.  The stress of his particular situation is taking a toll of Tony's health and this is manifest in sudden blackouts.  For this he concedes to visit a therapist, Doctor Melfi, who ends up being one of the key essential characters in Tony's life.  Throughout the season the issue of loyalty is explored, whether doing the right thing by your `family' is the right thing morally.  This issue is explored even further and with greater detail and delicacy in season two as the apparent handling of the disloyal takes an emotional and even physical toll on `the family'.  Season one is mainly here to introduce and make nice, get us accustomed to and comfortable with the cast of characters.  Everyone here becomes so real to us.I'm a huge campaigner for the idea that James Gandolfini has single handedly created the greatest television character in the history of television.  His performance is above and beyond what many have been able to accomplish in their entire careers.  James is able to really get inside Tony's head and flesh him out for us.  We discover and fall in love with this man who is only doing what he knows how to do and he's only living the life he knows how to live, but underneath that criminal veneer he is just like you and me, with wants and desires and pains and fears and responsibilities that he does his best to take care of.  And yet while you realize all of this James is doing something utterly marvelous.  He's making you sympathize and rationalize with a killer, a philanderer and a liar among other things.  You look at the man that Tony Soprano is upon outside appearance and you'll find yourself disgusted, yet when you watch this show you find yourself fascinated and ultimately understanding.  This I tell you now is the power of brilliant and dare-I-say `iconic' acting.The other actors in this series are phenomenal as well.  Edie Falco is just fantastic as Tony's wife Carmela.  She plays Carm with the perfect mixed bag of admiration and exasperation.  Michael Imperioli is also brilliant as young Christopher Moltisanti, and Tony Sirico is flawless as Paulie.  Lorraine Bracco doesn't present a whole lot on the outset but as the season presses forward her character becomes more central to Tony's life and thus makes a strong impact.  I will admit to never really finding myself adjusting the character of Silvio Dante, and it's not that I feel Steve Van Zandt does a bad job playing him; it's just that the character himself never really grew on me.  The real standouts, at least in season one that is, aside from Gandolfini and Falco were none other than Dominic Chianese and Nancy Marchand as Uncle Junior and Tony's meandering mother Livia.  The late Nancy Marchand is phenomenal here, completely loathe-worthy but overall phenomenal.  Actually, neither her character nor Uncle Junior really give us much to love but both Marchand and Chianese are so in tune with their characters that we can do nothing but respect their performances.The other actors here are given their opportunities to shine, but most of this will happen in later seasons.  Take for instance Vincent Pastore who plays Tony's best friend Pussy.  While he has his moments within the first season it's really his second (and final) season that prove to be his finest accomplishment on the show, and Christopher's girlfriend Adriana, played by the beautiful Drea de Matteo, is really nothing more than a prop within the first season but as the show progresses, especially in seasons four and five, she flourishes beautifully.  Speaking of flourishing, both Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler who play Meadow and AJ Soprano (the children) establish themselves within the first season but really gain steam as the show presses on.  As they grow up with the show they really come into their own as actors and ultimately as characters, especially Meadow.  Aida Turturro also makes her presence known and heard as Tony's loudmouthed, self centered, ultimately horrid and detestable sister Janice, and she does this effortlessly and orgasmically as the series progresses.So, that's about all I can really say for season one (I guess there was a lot here about the show in general) and I'll surely rehash this discussion with my review of season two (whenever that comes).  Just know that for those of us who have experienced this television show in all its glory, there will never be another show to take its place, and for those of you who have yet to experience this brilliance, what are you waiting for!  With each episode there is more to love.  Take this as a warning from me...a life without `The Sopranos' is a life wasted!	5.0	Without doubt the greatest show to ever grace the small screen...this is the beginning...	2007-09-17	4	3	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AAZ59RTAODTKY	Andrew Murphy	"Ok - if you haven't watched the best tv series in the last 30 years - the Sopranos - what rock are you living under?  Really?This show includes the best writing and acting on tv today.  James Gandolfini is very Brando-esque in his tortured portrayal as Tony Soprano.  Michael Imperioli introduces us to Christopher Molitsanti, a budding gangster with striking assets and flaws.  He really lays the groundwork in the 1st season for the awesome stuff he does later on.Again the writing though really steals the show.  There are no italian ""types"" on this show.  Everyone is multi-dimensional yet accesible enough for anyone law-abiding or not to identify with.Favorite Episode: ""College"" - definitely one of the best episodes ever.  Gandolfini is superb in a dual role as a nuturing and trusting father & as a vengeful gangster after spying a former associate turned government witness.  Tony's preying on the former goomba is captivating and despite the brutal end, you as the viewer will feel justice was served."	5.0	Good Morning Rat!!!	2004-12-02	4	1	3

It is truly a wonderfully entertaining drama series!  Being an Italian-American I can relate to most of the family drama and it is very realistic!  It is refreshing to see a series portray the Italian-Americans as family oriented people that regard the family as being priority.  The writing is beyond genius and the actors bring reality to the characters they portray.  If you were to ask me my favorite character, I wouldn't know what to say.  I love them all!

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AE8RQHFMSLN0D	"Anthony Damato ""Law professor"""	. I watched all 13 episodes of The Sopranos: First Season, in the course of two days.  I hadn't seen any of the episodes before, and I'm glad I hadn't, because as one gigantic movie the effect is bigger than the sum of its parts. The characters and scenes weave in and out, and they're not interrupted by an artificial one-week pause the way you'd see the serial on HBO.  I think the outstanding person in the cast was Lorraine Bracco as the psychiatrist; she has a clipped way of speaking that is positively riveting.  There was nothing phony about her psychiatry even if it was a bit on the Freudian side, because at least she put forth her hypotheses and let her patient, Tony Soprano, react to them.  I think James Gandolfini was fine in the lead role--better than DeNiro in a similar role in The Analyst--though just a tad not menacing enough.  Why am I being picky--the entire cast was good, which is another way of saying that it was a brilliantly directed serial by a director who knows actors and how to get the most out of them.  Some lines in the show are uproariously funny--better than any sitcom humor, and thank God for no laughter track.  The sets and cinematography is first class, so this really amounts to a six-hour movie that has the look of a multimillion dollar Hollywood feature.  And as an investment, I would say that the DVD is something you'll want to see again and again over the years, show your friends, and keep as a real treasure.	5.0	One of the Best Things TV has Ever Done	2000-12-25	46	38	8

Not only I haven't watched it before - I haven't even heard of it and didn't know what it was about. And... it was love at first sight. I didn't have a possibility to watch all the episodes on TV, so not long ago I ordered the first season at Amazon.You know, all the great movies, even our favourite ones, have one common demerit - they are too short. But in case with ""The Sopranos""... It was a long-long pleasure (680 if to count in minutes, and 6 - in evenings). Still a bit sad because it's over, but on the other hand I have other seasons ahead.What's the everyday routine of a mobster? Does he brush his teeth in the morning like ordinary people? What's his relationship with his wife? How does he explain his kids he's in the mafia? What's it like to be a wise guy? You don't get answers for these questions from big mob movies which emphasize the general mafia aspects mostly.""The Sopranos"" is a must for all the mob flicks devotees, and if you are not a sucker for such movies you'll definately become one after watching this great TV show."	5.0	DAD, ARE YOU IN THE MAFIA?	2005-12-18	7	7	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3LGMPE596T6OI	Ari B. Domnitz	On December 22, 2000, I recived the Sopranos First Season on DVD.  It was a Birthday/Holiday gift form my girlfriend of 5 years.  Over the course of the next week and a half, if there was any doubt of my whereabouts, it was a safe bet I was watching the next episonde. I am a 23 year old actor.  My VHS collection numbers 350. My DVD collection a mere 20, however the Sopranos box set delivered more hours of riveting enjoyment than anything has in a long time. The show is, in my opinion a perfect blend of satire, drama, social comentary and fantastic story telling.  Every person I introduce to the Sopranos is throughly impressed with all aspects of the series.  On a personal note, I think James Gandolfini has finally given us something that Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino have long strived to achive. Gandolfini brings a familiarity to this roll that is one of the key elements to the show's success.  He has created a character that is not out of reach for the veiwing audience.  Edie Falco and Nancie Marchand are also invaluable components to  the creation of the overall feeling of accesability.  While we may not all know what it is to have an AK-47 within arms reach, we do know what it is to have a nagging mother and a confused and judgmental spouse.  The icing on the cake of this series is its supporting cast, the boys at the club and kids at home create an atmosphere that is simply tantilizing to the veiwing audience.  I recomend this set to mafia fans and house wives alike.  Get it for the gangster in you, after all...a hit is a hit.	5.0	How the Sopranos saved Christmas.	2001-01-10	42	37	5

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1SDERJU0IHXEG	"""barober"""	I always swore I would buy a DVD Player when/if Star Wars came out on DVD.  But this collection made me buy one long before George Lucas got around to making DVDs.  I caught a few reruns of the first season of The Sopranos before watching every episode of the second season, and I knew that I had to own the first season.  I circled 12/12 on my calendar, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  Sleep is for the weak.  I watched every episode in sequence over the course of a few days, and I can't wait to start over.  When anyone says, &quot;Hey, I didn't get a chance to see that episode of The Sopranos,&quot; I'll gladly stop anything else and fire up the DVD player and watch with them as they fill in their blanks.  Is it too early to ask when the second season will be available?Oh yeah, an actual review might be nice.  This show is addictive for too many reasons to list.  All of the mini-plots mean something, all of the main characters are developed and exposed and... interesting!  And no matter what you may think of mobs or the mafia or whatever, the show has a certain basic morality that works for just about anyone.  Respect your elders, provide for and protect your family, mean things when you say them...This doesn't feel like fiction.  Check it out.  You'll love it.	5.0	Wow, this is very addictive!	2000-12-18	23	20	3

Watching this years after seeing the pilot, the acting is still stellar, the concept classic (Greek drama, Italian opera? Can't make up my mind.) Was Gandolfini Tony Soprano in the flesh and spirit, for the time he appeared on the screen? Yep.What I do miss is the original music. What often happens when a television series goes to streaming is that it loses music, or at least the original score.  I have seen this with SNL - you have to go far back in time to find any musical performances on the edited episodes that are streamed. I have old videos, chopped up with commercials, that contain the original SNL shows and the mostly stellar artists with one-of-a-kind stage shows in front of the camera.  I'm so glad I never threw those things out.Maybe I'm wrong about the Sopranos music, but it's been changed. If you've never seen the original, you won't notice it. If you loved the original, you will. It won't matter much - Tony Soprano is still Tony. Dr. Melfi is stil the coolest.	5.0	Thank you, amazon prime!	2014-05-21	1	1	0

It is without a doubt in my mind, the best series on television today.  If you don't have HBO and you haven't had a chance to see the show, I highly recommend getting the DVD sets.HOWEVER... as a DVD, I was a little disappointed in the special features.  There IS a one hour interview with David Chase (the creator of the show), and he also does an audio commentary for one of the episodes, but I guess I was hoping for a little more.I would have really liked to have seen some features on the actors.  Maybe audio commentary from them on some other episodes.All in all the show is incredible, but maybe down the road the DVD will have better special features.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ATJD01SS8NTJM	booboo bear	"The season starts off in an interesting way with a middle aged alpha male seeing a shrink because of what he's told is a 'panic attack'. As he speaks to the mental health professional it becomes apparent he is somehow involved in the shady business of organized crime and despite his relatively common appearance is pretty well off with a small family and a big home. Of course, being an American show, it breaks into a chase scene inside of the first ten minutes. My immediate impression was 'uh-huh... same old same old' but the exchange between characters from two completely different backgrounds (good looking female shrink and Joe tough guy in involved in retrospective reflection) grabbed me. It becomes especially fascinating when we find out he talks to the duckies like Dr. Doolittle but has a smile like an amused psychopath. We quickly learn he is brutal, violent, very animated (almost cartoonish) and very scary but just as likable in a dark and menacing way. His aging mom is every middle aged guy's nightmare come true and it's easy to identify with his common manner. Fred Flintstone with an attitude. Wilma is pretty much Wilma except now she has blonde hair.The premier episode shows Fred hitting on his lovely lady shrink and introducing the families through his reminiscences. Uncle Junior is a cantankerous codger, his nephew Christopher is a young hothead and inside of the first half hour a couple of guys have been beat up and one gets whacked. Of course there are all sorts of references to Italians. The only character introduced in the first episode who isn't of Italian descent is Hesh who makes it known immediately and often that he is a Jew who gives Fred advice. He's a smart Jew. Pebbles is pubescent, spoiled and at least a little whiny. ""Our existence on this earth is a puzzle"" says Wilma and the viewer is encouraged to put together the picture right from the beginning. It's an interesting jigsaw for sure.One of the reasons why The Soprano families are so easy to relate to for most people is because, like your average Joe Sixpac and Sally soccer mom, they get a lot of their big picture of the world through what their television tells them. It's influence is just as pervasive and responsible for how they see themselves in their  life's role as it is for real people.As beastly as Fred and his cohorts might be the real monster isn't really introduced till the second episode. Superman has Lex Luthor and Batman has The Joker and both of these superheros would run screaming from Fred's mom. She renders Prozac ineffective and exudes death from every pore with a black poison cloud for a sidekick.This is a really interesting series right from the get go and anyone who actually believes fans watch it for the profane language and T&A; should consider a therapist themselves."	5.0	Excellent right from the start	2007-09-07	1	0	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2EENLV6OQ3DYM	Brian D. Rubendall	If you like gangster stories, you've got to see &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;  Though the show isn't as realistic as &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; nor as grandiose as &quot;The Godfather,&quot; it still ranks high on the list of Wiseguy entertainment.  The acting is uniformly excellent, with stars James Gandolfini, Lorraine Bracco and Edie Falco creating strong believeable characters.  But it is the supporting cast that make the series so memorable, particularaly the tour-deforce acting of Nancy Marchand as Tony Soprano's EXTREMELY difficult mother.  Tony's &quot;crew&quot; consists of actors who've played small parts in many other gangster films, particularly &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;  Also excellent are the young actor and actress who play Tony's sometimes suffering children.  They strike just the right note between loving their dad and being unsettled by how he makes his living.If there is one quibble with the series, it is that sometimes it sacrifices plausibility for humor (but not nearly as badly as does the recent lame gangster film &quot;Analyze This&quot;).  But overall, this is a series for gangster buffs that can actually be enjoyed by those less enamored of &quot;life inside&quot; tales because of its great storytelling.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3CJETIDP7FADH	"Brian Melton ""Jimmy Can't Dance"""	I am a big fan of The Sopranos. Tony Soprano is such a beautiful character and I fall more in love with him (James) and the cast every week. I ran out the other day and splurged on the first season collector's set. I took it home, like a boy at Christmas, and unwrapped it. When I popped in the first tape though, there was this ringing...sort of like a modem or telephone. It made the first tape unwatchable. I returned it from where I purchased it, and exchanged it for another set. I took it home and watched all the episodes, somewhat pleased with what I saw. I popped in the 5th and final tape and it was broken. The tape kept cutting in and out and the sound was horrible. I have to take back my set today (FOR THE SECOND TIME). Take my advice, save yourself some trouble and rent it at Blockbuster.	2.0	The show is amazing...the videos are terrible.	2001-04-24	18	1	17

What a great show!  It holds up not only in quality but also in its broad arc. I am halfway through season 3, and there is a flow that I have not seen in any other show.

Great story, great acting, believable characters...  Thankfully this is on cable instead of network television.  ABC passed on this and HBO went for it.  I bet they're thankful!  Having the DVD series to watch instead of waiting for next week's episode was a real treat.  My wife and I love this show and it's about the only reason we continue to pay for HBO.  We play the trivia game on HBO's website and we are truly looking forward to season 3 in March.  We also can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD.  If you haven't seen this show yet, I can't recommend it enough.  As long as you aren't offended by some graphic language, violence and sex, you'll enjoy this as much as we do. This is not a children's show, by any stretch, but it is really good entertainment for consenting adults.	5.0	The GREATEST show on television	2001-01-02	1	0	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Along with Sex And The City, the HBO original series The Sopranos took the world by storm in the late-1990s with its cutting edge drama and acerbic wit. A cross between The Godfather and the traditional nuclear sitcom family, the show provided a unique experience for a niche audience that quickly developed into a barrage of dedicated fans. Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...The Sopranos (Season 1) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the self-titled series premiere in which the groundwork for the show is set when Tony Soprano visits a therapist in hopes of ending his panic attacks (sounds similar to the plot for Analyze This!). In his initial session with the beautiful Dr. Melfi, Tony confides in her the stressful aspects of his extraordinary life - a demanding job, an unhappy wife, and rebellious kids (among other problems)... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""College"" in which Tony takes his daughter on a college orientation trip to Maine where he encounters a former (and current) enemy, and ""A Hit is a Hit"" in which Tony strikes out when he attempts to make friends outside of his close-knit circle...Below is a list of episodes included on The Sopranos (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (The Sopranos)Episode 2 (46 Long)Episode 3 (Denial, Anger, Acceptance)Episode 4 (Meadowlands)Episode 5 (College)Episode 6 (Pax Soprana)Episode 7 (Down Neck)Episode 8 (The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti)Episode 9 (Boca)Episode 10 (A Hit is a Hit)Episode 11 (Nobody Knows Anything)Episode 12 (Isabella)Episode 13 (I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano)The DVD Report"	5.0	A truly great series...	2005-04-20	4	3	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A118K3NR8Y9YJ9	Bryan DEmilio	For anyone who has never seen the Sopranos before, where else better to start than from the beginning of the story.  Right from the first episode the viewer is drawn to the character of Tony Soprano, a ruthless mobster, because of his love for these DUCKS that make a home in his pool.  The off beat characterization ties into this psychological dramatic comedy that deals with family as much as it does about the mob.  Then, like any other great story, it gets more involved and brings the viewer to love all the chatracers (even the ones that are hateful).  Tell me of an italian family (or possibly any family for that matter) that can not relate to how Tony's family acts.  It will have you roaring with laughter.  This is one of the few intelligent series that can have you laughing one second and then be totally serious the next.  No one should have to go through life without ever having the Sopranos experience.	5.0	A MUST!!!!	2001-03-28	6	6	0

I almost ordered HBO to be able to watch the series. I am glad I did not spend the money to watch it on HBO. This show is OK but it isn't the awesome show that most people say it is to watch. First of all, not disrespect to the deceased James Gandolfini but Tony Soprano is disgusting! I do not know why a woman would want to have sex with him. He is nasty in appearance. I just don't see a guy like him having affair after affair with beautiful women like is portrayed on this show. He is hairy, overweight and has the personality of a gnat. The acting on the show is not what I expected either. Also, I would love to smack Anthony Jr. right in the mouth.

However, I've heard so much about the show that I decided to watch the DVD set. In a word, it is Fabulous! The very complex hero yet anti-hero, Tony Soprano, is compelled to see a psychiatrist after he has a panic attack.  Neither having the attack nor seeing a woman shrink is  conducive to his job as a tough guy mafia man. Unlike &quot;Analyze This,&quot; which had a similar premise, this story is not played for laughs.  There is some brilliant writing in this too with the psychiatrist appearing in Tony's dreams as both a sexual interest and then as his mother!  The late Nancy Marchand is absolutely great as Tony's scheming mother, who is quite the matriarchal manipulator among the gang family.  You will be absolutely hooked upon seeing the first episode so it is good that you've got 4 episodes per disk.  I might go back to watching tv if more of it were like this.	5.0	Outstanding!

The show was very cleverly constructed to lay the groundwork for the series premise that gansters are just like us, with the same problems.  The contrast of everyday troubles, angst, and unbridled violence continues to catch you up and carry you along.

Despite knowing he's a stone cold killer, I find myself routing for Tony Soprano as he tries to navigate the politics of the mob, stay ahead of the cops,  address his panic disorder, and be a decent father (really) to his two kids.  With a mother that would have driven a saint into the mob, or at least onto the psychiatrist' couch,  Tony Soprano is one of the most dimensional and accessible characters in the history of television.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2K28JHMIY3XKZ	Charles Andrews	How do you rate the most original series to grace TV in many years?  The HBO format allows for a more honest presentation than any commercially available venue.  The one failing of the set is that HBO waited so long to bring it out.  More than a year and a half after it debuted and after season 2.  The story are characters all develop well beyond the first year.  This may be the best testament to the series is that in year 1 the producers were breaking new ground but still tredding softly.  I think HBO perpetuates their mistake as year 2 won't be available until year 4 is about to start.  The delay in availability hurts the appeal.  For the uninitiated these could be a vehicle to become involved and up to date.  The release schedule reduces these to collector items.	3.0	A Start	2001-09-16	12	3	9

This season was great but after this season they changed tony sopranos voice and it sounds kinda funny the way he talk at some lines, but i wonder why they changed his voice but this was a great season. I saw all the soprano seasons on HBO on demand and they were great, if you have io digital cable then thats more better when you want to watch movies, watch shows, watch animation and all those other stuff, thats what i did to the sopranos and its better then just spending 99.00 on a boxset cause thats how much the soprano boxset cost at stores but i have HBO on demand and thats better, and it shows all the soprano seasons and i watched them, so this was a great season.	5.0	I have HBO on demand so i don't need to buy the boxsets	2008-05-22	1	1	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A17BOM7U8FLEXC	Chicago	I typically don't watch the 'popular' shows when they are on, so this is the first I've seen of the Sopranos.  I was surprised by the depth of the story, and this one is definitely a keeper.  While Tony Soprano is an obvious thug, murderer and liar, the writing very cleverly shows the 'human' side of Tony with compassion and humor.  While you may hate the deeds, you can't help but love Tony Soprano.  That is a difficult balancing act, and the acting of James Gandolfino is exquisite.  He makes you laugh with Tony, feel his deepest pain, cheer for him, and yet at times want to smash him in the face.  This is one of the best written and acted shows ever made, and rates with the best of them.  There definitely are moments of violence and blood (though not as many as you might think) when I had to look away, but I quickly got hooked on this show and have just started season 3.	5.0	Great show	2014-06-10	0	0	0

I'm glad Amazon picked up The Sopranos because you don't realize little things you've missed until you watch it again. First time around I didn't appreciate what a great actor Gandolfini was in this gig. The first season has more violence than I'd recalled. It seemed very real here because it was so well done. Lorraine Bracco and Edie Falco are very good, but Gandolfini makes the Sopranos. The mental struggles Tony Soprano deals with are vivid in the first season. If you've never seen this series before, you've missed one of television's greats.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3V9WAOTC14KNU	Christopher L Beckwith	A remarkable TV series that sustains the complexities of good film making and is worthy of the praise heaped upon it. All else having been said, it's worth noting how the the series is steeped in the lore of its cinematic geneology. The characters routinely refer to the great mafia epics Godfather and Goodfellas as though guiding oracles, reverentially quoting dialogue and invoking Coppolla and Scorsese as though Yoda-like figures in the mafia cosmology. Of course, the show, ever hip to itself,  contains cast members who appeared in those films, and the playful, self-conscious references to the earlier films are used with terrific effect. For example, Imperioli, who plays Christopher, shoots a bakery boy in the foot for making smart remarks, but the true joke, for those who remember &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; is that Imperioli played the hapless barboy who Pesci shot in the foot. Ever mindful of its pedigree, The Sopranos' tongue-in-cheek subtext is witty and alive in ways no other televison show can lay claim to. It also, alas, marks the end of the cycle for the genre. After &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; a soap and bullets opera that capitalizes to the full on what's come before, one can only say &quot;It's been done, what else can be said?&quot;	5.0	Post Modern Mafia Saga	2001-01-17	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3775OP5VTX5ON	"Coolkayaker ""ck1"""	I am a humongous fan of Gangster flicks.  Even Casino, heralded as overlength and slow, captured my attention from the get-go. But this Sopranos cult of personality is far overblown.  The first 2-3 episodes grate likes nails on a chalkboard with Mama Sopranos constant whining!  Although we do meet an interesting family, full of personality, every time there is an interesting story line, like Uncle Juni making Boss, or Christopher's madcap truck jacking, or Carmella's flicker of romance with the Father, it is lost and the plot moves on. And the Dr. Melfi shrink scenes: break out the No-Doz!  Perhaps I am expecting too much, but the benefits of a seamless motion picture (Casino, Goodfellas, etc.) rather than an ongoing series plotline is painfully obvious:  short, undeveloped plot pieces forming a montage of characters with no substance.  Sure, each character is very well developed, each with goals, dreams, and a &quot;heart&quot;.  But like an ethereal cloud lofting above a snowcapped mountain, the thin whisps of story fail to ever provide a foothold for our beloved characters to access our minds.  Anticipate seasons two and three to be more of the same... and for that, I am glad to have a friend videotape it for me rather than shell out for the DVD.

Pilliod	Many viewers clearly loved the characterizations and found the mixture of mundane family life with mafia family life to be brilliant, but I disliked this show because I found the characters pathetic and dull. Most of what I remember is a bunch of glowering punctuated by a few arguments and gunshots.The bulk of characters seem to represent a very mediocre brand of evil. They are human failures not because they gleefully engage in villainy, but simply because they are incompetent at living their lives. The acting, sound, and camera work were all quite competent, but since I was bored by the story, it was all wasted effort as far as I'm concerned.Certainly I'm aware of how popular the show is; the only other negative reviews seem to consist of people who can't deal with language or feel unfairly stereotyped. I figured I should take the time to say some people simply didn't think this was a very good drama.	2.0	Couldn't have cared less	2007-06-30	11	5	6

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A12RMAJXRPQWTY	C.Wallace	"I just finished watching the entire first season set. I had not watched the Sopranos before. Of course, I knew the basic story because the series got a lot of media hype.First of all, I have to praise the acting. All of the actors did a great job. Did James Gandolfini immerse himself in his role as Tony Soprano or what? How about Tony's mother, Livia, brilliantly portrayed by Nancy Marchand? Talk about cold and manipulative! Lady Macbeth step aside, please.It seems to me that this season's episodes captured the mundane side of evil. Most of the gangsters are portrayed as basically ignorant men, too lazy to get out and earn an honest living, and greedy/brutal enough to hurt people in their pursuit of cash. This is not a sympathetic portrayal of mob life. Ounces of apparent glory are counterbalanced by tons of banality.Tony Soprano is an evil man. His psychoanalyst, who plays a major role in this season, probably would never put it so simply, camouflaging Tony's evil with psychobabble. But Tony murders people in cold blood. True, his victims usually betrayed some code of honor. But it's still evil. Tony profits from armed robbery. He's involved with loan extortion. Innocent people suffer as a result of the kind of crimes that permit Tony and his family to live in such great comfort.And Tony has a family. There's a son in middle school and a daughter entering college. They have all the problems that most ""normal"" children have at this point in their lives. Plus, they have to deal with the kind of work that Tony does. They are usually well buffered from all of the viciousness, but they know the basics. How will this affect them?His wife is Carmela, most effectively portrayed by Edie Falco. She seems to be a ""good person"" who can handle the fact that her very comfortable lifestyle is supported by her gangster husband.Essentially, this is a ""soap opera"" about people with ties to those who throw bodies into rivers. Attached to the bodies are cinder blocks. That sort of thing.  Take away the criminal activity and you get the kind of bickering and betrayal that often plagues even the most ""normal"" of families.I found it to be very entertaining. Clever scripts. Great acting."	5.0	Entertaining	2009-12-26	0	0	0

The writing is incredible.  The twists, turns, devotion to family, the family's devotion to a seemingly evil criminal empire.  Getting to watch a certified psychopath come home from a long day of strangling ""rats"" to deal with his kid playing too much Nintendo or get a load of crap from his neurotic mother is just priceless.  In truth, the rest of the seasons don't really compare to this one.  It's just amazing.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3TPDK0VU2MX4I	Daniel Lukoff	About two weeks ago I got my copy of the first season in the mail, and was estatic to finally have all the episodes, in order, to be watched at my disposal. Up until then, I had only been able to watch whatever episodes were available at the local DVD rental, which was quite a hassle.Within two days of recieving this boxed set, my girlfriend and I had watched the whole set. Four episodes one day, then nine the next.If you ever enjoyed Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Scarface, The Godfather... any of these classics, or even if you were ever the one rooting for the badguys in all the crime movies we've loved for ages.. watch this.The Sopranos -- The story of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged New Jersey mobster who everybody knows runs the show, without the official title of &quot;Boss&quot;. It's his family--wife, son, daughter, and his family--friends who are like brothers, also partners in crime.It's something society has been subtley begging for, for ages. Without someone standing up and saying &quot;look, we wanna' see money, blood, anger, frustrations, and love. We want to see some hard folks do some hard things and show how it is to live the life we all want but are too afraid of our society-induced norms to live&quot;.WARNING: Do not be alarmed if while/after watching this show you want a life of crime, for this is a common side effect of watching The Sopranos.	5.0	Definitely one of the best television series ever aired.	2002-04-01	10	9	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1UL0FO9AGP4LS	"Daniel Putkowski ""novelist, pilot, world trav..."	Welcome to the dysfunctional world of the Soprano Crime Family. It all begins with a panic attack for patriarch Tony Soprano who is a capo (or captain with his own crew) in the beginning of this high melodrama. After finding nothing wrong with Tony, he's sent to a psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi. From there we meet the entire family, including wife Carmella, Tony's children, his associates, his enemies, and his annoying mother. This is what I refer to as gothic drama because it is so ornate in it's construction that there are thousands of little details to be seen among the big brush strokes of the surface story of the usual mafia activities: loan sharks, gambling, etc. Considering this show is now almost 15 years old, it is remarkable how poignant it remains. The common themes of loyalty and love are timeless, but the prescient observance of drug abuse, children run wild, collapse of family values, ring loud and clear to an audience today. There are funny moments, too, usually punctuated by a clever line that underscores the absurdity of it all. But don't be confused, these characters share a sociopathic sensibility that rears its ugly head. From the quality of the acting, to the locations, to the dialog, the Sopranos rises above regular drama, ascending the heights of the genre. I enjoyed this show when it was on television and enjoyed it even more, watching this season launch the series a second time. Please note: This is not a series for the sensitive or squeamish. Every offense is played to the hilt, in context, and without shame.	5.0	American Mob Gothic	2013-06-08	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A23QOAXJSWIBS6	"Daniel S. Russell ""syzygy121"""	I've been surprised by some of the reviews that have trashed this show for being stereotypical and maligning Italians.  I would reject that criticism outright.  What I see here are Italian Americans wrestling with their own demons.  No one can deny that the Mob is alive and well, especially in the NY/NJ area.  It is interesting that in the 7th or 8th episode, we are privy to a conversation between Dr. Melfi and her ex-husband about Italian defamation and the Mob.  Clearly, the writers have heard the criticism and have woven it into the text of the show.  I find this move masterful!But, let's back up a bit...the whole premise of the show is that Tony Soprano can't handle the life of crime anymore.  He and other characters live with regret and nightmares.  Their relationships are broken and need  fixed.  This is a show about a particular group of Americans dealing with the dysfunctionality that life holds for us: good vs. evil, love vs. hate, truth vs. lies, forgiveness vs. vengeance.  I think the show is less about Italian Americans or the Mob as it is about crime and guilt and violence and what they do to the human psyche.  In that sense it is less like the Godfather than it is Pulp Fiction or Boogie Nights.Controversy aside, the show is brilliantly written and acted.  Gandolfini is superb, as is the supporting cast.  What a great showcase for Nancy Marchand in the last days of her life.  I am so greatful to have this series available to those of us who don't get HBO.Certainly, it is not for children or the weak at heart, but it is thrilling to have this much power and intensity on a regular basis.  For those of you who hated to see Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs or other such films end, pick up the Sopranos.  The fun, the drama, the real life just won't quit!	5.0	Simply brilliant!	2001-01-11	13	13	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2SE4IZ7SVIV7X	Daniel Wells	This is to the 5 or 6 Italian-Americans who wrote reviews about how racist and sterotypical this series is. Nobody ever said that the Soprano family is the TYPICAL Italian-American family in Jersey and New York, or that every Italian Amercan is involved in organized crime in some way. It is FICTION. Just because you are embarassed that Italians were/are involved in organized crime, don't use &quot;Racism&quot; as your basis for maligning this series. It's &quot;Racism&quot; goes no further than it's premise: an Italian-American family in &quot;the mob&quot;. If that in itself bothers you, steer clear. If not, it is an excellent show; well written and well acted. Buy it.A lot of people have also complained that the quality of the dvd picture is poor if you have an HD tv. I don't know about that... all I know is that the only other way to own the entire series is to have taped it yourself on your vcr, and that would be much lower quality  than these dvds anyway, so quit your whining.All in all, if you like the show, definitely get this dvd set.

All the main characters, with the exception of the shrink and the couple that owned the &#34;mob hangout&#34; restaurant, were self-absorbed narcissists. After awhile, it becomes tedious to watch.

The interaction between gangster Tony, and his aged mother are great topics of conversation every episode.That a mafia capo would be affected by emotional stress is just something I, at least, never thought of...I guess it's a bit of karmic payback for their lifestyle.There is amazing hypocrisy that slaps the viewer in the face:  Tony's wife is a &#34;devout Catholic&#34; who accepts her husband's line of work for its material payoff.  Tony is aghast at his daughter talking about sex, even though he runs a strip club!  Just amazing.	5.0	An Oldie but a Goodie - Stands the Test of Time	2014-05-27	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A57Q87B0TC9IJ	Derek G	It's been said many times but bears repeating - even if you watch nothing else, this show alone is worth signing up for HBO.  On the surface it seems like &quot;yet another&quot; italian mafia flick which only adds to the stereotypes of italian-americans in cinema.  Beneath the surface it is much, much different.If you have not watched the Sopranos, I *strongly* recommend starting from the beginning with this DVD.  There is just so much that happens in each episode, it's like watching 13 different movies.  In my opinion, this season is still the best and after seeing it you will understand why this show has such a strong following.And what separates this show from the &quot;Godfather flicks&quot;?  Well, among some of the stories, you'll see what happens when a mafia heavy cracks under the pressure of dealing with his domineering mother (including a scene where Gandolfini is in a strip bar, popping Prozac and reading a copy of &quot;Elder Care&quot;.)  You'll see what results when gangsters meet gangsta rappers.  And if that isn't enough, you'll find out about 80-year old Uncle-Junior's special talent, one that would never make it on the prime-time networks, and what he has to go through to make sure the guys don't find out about it.It's pricey, but the fact that you're seeing all 13 episodes, each which could have been a movie in and of itself, makes it a worthwhile purchase.	5.0	Wow - what an amazing show!	2001-06-12	12	11	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AZ1H3VLCDR298	Derrick Thomas	When it comes to television show compilations, there are not many I would recommend besides this one. The Sopranos combines humor, sexuality, and violence into a one incredible realistic look into the mafia. I have never seen such a great show on cable before, especially with the great cast it has.James Gandolfini is a suburban mob boss by the name of Tony Soprano, forced to keep up with the times while not being caught by the feds, who have been increasing their pressure on him for years. He has to deal with a mother who treats him like garbage, played by the late great Nancy Marchand. Edie Falco is equally splendid as a wife who is fed up with her life in the mob, and tired with her husband's infedelities. Tony is also forced to weed out traitors in his organization. All this takes a toll on him, and he ends up seeing a shrink, played by the wonderful Lorraine Brocco(you may have seen her in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;).&quot;The Sopranos&quot; is filled on location in New Jersey, which adds the authentic feel to it. The large supporting cast is mainly from Italian descent, whether by accident or by design, and all do a fantastic job. On so many shows you can encounter characters you may not like for various reasons, but I have yet to dislike ANYONE on this show. At the heart it deals with Tony Soprano and his family, but it also delves into the lives of the larger &quot;family&quot; of the enforcers and molls they take up with, creating an ensemble not seen on television in a long time.If you have seen the show, then you will fall in love with this 4-disc set. It includes an audio commentary by series creator David Chase on the pilot episode, and has very good picture quality. This set is a must buy for every fan of the show, whether on DVD or VHS.

Spoilers Below for anyone who has yet to see the first season!Going into the Sopranos, I wasn't sure if it was going to be good or not.  Sometimes shows critics like aren't always the best.  And I'll have to admit, the first 3 or 4 episodes wern't anything special.  Then there was an episode called ""College"", which was definetly one of the finest hours of the season.  From then on every episode continued to be better then the next.  If I had to pick a favorite episode, I'd have to go with the season finale, ""I Dream Of Jeanne Cusomona"", for two reasons.  One, because of the superb scenes between and Tony and his physciatrist, Dr. Melfi(Lorraine Bracco, deliverying probably my favorite performance of the season.)And the second one is when Tony confronts his mother(Nancy Marchand) after she has a stroke.  THis was definelty my favorite scene of the season.There is not a bad performance on this show.  If I had to pick three, it would be Lorraine Bracco, James Gandolfini, and Nancy Marchand.  These three are just perfect.There is a body count, severel people have been killed.  One of the main chracters fate is left open at the end of the season"	5.0	An Amazing First Season!	2008-04-20	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2S2AOKY0U2W5Z	desi87	I was hesitant to give The Sopranos a try. I thought I wouldn't be able to relate to the mob and its motley assortment of colorful characters. Thankfully, I couldn't have been more wrong.I've only finished the first disc, but if the rest are as stellar as this one, and judging from the other reviews, that would be an astounding YES, I've nothing to worry about. One thing I wasn't expecting was just how laugh-out-loud funny the show is! Also, the chemistry between Gandalfino and Bracco is delicious (sorry, I'm a chick and we tend to use words like that :P), the character of Christopher is endlessly compelling and overall the acting and writing is flawless.If there's anyone out there who's yet to watch this show, bite the bullet and purchase the first season.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2QJ2ZQ580PN0O	"""deusjester"""	Quickie thought for those reading this: I don't get HBO, which airs The Sopranos. Occasionally it comes on for free for a weekend, but other than that I am totally premium-cable free, which suits me fine since I was (and still am with a few exceptions) under the impression that all TV programs nowadays are garbage. Of course, I may now have to reconsider my whole budget-friendly bare bones cable plan...I'm going to forego the synopsis of the plot of the series since that's already common knowledge. Let me just say this. If you don't get HBO, or don't watch TV at all for that matter, you're missing out. The Sopranos is sharp, brave television that has a wonderful underlying intelligence that becomes more apparent the more you watch it. Also, it still manages to be one of the most entertaining things you'll ever find in an episodic format. The plot has a good number of twists in it simply within the first season, and each episode is so carefully crafted that you don't quite realize how much content is actually in each one until you're done watching it. It pulls you in and moves you along at a brisk pace without ever seeming rushed or compromised, and the pacing alone is nearly worth the price of admission. Each episode plays out like a mini-movie.What really carries the series are the stellar performances by the entire cast, from the mainstays right down to the one-shot extras. The suspension of disbelief is never interrupted by sub-par acting, though you may snap out of it just long enough to think to yourself, &quot;Wow. These people are really good!&quot; James Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano as one of the most realistic and human people on television. Tony is NOT a stereotypical lead a la Jerry Seinfeld. This means that the show is not simply moved along by the bad things that happen to him, but by the things he (and those around him) do, and the mistakes that are made along the way. For every time we see Tony's soft or humourous side, we'll see another side that is dark and mean, constantly reminding you every time you get too comfortable who this man really is, and what he really does. Alternatley chilling and amusing (and often both), these episodes grow on you quickly. It's not uncommon to be telling yourself you'll watch &quot;Just one more, then I'll turn it off.&quot; Before you know it, the 13 episodes of Season 1 are up, and it's time to get the next one...On the technical side, these DVD's are of solid quality. Nothing mind-blowing in the way of picture, but still better than most TV shows out there. Sound is top notch, as is typically the case with DVD, and the dialouge is all very clear, with nice separation of the background sounds. 5.1 is somewhat pointless with this being a TV show, but you'd be hard pressed to find fault with the sound for that. After all, this show was ment to be seen on a TV, not in the theatre.The bonus options are informative, and make for interesting viewing for Sopranos buffs. The first episode comes with a commentary track, and there are a few behind the scenes bits plus a lengthy (77 minute) interview with Sopranos creator David Chase. The case itself is a box holding a fold-out 4 disc holder, with the whole package done in shiny foil and looking very sharp indeed. On a side note, this case (as with all things foil) seems to be a fingerprint magnet, so don't expect it look new for very long! Anyone who's handled the X-Men DVD case should be familiar with this...All in all, top notch entertainment at what comes out to a more than fair price. Pick yours up if you haven't already.	5.0	This series has it made!	2001-10-23	4	3	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AVLDQY3JWB6HU	D. Golden	Great acting, writing, directing...you name it the Sopranos has it. The show manages to depict some pretty nasty happenings with a blend of humor and compassion. At a time when the creative potential of television is being debased by &quot; reality television &quot;, it is refreshing and encouraging to watch a program that represents the wonderful end product of the collaborative efforts of many talented people. This is one of the few times that the actual lives up to the hype.	5.0	One of the Best	2003-02-16	2	1	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2FEJIORC1MBG3	D. Hartley	In this cynical age of hype, it is rare to find a work of ART that actually lives up to its own press. It's too bad that some can't get past the &quot;Italian-American stereotype&quot; issue, because if these self-righteous party-poopers would come down off thier high horses long enough to actually watch an entire episode, I think they would find that &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is really about the 21st century zeitgeist of the Human Condition. The fact that these characters happen to be of Italian descent is purely incidental.(If it's on stodgy old PBS and called &quot;I Claudius&quot;, THEN its okay,right?!There's even a manipulative matriarch named &quot;Livia&quot;, for God's sake...how many more clues do you need? Wake up and smell the millineum!)Suffice it to say that the finest CONSISTENT writing, directing,acting, film editing, cinematography and soundtrack in the history of television has occurred during the first three seasons of this program. I am surprised that no article or review(that I've read)has pointed out that the excellent Dominic Chianese, who plays Soprano mob &quot;figurehead&quot; Junior, appeared in &quot;Godfather II&quot; as Fredo's fateful &quot;friend&quot;,Johnny Ola...kind of brings it all full circle!It is a shame that the late Nancy Marchand (Livia Soprano) will not grace future seasons with her classy visage and expert craft-she'll be missed. And you'll be missing out on it all if you don't add this to your collection!	5.0	A high note for American TV!	2000-12-15	3	2	1

All at once Tony Soprano is portrayed as both as family man and Mob Boss; if you are a guy that needs money from him you better pay back the cash with interest;  or else.

The popular Sopranos series can be summed up by saying that if you combined the elements of four other works, The Godfather, Analyze This, Throw Momma From The Train, and the TV series, Thirtysomething, you would get The Sopranos.  Its almost like a comic book look at Mafia life.  Not nearly as serious or dark as the original Godfather, the main charachter, Tony Soprano struggles through each episode grappling with the stresses of mafia life, avoiding sex with his wife, abusing his girlfriend, and taking out the garbage.  The series does have its moments of interest; the soundtrack is hip and appropriate; the camera work is above par; casting is good.  But watching the Mafia boss eating a bowl of cereal in his underwear while he swears at his sister is just a little too much white trash than I can handle for a series of this genre.	2.0	Its no &quot;Godfather&quot;	2002-01-06	24	3	21

Examples on TV include &quot;NYPD Blue and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. English subtitles (with parenthetical explanations when needed) would go a long way to fix the difficulties produced. I have seen some scenes where I felt that I was the only Anglophone who could understand the jargon. And that's because I was born and raised in Manhattan, the motherland of all mobspeak. Watching shows in mobspeak would provide immeasurably greater entertainment if English subtitles would be added.

The Mob Boss aspects did require a character devoid of compassion, morality or God, but in my opinion it was overdone to guarantee the 'Lowest Common Denominator' which brings in every porn addict, and pervert to acclaim the series.  Not being any of those, I had no choice but to object to the unNecessary vileness throughout the series and to warn decent people of the sinful pornographic scenes included in every episode. .	2.0	UnNecessary Sexual scenes, Nudity, and Immorality, otherwise a good modern crime story soap opera.	2014-06-08	1	0	1

I had to fight the urge to watch it straight through, and mananged to space the 13 episodes over 3 or 4 weeks.The widescreen format is great.  However, the quality of the video or the transfer to DVD had its problems.  Low-light shots  often are very grainy, and the woodgrain wall behind Tony in the psychiatrist's office is usually a mess of pixelated squares.  It was bad enough that by the end, I found myself hoping for brightly lit outside shots.  I understand that it's broadcast in HD, so I'm guessing the problems must be with the transfer to DVD.	5.0	Great content, so-so video	2001-02-07	7	5	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2GA2SO3YK6CXI	"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds"""	"HBO provides a rare view into the lives of an Italian American family, as dysfunctional as they are captivating. The main character of Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini is the key ingredient that keeps us watching episode after episode. Tony Soprano lives the struggle of having to head his mob clan, while raising a rather troublesome family.The TV series is simply superb. From the start, Tony Soprano grabs out attention as the man who suffers from depression because of the pressures provided by his followers and family members. He seeks psychotherapy and the scenes between his doctor and Tony Soprano are classic material, especially given that I watch the show with a Mental Health Counselor, Alex Ariano. We find ourselves discussing Tony at length for days to come after watching each episode.The Godfather offered us an elegant view into the underworld of the Mafia, but the Sopranos provide a mundane, seductive, terrifying, and criminal view to people who choose to by-pass law and order. We find ourselves going from family life, filled with violence, drugs, extra-marital affairs, and sorrow... to a group of New Jersey gangsters capable of murdering at the drop of a hat.As the episodes start, we get to travel with Tony Soprano in his car, driving through the NJ Turnpike, with views of NYC in the distance. The background music captures the audience as it plays: ""Woke up this morning, got yourself a gun, Mama always said you'd be the Chosen One. She said: You're one in a million, You've got to burn to shine, But you were born under a bad sign, With a blue moon in your eyes. You woke up this morning, all the love has gone, your Papa never told you, about right and wrong... But you're looking good, baby, I believe you're feeling fine, (shame about it), Born under a bad sign, with a blue moon in your eyes!""You have got to see Nancy Marchand as she plays Livia Soprano, mother of Tony... a terrifying... nagging... depressed woman. Carmela, Tony Soprano's wife is played by Edie Falco, who provides an amazing performance as the woman who has to put up with so much, and yet, she finds the time and the strength to be loving to her family.Our favorite is Lorraine Bracco, who plays the therapist, Dr. Melfi. She is highly professional and handles Tony Soprano with great finesse. This is definitely...

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2V6T24IY09M0X	Felix Felicis	"The first season of ""The Sopranos"", by itself, is one of the landmarks in television history. Told from the point of view of Tony Soprano, at first a high-level capo and then eventually street boss of the DiMeo crime family in New Jersey, it is very different from everything else in the medium in a number of ways - shot and lit like a film; superbly written with a gift for deftly alternating  between shocking violence, drama and humor; complex plotting that often stretches over multiple episodes or even seasons; fully formed characterizations of even the most minor characters; imppeccable use of music and pop culture to establish mood, authenticity, and draw you in; and each performance is an acting tour de force. The attention to detail that permeates every frame of these first thirteen hours is astounding - a single glance, or movement, or word of dialogue; these can reveal enormous truths about each character. The first season focuses on Tony's emotional state; we understand the pressure of his job but also the relatively mundane pressures that he feels with his kith and kin in everyday life, and his inability to cope physically manifests itself in panic attacks which lead him to therapy - a choice that almost gets him killed, but ultimately proves useful to alleviating his problem at least temporarily (while also brilliantly allowing David Chase to provide self-analysis throughout the series). Here are brief capsules of the first thirteen astonishing episodes:Episode 1 - ""The Sopranos"" - The best self-comtained hour in TV history. Quickly and efficient sets up Tony Soprano and his world, without ever explicitly stating anything. We see his therapy sessions, his problems at home, his problems at work, and how his sharp mind works to solve everything, questionable or detestable ethics be damned. For example, his solution to one problem with his Uncle Junior is highly amusing and unorthodox but totally within character for a mobster. Compelling stuff and Gandolfini immediately establishes Tony as likeable in spite of himself.Episode 2 - ""46 Long"" - Jackie Aprile, the acting boss of the family, is slowly dying of cancer and Tony and his Uncle are next in line, hence a power struggle is in order. On top of that, Tony's nephew Christopher and his idiot buddy Brendan are hijacking Junior's trucks, creating a rift. Oh, and Tony's mother Livia is giving him agita over the ""retirement community"" he has chosen for her. No wonder he's still going to see Dr. Melfi!Episode 3 - ""Denial, Anger, Acceptance"" - Jackie's getting worse, and Christopher and Brendan still aren't listenting to Tony when he tells them to back off. Junior feels something has to be done, and it ain't pretty. the crew gets involved with a Jewish family dispute, with hilarious results. Also, Tony's daughter Meadow needs help dealing with her SAT prep, so she asks Christopher for some crystal meth to stay up and study. Virtuoso ending in this one.Episode 4 - ""Meadowlands"" - Things get heavy with Junior and when Jackie passes away, war seems imminent. However, Tony comes up with a plan that both helps him out tremendously and keeps the peace with Junior. Also, Tony's been having dreams about Melfi; he gets deadbeat cop Vin Makazian to tail her, which leads to bad news for her date.Episode 5 - ""College"" - One of the best of the season, this ep focuses on the conflict between Tony's two worlds and exemplifies what The Sopranos is all about. On a college scouting trip with Meadow, he spots an old ""friend"" of the family who had loose lips. We all know what happens to them, right? The balance between domestic Tony and murderous Tony has never been more delicate. Back at home, Tony's wife Carmela deals with her loneliness and feelings in not entirely appropriate ways, but never crosses the line. GREAT, suspenseful build to the violent ending.Episode 6 - ""Pax Soprano"" - Junior is the boss and he's driving everyone crazy, but it's in name only, as we come to find out when Tony's friend Hesh is suddenly taxed and Tony gets New York underboss Johnny Sack involved to help mediate behind his uncle's back. At the official coronation of Junior Soprano, we find out that Tony has a new problem - spelled with an F.B.I.Episode 7 - ""Down Neck"" - Anthony Junior, Tony's son, has been acting up in school. He steals the sacramental wine and shows up to gym class drunk. this worries Tony, who confesses to Melfi that he doesn't want this life for his son. A.J. also lets a potential hazardous buit of info slip when he visits Livia at Green Grove. And she intends to use it...Episode 8 - ""The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti"" - the feds are ready to hand down indictments, and everyone's panicking. Tony has to do a little ""clean-up"" around the house. Meanwhile, Christopher is pissed that he wasn't mentioned in the news at all and starts freaking out. All is well when he is named in the paper as a ""reputed gangster"". Imperioli shines in this ep, especially in the clever and very funny nod to his character Spider in Goodfellas.Episode 9 - ""Boca"" - Another funny one, about oral sex. Yes, that's right, oral sex. Junior knows that Tony is in therapy and he's on edge. Who else is Tony talking to, and what's he telling? With the indictments about to come down, Junior flees to Boca with his gal pal, who is yappy about his sex life and it costs her dearly. Meadow's soccer coach has a secret and it could get him killed. Well, if Tony wishes it...Episode 10 - ""A Hit is a Hit"" - The weakest ep of this season, it focuses on a profits dispute with rapper Massive Genius and Hesh, who used to run a record company. Christopher's girlfriend Adriana wants to get into the business, Massive G wants to get into her pants. In the B story, Tony tries to hang with the ""common folk"" but finds they all want to talk shop. And he's not to happy about it.Episode 11 - ""Nobody Knows Anything"" - Somebody's wired for sound and Detective Makazian thinks he knows who - One of Tony's best friends, ""Big Pussy"" -  but Tony can't believe it. His consiglieri Silvio doesn't buy it either. Tony gets his capo Paulie to check it out, while he does some research into Makazian's motives. Unfortunately, the cop takes an untimely (voluntary) leap off a bridge before he can find out the truth for sure. A classic that perfectly sets up the final 2 eps and also Season 2.Episode 12 - ""Isabella"" - Pussy, fearing the worst, has disappeared, and Tony, fearing the worst, is a medicated wreck. He's in bed all day and feels almost suicidally depressed. The meds have some interesting side effects that Dr. Melfi feels are psychologically siginificant. Just when it looks like Tony is locked into his stupor, he gets an unexpectated source of invigoration - an attempt is made on his life. It fails, and now that Tony is finally awake again, there's going to be hell to pay.Episode 13 - ""I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano"" - The wonderful season finale ties all the season-long story threads together in a dense, entertaining, and violent tapestry. Tony knows who ordered the hit, courtesy of the FBI, and it stuns him. He might not be able to totally deal with it but he tries anyway. The Feds move in on Junior, and Tony gets to work solifying his position and taking over. A rat is discovered, and exterminated. And as the season ends, we are with both families in Tony's friend Artie's new restaurant, as a storm rages outside. And perhaps inside, as well?All in all, the first season is a masterwork and I guarantee you'll get hooked immediately. No show has ever been this meticulously conceived, on EVERY level. Do yourself a favor and invest in this DVD set if you haven't already - not only is DVD preferable, since you can control how quickly you want to take it all in, but the disc also features a great commentary on the pilot episode, a comprehensive 77-minute interview with creator David Chase, and two worthless but mildly interesting fluff featurettes. So, enjoy. Like the song goes, ""Woke up this morning...got yourself a gun."""	5.0	The greatest show in the history of TV. Period.	2006-03-25	7	7	0

You don't even have to be into gangster films to enjoy this series. It definitely puts the human touch on characters otherwise would be considered inhuman since they are criminals.

There is definitely at least one character in this series that anyone can relate to directly or indirectly.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3FQ01UBABHX8Q	Garibaldi's Ghost	&quot;The Sopranos&quot; is nothing more than celluoid crud.  Ifind the series very offensive to Italian people everywhere.  We donot act like &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; Hell -- saying that &quot;TheSopranos&quot; depicts an accurate picture of the Italian people inthe New Jersey - New York metropolitian area will be like me sayingthat Freddie Prinz's character in &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; isrepresentational of all Hispanics and Margaret Cho's alter ego in&quot;All-American Girl&quot; truly depicts Asian-Americans in a bigurban city.I don't know about the rest of you, but I wasn'traised to be a cafone.  Any person that believes for one single secondthat &quot;The Sopranos&quot; depicts &quot;real&quot;Italian-Americans has a serious mental problem.Over the years, Ihave written to numerous journals to express my disgust and anger overthe media's constant portrayal of Italians as Mafiosi.  Frankly,programs such as &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; which stereotype Italiansas violent, vicious murderers and gangsters hurt the image of allItalians and cheapen the contributions that Italians have made tobetter mankind.Worse yet, shows like the &quot;Sopranos&quot;give young Italian-Americans a &quot;negative&quot; role model.  Whileyoung Italian-Americans should be embracing and emulating thepositive, life affirming attributes of their great countrymen -- suchas Galileo Galilee, Leonardo da Vinci, and Guglieimo Marconi;television gives them people like Tony and &quot;Junior&quot; Sopranoto copy.  It is a shame; but, I would wager that mostItalian-Americans don't even know who I, Giuseppe Garibaldi;Alessandro Manzoni, Giuseppe Verdi, and Antonio Lucio Vivaldi were.However, sadly, they'll be able to tell you -- in vivid detail --about the nefarious careers and acts of infamous people like AlphonseCapone, Carlo Gambino, John Gotti, Joseph Bonnano, and Vito Genovese.Any show that stereotypes a group of people should be pulled offthe air.  These programs are not funny!  They only help to reinforcestupid prejudices and bigotry.  As such, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;should be taken off the air before it does any more harm.  And, peoplethat enjoy this show -- especially Italians --need to take a good lookat themselves because they are part of the problem, not part of thesolution.Once more, I state that I am sick and tired of theasinine &quot;Al Capone&quot; stereotyping.  ConcernedItalian-Americans should not only ban &quot;The Sopranos&quot; fromtheir living rooms.  They should also encourage their young to focuson the good deeds that their ancestors have accomplished.  Forgetabout the gangsters and fictional characters from a Mario Puzo novel /screenplay.  These people are the overstated, over-emphasizedminority.  Focus on the positive contributions that Italians have madein / to the world.	1.0	Italian Stereotyping At Its Worst	2001-03-06	118	15	103

Initially, I had started watching the Sopranos when it first started and wasn't impressed with the show.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AJ8JJ6D5BSJKZ	Gary M. Greenbaum	"For most TV shows, the first season is the best. While the Sopranos' other seasons have remained at high standards, this was still the best.The main reason--because ideas and concepts were fresh and new. The idea of a New Jersey mafioso, both of whose families give him heartburn, forcing him to a shrink. We delight as they explore things for the first time--Tony adjusting to talking about what he doesn't want to talk about, his embarrassment as he is invited to the country club for the amusement of his neighbor, his relationship with his children, wife, mother, and other ""family"" members.As well as Gandolfini's Tony, we watch as Edie Falco's Carmela develops. It's doubtful if, in following seasons, she would grab a gun and head out to confront an apparent intruder as she does in Episode 1, or take such obvious verbal delight in Tony seeing a shrink. The character develops, and we get to watch.Nancy Marchand's hideous Livia is the highlight of the first season, the only season in which she was healthy. Watching it for the second time, we get a real sense of this damaged and damaging woman--as, after Tony gets a flesh wound to the earlobe, she greets him with ""Your ear's disfigured."" Livia is not prepared to go gentle into that good night, she's going kicking and screaming, and prepared to take as many people as she can with her.The production values are great, and embellished by the director's interviews.DVDs are the form that these shows will go down to posterity with. This is obviously in creator David Chase's mind, and he's giving them to us in their best form."	5.0	The first season and the best season--buy it.	2002-12-17	4	2	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2T0V99GLGXWCM	Ghost(Ghost(M))	"I haven't seen this on TV so I thought I'd check it out since it's mentioned so often. It's not bad as entertainment, meaning it's cinematically well made -- but if you forget to turn your brain off, you'll be bemuzed and annoyed.Take for example the protagonist, who, on one hand, is capable of strangling a dude with a garotta, matteroffactly, between other things as it were, with his own bare hands -- or cut off the manhood with a bolt cutter to some ""civilian"" dude he was hired to ""persuade"". And simultaneously he is supposed to be a caring father to two charming, intelligent, and obviously well-bred young girls, and a doting husband, and a warm friend with other people. Perhaps you can get ""confused"" like that for a year or two, between 18 and 25, but the dude looks like he's in his late 40s if not 50! If you're a psychopath, you can't be this other thing. Not at 48, sorry. So it's just another one of those ""Godfather"" like revoltingly unrealistic flicks full of pudgy, misshapen, potato-nosed and funny-talking, ever-out-of-breath, cigar chomping mafiosos, who endlessly hug each other like they're on the downlow, and then immediately commit acts of horrible, gory violence against each other and innocent random folks. Endless unnecessary bad language...  lots of ""enforcer"" types, all fat and out of breath just from being awake it seems. How can you be an ""enforcer"" if you're so out of shape? Hurting people requires good fighting trim. Well, that's a small thing of course. There's a tiny amount of very soft T&A;, but come on, there's other sources for getting that. And then, I'm not Italian so who am I to say, but don't Italians find this whole genre annoying and hostile? If they're so full of mafia, why don't they send a few of these fat nasty boys to cut the blls off and throw off the bridge these movie directors and producers who keep making this bilge?So, is this clicheistic, vulgar, cheap gorefest supposed to be wholesome entertainment? or does it hold some socially redeemable values? I'm lost here, cause to me this whole genre looks revolting. The bottom line: this annoys and kills brain cells. Not sure why there's been so much hype about it. Feel free to give it a pass, you won't miss anything.Note: for those who want closed captions/subtitles, you're out of luck. No subtitles of any kind (I know why: they didn't want to spend any extra money or time on making this crap)."	2.0	"Yet another ""mafia"" movie. I'm glad I'm not Italian."	2013-12-28	5	1	4
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A23KDYA7YGPEWW	Gil	While I do not have HBO, I did catch an episode here and there either at a friends' house, or while on vacation in a hotel when the show was in it's early years. Recently, I felt that in order to grasp the concept of the entire series, I would just go back to where it all began in 1999 and start with the first shows. I just ordered seasons 1 and 2, and 3 is on the way, and 4 will follow. Since I received my movies, I have been watching this every night. This show is addicting, to say the least! You can't just stop, because each episode leaves you hungry for the next.All I can say is WOW!!. As a dedicated admirer of mobster films, this is simply among the best. James Gandolphini is hands down, the ONLY person who can play Tony Soprano, period. If he is ever replaced, I could never watch it again in it's new form. In fact, this is one of the few shows that minor or major alterations in the main cast would spoil the show.I like the fact that it is not a one sided show, but displays all of the character's ups and downs in life, family problems, relationship difficulties and so on. The mob  and Italy aside, theoretically it could be any family in America. I could go into so much here, but I'm sure you already know all of that. Yes, it is violent, but without the violence and language, it would not be The Sopranos. Tony Soprano, a ruthless mob boss commands respect wherever he goes, but also when deemed necessary, displays his compassionate and humane side as well.  Despite all of the turmoil, Tony's wife Carmella, is a demanding and strong willed woman who fights to keep her family together, and is stanchly dedicated in her Roman Catholic faith. She is the only calming force of the show, and seems to be the neutralizer as well.While it is being slated for broadcast on A&E;, I'm not too fond of that. Why butcher such a good program? But if they do, I still have my uncut, uncensored versions! More to come!	5.0	Simply among the best!	2005-03-01	2	1	1

That being said, I purchased The First Season and watched the entire package over the Labor Day weekend.  Gandolfini is magnificent, everyman, threatening, sensitive, boorish, charming.  His character is fascinating -- you'd like to meet him on a plane, learn about his life, and hopefully never see him again.  The rest of the family, including Livia (played by the late Nancy Marchand) and his &quot;other family&quot; are equally complex.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	Well, that's not entirely true: I have pretty much stopped watching television and no longer get cable (which has made for a very peaceful election and post-election BTW), but it wasn't entirely due to the &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.  The show did have something to do with my decision, however, because it made me realize just how good television could potentially be (and, by contrast, just how bad and how distressingly formulaic it usually is).&quot;The Sopranos&quot; is an almost startlingly original show.  By now, those who do not receive HBO have at least read/heard enough about the program to have an inkling as to why it's been hailed as such a breakthrough.  It does have something to do with the relatively free rein provided writer/producer David Chase by the cable network. On the other hand, the HBO imprimatur is no guarantee of quality (look at the lurid, sensationalistic, and--I admit--compellingly bad &quot;Oz&quot; by way of contrast). Credit has to go to Chase and co. for having come up with something quite special. It goes beyond the originality of the premise--that a Mafia Don can be as vulnerable and as screwed up as the rest of us. That same conceit was the core of the film &quot;Analyze This&quot; and wasn't nearly as well realized.I think the show's success had as much to do with its authentic characters and locales (not much glamorization, going on here: Tony Soprano may be successful but he's not really big time) and its acknowledgement of moral ambiguity (personified by wife Carmela's perpetual ambivalence as well as Tony's own occasional misgivings).  And of course, there's the witty dialog, the perfect casting and the aura of intelligence that the show radiates.  Come to think of it, it was the best thing to hit ANY screen (large or small) in 1999.	5.0	The show that made me stop watching TV...	2000-11-19	50	42	8

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AME9XGN0AQ36J	Gregory Saffady	Not since the Corleone's and the Prizzi's has there been such an endearing mob family as The Sopranos.  Vito and his sons and Don Corrado and his troops never had Tony Soprano's problems, but then again, their family business wasn't chronicled in these 13 episodes depicting mobbed up New Jersey suburbanites.  David Chase explores an American fabric that puts him on par with Coppola and Scorcese's realistic explorations of east coast organized crime.  Chase quenches an insatiable audience appetite for Mafia folklore with first rate scripts and across the board stellar acting, both lead and supporting.  The first 13 episodes prove again that most superior (television) series shine best in the premier season.  The standout episodes are Episode #9, BOCA, Episode #11, ISABELLA and #13, I DREAM OF JEANNIE CUSAMANO.  Memorable dialogue and performances make this a must purchase.

The story is not very good, jumping back and forth between Tony's relationship with his mother, wife and daughter and his visit to a shrink. I had no problem at all with the nudity; too little of that. Personally, I prefer The Godfather to this crap and that steaming pile of cow dung known as Scarface with Pacino (the 1932 movie is better). I also like historical drama series' like The Borgias.

However, once you get to seasons 5 & 6 you will not want to stop watching, and the ending is one of the most controversial topics of all time.

Edie Falco (Diane fromOz), plays Tony's not so suffering wife, Carmela.Dominic Chianese is Junior Soprano, Tony's uncle/surrogate father and true head of the Soprano family.  He, along with Tony's nephew Christopher, Michael Imperioli, run the gang.This is a gritty show and certainly not for everybody.  Those who followed Oz will likely be among the devotees of the viewing audience.  Sopranos isn't always a shoot-em-up program.  There's a  lot of intrigue of inner working plots and ""what do we do next?"" thoughts.The acting, especially from Gandolfini and Falco is above the average television norm.

Oh My, was I wrong?  Yes I was-I LOVE this show.  It is addictive.  I can't stop watching.  There are so many things going on that you just can't stop watching!!  James Gandolfini is not a great-looking man, but Tony Soprano is hot. Yes I said hot. Maybe it's the power and the wealth and the weapons. Yeah, it's all that stuff.  The cast is unbelievable.  The chemistry between characters is unrivaled.  Do not continue living a life without The Sopranos. Rent It. Enjoy It. Buy It.  You must have this collection.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ABFJYHVD8RHLE	Hillary	"This is the best depiction of organized crime and its players EVER bought to the small screen. The Sopranos series on HBO is sheer brilliance. From the perfectly cast characters, to the direction and writing...there's never a dull moment.I was happy to purchase this set to catch up on what I'd missed. I found out quickly that I missed quite a bit too. Needless to say, a very satisfying purchase, highly recommended.The colorful life of Anthony Soprano, masterfully performed  by James Gandolfini, and his trusted crew, also cast impeccably, are depicted so authentically, you'd swear you had a secret camera on a REAL crime family. This show is far more believable than some major motion pictures that have organized crime themes.The first season of the Sopranos will give you a glimpse into meeting and getting to know all the characters.  My favorites are Tony, Paulie played by Tony Sirico, Christopher, (a more mature Michael Imperioli than the one Joe Pesci shot in the foot as ""Spider"" in ""Goodfellas""), and his girlfriend Adriana too.  Drea DiMatteo plays like she was tailor made for the role of Christopher's girlfriend. Carmela (Edie Falco) as Tony's open minded wife is terrific too.When you watch the Sopranos, it's NOT like watching TV, it's like watching a side of life that we all know about, but would never get to witness first hand.To sum things up ""badda-bing"", Sopranos first season is a must have for long time, and new fans of this incredible series.  You'll also find yourself watching it more than once, so consider the format you make your purchase in.  You don't want to be without the family!"	5.0	Once You Watch, You Can't FUGGEDABOUDIT!	2002-01-06	1	0	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ADWM8I2KMJQJX	"HJ Louw ""Hermgerm"""	"This is a fantastic box set that collects my favorite episodes, the very ones that introduced Tony, his family, and his whole sick crew to millions of viewers worldwide. A friend first introduced me to the Sopranos after picking up the DVD's in the UK (they didn't show Sopranos as a regular series in South Africa). After the first 2 episodes I was hooked, and started buying the subsequent seasons. Now I can't get rid of my Soprano addiction, and find myself in a state of depression whenever I finish a season and have to wait for the next one to be released on DVD. What makes this show so compulsively viewable is the humanization of Tony and his cohorts, allowing us to see them as real people with real problems, and not as these merciless hitmen without a care in the world for anybody. Christopher Moltisanti is by far my favorite character, with Tony a close second. In this season we see Tony's first confrontation with his ""Uncle June"" and the discovery by his children that their father is ""mobbed up."" The central storyline revolves around Tony's panic attacks that forces him into the offices of Dr Melfi, a psychiatrist, who more than once regrets taking on Tony as a patient. There is plenty of drama and character development as well as action and an awesome theme song which I just can't get tired of. The Sopranos is well worth it. The only problem is that once you start with the first season, you will find yourself compelled to buy all of them.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AANG87SKNL3T7	Isabella Valentine -  www.IsabellaValentine.com	I must say that watching the first season of the Sopranos (having never even seen an episode before)... I am completely and utterly addicted and nothing can pull me away. I bought the box set on dvd because I knew about all the awards the show had won and people often commented on the series.Within the first ten minutes of watching the first episode I knew I was hooked. So many little mini-stories all revolving around one person, this is an unpredictable moving and emotional series filled with humor that just makes you spit your coke out.My favorite scenes are ones involving Tony Soprano and his psychiatrist.Dr. Melfi:  &quot;What is your most loving warm thing you can remember about your mother?&quot;Tony (laughing hysterically): &quot;Well this one time my dad fell down the stairs and me and my mom just laughed and laughed and laughed...&quot; and then the shrink just crinkles her forehead. It's the little moments like that - that REALLY tie this movie together.Then the unbelievable scenes with his senile mother who wants her own son killed because he put her in a nursing home even though it really is a &quot;retirement community&quot; which I thought was a little funny. With the old mother running over her friend with the Buick, lots of betrayal, lust, hallucinations (aka Isabella), unbelievable dreams, and an obsession with ducks.... this entire season is a must have for any fan of Mobster movies.This whole season had many wonderful episodes, explosive storylines, and gripping scenes that are unforgettable and will be memorable for a long long time.	5.0	Beyond what I ever expected	2004-05-09	5	3	2
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2SCCTBY0AB4VO	Isis	I do not have HBO so I never saw the Soprano series, but I had read a lot about it's popularity.  So, since I have Prime I decided to watch it.  I started at the beginning and watched 10 1/2 episodes.  The beginning was ok so I kept on, seeing people get shot was no big deal, my mind immediately said &#34;fake gunshot wound, not bad&#34;. (I used to watch Frontier Playhouse as a child and those cowboys were always shooting and I know real from movies).  I'm Italian-American, but not THAT Italian.  My mom made sauce and spaghetti and salad every Sunday (because we kids wanted it), and I knew what a &#34;medigan&#34; was.  But there was no violence in my parents' household.  I never got smacked, there was no yelling between my parents and we kids were obedient because it was expected of us.  I really didn't like the mean language toward children.  When one of the characters got garrotted,  it was gruesome and I had enough.  Turned it off right in the middle of the episode and am not going back.  I personally did not find it &#34;realistic&#34;, but then I was brought up on The Main Line, not in South Philly.  Maybe it really was true-to-life.  So I gave it 3 stars, because I liked the &#34;sets&#34;, and the story was not too hard to follow.  That's it.	3.0	Well played.	2014-06-07	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2GBNMYG9P9KCM	Ixx	Don't be fooled by my 'one star'. I do that because people always stop at them. I love this show! At first, I was worried it would be too melodramatic, too exagerrated.... like the Godfather. I was pleasently proven incorrect! The show is a treat in many ways, and each of the episodes, although consistent in story, has its own style and personality, depending upon who wrote it.Now granted, the show is indeed very exaggerrated, but hey it's TV. But what I'm pleased with is the fact that it isn't too mushy and melodramatic. It has it's light moments, as well. I find Tony's relationship with his mother particularly hilarious, but that's only because that's exactly the way I see my relatives all get along. Also, the show is modernized (for the most part - some of Tony's crew seem like they're stuck in the Rat-Pack era a little too much to me.) Do they have classic Mob elements, too? Of course! Take one look at the stubborn old bat Uncle Junior for a perfect indicator. The man is stuck in the 40's and 50's and is pissed off at the concept of change. His personality and style give off a hint of classic Mafia film noire, which I enjoy.That all said, as the show seems to have a little bit of everything, lemme go into this whole Italian-American stereotyping crap. I'm an Italian-American. I know the portryals here are very stereotypical, and many of the modern Mafia elements themselves are, too. But why be offended?? It's a TV show, and meant to entertain only - not to educate. So those of you who are somehow offended by this show's portryal of Italian-Americans, just sit back and enjoy it for what it is - fun to watch! It's made for a mass audience who grew up on The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas.	1.0	excellent show with a nice, modern take	2004-04-08	66	4	62

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AMG88KV31ZIIO	Jack Crane	I never was a Sopranos fan. I would always watch it because it was after The Wire or Oz, or because nothing else was on. I can't remember. I skipped around a lot. I never really got into the show, and just generally thought it was poorly made. It seemed to appeal to a lot of people that were middle class and above. For a show about the mob, some things just seemed to be off.I decided to watch the show again straight through, from season 1 to season 6 to see if I just didn't get the show when I watched it originally, half-heartedly. By the time I got to season 5, for some reason, it didn't feel like anything had really happened. Part of the problem with the show is that Tony has everything. He is the boss, he has a nice family and he is comfortable financially. The only thing he has to worry about are the Feds, his gangster associates and his family drama. The character is completely impossible to like. Perhaps that's intentional. His family is impossible to like. Perhaps this is why middle class America loved the show, because it reminded them of their everyday life. However, this just wasn't good material for a TV show.I found a lot of things to be off with The Sopranos. Whenever there seems to be a fight, 95% of the time, someone is going to die. The fights are usually started for the dumbest of reasons. It's clear it's just for shock value. Tony is worth millions of dollars and is a known mob figure, yet his kid works terrible minimum wage jobs. If this show were realistic, AJ would be a prince who would be handed wads of cash by his dad, partying all the time in clubs. He does party in New York's best clubs in later seasons, but on minimum wage from a Blockbuster job, selling promotional materials. Uh, NOT A CHANCE. It's a sad attempt to relate to the middle class, but is not grounded in reality, likely because the writer never had to work a bad job and live on the money. Don't even get me started with Finn, Meadow's boyfriend in later seasons. His parents can send him to Columbia from out of state, yet he needs to get a job with a construction company to make ends meet? YAH RIGHT.I could go on, but this was one of the worst written, successful shows I've ever seen on TV. Completely ridiculous and overhyped. It should have been cancelled after the first season.EDIT: RIP James Gandolfini. He did a great job on this show, but I still stand with much of what I wrote. It was poorly written, but without Gandolfini, the show wouldn't have lasted long.	3.0	Kind of overrated, weak storyline lacking in suspense or conflict	2013-06-08	10	2	8

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	It is an interesting series and a slightly different tone on the mafia but it is the mafia all right and I wonder if we can still say anything that is bigger than a detail, an entertaining detail eventually, but nothing but a detail on it. Their job is extortion and extortion it is. They try to keep their nose clean and not do too many nose jobs but they hardly can really resist their deep nature. So they over-eat, they are fat slobs, they use guns like others use toothbrushes, they kill anyone who is in their way and they solve their succession problems and their heritage and inheritance with bullets or at times, when they want to be clean, with the police that gets rid of the older generation to let the younger one take over. Is that moral? Of course not but you can't let such a business be managed by people who do not know how to use an iPad or a cell phone, really, not to speak of a computer and the Internet. The police is not cleaning up society, it is cleaning up the mafia itself of the old stooges who could become dangerous by being out-fashioned by younger black non-mafia real criminals who would do it for the pleasure of killing and not the pleasure of a stable environment. Then the series is real entertainment because it is swift, brisk, fast, light, rapid, very active, but yet these perambulating fat whales are definitely non-kosher to my serious mind and the pig over some dining hall of some kind is non halal at all and that bothers me. Too much booze and too much pork. But well you will not get a brain stroke on that series, and a giggle from time to time on a priest who is sublimating his sex desire for women in good food and light slightly titillating innuendo. Young priests today do not look at little boys any more. They look at pretty women, married if possible. Husbands can accept anything from a priest provided there is a holy communion somewhere.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID	4.0	You will not get a brain fever with this entertaining series	2010-10-22	4	0	4

From his family issues to the &quot;family&quot;, Anthony, played brillantly believable by James Gandolfini, is starting to buckle under the strain of the weight of the world. There with the thread to sew his mind together is his psychiatrist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi, who confronts Anthony as no one else dare.The acting is superb, the stories demand your full attention, and the philosophical nuiances play like a violin to the lonely trumpet sounds of Anthony trying to figure out life. And it's in his struggles that we join him, and pray he finds his way out as we should.Truly, masterpiece theater.	5.0	If I could give ten stars....	2001-04-17	7	5	2
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A36IJHV89S2ONA	James Hobbs	The Sopranos was an all time original HBO series about a Mafia boss, &#34;Tony Soprano&#34; played by( James Gandolfin ), who is a ruthless sociopath at work, but a loving upper middle class father when he comes home at night. With David Chase and other talented writers and  excellent cast members like.. James Michael Imperioli, Edith &#34;Edie&#34; Falco and many others it all comes together as a believable drama.The story line was always changing keeping each episode  interesting. It can be violent at times but it is a story about the Mafia. I loved it when it came out and wish they would bring it back or at least have a final episode to explain what happened to the family.As I remember, it left you hanging and that was years ago.

But what a great idea to release the series on DVD for all to see.  The first 13 episodes of the first season (and as of this writing Season One, Two,Three and Four are available)are all on DVD and the series still continues and can be seen on HBO--Home Box Office.  This night time soap opera is about a family who has a gangster as a father, Tony Soprano (played by James Gandolfini, who gained thirty pounds for the role).  He tries to talk his mother into going into a retirement community building after she has had some dangerous incidents of her own.  Tony's male friends and family are also in the organized crime business.  Tony's daughter and 13-year old son do not know what their father does on the side, but are getting suspicious.  By the way, Tony owns a bar with strip-girls (and one in-joke strip guy) and he is seeing a female psychiatrist every week to sort out his feelings.  Adults Only!  Includes violence, nudity and foul language.  Disc #4 includes in ""Special features"", a 77-minute interview with David Chase.  Featurette #1, ""Family Life"" is four minutes long.  Featurette #2, ""Meet Tony Soprano"" runs 3 and a half minutes, Awards and Nominations and Cast Biographies.  Note: If you cannot find episode 13 on Disc 4, try this.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AFVPGUTRFEFUC	"Jason Francis Smith ""Dogstar Opinions"""	The Sopranos started it all. The golden era of television.  By placing it on HBO instead of network they immediately set a precedent for more authentic, honest, realistic TV.  Next they had James Gandolfini, who's portrayal of Tony Soprano is one of the best acting jobs ever done.  Add in a fantastic cast of other great actors, and then give them incredibly interesting and entertaining characters to play... with great music, and fantastic original STORY.  And of course... the setting, modern day mob story, is brilliant.Other shows like Sons of Anarchy and Breaking Bad and Mad Men owe their brilliance to The Sopranos.  I've watched the entire run 7 times now... and now that it's on Prime (as of May 2014) for free, I've started the run again (though I have the whole series on DVD as well).  All these years later, the show ages perfectly and is still the best.	5.0	#1 Show Ever Made	2014-06-11	0	0	0

What more needs to be said?Each episode plays itself like a little movie, and each episode gets the same level attentions and the results shine through.Everyone has heard the acclaim on this series and just about everyone has seen it, but this collection is definetly worth adding to your DVD collection.I can't wait until the release of the second season, and I will surely by the third, fourth, and the fifth and final season when they are released.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2ZUXNY4QI1X75	Javi	So I haven't seen this show in its entirety but I have watched the first season. I must say this is a story that just pulled me in from the first minute of the first episode. One of my favorite things about a good drama I.e. Breaking Bad, The Walkingdead , and SoA it's all based around characters and their personal struggle with the choices they make. The sopranos is one of those shows. Fallowing Tony Soprano who lives in a world that I know little of the Italian MOB life in jersey. He seems like a real nice guy who only wants to do what he feels is right and some times due to the world he lives in he is forced to do things he doesn't want to. Other cases he's the imbodyment of evil and others the victim of a un thinkable predator. Wish this never existed because I can tell I'm gonna spend a lot of my life watching this show over and over again.	5.0	Thee best television drama of all time	2014-06-12	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	I have to be honest, I stayed away from the Sopranos when it first premiered thinking it would be presented in a shoddy, second-hand nature.  I was completely wrong.  The only word I can use to describe this show is enthralling.  Once you start watching it, your hooked.  The character development has a lot to do with the success of this show.  Each character has his/her own set of dilemmas to deal with on a daily basis.  There is no question that Jim Gandolfini is the true &quot;star&quot; of this series, but he is surrounded by stellar talent.  Carmella, AJ, Meadow, Paulie, Christopher, Uncle Junior, Olivia, Artie, Pussy, Richie, Janice are all engaging characters that will take this show into a multitude of different directions (except the one's who get whacked).  Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Dr. Melfi, and her relationship with Tony continues to thread the series as it now enters it's third season.  The Sopranos is simply a well crafted, excellently scripted, and magnificently acted show which will not disappoint every time you watch it.	5.0	Why HBO is now a must	2001-03-19	14	14	0

Without The Sopranos there would be no cable shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Dexter, Weeds, Entourage, etc. James Gandolfinis portrayal of Tony Soprano made the anti hero popular.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"After all of the hype, all of the awards, and four seasons being released on DVD, I finally began watching ""The Sopranos"".  From the first episode, I was hooked.  It was nothing like what I expected, but it is an excellent show.  ""The Sopranos"" is a television show about Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), a mid-level mafia boss, and his family.  As a fan of ""The Godfather"" and other mafia movies, I thought I had an idea of what to expect, but ""The Sopranos"" takes the mafia concept in a different direction.  One way to get an idea of what ""The Sopranos"" is about is simply to take ""The Godfather"", push it forward 50 years into the present, and reduce the scale of Michael Corleone `s mafia authority.  You would get something that is not too far removed from ""The Sopranos"".Tony Soprano is the acting chief of the Soprano crime family while the real head, Jackie, is in the hospital with Cancer.  The Sopranos are successful, though somewhat small time.  They are a local New Jersey crime family, though not without a fair share of power and authority.  While Tony has all of this power, he also has the struggle of balancing his life of crime with his family life, and he is being torn into an emotional mess because of it.  Despite the expectations upon him, Tony secretly begins seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).  While Tony does not go into detail about his criminal life, Dr. Melfi knows exactly who he is but as long as she does not hear any details about criminal doings, she is not bound to report anything to the authorities.  It is with this understanding that the therapy begins and this is a major part of the show (and in my mind, it is one of the best parts of the show).  Tony talks about his family, and in this way we learn more about his relationship with his wife, Carmella (Edie Falco) and his mother Livia (Nancy Marchand).  His mother is an extremely manipulative woman and as much as I dislike the character, Livia is a very effective character and is a major power in the show because of her manipulativeness.With all this talk about Tony's family and therapy, make no mistake, there is a crime family to be run and Tony runs it.  The mafia relationships start to get a bit more complex as the season moves on and characters are added and subtracted from the mix, but this is what makes the show so interesting.  It isn't the violence, but the relationships between the characters (family and mafia, alike).""The Sopranos"" is an excellent show and one that I intend on continuing to watch and see how the storylines progress.  One that that should be noted: This is an HBO series.  It was made for cable television and there is quite a bit of violence, language, and even some nudity.  Some viewers may find this content inappropriate, but in my view, this is a top rate program."	5.0	an excellent television series, more than just a mob show.	2004-01-26	3	2	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1G7F9ZDJ07EMA	John	I thought I would rent the first season of Sopranos since I don't have HBO and can't watch it.  Also, being that I'm from north new jersey, it made it even more enjoyable because I recognized almost all of the spots that they were filmed in.  As far as the series go, it's a hit.  I was a bit skeptical first because I thought I'd find it hard to get into after watching classic mafia/gangster movies such as Goodfellas, Casino and Scarface.  But in the end I found it most enjoyable with some funny parts.  James Gandolfini shines as Tony Soprano.  He's the reason to watch this series.  As far as the other actors go in their roles, it's mostly hit or miss.  Meadow Soprano's performance is borderline fair and quite frankly the son (his name slipped my mine for some reason) is extremely annoying.  But other than that, the first season was most enjoyable.  Now if I can get the second season..	4.0	Enjoyable	2003-10-31	4	1	3

Many thanks to Amazon Prime Instant Video for the addition of these classic HBO television productions. I am fairly certain viewers around the country are re-visiting the Soprano family.  I was impressed when the show originally aired but was unable to catch each episode. To watch the series in succession is a wonderful experience. It's a credit to the legendary show's creators, to the terrific cast and writers to finally see and appreciate how the story and characters develop over time.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A37TFG3PNKCTKJ	johnnyitalian@aol.com	"How to have a ""Guido Day"" just like The SopranosIncorporate something with roots from the boot over typical Meddigan practices and you will understand how to live your daily life as a true Goomba...MORNINGWake up and get ready using guido hair care and hygene products (Aqua Velva after shave, Aqua Net hairspray, etc). Get dressed wearing an outfit from the goomba wardrobe (dark colored suit with an elaborate floral print tie or Hawaiian shirt, Fila jogging suit, etc). Don't forget the gold jewelry. At breakfast, eat some pepperoni and eggs or peppers and eggs with a fresh Italian roll. Then stop at the bakery on the way to work for some espresso or capuccino with some pignoli cookies or a canolli.  In your Monte Carlo, listen to 103.5 KTU or pop in a tape ofAngelo Venuto or Eiffel 65 if you are in the mood for some modern goomba dance tunes. If you are feeling more old school, put on some Dean Martin or Sinatra. Right there you've incorporated 4 goomba things into the early morning routine.AFTERNOONOnce you are at work, check the internet news for what's going on in Italy. When having a conversation with co-workers and talking about sports, music, movies or whatever else, bring up Italian-American athletes or singers or actors. Hopefully you'll have a paisan co-worker who will have an equal amount of interest in such things. And always use the hand gestures and Goomba-Italiano slang dialect (oofah, agita, maddone, gabagol', etc) when speaking. At lunch time, go to the Italian deli and pick up a pro-shoot and mozzarell' sengwich with a Manhattan Special. Or if you feel like ahbeetz, go to the pizza parlor on the corner and pick up a slice or a calzone. Don't forget to pop some Perugina mints or a splash of Binaca after eating. You've successfully practiced, discussed and engaged in several more goomba selections for your afternoon.EVENINGGetting back to your guido lair is the best part of the day, when you can relax and let it all hang out. The first thing to do is to grab an ice cold Peroni out of the fridge and if you are really in the mood, light up a Perodi and puff your brains out. At dinner time, it's macaroni with meatballs and a nice glass of homemade vino. At the conclusion of dinner, it's time to watch some ""Who's The Boss"" reruns or play a little ""Super Mario Bros"" with the kids. Later on, pop in a movie, maybe a little ""My Cousin Vinny"" or a ""Sopranos"" DVD. Have your way with the little woman and fall off to sleep until the next day. Once the weekend rolls around, it's out to the club to dance and kick back a dozen or maybe take a trip down the Jersey shore or to an Italian festival.... What was that, 4 or 5 more goomba incorporations there? Look, this is life as you know it, being a true goomba. You are going to stray from this routine and you may even eat White Castle instead of gabagol' one day. But 9 times out of 10, the goomba will pick something goomba over something that every other assimilating meddigan picks. Whether it's the brand of hair gel you pick or the car you drive or the music you listen to or the entertainer or ballplayer you follow. These are the practices of this very select subculture known as the goombas or guidos and you will know one when you see one.More on the dialect...Come stai, molto benne, buon giorno, arrivederci. Every Italian from Italy knows these words and every Italian-American should. But what about the goomba speech pattern? Those words and phrases that are a little Italian, a little American and a little slang. The goomba says ciao when he arrives or leaves. He says Madonna Mia anytime emotion is needed in any given situation. Mannagge, meengya, oofah and of course, va fungool can also be used. Capeesh? He uses a mopeen to wipe his hands in the cucina, gets agita from the gravy and will shceeve meatballs unless they are homemade from the famiglia. Always foonah your bread in the pot of gravy or you will be a mottie or a goo-goots. Mezza-fanooks and mulignans are usually always mamalukes and the girl from the neighborhood with the reputation is a facia-bruta puttana or a schifosa hewa (who-re). If you are called cattivo, garbbadosht, sfatcheem, stupido, or strunz you are usually a pain in the you know what. A crazy diavlo can give you the maloikya (evil eye), but that red horn will protect you if you use it right. Always say per favore and grazie and prego. Piacere is always said if you meet someone you like. If you are feeling mooshadd or stunad or mezza-morta always head to Nonna's and she will fix you with a little homemade manicott,' gavadell' or calamod' or some ricott' cheesecake. Mangia on some zeppoles, canollis, torrone, struffoli, shfooyadell', pignoli cookies, or a little nutella on pannetone. Delizioso! I think I will fix myself a sengweech of gabagol' with some proshoot and mozzarell' or maybe just a hot slice a peetz. Pasta fazool, mussels ma-dinara, clams oregenata, eggplant parmigian' and calzones are more traditional comfort food. Chiaccherones talk too much and if you say perche I don't know why. Just tell them to stattazeet. So salud' if you have any Italian blood in you and if you understood anything I wrote here. If so, you are numero uno and the professore of the goombas. Aspett' a minuto I have another thing to say, domani is another day! If you don't get any of this then fa Napola with the whole thing and you are a disgraziato. Scuzi, me dispiachay, I didn't mean that. Just fugheddaboutit.More Goomba FoodsLasagne, stromboli, risotto, sausage & cheese fritatt', chicken francese, olives, peppers, pepperincinis, salami, provolone, grissinis, ravioli, veal, minestrone soup. Remember, you may see other Italian-Italians or Italian-Americans pronouncing these words differently just as they would other Italian words. The goomba uses this dialect, and it is a real and true version of the Italian words.The Sopranos do everything I've talked about here to a T. Oh and they also work in organized crime but that's really not what the show is all about."	5.0	The Sopranos is a REAL lifestyle	2004-08-12	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ABX7SEE84DMLU	John P Bernat	"My wife and I had bought this collection some time ago [got a good price, too - timing is everything].  We'd just finished the most recent season and were pretty satisfied with it.Then she said, ""Why not pull out Season 1 and see how things have changed?""  So we did.Some of these observations might be more obvious than others...1.  Boy, was Anthony Jr. a cute little boy!!  Even when he was messing up, he was cute.2.  Tony had more hair, especially in episode 1.3.  Uncle Junior was much more ""with it.""  Sure, he was making bad decisions, but they were emphatic bad decisions.4.  Carmela handles an autmatic rifle with apparent ease and familiarity - something she never does again.5.  Episode 1 shows Tony chasing a deadbeat in a Lexus sedan.  I have seldom seen a more effective presentation of a man who is incredibly well-suited to his work, and so much enjoying it, too.  Pure pleasure, good cinematography.6.  The writing was better.7.  Dr. Melfi was more mysterious.  Season 1 peels her like an onion, and it's fascinating.  When she is later attacked, the attack is all the more horrifying for our familiarity with her.8.  If only we could bring Big Pussy back from the dead - man, I liked his character a lot.Anyway, yeah, it's expensive, but you cannot watch The Sopranos without having seen Season 1, so...suck it up."	5.0	The First Season was the Best Season	2004-10-08	5	3	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5	Joseph Haggard Jr.	"There have been many memorable TV shows made for the past five decades. With these shows came memorable characters such as Archie Bunker, Lucy Ricardo, Dr. Frasier Crane, Lt. Theo Kojak, and Det. Andy Sipowicz (just to name a few). You can add Tony Soprano to that distinguished list. ""The Sopranos"" just might be the best dramatic series that I've ever seen. WOW!!! This is quite a different TV show that anything you watch on the major networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox). It's a cable show, and it contains brutal violence, drug use, sexuality/nudity, and a ton of foul language. These are elements that you might find only a little of on a network show (like ""N.Y.P.D. Blue"") but not a lot like on this show. But that's not the reason why ""The Sopranos"" works so well. It works so well because of fresh writing, solid directing, and especially superb ensemble acting. This show has 10-12 memorable characters that I'll never forget. The show has three leading characters, and the actor and two actresses who play them give great performances. Tony Soprano is the leading character, a mob boss with two families: his regular family (wife, kids, etc.), and his mob family. James Gandolfini is a towering presence in his tour-de-force starmaking role as Tony, the man who usually has a hot temper, but at times can have a soft side. The focus of this show is when Tony starts to have panic attacks, and secretly begins to see a shrink. Lorranie Bracco plays Dr. Jennifer Melfi, the shrink who listens to Tony's problems. This is Bracco's best role since her Oscar-nominated performance in the similarily themed ""Goodfellas"". Edie Falco was a real find as Carmela, Tony's loyal, tough-talking wife. This is an actress who I had never heard off or seen until this show came on. Falco is brilliant on ""The Sopranos"" (winning an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a SAG award for the show's first season), and I hope to see more of her in years to come whether it's on the small screen or the big screen. ""The Sopranos"" doesn't focus on Tony, Carmela, and Dr. Melfi all the time. There are the supporting characters too, and they're all played by terrific actors. Most notably (and sadly), the late Nancy Marchand was brilliant in her portrayl of evil matriarch Livia Soprano, Tony's mom. This is what you call great acting. Marchand was already battling lung cancer while making this show, and the job she did here was outstanding. She should have won the Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Emmy for season one, I don't care what anyone says. Robert Iler and Jamie-Lynn Sigler are terrific as Tony's kids Anthony Jr. and Meadow; Dominic Chianese is splendid as Tony's hot-headed Uncle Junior; Michael Imperioli (Christopher), Steven Van Zandt (Silvio), Tony Sirico (Paulie), and Vincent Pastore (Pussy) are all excellent as members of Tony's gang (besides Bracco, Imperioli, Sirico, and Pastore also appeared in ""Goodfellas""; Chianese appeared in ""Godfather Part II""). These are all characters that I'll always remember no matter what happens to them. Creator/executive producer David Chase has fashioned a television show that's smart, funny, and sometimes shocking. ""The Sopranos"" is an example of great television, and to this day I still can't believe that it lost the Best Drama Series Emmy to ""The Practice"" for its first season. What a gyp! I don't think the Emmy voters were paying attention. ""The Sopranos"" is simply the best of the best, and season one was as good as it gets!"	5.0	The Sopranos: Season One	2006-03-03	1	1	0

However, when I turned on my TV and began to watch, I noticed something peculiar: Bryan Cranston was nowhere to be found. Sure, the main character is bald, but he doesn't have a goatee or a hat. His son is just fat and not crippled. What the heck is going on?Soon after I finally put two and two together...this show is not Breaking Bad. As everyone knows, Breaking Bad is THE television show. If it's not Breaking Bad, it's not the greatest show ever, and it's certainly not even watchable. All the reviews are misleading. Only this is the truth. This show is a waste.	1.0	It's not Breaking Bad so it sucks	2014-05-29	6	0	6
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"I've never been a subscriber to HBO, but after getting hooked on ""Deadwood"" I decided to check out some other HBO TV shows and I started with ""The Sopranos."" I rented the first disc and through the next four discs, I realized that this is an amazing show. I love mob movies, but they've become pretty cliche nowadays and lose a lot of entertainment value. This show isn't cliche and if it is, it does it on purpose. You have to love a mob show that features characters doing impressions of The Godfather, Goodfellas, and Scarface. Or commenting about how The Godfather Pt.3 was just misunderstood. The actors in the show are all amazing and fit their parts perfectly. James Gandolfini is just as good as Pacino and DeNiro were in their mobster roles as Tony Soprano, the matriarch of The Soprano family. There's also his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and his son Anthony Jr. I always feel it's best to watch a show without a preconcieved notion of what's going to happen, so I'll give you a basic synopsis instead of details. Tony Soprano begins passing out at random moments and begins seeing Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), a shrink;which in Tony's business isn't good. Meanwhile, he tries to hide this from the boss Uncle Junior and set his mother up in a nursing home. It's one of the weirdest mob families ever created. This show works well on so many levels;it's funny, dramatic, keeps the mood they want at a right level. If it was a movie, there would definitely be some Oscars passed out here and there. Here are the episodes and just some opinions about them:1. The Sopranos-Does something few pilot episodes do. It catches your attention and keeps it there.2. 46 Long-Even better than the pilot episode and very funny.3. Denial, Anger, Acceptance-The best episode so far, the show really begins to grow on this episode.4. Meadowlands-Another great episode, the shows kind of going from black comedy to serious drama by this point.5. College-A great episode involving Tony finding an old mobster who ratted out some of his ""colleagues"". Meanwhile, Carmela has Father Phil (a local priest) spend the night while Tony and Meadow are away.6. Pax Soprana-Another classic episode in which Tony loses some of his libido while realizing he's in love with his therapist.7. Down Neck-Awesome. Features some ""Goodfellas"" like flashbacks.8. The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti-This episode involves The FBI arriving at Tony's house. The episode is yet another winner.9. Boca-This episode is pretty funny and well written. It involves Uncle Junior not wanting anyone to know that he performs oral sex on his lady friend and Tony finding out Meadow's soccer coach had sex with a teammate.10. A Hit is a Hit-I love how characters frequently talk about classic mob films like ""The Godfather"". This is a really funny episode. One of the best so far.11. Nobody Knows Anything-A main character dies in this episode (although, it's probably not who you think it is) and there's a rat in the family. Interesting episode with some interesting revelations at the end.12. Isabella-This episode has a different mood to it and while it could be deleted from the season and you wouldn't miss a thing; It's a damn good episode.13. I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano-This is the season finale and it's got to be the best episode. It's the longest and most entertaining.This is definitley a show you need to check out.GRADE: A"	5.0	Outstanding	2006-06-15	5	5	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A29FUUF4RZJMUR	"J. Rondon ""151sheridan"""	I originally bought the 1st Season DVD set of the Sopranos as a Xmas gift for my Stepfather, but never had seen the show myself.  When my parents got through the whole season in a week, I figured I'd check it out and rent it off Netflix.  Within 2 weeks, I had bought all 4 seasons!  It is completely engrossing and is probably one of the top 5 works of entertainment I've ever seen.  It's a bit violent and risque, but the storylines, acting, and especially the production, are so good that the liberal language and nudity is almost secondary (but it's definitely for the over 16 crowd).  The casting is brilliant, and the DVD sets themselves are attractive and well-presented, though a little light on special features.  I am actually considering getting HBO just to be able to see the 5th season, which starts in March 2004.  The New York Times has hailed the Sopranos as the greatest achievement in American pop culture in the last quarter-century, so if you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out.Don't put off the show thinking it's another mob/crime drama. This truly lives up to the hype. It's extremely rich entertainment.	5.0	A Television Work of Art	2004-02-07	4	3	1

I gave it 4 stars because it got melodramatic and slow in the middle; not what I would expect from a gangster series, but I guess it was filler. All in all, it was a great set, great packaging, and the 4 episodes per disk helps you stay up all night watching it and makes you late for work the next day. I would suggest timing it so that it comes in on Friday. James Gandolfini is superb.	4.0	Very good first season	2002-01-06	3	1	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A13S9X0VL3VPXB	Judith K. Sherman	Just when I thought that Amazon Prime's streaming library was unworthy of its upwardly revised subscription price, Amazon announced that a huge chunk of HBO's catalog of shows is now available, free of charge to members. I had long been aware of the buzz surrounding The Sopranos, but had never watched it since I do not subscribe to HBO.Five minutes into Episode 1 of the first series, I was hooked. While gangsters and violence are not even remotely funny, the writers have created characters that are well drawn with interesting nuances of sensitivity and affection. My favorite character is the mother, whose self pitying and guilt inducing barbs are hilarious.I have now finished watching Episode 7 and I look forward, with great anticipation, to my next serving of this unexpected delight. This series is fun, funny and addictive. If I watch two episodes each night, how long will it take to finish watching the entire series? Hmmm. Maybe I should consider watching 3 or 4 episodes each day...especially if I want to see Boardwalk Empire, The Pacific, The Boss and so many other HBO offerings!	5.0	Thank you, Amazon Prime!	2014-05-26	0	0	0

We enjoyed it so much that, after we watched all of the added special features, we promptly went back and watched the series again!  And it was just as good, if not better, the second time around... Yes, the &quot;f&quot; word is prominent and used in as many grammatical ways as there are, but this in no way detracted from our enjoyment.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, for its dramatic effect as well as its comedy.  When will the second season be out on DVD?????  We can't wait and will probably have to watch the first season AGAIN before we watch the second season - gee, that would be a pity (NOT)!

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AV0OBG2SS1I1R	K. A D. Veer	"When I first saw ""The Godfather,"" it got me interested in the mafia. It was scary, smart, and entertaining. But after seeing the first episode in this fantastic boxed set, I was hooked. The family on both sides of Tony Soprano (the mafia, and his blood family) continue to push him to the breaking point, which is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and always captivating. He also keeps an interesting relationship with his therapist, that he must keep secret from the mafia, as it is a sign of weekness.At first glance, his blood family seems disfunctional, but that is mearly the writer of the show doing something we are not familiar with in this industry: being honest. Some shows, like ""the Simpsons"" look at family like too comicly (but i still love it anyway), and others look at it very unrealistically like ""7th Heaven,"" which makes family life look too happy and clean.This is the only television show that I would pay [price] for at this time. I highly recomend this show to anyone interested in the mafia.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AY46DEOJJYFTW	Kerry O. Burns	I am a diehard Sopranos fan. I still have that Journey song bouncing through my head from the very last episode. So what is a 'made fan' supposed to do now that the only series I watched is now over? Start watching from the very beginning. I've been a fan since season 1 but how refreshing it is to watch it all again. It is amazing to see how young everyone is back from season 1. The intro to the characters and all the little nuances that you pick up is amazing. The storyline of Tony in his first session with Melfi, how conniving his mother was, Uncle Jun and his old school ways. Most amazing to me how virile and full of hope Tony seems to be and how much he changed over the years beaten down by the life he leads. Incredible writing and incredible acting. A dvd for the ages.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	The anti-hero themed series is hot right now in the wake of series like Breaking Bad, Dexter and even Mad Men & Hannibal's leads, but over a decade ago in 1999 the Sopranos introduced us to an ensemble of recurring problematic characters. The original HBO series was ultimately Goodfellas set in &#34;the present day&#34; and earned over 20 Emmys over its 6 season run. The most brilliant twist on the premise was having jersey mob boss Tony Soprano (the Late great James Gandolfini) begin therapy in the pilot episode (and continuing throughout the series run) to get to the bottom of anxiety attacks he's having.  By doing this the viewer has a unique window into the character's thoughts that would not be possible outside of a monologue or a book format.  This is a risk as big as any as Tony remarks &#34;The wrong person finds out about this and I get a steel-jacketed anti-depressant right in the back of the head!&#34; In a great bit of casting an equally interesting character provides this therapy Goodfellas' Karen Hill herself Lorraine Bracco plays Dr Melif. Bracco isn't the only Goodfellas vet of the Sopranos regular cast, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, Frank Vincent, and Joseph R. Gannascoli are all in the Scorsese mob classic. In turn Scorsese himself turns up as himself for a second in the Sopranos pilot. Don't let the series pedigree convince you, this is must watch wise guy dramaSeason 1We meet the Sopranos, before long the old Don's passing a power struggle ensues as Tony makes his move while letting his Uncle Junior become the family figurehead. Tony sets his manipulative mother up in assisted living. Pre-collage pressures drive Tony's daughter to experiment with drugs and while on a collage scouting trip with her he spots a snitch. Problems with Anthony Jr. Lead Tony to reflect on his childhood. The family learns that the Feds have indictments coming and it gets out that Tony is seeing a shrink. There's some issues with a local girl's Soccer coach and Uncle Junior's sex life becomes too public. Chris & Adriana try their hand at the music industry. Tony suspects a traitor after some suspect arrests. In the penultimate and strongest ep of season one &#34;Isabella&#34; Tony's stress at a high leads him to a enigmatic Italian student ending with an attempt on his life	5.0	"I'm in waste management...

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2JF0ZD11IMTK1	K.	"They're playing us for stupid, and we're acting the part.  Hey, I like The Sopranos as ""entertainment,"" but it isn't just entertainment.  It's sophisticated barrage of ""suggestions"" designed to pass for fun.  The constant pharmaceutical company marketing of Prozac, (as well as product placements like Chevrolet and Sharp) is quite odd.  You didn't see any of that in the Godfather, did you?  Makes one wonder who owns HBO.  They throw in chemicals too, like for pesticides (Bug-B-Gone) and lettuce &quot;brighteners.&quot;  They act like everybody uses this stuff and believes it's okay.  But many people know that pesticides are poison, and lettuce is no longer FOOD if altered with toxic chemicals!  The Sopranos too often seems like HBO is a bit too friendly with the chemical giants and are using the mafia concept to sell pollution for profit.  This makes the series very disturbing to me.  The Sopranos is very watchable, but the idea of the true mafia using the old mafia concept to distract us, really creeps me out.  If it weren't so calculated it would be ironic.  At the very least, we're watching a show without commercials, because the commercials are built in.  You don't think this doesn't affect the story, do you?  Come on.  Enjoy, but ask yourself who's truly benefiting.  Or, just pop a Lithium and forget about it!  Because REALLY, no one would sell you out for a few million bucks and a good measure of power, now would they?  Of course not.  You must be crazy."	1.0	A PROZAC COMMERCIAL	2002-07-10	103	10	93

The colors are bold and vivid and the production has a realistic three-dimensional look.However ... dark interior scenes and night-time scenes are way too dark, especially in the pilot and first three or four episodes.  Sometimes the characters' faces are completely lost in shadow.  I have watched this on DVD several times and these scenes looked very different.  Scenes inside the ""Bing"", for example, look as if someone cranked the contrast up way too high.Most of the episodes look spectacular, but the dark scenes often look muddy.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A16X61RLY1YJL7	"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	&quot;Family Redefined&quot; is what it says on the cover of the boxed DVD set and has been one of the predominant themes behind &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and that theme couldn't be more accurate.  Over the years there has been so many mob movies and television series, but few, if any, have taken a look at the mob life as such as &quot;The Sopranos&quot; has.  From the very beginning of this outstanding series, you the viewer know that something very special in the world of television is playing out before your eyes.Very few shows on television today draw my interest, but this series has quite easily drawn me into the fold.  The entire atmosphere is completely and thoroughly intriguing as you see Tony Soprano, New Jersey crime family Capo and de-facto boss go through all of the troubles he's having between trying to balance his home life with his wife and kids, his Russian girlfriend and &quot;the&quot; family and all of its idiosyncrasies and the daily predicaments that come about in that life.  All of which brings him to his mother who has been driving him nuts all of his life.  Between all of the other things in his life and his mother, you now have the very basic core of what makes this show so interesting, a crime boss who finds that he must see a therapist to try and cope with it all.All of the actors and actresses in this series deserve all of the accolades they've received and continue to receive for bringing to life this exceptional story.  Show creator, writer and director David Chase, has proven with &quot;The Sopranos&quot; what a pure genius he is.  One of the main things I like about the writing and directing for this incredible series is the way they can drop tidbits of information here and there and the payoff for that information may come during that episode or it may not come until the next show or several shows down the road, all showing what serious and genius thought is going into the show.Could there have been another main title song for the series, yes, but it wouldn't have been nearly as appropriate.DVD Features:  Another of my favorite features is the way the DVD's are set up with episode index and the &quot;previously&quot; and &quot;next on&quot; features.  Of course, given that this series is on HBO, these features were sure to be added.Episodes:The Sopranos - This is the premier episode that serves beautifully to in establishing some of the premises to this outstanding series that has won so many awards!  Tony Soprano, a Capo in a New Jersey crime family is having panic attacks and starts seeing a therapist.  Along with the scenes with him and the therapist there are some great &quot;mob&quot; scenes.46 Long - After some serious incidents, Tony is finally able to get his mother in a &quot;retirement community&quot; and Christopher and friend Brendan are getting into Uncle Junior's business.Anger, Denial, Acceptance - Issues between Tony and Junior are coming to a head and Meadow seeks out Christopher to &quot;help&quot; her and her friend study for the SAT's.Meadowlands - Tony now finds himself dreaming about Dr. Melfi and goes so far as to have her followed by a degenerate cop who is on his payroll.  Junior teaches Christopher a hard lesson.  With the tension rising between Tony and his Uncle Junior he has to come up with a solution to the crisis before all out war breaks out in the family.College - This is a brilliantly written episode that touches on the poignant and at the same time furthers the series by showing both sides of Tony's personality.  Tony is taking Meadow on a trip to visit several prospective colleges and he happens to notice someone who had ratted out several years earlier.Pax Soprana - To smooth things out in the family, Tony supports Junior becoming Boss, although everybody but Junior and his crew knows that it's Tony running things.  Of course, given Junior's homicidal tendencies, he's not making it easy for Tony.  We start to see signs here that the FBI is taking a closer look at the family as well.Down Neck - Anthony Jr. is having problems at school and is suspended.  As part of his &quot;punishment&quot; he is made to visit his grandmother at the nursing home and he reveals a family secret to Livia that will have serious ramifications.The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti - The word is out that the FBI is moving in and it's time to clean house and Livia lets slip to Junior Tony's secret.Boca - The tension between Tony and Junior builds up even higher as Tony now has a secret about him as well.A Hit is a Hit - Christopher and Adriana makes an attempt to get into the music business and Tony is encouraged to socialize with &quot;regular&quot; people.Nobody Knows Anything - Tony finds out there's a rat in the mist and it's supposed to be one of his best friends, who he hopes it's not.  Livia continues to stir the pot with Junior and he makes his ultimate decision.Isabella - Tony is severely depressed and he &quot;meets&quot; an extraordinarily beautiful exchange student.  Junior takes his shot at Tony!I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano - In this incredible season closer the whole season comes to a head as it becomes clear who the rat is and the Feds play a tape for Tony, making it perfectly clear who made an attempt on his life.  {ssintrepid}Episode list:The Sopranos46 LongDenial, Anger, AcceptanceMeadowlandsCollegePax SopranaDown NeckThe Legend of Tennessee MoltisantiBocaA Hit is a HitNobody Knows AnythingIsabellaI Dream of Jeannie CusamanoSpecial Features:- Interview with Sopranos creator David Chase by Peter Bogdanovich- 2 Behind the Scenes Featurettes	5.0	The Sopranos Season 1 - An incredible series!	2003-10-27	15	10	5

Tony`s journey of self discovery coupled with his stress over running his crew and worrying constantly about FUN informants, while trying to balance all of that with maintaining and providing for his family's daily life, like preparing the daughter for college, dealing with his sons lackluster interest in school, and his wife's constant need for control, make for a fun and involving drama with a little something for everyone!	5.0	Enjoyable	2014-06-05	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2NQUGGYM0DBM1	L.A. Scene	"There aren't many television shows in the 50+ years of television history that can be categorized as a ""weekly event"".  A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  ""The Sopranos"" would be different in that it was a show that appeared on a premium (pay) cable station and would prove that premium cable stations can produce high quality shows that provide high levels of enjoyment.  I'm not someone who subscribes to HBO so I felt on the ""outside"" on the ""talk"" would surround the episodes of ""The Sopranos"".  However that didn't stop my curiosity about wanting to watch the show.  Once I watched ""The Sopranos - The Complete First Season"", I not only got an appreciation for the show - but I now understood where all of the hype came from on this show.The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is a ""capo"" (high ranking member of organized crime) in the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  In his home life, he is trying to keep his marriage together to his wife Carmela (played by Edie Falco) while his children Meadow (played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler) and Anthony Jr. (played by Robert Iler) are beginning to learn about the line of work their father is involved in.  Also on the home front, Tony is dealing with putting his mother in a nursing home.  The pressures of his homel life combined with the volatile nature of being involved in organized crime has triggered panic attacks in Tony.  To deal with the treatment of his panic attacks, Tony sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).  Throughout the first year, we see how Tony begins to trust Dr. Melfi and how he grows closer to her.Here are ten points about the show that I took from watching this DVD set - in no particular order1.One thing I realized as I watched all 13 episodes in Season 1 - James Gandolfini is one terrific actor.  Gandolfini is extremely believable as Tony Soprano and he will probably always be joined at the hip to his character.  I think the fact that he was born and raised in New Jersey makes him a natural for the environment and setting of the show.2.As usual, HBO will push the sex and language - something that is typical in HBO's original programming.  While there are objectionable elements, these elements do play a role in contributing to creating a realistic environment with realistic characters.  I give producer David Chase a lot of credit for this.3.While I love the idea of Tony Soprano seeing a psychiatrist, I didn't find the character of Dr. Melfi very interesting.  I found Melfi's character dry and I felt more could have been done to develop her.4.The opening sequence and credits to the show are awesome.  Watching Tony Soprano drive from the Lincoln Tunnel through North Jersey to the song ""Woke Up in the Morning"" (performed by A3)  is powerful stuff.5.I found the whole idea of setting the show in North Jersey to be fascinating.  In addition to the opening sequence, a good chunk of the show is filmed in North Jersey.  I grew up in this area and never found the surroundings to be interesting.  However, putting the show in North Jersey really works.  It's amazing that people outside of North Jersey recognize many of the landmarks in North Jersey as a result of watching this show - landmarks that just never interested me.6.David Chase is brilliant at integrating music into the show.  In addition to the title song, Chase does a great job at finding the right music for the right scene.  The closing credits of each episode always use a different song - yet Chase finds a song that fits the ending of each of the episodes.7.Paulie Walnuts is one of the all-time great characters.  Tony Sirico does an outstanding job at playing Paulie while integrating a sense of humor into both his character and the show.  One of the best scenes is when Paulie is in an Espresso Bar and complains how ""his culture"" missed out on cashing in on the whole coffee boom.  It's a shame Paulie didn't get more airtime in Season 1.8.While the storylines are terrific and entertaining, sometimes I did find them a little tough to follow.  I often found myself having to do some outside research on the background of ""The Sopranos"" so I can could follow the storylines.9.Michael Imperioli is brilliant as Christopher Moltisanti.  Moltisanti plays a young cousin of Carmela who is trying to become a ""made man"".  There is a scene in Season 1 involving Christopher that will remind you of Imperioli's performance in ""Goodfellas"".10.Steven (""Little Steven"") Van Zandt plays Silvio ""Sil"" Dante, the owner of the ""Bada Bing"" nightclub.  This is the same ""Little Steven"" from Bruce Springsteen's E. Street Band.  Van Zandt is brilliant on the show and has a very believable character.  Like Paulie, I kind of wish he had more scenes than he had.Overall, I found the show to be riveting television and would not hesitate to call this ""the most exciting 60 minutes on television"".  In addition to the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, this is a very good and entertaining set - highly recommended."	5.0	"A True Television ""Event"""	2006-04-13	1	1	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	My son is a big Sopranos fan, so I bought him the set for Christmas. I myself had seen maybe two or three episodes on cable and had enjoyed them. So, when he began watching, I was right there watching with him. What a terrific show. It is absolutely gripping.It is a marvelously creative series with a stellar cast. For those of you who have been visiting relatives in Antarctica for the past several years, the story revolves around the mob in New Jersey. It centers on one family specifically, the Sopranos, headed by Anthony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who is married to his loyal childhood sweetheart, Carmela (Edie DeFalco). Together they have two children, Meadow and Anthony, Jr. Tony's dangerously manipulative mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), is bound for a retirement home, if Tony has any say.Tony, however, has another family, comprised of a bunch of murderous henchmen, who occasionally march to the tune of a different drummer, and a Russian mistress. Trying to balance all this has given Tony panic attacks, so he goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), whose relationship with her client alternates between fear and fascination.The writing for this series is splendid and the interweaving of comedic and familial moments with the darker, more violent ones provides the viewer with an intelligently woven plot. James Gandolfini is outstanding as Tony Soprano, a powerful mob boss, who can also be a teddy bear of a guy and a good friend, unless you are perceived to have been disloyal. Then, you may kiss your buns goodbye. Tony is mercurial, sexy, fearful, cautious, and, given the right circumstances, deadly. He is a fascinating and beguiling character. Edie DeFalco is warm, funny, loyal, and the glue that binds their immediate family together. Yet, she too has her own sting, and she knows the power that her husband has. She is not above using it herself, if necessary. The late Nancy Marchand was terrific as Livia, the manipulative, scheming mother. She will be missed, as she was quite a character.All in all, this is a great show and a great set to own. I have already seen the first, second, and third seasons. I now can't wait for the fourth season to be released.	5.0	THE SOPRANOS HIT A HIGH NOTE...	2003-01-04	9	6	3

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3774UJAKO4FHI	lesley9	Multi-layered, compelling, absorbing. The series takes on a depth not possible in the HBO weekly airings by the ability to watch each episode immediately in order and then go rewatch the series again.Nancy Marchand's performance and the character itself has an especially sublime complexity rarely seen on TV or in the movies. The Chase commentary on the first episode points out how dark her character is when she doesn't object to the even then hinting by Junior that Tony may need to be removed. You cannot have appreciated that moment if you have not viewed the series more than once.I'm dying for series two to be released on DVD. And then series three. This is one instance (rare) in TV/movies where the interaction between the written word and the ability to see the actor's performance elevate both to a level of praise usually reserved for great literature alone.Although it occurs in Series two somewhere, I remember watching Tony's sister Janice in a solo shot driving her car. The camera's viewing her from the front passenger side. I can't even remember the story line at that point but I remember being wowed by her facial expressions going through a million quick fast changes with little dialogue as some line of thought is going thru her mind. It was just a little moment but indicative of what Chase was able to achieve with this series.	5.0	A Reason to buy a DVD player.	2001-01-28	2	2	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	I didn't have HBO when The Sopranos came out in 1999, and so I am delighted that it is now on a set of DVD discs.  I'm a big fan of books and movies about the Mafia and so I was prepared to love it. I must say that my expectations were all met, and more.  There is nothing like being able to watch the series, in its entirety, all at once, at my own pace.  And there is nothing like watching several video interviews and behind the scenes featurettes on the discs to enhance the viewing experience with background information.  This series has won many awards.  I can understand why.James Gandofini stars as Tony Soprano, a very human individual, who just happens to be a gangster.  He's living in modern times though, and so he's plagued with depression and goes to a therapist, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Tony's domestic scenes, which include his wife, Edie Falco, his daughter, Jamie-Lyn Sigler, his son, Robert Iler, and - especially his mother, Nancy Marchand, are all unique and slightly off-center examples of brilliant writing and editing.  Add to this his criminal activities and his violent temper, and there's a mix that fascinates me completely.One of the delights of the series is that I can't quite figure what will happen next. I'm constantly on edge as I watch the story unfold, and there are always surprises.  I like the humor and the irreverence.  And best of all I like the fact that each episode is commercial free and a complete movie in itself.  I love it when the scenes move back and forth between the actual crime stuff and his family life.  And I love the humanity that Tony exhibits.  In a way he is &quot;everyman&quot; as he struggles with decisions and hard choices in his life.  And yet, he is larger than life, and a bit of a hero to our culture.  Couple this with really fine acting and an excellent script, and a winner emerges.I'm not into dream sequences and these were the only parts that dragged down the action, but there were only a very few throughout all the episodes.  However, now that I look back on it, I'm glad they were there, because even though I was annoyed with them at the time, I can now see how they really helped develop the characters.  These on-target characterizations are what drive the series and make it soar above its nearest competitors.  The Sopranos on DVD is a winner in every sense of the world.  And it is not only recommended for aficionados of the gangster genre.  It gets my highest recommended for everyone.	5.0	Larger than life and full of humor, irreverence and humanity	2002-07-12	51	45	6

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	I'm normally not a gangster-movie watcher, so I was a bit hesitant when we first started watching the Sopranos. I was afraid it'd be a tired, stereotyped show. I was amazed at the quality of acting and screenwriting, and was sucked in immediately. I rarely watch TV, but I found myself setting aside the time when the Sopranos came on, and enjoying it immensely. My boyfriend, a NYC native, loves it as well.It's not just about a mobster and his criminal life. Tony has a wife who is struggling with what her husband does both on and off the job, his kids are both going through heady doses of teenaged angst while buffeted by the realization that their family is funded by criminal activities. Tony's shrink is both attracted and repelled to him, and finds her professional and personal life mixing.There's intergenerational conflict, Tony struggling to keep things going, betrayals that are completely believable, people tyring to do the right thing in a large sea of wrongness.The characters *know* they are of a type. They joke about the Godfather movies and will mimic lines in it while on a job.It's a show of multiple layers, and one that gives a richer feeling each time you watch it. Quite stunning when compared to a lot of the mind-rot you find on tv. I'd highly recommend the DVD not only to those who love the show, but also to those who haven't seen it yet. Give it a try - you'll find these DVDs get a lot of use.	5.0	Incredibly good drama with fun ironic touches	2000-12-12	31	26	5

And Amazon won't allow you to choose a different one even if you want it.

Is is gritty, down to earth and not glossed over like &#34;The Godfather&#34;was.  It tells the story of the modern day mobster.  Tony Soprano is made boss after his mentor dies of cancer.  It's all about a &#34;Boss&#34;of a family of the New Jersey mob that suffers from anxiety and depression and how he handles his crew, his psychiatrist and his own family: a wife and two children and a Mother that is even more vicious and underhanded than he is.  The characters you have surely seen in other mob movies and seem very real.  The series shows the real life of the guys on the street as they try to make money to be passed up to the &#34;Boss&#34;.  It seems that basically everyone of them are sociopaths including the family members, who sometimes grow up confused about their identities and either go to college or into the &#34;business&#34; Tony and Carmella are really the stars of what family life is like living with a mob boss.  It is well written and different. Forget about it, try it, it'll make you an offer you can't refuse!&#34;	5.0	The Sopranos Rocked	2014-05-31	0	0	0

However, during a recent baby-sitting gig, I began to watch The Sopranos - The Complete First Season after my friend's daughter had gone to sleep.I was immediately and hopelessly hooked.This first installment of the series definitely lives up to its hype. This is smart, engrossing entertainment that's strictly for adults, and is probably the BLACKEST comedy you're likely to ever encounter on television. Most of the casting is perfect and is expertly handled, the exception being the embarrassingly untalented ""Miami,"" ""Little"" (your choice of adjectives) Steven Van Zandt, whose overzealous mugging makes me cringe. However, I understand that he's responsible for choosing most of the music used and given that his taste is exemplary (translation: I applaud his selections), his presence can be excused. (At least he's not allowed to wear his signature shmatta on his head while in character.) And speaking of music, viewers should take the time to consider being appreciative that seasons are being released on DVD without having to consider music rights; it would have been a shame if this series had been forced to substitute generic filler for the brilliant original choices used, a la the recent Northern Exposure and SCTV DVD releases. This is yet another case where the music selections are cast members, and essential ones at that.Special features include two featurettes, both of which are good, and an interview with series creator David Chase. This effort is flawed by HBO's choice of interviewer, pretentious windbag has-been, Peter Bogdanovich (who turns up as Jennifer Melfi's own therapist in Season 2). Mr. Bogdanovich, who has manufactured a second career based on knowing much more talented and significant directors, is congenitally unable to undertake an interview without mentioning Hitchcock and/or Welles, and is invariably seized by the Rich Little syndrome, i.e., he's compelled to do impressions of them as well (which I must admit are quite good, leading me to suspect that he has quite a bit of free time on his hands during which to perfect them). During the course of this interview, his attempt at introducing Hitchcock is abortive and I waited with bated breath for the inevitable ""Welles,"" which he successfully managed to insert (my disgust was, however, much mitigated by his mispronunciation of the word ""elegiac""). The same two individuals are paired for the commentary, which is restricted to the first episode, and during which P.B. drops Preminger's name sans impression.The DVD's double as DVD-ROM's, but they're Windows-compatible and are useless on all but the most recent Macs, hence I'm unable to comment on them. This somewhat annoying oversight is probably the only flaw in the set.Regardless of whether or not you agree with my observations on P.B., do pick up this set, especially if you've a rookie. Amazon third-party sellers offer it at incredibly low prices; grab it. And for those who find its depiction of Italian Americans offensive, I'd like to suggest that it's unlikely that most viewers think that The Sopranos typifies Italian Americans in general; I know I don't, and I grew up in a Sicilian neighborhood.

It's Mob-Side story is something a lot of us cannon relate to, but when it begins to affect the personal lives of all the people who are connected to Tony Soprano, the outcomes hit home in many different ways.You may watch the show for the first time and get so caught up in the story line, that you may think that the show paces very slowly; however, upon a 2nd and 3rd viewing, you begin to see the ideas between the lines of these characters and the desperation that they feel on a daily basis to find out where true happiness and the real good lies in all of us.

The acting, writing and humour (sarcasm and irony especially) first class.I've seen this series loads of times and i don't think i'll ever get bored of it.	5.0	Unbeatable	2004-07-23	3	1	2

I like the dynamics between Tony, his wife, mother and the female psychologist. I would suggest the Sopranos to anyone who is looking for something good to watch this summer...that is if they dont mind a little blood and gore every now and then.

The slipcase and fold-out jewel-box are very attractive, and there are lots of bonus features on the 4th disc.  Each episode is preceded by an information screen showing writer, director, synopsis, etc.  As for the show itself, it's hard to write anything original about the hottest thing going...if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a real treat.

And working with the mob figure due to the popularity of The Godfather.  I found the first episode somewhat entertaining.  Then it became rather dull and unimaginative.  It seemed the characters were not very believeable and not very entertaining.  I never saw the program when it was new and popular. It didn't sound very interesting. So thought I would give it a try.

They were entitled &quot;College&quot; and &quot;Pax Soprana&quot;, and they were both  layered and brilliantly written, with witty dialouge and great multi-faceted characters. The acting, as well, was across the board perfection, particulary Marchand, Falco and Gandofini. But most impressive, it did something that television rarely does: it made me want to see the next episode, right then and there. Each had it's miniscule flaws, but with television this good, there excusable. Both episodes: A-. Can't wait to see more episodes and buy the complete first season!	5.0	Great Series	2000-12-25	2	1	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	Season 1 of the Sopranos was one of the best series ever made.  Each episode was well directed and the characters were compelling and believable (the other 4 seasons are by no means close in comparison).  A mob family in turmoil after its boss is suffering cancer.  Tony and Corado Soprano compete for succession as boss.  Tony, decides it is better to let Corado be boss and have the Feds chase him while Tony himself runs his own little group with no government pressure.Tony cannot deal with his daily stress and starts seeing a psychiatrist, brilliantly played by Lorraine Bracco.  The exchanges between the two become the highlight of the first season.  Basically, Tony is more happy with animals than people and this is because of a controlling mother that never loved him.  In fact during the season his mother plots with Corado to have Tony bumped off.Tony has a very loyal wife that tries to overlook his &quot;indiscretions&quot; with other women while trying to come to an understanding about her own religious beliefs.  The two have two adolecent children that have &quot;real&quot; problems like all other kids.  During the season the two come to realize that there is more to their father's &quot;business&quot; than they thought.Great character actors make up Tony's mob.

With out it there are so many shows today that would never have been made. James Gandolfini was so good that he was type cast until the day he died. Edie Falco was amazing, And the list goes on and on.Anyone who hasn't seen The Sopranos owes it to themselves to see this one.

I watched the entire Sapranos series when it first aired on HBO back in the 90's. I am kind of a mafia student if you will. I have studied the history of it and watched all of the video and read all of the books.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	For thirteen straight nights in September of 2000, Canadian viewers were treated to nightly, uncut and uncensored installments of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; on free, network television.  It was the perfect introduction.After hearing much hype about this show, I was very intrigued to see what all the fuss was about.  After the first episode, however, I felt ripped off.  The characters came off as two-dimensional, cliched &quot;goombah&quot; types.  Furthermore, their insistence on constantly referring to the great gangster films of Francis Ford Coppolla and Martin Scorcese only underscored this lack of reality.  But after viewing a couple more episodes, it hit me: that's the point!  These characters aren't old school, authentic Mafioso.  They are most definitely contemporary.  Post-modern mobsters, if you will.  They know every line of Godfather I &amp; II (but of course not III), and allow it to seep into their everyday speech.  They are very media savvy.  Notice that whenever something newsworthy happens to the 'family' (e.g., Jackie's death; the failed hit on Tony), they find out about it on the 6 o'clock news.The self-examination theme is stretched even further, with Tony's relationship with Dr. Melfi.  The mobster-sees-shrink idea, which was beaten to death in &quot;Analyze This&quot;, is actually quite effective here.  How does Tony talk about his personal life without endangering the doctor?  How does he hide his &quot;weakness&quot; from his mob family?  How does he deal with his depression, insomnia, and impotence, in a world where strength is mandatory?  Well, needless to say that no easy answers are offered.  A refreshing change, that.Tony Soprano is one of those characters that could easily degenerate into a collection of cliches.  But the show's superb writing and the great acting of James Gandolfini never let this happen.  Tony exists in the eye of a very powerful hurricane, where the swirling winds threaten to carry him away at any moment.  His wife is conflicted about the job his kids are just beginning to find out about; the conflicts between members of his crew are constantly dropped in his lap; and worst of all, his senile mother may or may not be what she appears to be.  Gandolfini manages to convincingly play all sides of this complex man, with humour, charisma, and when he needs it, incredible power.Other standout actors include Dominic Chianese as 'Uncle Junior', the old school gangster with his first taste of power; Michael Imperioli as the confidant and aggressive up-and-comer 'Christopher Moltisanti' (&quot;He'll even be buried in his track suit&quot;); and Nancy Marchand as the matriarchal 'Livia Soprano'.  Livia is an interesting character, in that it took me the full first season to fully grasp that her character wasn't some wishy-washy old lady, but actually quite calculating.  Or was she?  I guess that's a question the second season should answer (I hope we get to see here).Some of the acting, however, is not quite up to snuff.  Little Steven Van Zandt is a collection of annoying tics in his first acting role, Edie Falco gave a much more interesting performance when she was on 'Oz' (although I do see much room for her fed-up housewife to grow), and Lorraine Bracco's 'Dr. Melfi' is, for the most part, just plain boring.  She spouts Freudian psycho-pabulum as if it were the gospel.  She even manages an emotionless veneer when confronted with danger.  Her saving grace (for the viewer and for Tony) is that she looks good in short skirts.But these are all minor complaints.  Overall, the show just kept getting better and better, from episode 1 to episode 13, as the characters became more fleshed out and the dramatic tension increased.  Finally, an instance where massive hype yields a rewarding result.	5.0	Manages to live up to its hype	2000-10-04	146	114	32
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	I don't subscribe to HBO, so my recent purchase of a DVD player has opened to me the crazed, profane, fascinating world of &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; After having watched the complete first season and most of the second, I have no doubt that this show is unique--and uniquely excellent--in the annals of television. Each episode is as tighly written and superbly acted as an excellent movie, but the series structure allows creator David Chase and his writers to expand and complicate the characters as you would in a serialized novel. The effect is like a collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Charles Dickens! You feel that &quot;The Sopranos&quot; gives the most complete picture of life in the mob of any movie or TV series ever; &quot;The Godfather&quot; and even &quot;GoodFellas&quot; seem hopelessly romanticized by comparison. (Tellingly, Tony's crew quotes &quot;The Godfather&quot; constantly, trying to make their sordid lives into the stuff of movie glamor.) Virtually every character on the show is complex and interesting enough to devote an entire column to, but you can't write anything meaningful about &quot;The Sopranos&quot; without discussing the central character, Tony Soprano. Greedy and violent, yet also possessed of charm and organizational ability, Tony seems to have compartmentalized his life comfortably into his &quot;business&quot; life--i.e. stealing and murdering--and his family life. That is, until he starts having blackouts... In any case, Tony is a larger-than-life character, and James Gandolfini does an incredible job in bringing him to life, with all his contradictions, doubts and sudden rages. As Gandolfini plays him, Tony is Henry VIII with a Joisey accent, or Ralph Kramden with a .38. All the other performers--Edie Falco as Carmela, Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Melfi, Michael Imperioli as Christopher--likewise manage incredible balancing acts with their characters. But special mention must be made of Nancy Marchand--formerly famous for playing patrician roles--as Livia, Tony's bitter and paranoid mom, an emasculating mother if there ever was one.	5.0	Is this the best TV series ever, or what?	2004-05-22	3	2	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ATECU14VUIOJ0	Miss Barbara	"I'm probably the last person on the planet to watch the Sopranos.  At first I thought that the genre would turn me off.  Then I thought that it would be too muddled in Mafioso minutiae to hold my interest.  Little did I expect a family story in keeping with the OC only on the East Coast and instead of a left leaning attorney father figure, I'd find a two fisted family man.  Instead of bagels with a schemer we get pasta in take out containers.The family is a caricature of the typical East Coast Italian clan.  We get momma who lays guilt on her kids, Uncle Pussy with the heart of gold (and lead), Uncle Junior who's at the end of his reign of leadership and the wife who has the hots for the parish padre.Tony hooks up with a head shrink which strikes fear into the ""family"" as they are sure he's telling tales ""out of school"".

Since I don't have HBO, I never did see Sopranos until I bought the DVD set.  I knew I would love the show as Chase worked on another TV show I use to love: Northern Exposure. Well was I right! The Sopranos is just great TV. My wife and I both enjoy watching the episodes.  The DVD quality is top notch, with great 5.1 audio and 16:9 enhanced video!

It is about psychopaths who are dangerous and not at all funny, yet this show has it's humor too.  It was great to go back to the beginning and see how it started out.  Interesting note:  James Gandolfini died of a heart attack and was very heavy, but in Episode One, not that many years before, he wasn't all that fat.  Apparently, one does not always have to be fat for decades in order to die of a heart attack.That &#34;medical note&#34; aside, the show is excellent.	5.0	One of the Best Shows of All Time	2014-06-06	0	0	0

I did have a defective disc when I first ordered, but the box set was replaced. I thoroughly enjoyed this first season. I began watching the series on HBO years back but never stuck with it consistently. Glad to add this series to my collection. I did want to add that when I first ordered the actual seriesThe Sopranos Complete SeriesI had huge problems with defective discs. Three times the series was replaced, until I gave up. I found ordering the series separately was not only cheaper but better chance of having proper working discs.	5.0	Excellent	2014-01-14	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AVNFGFRFPAFK4	"Myrna Minkoff ""Myrna"""	This pathetic mafia soap opera is an artless ripoff of the fan base built by Coppola, Scorsese, and other masters of the genre.  A cheap knockoff.  A waste of time.  I find it very depressing that this rubbish became so popoular...speaks volumes about the vast wasteland of popular culture.  The fact that Don Imus tirelessly promoted it should have been a tip-off that it is bad.  Imus reminds me of a barkeep I used to know in college who claimed that -- if he wanted to -- he could switch the whole college town to a particularly bad brand of beer.  I think Imus had similarly egotistical and perverse motives for hyping this thing.	2.0	Vastly overrated	2007-10-31	20	5	15
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2Q2QATGQ3XT3F	"""nachtnoir"""	I never saw the show on television, I don't have HBO.  I only had word of mouth to tell me how good this show was, so when I saw that they were releasing the entire first season on DVD, I had to get it.With all of the nods the show makes to some of the best mafia movies, I could not but smirk a little when watching this.  But you have to realize, even cold, mafia guys, must get a little jazzed seeing films about what they do.  You probably would too if you saw a film about your occupation.The DVD is put together fairly well, and the menus are so simple even your grandpa could figure them out.  And the extras are pretty good too.  HBO has become a pretty good film studio as well as a cable tv channel.  Maybe we aren't too far from a Sopranos movie, or a Sex in the City film.Whether your into the show for its realism, or just the subject matter, you'll love the Sopranos.  It's a good family show.  Not! Well it depends on what your &quot;Family&quot; is like I guess.	5.0	The mafia version of the Waltons	2000-12-16	8	7	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A8ELDUMFRN9MZ	"Nancy A. Miller ""Matt"""	"Quite simply put, the first season of ""The Sopranos"" is one of the masterpieces of modern filmmaking. Period. Few other artistic endeavors in recent years have been so indelible, so deep, so rich and haunting. From the brilliant first episode to the miraculous season finale, few other television can even come close to matching it.Funny, because the idea sounds like a bad bar joke. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) seems to have everything a man could want: beautiful wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and kids Meadow and A.J. (Jamie Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler), big house, and loyal friends, and a well-paying job.....as a major capo in the North Jersey mafia.However, it's clear that life has begun to eat at Tony, and not just because of his wave-making Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianse) and cantankerous mother Livia (Nancy Marchand). In general, he feels that he's, ""...come in at the end; the best is over."" Such feelings of doubt eventually climax with a panic attack, brought on by the departue of a family of ducks that took up roost in the Soprano family's pool. So, Tony begins therapy with Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).The idea of a mafioso on the shrink's coach could have been facile at best, ludicrious at worst. Instead, Tony and Melfi's sessions become the backbone of season 1. More than any other season, creator David Chase uses these scenes not only to illuminate the profoundly complicated psyche of his chief protagonist, but to show us a whole new world that look startling like our own.Indeed, one of ""The Sopranos"" chief traits is the naturalism of the settings, and the artful banality of the surroundings further underscores the show's often brutal content (physical, emotional, or otherwise).In another audacious and off-kilter move, Chase constantly messes with what the cliches we have come to associate with the Mob. Sure, Carmela seems like a gum-snapping cliche at first glance. But she turns out to be a deeply conflicted woman desperately trying to find peace with her conscience. Yes, Livia seems like a dottering old crank, but there's cool calculation under every move. And of course, there's Tony....a seeming model of italiano machismo who begins to find peace by talking about his feeligns with a female psychiatrist.While ""The Sopranos"" often takes on an epic feel (particularly in the brilliant Season 1 plotlines of Junior and Livia's scheming against Tony that finally becomes an attempt on his life), it's this down-to-earth honesty and eye for detail (Livia's favorite newspaper section? the obituaries) that raises it to greatness.And every cast member is perfect. Bracco nails every line with the correct balance of professional fear and honest concern. Falco is a marvel as she details a strong but morally compromised woman trying to find peace with God and common ground with her husband. Marchand gives one of the great TV performances; her every move is hilarious, terrifying, and sad (one of my favorite lines; Livia on a depressed Tony: ""You should see the way he comes down to the dinna table....in his beathrobe at seven a clock in the evening!""). And standing in the center is Gandolfini, who is extraordinary.In the end, words don't do justice to the subtlety, grace, eloquence, and rough-hewn profoundity of Season 1. So....buy it already!! All the hype doesn't give this magnificent achievement its proper due.Final Note- Although every episode is wonderful, ""College"", ""Boca"", ""Isabella"", and ""I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano"" stand out as instant classics."	5.0	The Astonishing First Chapter of a Great Series	2003-09-13	4	2	2

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1C0SYSM25LRRU	"Nicole Hamilton ""KD1UJ"""	I'd been hearing about The Sopranos all last year but honestly, I just never have time to catch a series every week.  I just don't watch TV with any regularity and I'm not crazy about missing episodes or seeing them out of order when I know there's continuity.  When I saw that whole first season of The Sopranos was coming out, I figured that would be just right for me.I wasn't disappointed.  Matter of fact, I was blown away.  It's a great show, at times hysterical, at times very dark.  The characters are sometimes over the top but they stay close to basic story, unlike a lot of shows where, struggling to fill 60 minutes and having run out of any sensible ideas, they'll have doctors from an ER show caught in an improbable plane crash in the Andes or whatever.The most interesting thing for me is the way they've used Tony Soprano's sessions with his therapist as a way to stitch everything together and let you get inside Tony's head.  The actors playing both Tony and the therapist turn in remarkable and very believable performances.This set is also a heck of a bargain.  You get 13 episodes, four per DVD, plus some bonus materials, which is a lot of viewing time for the money.I recommend this set as easily the best DVD purchase I made all year (this from someone who buys nearly everything that comes out.)	5.0	Absolutely fantastic!	2000-12-24	80	74	6

At that time there was really nothing like it as far as story line, dialogue, character development, casting, and production value.  It was a first in all those categories, especially in the television arena.  Now there are so many series that have followed its example:  Breaking Bad, The Wire, etc. --  they all owe a huge debt to the writers and cast of The Sopranos.Okay, having said all that I think The Sopranos is still worth watching.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1HRMJJJPZVDZS	Peter Praught	*The Sopranos* is the ultimate organized crime television series of all time.  This ranks right up there with The Godfather I & II and Goodfellas.  The whole show rings so true to life, with the language, the day to day problems of coping both with 'THE FAMILY'as well as The family, present a study in human interaction that I find completely mesmerizing. I  have watched every episode of all three seasons a minimum of 5 times, some as many as 20.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A27MCNZZI03RII	Philip S	In my opinion The Sopranos is the best show that has ever been created. The Wire is a very close second but The Sopranos remainsthe most entertaining show to watch, just as much now as when it originally aired. My true test of a great show or movie is how longit can remain relevant and enjoyable and The Sopranos is still very strong. The blu ray is decent, about as good as this season is evergoing to look and sound. It is much better than the standard definition DVD but cannot compare to both parts of the sixth season thatwere released earlier. Much of the problem is with the original source material and cannot be changed so I give it a four out of five starranking. Certain scenes have way to much grain and the lighting is on and off in certain scenes, again, all present on the now ancient DVD.About the only thing that I can find wrong with the blu ray PQ is edge enhancement which although noticeable in many scenes never reallydistracted me too much. The sound is great, a very noticeable upgrade. Just like most HBO releases there are very few extra materials. Overallthis is a solid high definition release of the fabulous beginning to my favorite show of all time and arguably one of the best shows ever made.	5.0	The best show ever made receives a good blu ray release	2010-02-02	4	4	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	When The Sopranos first hit the airwaves in January of 1999, it was unlike any other television show in history.  In fact, it is almost unfair to classify it as a television show. They are more like mini-movies.  By airing the show on HBO, show creator David Chase sacrificed ratings for quality.  Without the limitations of network television, the show can realistically portray the dysfunctional life of Tony Soprano's two families.  James Gandolfini gives one of television's all time best performances as the emotionally confused and tormented Tony Soprano.  Edie Falco is magnificent as his shrill wife and the late Nancy Marchand is glorious as his menacing and conniving mother.  Although the mafia is a central theme to the series, it has less to do with The Godfather and is more like of a bizarre combination of the dysfunctional family sitcom Everybody Love Raymond and the dysfunctional family drama American Beauty.  A true television landmark and is worth repeated viewings.	5.0	The Sopranos Hit A High Note	2001-01-08	25	21	4

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1TPW86OHXTXFC	"prisrob ""pris,"""	With the recent death of James Gandolfini, superlatives of his performances are proclaimed. The finest is his portrayal of Tony Soprano. I took the time to re-watch Season one. Who can forget Our first view of Tony in the waiting room to see Dr. Melfi. Reluctant warrior has been having anxiety attacks, and after undergoing all te usual tests, he has been advised to see a therapist. So, we start our time with Tony Soprano and his families.Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini, is a family man, waste management consultant, and, as we find out Mafia man.  we first meet him as he ends up seeing a therapist, Dr. Melfi, played by Lorraine Bracco. Tony's got a lot on his plate: an old menacing uncle, a vile mother, a young, often foolish cousin, played Christopher played by Michael Imperioli, and the FBI are circling.  His wife, Carmela, played by Edie Falco.  Tony, in this first series, has a sort ofcharm. We soon find out how menacing he is, but that charm always wins out. We know Tony has a good heart, and we grow to love him in spite of his violence.  David Chase, the writer, has given us the best series of our American culture. It is said that Tony's character was the forerunner of the lovable bad men in our television history.I loved this series, and somehow was able to veer come my abhorrence of the violence.Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-22-13	5.0	HBO's Finest	2013-06-22	1	1	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3JYW6GWR9CS5P	"purerockfury ""Gorillas"""	For years, I continued hearing many great things about this amazing mob-drama on HBO called The Sopranos. Many people went out of their way to tell me about it, especially those who knew about my love for mob films like A Bronx Tale and Goodfellas. Unfortunately, I have lived my life without HBO and for the most part could care less. Last fall, curiousity got the best of me and I went and rented the first four episodes of Season 1. In that time period, I had heard various things about the show's fourth season, mainly former fan's disappointment with the fourth season or simply how the show was completely overrated. I tried to watch the four episodes without thinking of those criticisms but I started out with those being prevalent and thinking &quot;This show just can't be as good as Goodfellas and the like.&quot; WRONG!!!The Sopranos first episode starts off a little slow but by the end of the first four episodes, you realize the immense ground that has to be covered which caused me to understand what the writers were trying to do. The most imspiring part is that they really pulled it off well. They have you gaining an affinity for certain characters (Jackie Aprile Sr.) and absolutely loathing others (Mikey Palmice) but remembering them all very well.Though I find the second and third seasons to be superior, there was no better way to open up the series with the rifts that formed throughout season one. David Chase took a subject matter that had been mastered by few (Scorsese) and butchered by others (every idiot director that writes a romantic comedy and feels the need to have the antagonist be a mafia boss or Cuban drug cartel boss) and made it fresh and gripping for modern America.

Sure you can videotape the replays which seem to happen every few months, but heck, that is videotape!  If you have a DVD player, and a good speaker system, GET THIS!Do not fall into the thinking that you will catch this at some other time when and if it goes into syndication on non cable.  Sure it CAN happen a la Tracy Ulman Show, and the Outer Limits.  However, the censoring on this show will make it as bad as catching Beverly Hills Cop all dubbed up and cut.  Do yourself a favor and watch this series as it was intended to be seen and not as dictated by network censors.Keep in mind that my rating is prejudiced by the fact I love the series and believe that DVDs are far better than vhs tapes.	5.0	Love the show?

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A9JCSSS3QV7OU	Randall K. Waddell	The Sopranos first season is a mob masterpiece that quickly grows on you. Filled with suspense, drama and action, this series leaves you asking questions and eager to watch more. It is told from the point of view of Tony Soprano, at first a high-level capo and then eventually street boss of the DiMeo crime family in New Jersey. Although slow to develop, this show gradually grabs a hold of you as you begin to enter and relate more and more to the world of the Sopranos. The family truly becomes real as a result of in-depth character development and complex issues that they are forced to deal with. The attention to detail in this piece is astounding. Every movement, image and sound is well thought out and utilized to express the intended mood. Although it is mostly a serious drama, comic relief is injected artfully to prevent the loss of attention. The multiple conflicts are complex and inter-related. As the tension begins to pick up towards the end of the season it reaches its addicting peak. The many twists, turns and unpredictable events leaving you gasping for season 2.	4.0	Sopranos first season	2006-04-11	3	1	2

Once my wife and I started watching this...we came in when the 3rd season was being shown on cable...we watched all of seasons 1 and 2 in one weekend. Each episode builds on the other so it's best to watch the whole series. A story line may not be revisited for several episodes so you wouldn't get whats really happening since you did not see the begining of that story line. To borrow a marketing phrase from Lay's Potato Chips in reference to these episodes...Bet ya can't just watch one.	5.0	I LOVE THIS SHOW...	2014-06-11	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A93LCEKKTMG7Q	R.D. Monsoon	The Blu-ray version of Season 1 boasts significant video quality improvements over the 2000 DVD release.Season 1 used a grainier film stock than subsequent seasons. This was problematic for the 2000 DVD release because MPEG II encoding has a difficult time handling grain,  HBO squeezed 4 episodes onto each discs (except the last one) resulting in a high level of compression, there was a lot of edge enhancement applied to the video, and that this was a relatively early DVD release -- MPEG II encoding has significantly improved since then. As a result, the video on the DVDs had a lot of artifacts -- and the larger the TV you have, the more obtrusive the artifacts and edge enhancement are.The Blu-ray release pretty much fixes all of those problems. You can really see the difference in the closeups on the actors' faces. The image is clear with a film texture. You'll also notice a lot more details in the background.The pilot episode doesn't look as good as the rest of the season. This is no doubt because a cheaper film stock was used and they had less time to light scenes due to it being a pilot. The rest of the episodes look uniformly excellent.Don't expect the show to look quite as good as good as the HD broadcasts of the later seasons. Starting in Season 2 much more money and effort was put into the cinematography in order to give the show a feature film look. The interiors of Season 1 are typically slightly over lit with a soft white light. I suspect this was done because they had a shorter production schedule then later Seasons when the show was a hit, and they didn't have time to relight sets every time they moved the camera.The packaging is virtually identical to the DVD box. HBO has wisely decided to spread the season across 5 discs -- no more than 3 episodes per disc. This minimizes compression and helps improve video quality.Nothing to report about the sound. Like the DVDs, the surround sound channels only come to life during explosions and shoot outs.Fans of the show will be very happy with the results.	5.0	The upgrade to Blu-ray is worth it	2009-11-25	142	133	9

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ALD1CRUBY1365	R. L. MILLER	"Even if the ""m"" word is a naughty word since the 1980s. This series has enough continuity that it can be viewed as a single story in however many segments at a time you might wish. In part, it's a mixture of ""Godfather-The Next Generation"" (if that existed), ""Goodfellas"", ""Analyze This"" and a hypothetical prime time soap that I had this joke about years ago--what if they did one about an organized crime family? Would they call it ""On the Lives Of My Children""? Tony Soprano, as played by James Gandolfini, is an engagingly complicated sort of guy. Like a lot of guys of his generation, he is college educated, so his wiseguy patois is sprinkled with tidbits from his psych, poli sci, sociology and philosophy courses. His marriage has settled into a predictability that endangers it somewhat. His son has inherited his tough-guy personna, his daughter his philosphical side, but he wants to keep both as far away from the ""mob side"" of his business as he can. He has ""soldiers"" working for him that are either airheads or macho types looking to prove something. His Uncle Junior has issues over first his younger brother (Tony's father) getting leadership, which then passes to Tony as his nephew. So soothing Unc's wounded ego is a full time job. But most of all, Tony's seeing a shrink, a woman shrink at that. He's keeping the doc's gender from his wife, for predictable reasons. Doc is no glamour girl but she has this earth mother charm that enhances her appeal and has Tony dreaming about her. Even though he already has this young Russian sexpot as a mistress. His mother is well into Alzheimer's, but any attempt Tony makes to hook her up with more thorough care is seen by Mom as abandonment. And all that Tony has to turn to as a counteractant is the Doc and Prozack. I have only one complaint, though. The series ought to put out a glossary of Italian slang with phonetic pronunciation after each example. It's used all over the series. I've heard most of it most of my life and I'm in the position of knowing how some of it is spelled but not the pronunciation, and the rest I know how to pronounce it but I can't spell it. With one exception--Uncle Junior warns his girlfriend in one scene not to let out certain details of their intimacies--""Guys I know will think I'm some sort of finuke"". I know that last word is really spelled ""finocchio"", from its use in ""The Godfather"". The HBO/ Sopranos site should have had a page on that a long time ago. Meanwhile, I also own the ""Second Season"" and I'll be watching for the third and so on."	5.0	You don't get HBO? So buy this and watch it as a miniseries.	2002-01-25	3	2	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	Robert I. Hedges	"I am not generally a big fan of underworld films, and I do not have HBO (although I see it often while traveling), so I wouldn't seem likely to be a fan of ""The Sopranos."" Appearances can be deceiving, though, and in this case I think David Chase and the HBO team have created one of the most original, best written, and certainly best acted shows in television history. The show is obviously violent in places, but I appreciate the way that the writers intentionally do not center the show on the violence, but rather on the interpersonal conflicts within the organization and in the personal lives of the extended Soprano family.James Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony Soprano is without doubt the unifying focus of the show, especially in the first season. As I see it the first season has two principle arcs: Tony's struggle for leadership with his Uncle Junior, and his relationship with his aging (and crazy) mother. Much of this is cleverly unveiled through psychiatric visits with Dr. Melfi where much of the true motivations and fears of the characters are unveiled through Tony.The show is deeply faceted and one of my favorite dramatic devices is the revelation of the significance of things from past shows (i.e. the ducks in Tony's pool) in later shows. This has the effect of forcing the viewer to analyze the characters and plot points for themselves, come to conclusions, and then later confront the actual motives intended by the writers. This subtle and complex nuance is why the show succeeds where so many other shows fail.The production values are superb, and every actor is perfectly cast. James Gandolfini in particular is stunning in his portrayal of Tony, not because of what he says, but because you can see what is going on inside Tony through his expressions: there is a lot going on behind those eyes. One of the best acted scenes in any production ever is the attempted hit on Tony; the facial expressions on Gandolfini's face (fear, anger, relief, glee, surprise) in that one scene justify the purchase price of the set alone.The extras are a bit on the thin side. There is an interesting interview with David Chase, a couple of short HBO promotional films, and biographies. They are fine, but nothing to write home about. Overall, though, this is a world class piece of gritty realism, told with sympathy and dark humor.This is one of the few truly original shows ever to grace the small screen."	5.0	Ducks In The Pool	2005-07-31	8	7	1

The characters are very well played and were well placed by the casting crew. The intro music sets the mood, -want that ringtone-. Completing one episode leaves you wanting for more. It is not a slow starter, immediately immersing you into the life of a capo, though hard and tough, he also displays tender qualities, needs and family ties.I definitely recommend this movie.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3AD071UEP20WS	"Roger Long ""longrush"""	"The most remarkable thing about this made for TV series is that it is about a mob family, complete with whacks, beatings, shall-we-say colorful language, and sex.  Television, from its beginnings, has been rather circumspect, more with respect to the sex and language than to the violence.  Thus, this is a departure from the past.Otherwise, there's not all that much difference between this series and, say, ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"" or the ""Cosby Show.""  Greed, too much money, lust, lies--they are all there in these series about families, as opposed to family series.  But in Dallas and Dynasty the nefarious characters never bared much flesh or did a whole lot of swearing.That said, The Sopranos is a fascinating series.  The viewer actually comes to have a certain empathy for Tony Soprano.  Under his bravado and language is a man who is not sure of himself, a man who wants to be accepted as somewhat more than a ""waste management consultant.""  In one episode he gets himself invited to play golf at an exclusive country club, and all that the other three men in his foursome can talk about are their stock portfolios and Tony's mob connection, the latter in an oblique way:  ""Was The Godfather movie accurate?"" and ""Did you know John Gotti?""  Tony's feelings are then revealed to his psychiatrist.  In the end, Tony is not invited to join the country club.The acting is excellent, even with the more repulsive characters, i.e., Uncle Junior and Christopher, for example.  The New Jersey setting and the accents always feel right.  The stories are interesting and believable.  In short, this is about the ups and downs of a family, but it ain't quite the Huxtables or the Ewings in the ""awl bidness."""	5.0	Joisy family	2009-02-03	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3081Z4P774YR4	"""rsmon77"""	I like dramas (or any show in general) where there are characters I love AND hate at same time.  Our protagonist Tony Soprano (played with great vigor by James Gandolfini) may be trying to juggle his family life, his underworld life, and deal with his own personal problems, but he's also a liar, an adulterer, and a murderous scumbag.  Even the seemingly &quot;good&quot; people in his life have their own little hypocrasies.  That to me is what fuels &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, especially in its first season.  It's all the little things that make life up: the lies, the truths, and the things you really don't know about the people around you.  Inlcuded in this DVD package is a commentary on the first episode and an hour-long interview with the show's creator which explores the origins of certain characters, performances, and the controversies involving the show.  A nice package for a truly fascinating, and often brutally funny series.	5.0	It's not JUST about the Mob...	2001-06-08	1	1	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	AH070GDFKY5R3	"Ruth A. Ballard ""ruthab21"""	First, let me say that I'm an avid Sopranos fan.  I put the first-season DVD on my Amazon wish list and was thrilled when I was given it as a gift.  I have a hearing problem and always use closed captioning while watching TV and videos.  I have been disappointed to find that some DVDs that list CC don't actually have it.  Unfortunately, The Sopranos: First Season is one of them.  Yes, I do know how to use the DVD menu to select closed-captioning, but the only options listed are for quality of sound or the languages Spanish or French.  Since my TV is always set for CC, that shouldn't be the problem.  Consequently, I have to turn up the volume considerably, but still miss some of the dialogue.	4.0	NO Closed Captioning	2008-05-31	4	3	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A361JIPRX9EX9M	"Ryan ""The Doctor"""	What a great show!  The Sopranos is one of the best shows on TV today, and is probably one of the best shows in the history of TV.  This story of a mafia boss and his 2 families explores notions of filial loyalty, the Oedipus complex, psychotherapy, marriage, parenthood, and much much more.  Gandolfini is amazing as the conflicted Tony Soprano, trying to balance his home life with his other Family, the New Jersey Mob.  Tony is at once repulsive in his violent and self-centered attitude, and yet lovable as a father who genuinely wants to do good for his family.  And although Tony is the central character, every actor gets their chance to shine, and they all have their own feelings, stories, and demons.  A great show that runs the gambit from drama to comedy and everything in between.	5.0	Givin' me Agita!	2002-03-28	3	2	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1YGXTC20QGRYI	Samantha	A great show. I went through the first 3 episodes so quickly! If you like the Wire, you'll love the Sopranos. For those that hate the cliche and over-produced network TV dramas, this show is a breath of fresh air. Deals with anti-hero Tony Soprano and lots of themes about moral ambiguity. Not for those who can't stand some violence- but it isn't that bad. Some viewers will use this as an educational source on Italian-Americans, but this is foolish. I can see why my grandmother doesn't like the show (she's offended by the characters using their &#34;italianess&#34; as an excuse to engage in crime, loud talking or just trashy behavior). It's not a documentary on Americans with Italian lineage- it's a show about how morally ambiguous characters deal with touchy subjects like raising children, mental illness and negotiating the tension between establishing dominance and asking for help.

What an awesome surprise to stumble on something so good. This is such an intelligent show. I am still amazed at how they set up the &quot;bad guy&quot; as the main character. I find myself not only rooting for him but liking him despite all his faults and terrible deeds. I was very sad after playing the last episode in this set because it meant there were no more for me to watch. I can only hope they release the second season soon.What you should do: Walk, run, or crawl to buy, rent, or borrow season one of the Sopranos.

What both shows share is a psychological depth to the characters unlike that seen on other shows, a real focus on what makes people tick and what the patterns of life are.All of the ranting and raving that Sopranos fans do about this show is justified.  This show is good in too many ways to count.  It acheives a standard of excellence and relevance that no television show yet had.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"I finally came out from under my rock and checked out ""The Sopranos,"" quite possibly the most beloved and ballyhooed show ever on television.  Needless to say, I was dubious - how could a mere TV show merit the countless accolades that have been foisted upon it?Then I pushed 'play,' and all was made clear.  ""The Sopranos"" is easily one of the best-written TV series of all time - right up there with HBO's other magnum opus, ""The Wire.""  In a genre rife with caricature, ""The Sopranos"" stands out because of its fully-drawn, well-rounded characters.  The actors must drool over their new scripts!The series may refer to the Soprano family, but the fulcrum for all the action is Tony (James Gandolfini).  Tony is a lumbering hulk of a man with a twinkle in his eye and a penchant for bear hugs.  A beloved ""captain"" in the crime world, Tony is recognized as a leader even though he does not have the official title of ""Boss.""The series first humanizes Tony by giving him a charming affection for the ducks in his pool and a wonderful relationship with his therapist, Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco from ""Goodfellas"").  Tony has been blacking out a little bit of late, and needs some counseling.  This choice is a fantastic mechanism for storytelling, as Tony is forced to break out of the mafia's notorious 'omerta' and open up.  It also sets the wheels in motion for serious violence, because while the mafia places a lot of stock on silence, they don't place much in doctor-patient privilege.So Dr. Melfi is Tony's sounding board for his manifold professional and personal problems.  There are far too many to list here, but suffice it to say that whether it be a struggle for power within ""our thing,"" or coping with his evil mother-in-law Livia (Nancy Marchand), or just taking his daughter to visit colleges, nothing in Tony's life is easy.  As the season progresses, you begin to see Tony like a fat Italian Atlas, bearing the weight of the world on his monstrous shoulders.But you don't want to give him a hug, either.  Every time Tony gets just a little too sympathetic (like with his immortal line, ""what constitutes a fidget?"" to a child shrink who has diagnosed Tony's son with ADD), Tony goes out and does something mind-bogglingly evil and ruthless.  While you may love to invite Tony into your house for an hour of TV, you sure wouldn't want to live next door to him (a plot twist that the writers nail perfectly).Be warned - this is violent, rated 'R' kinda stuff - lots of blood and skin.  Maybe not as much blood as HBO's great series ""Rome,"" or as much skin as HBO's ill-fated ""Carnivale,"" but enough that you don't want your eight-year old watching it with you.Steeped in the lore of mafia movies and books (the characters quote Al Pacino's ""Scarface"" and the ""Godfather"" trilogy with aplomb), but somehow standing to one side of them, ""The Sopranos"" is a wonderful romp through life with an amazing family . . . that just happens to be in the mafia.Check it out - you won't regret it."	5.0	Magnificent writing allows Season One to live up to the hype	2007-04-06	8	6	2

The passing of James Gandolfini makes it impossible to produce a movie in the future, aside from the great loss of an actor who was just beginning to peak at the time of his passing.  As a veteran, I appreciated everything he did for the Armed Forces and his strong support he had for all of us.  He will be missed as an actor, but more so as a good man doing great things for veterans.	5.0	The Sopranos	2014-06-20	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3SQ62XV9E9SXZ	Shrugged	For those that may not have heard, The Sopranos is the platinum standard for quality television. The writing, casting, acting, directing are without peer in the history of the medium. In fact, a total of 86 episodes were made and the vast majority of those are far superior to even the better movies being made today. Every time I return to  The Sopranos I'm reminded that even the best television shows that have been made in its wake (and I'm a fan of a select few) pale in comparison. I've yet to meet anyone that gave the show a real chance and didn't become a huge fan, several skeptics included. The Sopranos is definitely not for young children. Though there is plenty of cursing, violence and nudity, it's never pointless or gratuitous. The blu ray edition of season 1 is a substantial improvement over the original dvd. I challenge anyone that has not seen this magnificent show to grab the blu ray of season one, make sure you won't be bothered, and watch several episodes uninterrupted. You will be hooked.	5.0	Absolute Masterpiece-High Water Mark For Television	2010-04-13	3	3	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2T476K3SOGCBB	"Sirwriter ""Retired Computer Builder"""	An opportunity to see episodes I missed when it was on originally. I watched the entire first season in one weekend! Here is a family of families who exploit almost anything that may profit them. Like an army of people seasoned in breaking laws made for everyday people, exploiting businesses they can control for their own profit, judging people and swiftly dispatching their own form of justice, from beatings to killings, they live according to their own codes and rules. They float on a river of cash, and for the most part they are happy, working to achieve inside levels of success and new levels of status, bringing them more money, and more, higher levels of responsibility along with increased success and rewards.This is a lifestyle one never leaves, and they all understand that from the time they are accepted into it. Powerful, fearless, defending their property and family members and friends, they live an almost charmed existence. Some are finally pursued and caught by law enforcement, usually after a long and tedious effort, usually at great expense to the average taxpayer.Most of them, even incarcerated, continue to run their business from the inside, counting on their status within the family as well as loyalty from their own crew to carry out their decisions and commands that they make inside institutions and dispatch on the streets. They also enjoy a freer reign to conduct their businesses, with few of the prison population willing to impede their progress. Indeed, volunteers are in line to assist them in order to find favor with them. When their sentences are completed, or they reach parole status, they return to business as usual on the outside.We also see a side of them with the same illnesses, weaknesses and phobias we all have. No one is immune to fatal diseases.  Illness and disease strikes them like any normal &#34;citizen&#34;. They have the best doctors and hospitals yet still they succumb. They also go to therapy.They too wake up with nightmares, monsters in their closets.They try not to make the same mistakes their parents made with their children.The higher up the ladder, the more important is their status and respect from everyone they touch. Many of the elected public officials who protect the citizenry from them, as well as doctors, lawyers, financial consultants and advisers  find it easier to look the other way, accept &#34;gifts&#34;, different types of immunity than their peers, and become a sort of &#34;hybrid&#34; in their position few persons in the public know of, or could prove.This largely immunizes them from exploitation, and even offers them a certain place in the fringes of these families where they not only enjoy increased business at higher profits and bonuses for jobs well done, but protection from other competition and offers them assistance in resolving their own problems. They often form friendships with key members of the families that carry over into their own future generations.In my opinion, this series stands even today, shoulder to shoulder among the &#34;survivor&#34; shows, is more creditable, and entertaining. I highly recommend The Sopranos . It is very well done.	5.0	The Sopranos - Like a triple hot fudge cake and ice cream; you know it's not healthy, but it's so good you don't care!	2014-05-29	0	0	0

The performances, particularly those by Gandolfini and Nancy Marchand are brilliant. The first season is excellent in every way.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ABFL6GI4ZN49L	"S. S. D. ""tarantura"""	A great upgrade from the DVD release of the first season, as expected (and hoped for).  Full 1080p with a fairly high bitrate. The Sopranos wasn't filmed with an HD camera until later seasons, I guess, and the picture quality isn't as nice as, say, the sixth season on Blu-ray.  That said, they did a very good job overall, although the pilot was far from great (high-contrast, grainy at times).  Audio quality is impressive.VERY disappointed with the subtitle effort.  I understand there are many who do not care about subtitles, but I believe it's worth pointing some things out for those who do.  I truly cannot believe HBO let the folks who created both English subtitles actually *FIX* way too much of the bad grammar, mispronunciations, and occasional malapropisms that the writers intentionally added (mostly evident in the early episodes).  Way too often subtitle companies freely edit the spoken word for written on DVD and BD - what's so tough about creating verbatim subtitles?  I always have subtitles on, when available, as it can make for a far clearer understanding of what's going on at times.  Those who are deaf and rely on subtitles (or those non-impaired watching in a loud room or maybe audio muted like I'm forced to at times) may find it difficult understanding exactly what the writers intended, which for a brilliant show like this is at the very least a disappointment.Ok, I'll stop with the subtitle bashing.  Ignoring the pilot episode, video quality gets a 'B/B-' grade.  Easy to recommend, especially since as of now it's near impossible finding a professional review of the first season of The Sopranos on Blu-ray.	5.0	So nice to watch The Sopranos first season in 1080p!	2009-11-29	7	7	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2YRDIRL316QJL	Stephen M. Kerwick	Like many of the reviewers here, I had heard good word of mouth reactions to The Sporanos and saw some of an episode during an HBO promotion week.  Still, I was skeptical about the show, as most things that popular fail to deliver a quality product consistently.  I was disabused of this notion when I started to watch this DVD consolidation.  The shows are so much better than I'd hoped for that I had to force myself to ration them out at the rate of 2 or 3 a week.  The whole project from writing to acting to plot and characters is, quite simply, fascinating.  What's more, every bit of the show is absolutely believable.  While the Godfather films, excellent as they are, show a sort of mythologized history, The Sopranos has a lifelike quality that television almost never communicates.  More importantly, the program develops an interest in the characters and curiosity as to what will happen next that is seldom seen in popular entertainment any more.  There is also a good deal of humor, but never the cheap laughs that would seem available.  Instead, there is a subtlety in irony that may well go over the heads of less sophisticated viewers.  I'm already anxious for the subsequent seasons' compilations to come out and might even subscribe to HBO.	5.0	The Best Money I've Spent This Year	2001-09-02	1	0	1

Outstanding character development, great acting, believable plot lines and plenty of violence and sex (definitely not for kids). But it isn't all about violence and sex, it's about family (no matter how dysfunctional), about relationships, about honor (even amongst thieves). For those of you who have never watched this rather old series, try watching the first two episodes of season one. If it doesn't grab you by the end of the second episode, then walk away, it's probably not for you. This series is ONLY AVAILABLE IN HD here on Amazon!!

Without going into details as to the specifics of the series itself even many years after an illusion it remains one of my favorite things to watch on TV. Maintained in a just go subscription on cable for many years just to be able to access the Sopranos via HBO GO Sophia man when that was available. Now that HBO series are included with Amazon prime that is a huge boost for the Amazon prime service itself as it relates to video streaming. I need to cancel my HBO now because the newer series with the exception of game of thrones are not nearly as good as the Sopranos before the Sopranos there was the wire and there was's but the Sopranos is really the series that has made HBO the premium movie choice of most people in America and probably the world.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A34Q2RG2PS2OL	"the dirty mac ""boot64"""	"If there is a ""holy trinity"" of mafia films and television shows, then it would have to be THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS and now THE SOPRANOS. Each of these sagas approaches the mob from a slightly different viewpoint. The Godfather films take a romanticized approach that focuses on the organization's upper management. Goodfellas focuses on the grunts, the guys doing the dirty work. The Sopranos tends to fall somewhere in between, chronicling the mob's middle management. Goodfellas is a true story (although some names were changed). The Godfather films are almost complete fiction. Again, The Sopranos is somewhere in between; the plots and characters are fictional, albeit fiction that parallels reality with uncanny precision.For the benefit of newcomers, here is a quick introduction to the first season -- without divulging too many details, of course. Our protagonist is Tony Soprano. He is a capo and rising star in the crime family when we first meet him. He's also an extraordinarily complex character -- as sensitive as he is tough, as angst-ridden as he is ruthless. An anxiety attack in episode 1 sends him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi.Another key character in the first season is Tony's uncle Corrado ""Uncle Junior"" Soprano. Junior is a capo himself; years earlier he labored in the shadow of Tony's father, ""Johnny Boy"" Soprano. Now he watches warily as Tony rapidly rises through the ranks. It's not that Tony and Junior don't like each other; they just don't trust each other. In episode 2 we meet the family's acting boss -- Jackie Aprile Sr. Sadly, he doesn't last too long. Jackie's demise sets in motion the tension between Tony and Junior that simmers and escalates in subsequent episodes.One thing that makes The Sopranos stand out from other mafia dramas is the prominence of its female characters. We've already mentioned Dr. Melfi. Her sessions with Tony are not a screenwriter's gimmick; they define the show and give it extra gravitas. (In her first session with Tony, she asks him what he does for a living. He tells her: ""waste management consultant."") Tony's wife Carmela is a compelling character herself, one who is nearly as conflicted as her husband. On the one hand, her love for Tony is unbreakable; on the other, she knows exactly how he makes a living and she feels pangs of guilt for condoning it. Last, but far from least, is Tony's manipulative mother Livia. Is she senile or just faking it? Her conversations with Uncle Junior are priceless; it's fascinating to watch her press Junior's buttons and play him like a baby grand piano.Believe it or not, this just scratches the surface of the show's richness. Other great supporting characters are Sal ""Big Pussy"" Bonpensiero, Paulie ""Walnuts"" Gualtieri and Tony's tempermental nephew Christopher (why no nickname?) Moltisanti. Yet another terrific character is corrupt detective Vin Makazian (played by John Heard) -- a ""degenerate gambler with a badge,"" to quote Tony.According to former New York Post columnist Jack Newfield, some Soprano characters may be modeled on true-life gangsters. Some people in law enforcement say that Christopher reminds them of Nicky Scarfo Jr. (son of the former Philadelphia mob boss). Others speculate that Paulie Walnuts bears more than a passing resemblance to a Genovese family hit man named Anthony DeVingo. Coincidence? There was a real-life gangster named Anthony ""Little Pussy"" Russo who made his living as a cat burglar. (Hence the nickname.)Organized crime has always been fodder for films and TV. But The Sopranos proves that even a genre that seems to have been done to death is worth revisiting when someone puts a fresh and creative spin on it."	5.0	Adventures in Waste Management Consulting	2001-11-25	9	7	2

The characters are fully developed, interesting and exciting.  Having lived in New Jersey the premise rings true.  The Godfather movies were more slow moving and ""dark"" than this series.  Here we have a tragi-comic soap opera about a neighbor in an upper middle class neighborhood.  We have pasta, priests, pschoanalysts, rowdy teenagers, horny teenagers, horny adults, murder and husband/wife mindgames all combined in a wonderful recipe.  The only TV series even coming close are Seinfeld and Cheers.  I have the first two seasons and will get 3 and 4 when released.Frank Liberatori"	5.0	Semicivilized Wiseguys	2002-07-08	3	2	1
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	I have this tendency to avoid all things popular.  Don't know why.  Maybe some leftover teen rebellion thing, but I stay away from things that are wildly popular.Like THE SOPRANOS.Heard about it, heard about it, heard about it.  But, after THE GODFATHER films and GOODFELLAS, what more could be possibly done?Then 9-11 hit.  And I got stuck putting in incredible amounts of overtime (nuclear security and all).  So I decided to catch up by renting the First Season of THE SOPRANOS and sneaking into the Safety Office to use their VCR.And I was hooked.  If I couldn't finish the tapes by the end of my shift, I was cutting into my sleep to finish them up afterwork.All the good things you hear about this show are true.  Its wicked sense of humor, superb writing, brilliant casting.  That it makes you really love these characters--even as you know how brutal and repulsive they can be--is a true testament to the talents of everyone in front of and behind the camera.Make sure you see the episodes in order though.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	"If you are a fan of mob movies, or the mafia lifestyle itself, look no further to add to your mob movies collection than the complete series of the show ""The Sopranos"" This series follows the life of Anthony [Tony] Soprano, and his hectic, and often dangerous, lifestyle of being a mob boss. With problems of putting his mother in a retirement home, to having an Uncle who acts on his own and against him, to dealing with all the hassles of a normal life such as dealing with his kids and his marriage relationship with his wife, Carmela. The Sopranos immediately hooked me, and it will likely do the same thing to you too....This four disk set comes with 13 episodes including:The Sopranos: Tony Soprano has a panic attack and starts taking lessons with a female psychiatrist named Jennifer Melfi. This is where we learn all about the Sopranos and how the lives of a mob boss and his family live together. You meet all the characters; Tony's Uncle named Uncle Junior, his mom Livia, his family and his crew [including Paulie, Silvio,and his nephew Christopher,]46 Long: Tony's nephew Christopher and his buddy are stealing from trucks that are protected by Uncle Junior. This only further damages the shaky relationship Tony has with his uncle. Meanwhile Tony's mom burns down her kitchen while on the phone, and later runs over her friend with her car, so the decision is made to place her in a retirement home.Denial, Anger, Acceptance: Tony's own daughter Meadow tries to score some crystal meth from Christopher to help with her studying for exams. A business deal with a Hasidic owner turns ugly, and Junior is being urged to take stand against Christopher and his buddy for robbing his trucks. [the ending of this episode is really dramatic]Meadowlands: Tony finds himself dreaming about Dr. Melfi, so he decides to have her followed by a dirty cop to see what her lifestyle is like during her days. Also, Christopher is furious at what Uncle Junior did in retaliation of the truck robberies and wants revenge. But just when it looks like war is about to break out, Tony comes up with a plan to solve everything.College: While Tony is taking Meadow on a car trip to check out different colleges, he spots an old associate who turned on him and the rest of his crew by becoming a ""rat"" and putting a lot of Tony's friends in jail. At home Carmela starts a close relationship with Father Phil, a priest, which leads to some questionable actions.Pax Soprano: Uncle Junior has been made boss of the entire family, or so he thinks. Tony and Carmela mend a few things in their relationship and Tony has to also deal with Uncle Junior's new overwhelming demands as mob boss. However everyone's troubles are about to take a turn for the worst with the introduction of the FBI. [REALLY good ending in this episode.]Down Neck: Tony's son, Anthony Jr., has been suspended from school for showing up to gym class drunk. While in the principal's office, Tony and Carmela are told that Anthony Jr. may have A.D.D. Tony is reminded of his own childhood and we see flashbacks to his days as a kid and how he found out Uncle Junior and his own father were in the mob. Also while he is visiting his grandmother as punishment, Anthony Jr. lets slip that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist.The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti: Word comes to Tony and his crew that the FBI is getting ready to move, so they all clean their houses of any incriminating evidence. However one man, Christopher, is not in as much danger as the rest, and believe it or not Christopher hates being safer than the others. Meanwhile Livia tells a visiting Uncle Junior the dark secret of Tony's and Dr. Melfi starts to be questioned by her family about her mafia client.Boca: Uncle Junior has headed down to Boca Raton for a romantic getaway with a lady friend to clear his head on all this questioning about his nephew and the psychiatrist, but to no avail as he starts to wonder if Tony is talking to the Feds. Meanwhile Meadow's soccer coach, who is considered a great coach, has decided to move to a different and better job in another town...but not if Tony and his crew have anything to say about it.A Hit is a Hit: Christopher and his girlfriend Adriana have gotten into talks with a well known rapper named Massive Genius. They decide to work together in the music world but Christopher slowly realizes that Massive Genius has more plans in mind that involve Adriana. Meanwhile Tony has been told by Dr. Melfi and Carmela to interact with ""normal"" people to see what its like.Nobody Knows Anything: Vin Makazian, the dirty cop who Tony told to follow Dr. Melfi, tells Tony that someone in his crew may be wired and working with the FBI. Meanwhile Junior and Livia start to plot with each other on how they should take a stand in the rocky relationship they have with Tony.Isabella: Tony has become depressed after months worth of taking medicine that supposedly would help him with his panic attacks. The only thing that gets him up on his feet is a beautiful woman next door who is an exchange student. However Tony's life takes a turn on the dangerous side as a hit is taken on him, led by his own uncle. The hit fails however, and Tony is now more than ready to strike back...I Dream of Jennie Cusamano: Its an all out war as the rat in the family is found out and taken care of, and Tony and his crew strike back at his uncle that results in a chase through the woods and Tony's uncle being arrested by the FBI. Meanwhile Dr. Melfi is told to leave as it is not safe for her anymore to live here as Tony is afraid his uncle will take her out as well. Tony also has one last visit for his mother in her nursing home...This series is something to be seen; you really relate to Tony and his family and wonder just what is real and what is done just to be dramatic. Either way it's successful at what it does, it gets you ready for seasons 2-6. Highly Recommended."	5.0	One of the best shows HBO ever made...EVER!!!	2007-01-01	6	6	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1DQZBHEU98PBT	Theresa W	The Sopranos Season 1 was the very beginning of the what was to become an icon, larger than life.  In Season 1, like many series, the writers were finding their groove and the cast was working out their characters.  A lot of what goes on or begins in season 1 storyline-wise, character-wise, plays a large part seasons to come.  Sort of the beginning of a croched blanket.If you are new to the Sopranos, I HIGHLY recommend it.  Season 1 is a little slower going, but even with the quirks, it's a great first season.  I didn't think I'd enjoy the series, as I'm not a mafia movie fan, but The Sopranos has so much more than just that.  It's really more about family, similar to a soap opera.  If you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll be pleased you did.	5.0	The Beginning of an ICON	2008-07-12	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A33QRDSD3J5WHE	"Timothy H. Tobish ""timberwolf1"""	Congrats to HBO and Showtime for providing the best programming on television today.  Oddly enough, I get neither service; yet with my friend taping &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; on Showtime for me and recently watching the DVDs of &quot;Sex and the City,&quot; I have been overwhelmed.  However, nothing could prepare me for &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;  I've been hearing for over three years how brilliant this series is, from critics, web sites, magazines, TV, friends, etc.  But it was never enough for me to get HBO.  1) I'm sick of ganster movies...&quot;what hasn't been done?&quot; I thought.  2) For the most part I hate one-hour TV series; I'm a sitcom guy.  3) Things like this NEVER live up to the hype.So when I signed up for my new membership at the local B'buster, I figured &quot;What the hell&quot; and grabbed Episodes 1-4.  Three minutes after starting the first episode, I was BLOWN AWAY by this DVD, and it just kept getting better.  I watched the first four, went back to the store for the next disc, and watched the remaining series over the next two days (having withdrawal when the store was out of Disc 3 with Episodes 9-12 for a few hours...I drove the clerks crazy coming in 4 times).  Coming from the East Coast and having gone to Catholic school, my life as a kid was full of Italian families (including classmates from a notable New Jersey crime family).  The family life, restaurants, etc. depicted in this family are so real, and the characters, dialogue, sets and locations so rich and multitextured you can smell the pasta cooking and get a craving for manigots and cannolli just watching.  Thematically brilliant; the image of a Mafioso going to therapy intercut with scenes of the 'business' is as good or better than any feature film on the subject, and far more intimate.  As said before, the writing, acting, directorial and production quality makes it like watching a 6 1/2 hour movie rather than an episodic series, and watching it this way I think adds to the enjoyment.  I'm really glad I waited, and even though it's gonna kill me, I'm NOT going to haunt the Video Trader boards for home-recorded versions of Seasons Two and Three, but will wait for 11/6 and get the DVD (probably watching the whole damn thing in one sitting).  Nor will I jump forward, I want to see the whole thing in order.The DVD is fantastic as well, the special features really add to it, but also the presentation, clarity, audio and widescreen, while not the best I've seen, clearly add to the experience.RENT OR BUY THIS VIDEO, NOW!  Even if you're not a fan of mafia movies, you'll probably love it, it's that good.	5.0	Utterly amazing, in every respect	2001-08-13	8	7	1

Even in the pilot episode, you can tell that the make-up jobs were a bit more budget than the rest of the series.  Blu Ray discs hold up ALOT better and are far more scratch resistant, making this a definite buy for those who intend to keep it for many watchings to come.My big complaint.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A35UIYSKD6PVEG	Traveling Irishman	Another one of HBO's smash hits this year!  The Sopranos is by far one of the best dramas ever made.This series delves into the lives of a modern era mobster family.  However this is not your typical gangster show.  It takes you into the personal lives of Tony Soprano, mob boss, and shows you that they are only human.From gangster hits, to sessions with his psychiatrist, you get to see how the gangster live affects Tony and his family.This is an absolutely incredible series and in my opinion is one of the best ever made.	5.0	Absolutely Incredible.	2001-02-12	2	2	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1QQ1N15VRMQ0D	Trika Chica	I am in the process of re-watching the Sopranos from season 1.  Love it.  It's one of those shows that starts out pretty great and gets even better.  I love that it's set in modern day and seems more realistic than past 'mobster movies' which only seemed to glamorize the life.  This really does seem to show both sides of the story, it is impressive how they manage to make you feel empathy for Tony in spite of his dark criminal nature.  Personally I love the therapist angle, because it really does help you get inside of his head and see the human side of this man.  Those parts are written really well.  Getting to know so much of his family serves the same purpose: you can identify with him as a parent, trying to do what is best for his kids, who have WAY too many privileges and seem to take their lives for granted...And his relationship with his domineering but rapidly aging mother...who can't identify with that??  It really humanizes Tony Soprano.Bottom line, this is a smart, sharp show that is really worth watching.  The first two or three episodes weren't my favorites (hence I'm giving Season 1 4 stars rather than 5), because I really had to WANT to get into it, because the first few episodes felt a little like chewed meat to me...but once you get to know the characters, this is a really great show.  If you missed this show in its first run on HBO and you're wondering if it's worth your time, give it a few episodes.  You'll be hooked.	4.0	Great show, gets better and better	2014-06-11	0	0	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1XNGE7522URFK	"Visual-Eyes ""movie fanatic"""	Clearly, one of the best offerings ever done in the made-for-television genre.  From a production perspective, you couldn't ask for better casting or better acting.  Gandolfini and Falco are entirely believable as a mob couple from northern NJ.  Bracco turns in a great performance as a psychiatrist and completely separates her character from the previous mob related material she's done (Goodfellas).Even the components of the story that are not riveting (e.g. the ducks) are woven into the larger picture very well.  A great mix of American family life, the grisly activites related with the underworld, and the torment faced by middle aged men who come to question their life, career and family.Special note must be given to Nancy Marchand, who sadly passed away last June (2000).  Her character, Olivia, will be sorely missed in the Soprano family.  This is a must have for your permanent DVD library.

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2CSBTG3NMATR5	Wayne Campbell	The slam-bang style of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) has always brought to mind the antics of such anti-heroes as Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, or even the coveted role of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino.  The take on an imbalanced mob boss is a new twist, and Gandolfini swings hard and connects.  Edie Falco is equally as unnerving, leaving the role of the unquestioning, subservient mob housewife behind, accusing her husband of being a liar and a cheat.  Which, naturally, feeds Gandolfini's rage and unpredictability.  Throw in a bunch of seemingly inept but courageous mobsters, a dyfunctional family life, a homicidal mother, bouts of depression, intra-operation enemies and you have a recipe for some of the best Italian-American fare that TV has had to offer in many years.	5.0	The Sopranos Sing a High Note to the Heart	2002-09-04	3	2	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A17JVVAKWEB0M	Wesley Mullins	"Meet Tony Soprano.  He lives in the New Jersey suburbs of New York City, has two teenage children, a demanding wife and a mother whose years of controlling manipulation have caused him to see a psychiatrist.  He likes to sleep until noon, feed the ducks that nested in his pool and watch old screw-ball comedies.  And in his spare time, he is an under boss in the New Jersey Mafia.This is the set-up for the television show that has superceded all its predecessors and taken its place at the pinnacle of television artistry.  Creator David Chase's masterpiece follows Tony is his travels through his three worlds: family, work and therapy.  The plot arcs are simultaneously short and long-ranging, as resolution is found in each episode and also builds toward the series being one giant entity.  Each episode leaks into the other, but amazingly can stand alone as an autonomous work of art.  The end result is a television show with the grand scope of a novel, while not forgetting to lead viewers along with weekly payoffs.Season One deals with three main issues.  The first is the power struggle between Tony and his Uncle Junior, as they battle over control of their Mafia family.  Second is Tony's mother's deteriorating physical and mental capacities and his decision to place her in a nursing home (or as he calls it ""a retirement community"").  Lastly, the season's spine is Tony's relationship with his therapist.  Much of what the viewer knows about his work and his family comes from therapy sessions with Dr Melfi, as he opens up about the turmoil all around him.As much as the series hinges on the many supporting characters, the show IS Tony.  Women love him, men fear him and viewers are captivated by him and all his complexities.  James Gandolfini dazzles in his performance as one of the greatest characters ever seen on stage, television or film.  Shakespeare would have been proud of such a creation.Many love the show for the sex and violence, but there is so much more to this series.  Yes, it entertains, but it also provokes thought.  The show comments on the merits of the therapy, addresses both sides of Italian defamation, and constantly deals with the difficulties of raising children in modern times.  Nothing produced by the entertainment industry in the past thirty years is more thoroughly satisfying than The Sopranos, and Season One may be the height of its creative appeal.  It is a show not to be missed by anyone."	5.0	Television's Best Ever	2004-06-06	10	9	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to review this show, as it's already been analyzed to death (and beyond) by people smarter and better-versed than I, but what the hey.  Suffice it to say that season one of The Sopranos is easily one of the best debut seasons a TV show has had in recent memory, slightly better than season one of The Shield in my book and just behind season one of Arrested Development (RIP).  Befitting its mob-opera status, it combines an epic scope with a wrenching human element in a way few shows can, and in a sad commentary on the state of TV comedy these days, it also manages to be one of the funniest shows around, laden with irony and gallows-humor dialgoue.  Every episode is as complex and detailed as a season of most shows, constantly developing a whole universe of characters who are deeply flawed, often tormented, and undeniably human.Examining the life of North Jersey mob captain, husband and father Tony Soprano, the Sopranos isn't just about the friction caused by the intersection of mob life and family life, but about the stresses the modern world places on both, all typified in its central character.  Played with exacting detail and nuance by James Gandolfini, Tony's a walking contradiction: brutal, loyal, contemplative, explosive, and monstrously hypocritical all at once.  He's also a man caught between eras, living with the legacy of the close-knit, tight-lipped Mafia of his father's generation as he navigates life in an exclusive suburb crawling with yuppies and tries to work his way through the panic attacks that have been plaguing him.  Although it's not easy to work up much sympathy for a Mafia captain, Tony does gradually emerge as a tragic figure resigned to his fate: he knows that he could've turned out differently under different circumstances, but he just figures being a mobster is his lot in life and he might as well dedicate himself to it.  Even while seeing a psychiatrist, Tony still laments the decline of the ideals and conventions of the older generation, where mob bosses didn't have panic attacks and didn't have to worry about being ratted out.  And to its credit, the show isn't afraid to show him at both his most thuggish (the hilarious beatdown Tony delivers to a debtor in the premiere is easily a season highlight) and his most vulnerable (such as when he stumbles around his house drunk after calling off a planned hit).As the season opens, it's obvious that Tony has some problems, and they only mount as the episodes progress.  His manipulative, neurotic mother Livia (Nancy Marchand, delivering the season's most memorable performance) is losing her marbles and can't live at home anymore; his friend Jackie (who also happens to be the boss of North Jersey) is dying of cancer, leaving a looming power vacuum which either Tony or his vicious Uncle Junior will have to fill; his wife's cousin Christopher has brought a meth-addicted loose cannon into the family business; and the Feds are starting to take a hard look at Tony's activities.  As events unfold, Tony ends up having to worry about federal indictments, the prospect of a rat in his crew, his conflicted and ambiguous relationship with his therapist, and even an attempt on his life, with the show doing a brilliant job of mixing in single-episode plots with the overarching narratives and bringing it all to a head in the lightning-paced finale.Even though the emotions on display tend to be rather outsized, the show doesn't pander to the viewer with tired jokes or contrived melodrama; it just perfectly reflects the bizarre mix of humor, drama, and inanity that life so often is.  Much as with the Simpsons, it's not even really accurate to call the show The Sopranos since its focus goes way beyond the titular family to create a slew of memorable characters and plots.  The show isn't about the inner workings of the mob so much as the feelings and experiences associated with it, which are covered from a wide range of perspectives-friends, family, neighbors, hangers-on--and its some of its quieter moments are actually among its best.  Sure, you get the occasional shootings (and one rather unpleasant garroting), but you also get Tony's awkward response to his daughter's questioning about how he makes his living; Christopher feeling distraught over the lack of notoriety his criminal activities have brought him; pretty much a whole episode examining to the impact of stereotyping on Italian-Americans; and one hilarious episode devoted to Uncle Junior's attempts to keep a not-so-dark secret about his sex life from getting out.There's a lot more I could ramble on about in discussing this show, but why bother?  All that really needs to be said is that the Sopranos is a fiercely intelligent, unflinchingly violent show that humanizes its characters without romanticizing them.  And with every season now out in (relatively) affordable DVD sets, you have no excuse not to check it out.	5.0	You know you wanna watch it	2006-04-29	5	5	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A15XXOVX6ZNNRO	"William D. Shingleton ""Wishful Thinking Is No..."	As a body of work, the Sopranos rivals the Godfather trilogy in its treatment of the life of the mafia.  Of course, part of the Godfather Trilogy is the terrible third film, and the Sopranos has its warts as well.Mostly, the warts are the supporting cast, which in the first season is not terribly well developed.  The kids have a few moments, Edie Falco has the occasional scene, but the first season is really about Tony and his mother - even Uncle Junior is left as a relatively one-dimensional character at the end of the season.  The good news is that there's more than enough depth to Tony Soprano's character to warrant an entire season and then some, and the series over time has improved in its ability to focus on somebody other than James Gandolfini.There's a lot of criticism of entertainment like the Sopranos for glorifying mob life and for unfairly stigmatizing Italian Americans.  If you actually watch the series without looking to be offended, I doubt that you'll find that either is true.  The thing that makes the Sopranos (like the Godfather) great is that the fundamental premise is that the choices that the mobster makes to lead him into the fabulous life of crime are the same choices that torment him and prevent him from enjoying the fruits of his crime.  In terms of the treatment of Italian Americans, there is a significant Italian mob presence, but it's balanced by other characters (Artie Bucco, Dr. Malfi, and others) who are Italian and not organized criminals.I'm Italian and I haven't been offended by anything in the series - my Grandmother, who still speaks Italian, watches this series because of its realistic portrayal of the most important part of Italian life - the food.  This I think is a critical point; unless you truly cannot stand the sex, violence, and cursing, you will be entertained by this series regardless of your age or gender.The main drawback to this DVD set is the speical features, which are among the worst I have seen.  There's a 77 minute interview with David Chase that makes an interview on the Chris Farley show seem well thought-out.  There are two so-called 'featurettes' on the show from HBO that are really nothing more than commercials.  It's too bad we couldn't get a director or actor commentary on at least the pilot.Overall, if you like mob films or shows you will love the Sopranos.	4.0	A Great Series and a Terrible DVD	2005-04-16	3	0	3

Superbly acted by all involved, masterfully directed by several talents, and wonderfully written, this first season introduces you to the New Jersey mob with Tony Soprano as its lead.  He cheats on his wife, kills as needed, and leads with a firm hand, but James Gandolfini gives him such humanity that you can't help but root for him.  Brutal?  Yes.  Profane?  Yes.  But you can't stop watching the Soprano family and the Soprano mob family do their thing!	5.0	Fantastic Show!	2012-09-06	1	1	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	ARHIP94W9PFZG	Worked as advertized.  It's best to stick to ...	Everything about this series is very well done and nothing seems &#34;phony&#34; about the characters or the plot twists.  I never had HBO so I didn't get to see it when first released, but I think this is the best way to watch this series:  one or two episodes a night so that the plot stays fresh in your mind.  The acting and direction is great, but I think the writers deserve special credit for helping bring these characters to life.  Kudos!	5.0	Addictive!	2013-07-05	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A62VD2R3NGUMM	W. Reimers	I didn't remember seeing the first season (and perhaps 2nd), but I did recall that the shot of the Twin Towers was removed from the opening credits.  I was curious to see if the original opening would be on the DVD.  Well, ya, there is a shot of the towers, but it appears to me as though it is a shot of the side view mirror of Tony's SUV with the image of the towers in the reflection.  Does anyone know if it was always that way?  If so, that simple shot was very prophetic; foreshadowing that, soon after, the towers would only be in our past.  If it is not original, it was a well thought out  adjustment.	4.0	Opening Sequence and the Twin Towers	2007-06-28	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1JPC6S4P5SVLM	WRII	If you don't have HBO, GET IT AND WATCH THIS SHOW.  You will get hooked.  I did, and I thought that I would hate it. Once you get hooked the first season on DVD is a must have.  The first season develops the characters and gives you the bulk of the family history.  The DVD has many extras including DVD-Rom features.  It also contains helpful episodes summaries along with the expected DVD features.	5.0	The Sopranos- The Best Show On Television Right Now	2001-07-08	0	0	0
B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2QQ5O2TFZPTIH	Wu-Tang_Assassin	One word for this show, amazing. I have never been a fan of shows that come on everyday or once a week. But since i've heard so many good things about this show, and also being a fan of mob movies I decided to pick up the first season and start from the beggining.After watching each episode, I just kept watching the others that led one after another. This show does a great job of introducing the characters, you get familiar which each of them quite fast and easily. Since im a fan of movies like Goodfellas, I started to like this show right off the bat. If I counted correctly theres about 13 or so episodes in this DVD set.The storyline throughout these shows are great, thats what keeps me entertained. When something big is happening in the show, but it kinda cuts off at the end, it makes you want to watch the next episode to follow through and keep watching it. It really is an addicting show. The acting on this show is wow, really good. I didn't see any weakness in the acting by hardly any of the actors in the show. And Tony Soprano by far does the best job acting. There is nothing corny in this season, the acting is GREAT.If your a fan of mob movies like Goodfellas, Casino etc you should really like this show. Theres enough violence, and mob type feel to this show for sure! If you haven't seen any of Sopranos yet, or new to it, DEFINATELY pick up this DVD set because its definately worth it.Dont pass this up!	5.0	Sopranos: First Season	2007-02-28	1	1	0

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A1C7QKP8PU0XS8	yosunnyjoe	There is little quesion that you will find most episodes of the first season of the Sopranos entertaining. It all stems from a mob guys need to see a shrink for panic attacks but the key is the likeability of the characters. These are real people, some you just wouldn't mind spending some time with despite their violent mob implications. David Chase also incorporates enough characters so the unexpected murder can take place anytime, unlike most television shows where you know who will absolutely survive the closing credits. Tony Soprano who is one of each episodes likely survivors has the ability to enthrall you with the mob side of his life as many relate to his family side instead. James Gandolfini is perfect for the job and wife Carmella (Edie Falco) is excellent. The main difference between All in the Family in it's day and the Sopranos is that racial insults are shared by uncle Junior and mom Livia. Tony is also set in his ways. There are many laughs with no laugh track. Please be aware of the violence which in this case may not be as shocking as it's usually what keeps the interest of fans. One could argue that this is the type of T.V. people really want to see especially with the reported success by HBO. At production costs at 2 million per episode and only on average 15 episodes per year it will be interesting to see if the networks can even come close, if not see these videos they're not to be missed.	5.0	Todays updated All in the Family	2001-05-30	2	1	1

B00003CXOO	The Sopranos - The Complete First Season [VHS]	A2HNLTXARVYQZM	Zachary Bergland	"If people tell you The Wire is the best show ever, then they are a liar.  If a buddy says Breaking Bad has surpassed The Sopranos for King of All Television Dramas, stop being friends with him.  It's an experience you have to see to believe.  It's that good. Which is why I laugh when I hear those comparisons to those other great shows.  I consider The Wire and Breaking Bad #2 & #3 but they are so far behind #1 that it's comical.  Every episode fills more drama and epic moments than those shows can reach in entire seasons.  It's ""worst"" episodes are better than most shows' Finales.  It's much deeper than those other 2, as I will now call them because the writing, directing and acting says so much more about life, death, and deep burning thoughts and questions all humans have.  You learn as much as you are entertained.  You learn about history, the human condition, and more important to the actual craft, about what makes great storytelling and acting.  It's not about an elaborate plot crisply written.  It's about people.  It's a character driven show, with more interesting characters played by superior actors.  No more so than James Gandolfini, who plays the ultimate anti-hero, protagonist, antagonist and tortured soul, Tony Soprano.  Emmy winner Edie Falco plays his enabling wife, Carmela, with almost equal the brilliance.  Oh, and have you met his mother yet?  Meet Mama Livia, the reason for Tony's existence, and all his misery.  It's not a mob show.  It's The Sopranos.  And it doesn't let you out alive.  I suggest watching all six seasons before it's censored by America for being too awesome."	5.0	Best By a New Jersey Mile	2013-10-04	1	1	0
