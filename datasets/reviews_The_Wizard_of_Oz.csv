0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1IWG16D1FD1GQ	1John 4:7-12	I was absolutely thrilled to see this movie in my mailbox only a few days after I ordered it. I watched it immediately and loved every single minute of it!! It is even better to me now that I am older. I have no children, so this movie was just for me and I must say it is refreshing to watch Wizard of Oz, because we live in a world full of violence and inappropriate language - you won't find any of that in this movie! This is a keeper and I was honored to add it to my video library. I did some research on the Wizard of Oz and found out that Shirley Temple was supposed to play the part of Dorothy. As it turns out, I did not need to research the Wizard of Oz because the 75th anniversary edition has all the information in it for me about Shirley Temple wanting the part of Dorothy and all of the other wonderful details. I hope adults consider watching this movie because there is more to take away from it as an adult, simply because the older and wiser we become the more we are able to glean. The movie proves to young ones that everything you need is inside of you. You just have to call on it. this was proven in the movie by all of the characters going to the Wizard of Oz to ask him for certain traits they felt they lacked. However, as it happened, they were never given anything from the Wizard of Oz except for phony traits that hung around their neck. The things they desired, such as  courage and a heart were actually inside of them all along. By watching this movie kids can learn that if one simply needs something, one can tap into what God has already put in them and allow it to flow, freely!! This movie is for everyone: disabled persons, babies, children, teens, adults and elderly alike!! If someone is unable  to see the movie they will find great satisfaction from simply listening to it! The audio is very animated!! Make yourself some vegan popcorn and enjoy the movie!!	5.0	A Classic That Thrills Me, even today!!	2013-12-17	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"There's little left to be said about 'The Wizard of Oz'.  It is #6 on AFI's top 100 list.  It is one of the enduring classics, passed on from one generation to the next, and it's components have an iconic familiarity still strewn in commercials, references, and other imitations.All that's left for me to state is how much it can be taken for granted.  Watching the film recently on DVD reminded me of how much familiarity can lead to contempt.  It had been since the eighties since I last saw this movie, and it renewed my awe for this snappy, innovative, and thoroughly entertaining trek from Kansas to Oz.What struck me was the brilliance of color, the extravaganza of song and dance--not just by the four core characters, but by the Munchkins and the citizens of Emerald City.  I took in as for the first time the beautiful set designs, the great musical numbers, and the brisk pace as the scenes spring before your eyes and the story unfolds.  It's easy to forget how effective Margaret Hamilton was as the Wicked Witch of the West, or the choreography of dancing, or the flight of the flying monkeys, or the transition from black and white to color that separates the two worlds and takes Hollywood into it's early flights in color film.As it has been said time and again, 'The Wizard of Oz' is the cinema equivalent of ""Jack and the Bean Stalk"".  It is a powerful voyage for children as it brings to the surface their fears only to vanquish them and make them feel secure as never before.  (In this regard, maybe only 'Home Alone' has been able to do in post modern times a fraction of what 'The Wizard of Oz' can do.)One last thing:  I insisted on watching this classic again with the help of Amazon.  Being able to obtain 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' for free on Kindle let me do what I recommend to my students:  It let the muscles of my mind (my imagination, or my personal DVD player) to conjure the images anew from Frank Baum's wonderful book.  It was a revelation worth seeing for the comparative value of each.  I think the movie makers made judicious decisions with timing and editing and made the film the gem we know it to be today.  Maybe they weren't able to recreate the South land with all it's china characters, but they knew how to keep an audience captivated.  Certainly there were accommodations to tailor make the story for the audience.  In the book, the Wizard of Oz has them kill the witch to get their wishes granted; in the movie we know they only have to get the broom.  Of course by now this shouldn't be a spoiler, but the magic causality was traded for dream sequences, which everyone, including maybe David Lynch, have borrowed from.(Finally, can you imagine what 'The Wizard of Oz' would have been like if Shirley Temple had gotten the part of Dorothy?  Or if Buddy Ebsen would have played The Scarecrow?  Most of us shudder to think of it, but I'll bet '..Oz' would have been a blockbuster then, but not nearly the classic it is now.)"	5.0	Reasons to Revisit 'Oz'	2012-09-01	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A32JKNQ6BABMQ2	"abe ""starman"""	"well,in case your the most brain dead person on the planet and have never seen this movie,i will review it for you.the only flaw is that the main character dorothy is a bit too quaint.the story is all about a girl and her tiny mutt toto who are whisked away to the magical land of oz by a tornado.when they get there,they are informed by a good witch and about a hundred little people that the house they landed in killed a bad witch.her sister,also a bad witch shows up and vows revenge.dorothy takes off for the wizards keep where she hopes to find a way home.on the way,she meets a walking talking dancing singing scarecrow with no brain,a man made of tin with no heart and a man lion whose a coward.they travel together to the wizard for help.the witch has other plans however.the kids will like it.a useful technique for keeping them from not fearing the witch is to have someone pretend to be scared of the witch and ask the kid to protect them.they will forget their fears to protect mom or whoever every time.im not sure who the people in it were.dorothy died of an amphetamine addiction.the tin woodsman died of cancer due to the tin man makeup.the lion died of a heart related cause.[in real life i mean}.the kids will love it.they made a 2nd one in the 1980s.it was nothing like the original.there are many books to this movie also.this was just one story of many many others.this is easily the best.everybody can like it.theres a lot of witty lyrics in this musical.one in particular id like to mention is in the song if i only had a brain.in the actual movie,the scarecrow sings a quick little ditty then stops.the soundtrack has a really long musical part behind it.after the solo,he sings[only on the soundtrack]""then perhaps ill deserve ya and be even worthy of ya if i only had a brain"".whats this?was that a pass on her?thats pretty messed up considering shes 12 in the movie.and whats with him trying to be her man the whole time.hes always first to help her,never talks bad or disagrees,admonishes others for doing so.the tin man acts quite like a jealous and crestfallen x lover also.if thats not bad enough,later you find out its a dream and that the 3 characters were her minds renderings of the farmhands on her uncles farm.very scary!when dorothy breaks down in teers or sings somewhere over the rainbow it is a bit emotional.this movie was released in 1939.it blew all movies before it out of the water and set a new standard in movies.it was also the very first movie to contain color.when dorothy opens her door after crash landing in oz.an abselute gem.there are a few chicks in this movies but they are all 3 and a half foot tall or 55 years old.the 2nd wich was horribly burned when she disapeared from oz in a puff of smoke and fire.ive never read the books but would love to.i read a somewhat deranged comic book version though.the message is theres no place like home.if you have just a house and no loving home,make it a home or go make another one some other place.the special effects were mind blowing at the time but not anymore.a timeless classic!"	5.0	wizard of oz	2004-09-10	13	1	12
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3DJC3PLH6YWVR	A. Carroll	"Who does not love Dorothy Gale, her adorable dog, Toto, and her lovable and musical friends, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion? Were we not all dazzled by the extraordinary color change from black, white, and sepia, to a brilliant display of the new technology of Technicolor, altering the entire mood of the film? The Wizard of Oz is beloved by many, and remembered by all. Personally, I grew up watching and adoring this movie and singing all of the unforgettable, catchy tunes. I have even dressed up as Dorothy for Halloween. This is a timeless classic, portraying a story of perseverance, friendship, and self sufficiency among other things. The tale of the four friends' journey and triumph over the wicked witch to get what they needed; be it home, a brain, courage, or a heart has been inspiring people since 1939.To me, the movie seems to personify the triumph of good over evil, as well as perseverance. As the story starts out, Dorothy simply wants to keep her dog, and be independent. However, she ends up finding herself in a great deal of trouble, seemingly far from home, and feeling extremely dependent. This shows just how childlike, and human her character is, and how she has ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" type of attitude. However, she and her four-legged companion, Toto are obviously quite easy to get along with, as she makes friends almost everywhere she goes. Each of these new friends, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion all want something both relatively simple, yet incredibly complex. They want only small things, though those very things mean a great deal to each of them. Only a truly loving, intelligent, or courageous person would wish for a heart, a brain, or courage. Others would wish for more material things, and I think this shows what truly good people each of the characters were.Dorothy only wants to get back home to Kansas, her family, and her familiar life. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, want a brain, a heart, and courage, respectively. Throughout the movie, they travel many miles, and overcome many obstacles just to see the wizard. Narrowly escaping evil trees, a flame throwing witch, and sleep-inducing poppies, they finally arrive in Oz to meet the infamous Wizard. Only the magical, ruby red slippers of the deceased wicked witch of the east identify Dorothy as being legitimate in the eyes of the citizens of Oz. After having the wizard reject her first request, she is sent on another mission. During this process, Dorothy is captured, and nearly killed by the still living witch, as her friends cunningly plan her successful escape. In one fell swoop, Dorothy takes down the witch dynasty for good, melting the Wicked Witch of the West with a bucket of water, allowing Dorothy to take her broom back to the wizard. These loyal friends went to great lengths to save and help her, and each other, showing one of the great themes of the movie.The witch's broom satisfies the wizard, though his returned gift of 'magic' is slightly less impressive than had been expected, necessitating a new form of magic. Self sufficiency and self actualization are major themes of the film, and are rather evident, especially in the end. As a conclusion, Dorothy and her companions find they could have gotten along without the wizard's help all along. All they really needed was confidence, and to appreciate what they already had and took for granted, which they discovered without any real assistance from the wizard, besides perhaps a few encouraging words. Each person eventually found their respective desires within themselves, as they could have all along, though the true test was to dig deep to find each of them.Good triumphing over evil is a prominent theme of the movie, as well as the innocence of childhood, and friendship. The four friends unconditionally love and protect one another, and go to great lengths to do so. Dorothy's obvious innocence kept her from always seeing things as they were. She did not expect anyone could be so wicked, as the witch and many others were. Also, the story, that we eventually learn Dorothy dreamed up, is somewhat obviously just that; a child's dream. In hindsight, the costumes of the characters were both realistic, and just fake enough to make out who the characters represented in the young girl's life. I always found this to be a rather interesting fact. During her entire stay in Oz, Dorothy never seemed to realize her new friends were indeed the same as her old ones from Kansas, though when she wakes up back in her bed, she knows that each of them were also in her dream. This shows that each of them have parallel mannerisms with their previous characters.Even the score for the film is fantastic. As a musician, and a child who grew up singing ""If I only had a brain,"" I quite appreciate the musical aspects of this glorious movie. Each of the songs portrays the individual parts of the movie, as well as the film in its entirety. While there are many different themes and melodies, from ""Over the rainbow,"" to ""We're off to see the wizard,"" to the unforgettable theme of the Wicked Witch of the West, they all eventually tie in together, and apply to the whole movie. Each scene has its own music, and therefore its own mood, and identity, but is also somewhat similar to others. For example, as Dorothy discovers each of her new friends, in turn, the song alters just a bit. It changes from ""if I only had a brain"", to ""if I only had a heart"", and then the same for ""the nerve"". The quartet also sings many songs, such as ""We're off to see the wizard"" in many different scenes, though it is essentially the same song.All in all, the Wizard of Oz is an excellent movie, on of the best ever in my opinion. The joyous music and life lessons that it brings can do nothing but make one smile, unless of course you were afraid of the flying monkeys. With the expert cast, headed by the talented Judy Garland, an amazing display of Technicolor, unforgettable music, and four loyal companions, the Wizard of Oz is rightfully one of the most beloved movies of all time."	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2008-11-05	4	3	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AU7TQ22Z4Y8CE	"Adam Dahlkoetter ""Adam Dahlkoetter"""	The original Wizard of Oz movie was horrible. It is very loosely based on the original Wonderful Wizard of Oz book. A new movie series should be made.MGM changed so many things from the book in this movie it's ridiculous. Here is a list of just some of the things that are not true to the original book.1. The magical shoes Dorothy gets at the beginning are the Silver Shoes (Not Ruby).2. The time spent in Oz is real, not a dream.3. The three farm workers, story teller, and miss gulch, do not appear in any Oz book at all.4. The Wicked Witch of the East and the Wicked Witch of the West are not related at all.5. The Wicked Witch of the West does not appear in the book until Dorothy and friends travel to the West on the Wizards orders.6. They went to the West to kill the Witch, not to take her broom stick.7. Glinda is the Good Witch of the South, not the North.8. Glinda does not appear in the book until the final when she tells Dorothy how to use the Silver Shoes to get home.9. Munchkins all wear blue.10. The road is called the Road of Yellow Bricks, not the yellow brick road.11. The journey to the Emerald City is much more dangerous and long than depicted in the movie.12. No one sings in the book.13. The Silver Shoes can be removed while still alive.14. The unnamed elderly Good Witch of the North greets Dorothy when she first arrives in Oz.15. All witches in Oz wear white, not pink or black.16. Dorothy was not rescued by the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion at the Witch's Castle, she rescued them after killing the Wicked Witch.17. Glinda does not come to the Emerald City at the end of the story, Dorothy and friends have to travel to the south to ask for her help.18. The Wizard appeared in more than one form, not just a giant floating head.19. The four companions visited the Wizard one at a time, not all at once.20. The four companions stayed in the Emerald City for several days.21. Dorothy was the Witches captive for several days, forced to work for the Witch.22. The Winkies, the Witch's slaves, all wear yellow.23. The Winged Monkeys are only bound to serve the Witch three times as she owns a cap that controls them. After performing a task they leave.24. Dorothy takes the cap of the Winged Monkeys after killing the Witch and uses it herself.25. When using the Silver Shoes magic, Dorothy clicks the heals together three times, and wishes to go home to kansas, she does not say there's no place like home.26. The Wizards balloon was dismantled after he arrived in Oz, and Dorothy and him built a new one out of green cloth.27. The Wizard was from Omaha, Nebraska, not an old Kansas man.28. The Emerald City did not exist when the Wizard arrived in Oz. When he was first made the ruler of Oz the Emerald City was built on his first order.29. The keeper of the gate to the Emerald City did not deny Dorothy and friends entrance to the city.30. The Munchkins thought Dorothy was a Good Witch because she wore a faded white and blue checked dress. White being the color of a witch and blue being the color of the munchkins.31. Dorothy's house landed in a ditch no where near a Munchkin village, and only somewhat near the road of yellow bricks.32. Dorothy's house never returned to Kansas.33. All Munchkin houses are painted blue.34. The gift given to the Scarecrow was not a diploma, but padding in his head to mimic brains.35. The gift given to the Tin Man was not a heart clock, but a stuffed satin heart put into the Woodsman's chest and then patched over with tin.36. The gift given to the Lion was not a medal, but a bowl of liquid said to be courage that the lion drank.37. The Wicked Witch of the West did not have green skin.38. The Wicked Witch had only one eye.39. The Wicked Witch melted from water because her wickedness had dried her blood out of her body years ago.40. The Good Witch of the North gave Dorothy a magic kiss on her forehead that protected her, that is why the Wicked Witch of the West would not harm her.41. Dorothy was saved from the poppy field by field mice, not by Glinda.42. When Dorothy returned to Kansas the Silver Shoes had fallen off over the desert surrounding Oz.43. In the final chapter, Dorothy tumbled into Kansas in a field near her Aunt and Uncle's farm, and a new farm house was already being built by her Uncle Henry.	1.0	Please make a new Oz movie, this one is horrible	2010-07-05	57	6	51
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ASL3NTON56ICP	Adam	This is by far the best Blu-ray conversion we have ever seen. I was a bit reluctant at first. Knowing that this is a 1939 movie, I was worried about the quality of the Blu-ray, but because we are such Wizard fans, I decided to get it anyway. The images are breathtaking. When Dorothy enters Munchkinland you can see every petal and every stem on every flower as she slowly walks in. You can appreciate the Munchkin's costumes, and the beauty of the sets. The Scarecrow's clothes, the Tin Man's suit, the Lion's fur and mane, are impressive in their clarity and detail. The Yellow Brick Road is more magical this time around.We already had the DVD version, and while it is spectacular, the Blu-ray blows your mind.It is refreshing to see such beautiful sets and costumes, even when you know some of the backdrops are painted, and the Yellow Brick road ends at a wall. They are so much warmer than the CGI images we see nowadays. This, and the story itself, are what make this movie such a treasure.	5.0	Wizard of Oz Blu-Ray	2013-01-08	0	0	0

Full of MGM jewels,  and the most golden songbook ever heard in a movie, &quot;The Wizard of  Oz&quot; is still magical and its blissful naivete is what makes it so  wonderful to all age groups. The story of the little girl, Dorothy Gale,  who went over the rainbow into the enchanting land of Oz, and her quest to  get back home to Kansas. With the help of three new wonderful friends, a  limber Scarecrow, a sentimental Tin Man, and a bumbling Lion, she makes her  way to the Emerald City to find the one being who can help all of them -  the wonderful Wizard of Oz... a better cast you'll never see in a film, the  sparkling standout of course being, the wistful, wonderful Judy Garland.  And never will you find a film with more memorable scenes: Garland's  career-making &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; sequence, the arrival in  Munchkinland, the waltz down the Yellow Brick Road... all conspire to make  perhaps the most memorable and most beloved motion picture of all time.	5.0	IT'S A CLASSIC- IT'LL NEVER DIE	2000-06-12	7	7	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A389M5HYNF26PN	A. Hofer	It's been ages since I've seen this movie. I refuse to watch classics like this while being pestered by commercials.Reviews for the blu-ray version were overall very positive so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I couldn't get over the sharpness of detail and vivid color. There is also a noticable improvement over the audio. I was surprized to see that this movie isn't shown in wide screen on this disc but a previous reviewer did a good job of explaining that the original film wasn't made in wide screen.The blu-ray version of OZ met all of my expectations and then some. I'm glad I bought it.	5.0	Blu-ray does it justice.	2013-01-02	0	0	0

I watched this movie everyday of my life when I was little, I am glad that it is still treasured and they were able to clean it up to make it look even more like a dream land.  The watch is beautiful.  I really enjoy the book.  I am not finished with all the extras since there are so many, but they are just as good as the movie itself.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2NJVKKIGP6X0D	"Alan A. Cummings ""AAC"""	The Wizard of Oz may be considered a classic by many people, but I guess these people never read any of the books.  About the only thing the movie has in common with the books is the title and some of the characters.  L. Frank Baum would turn over in his grave if he saw how his books had been destroyed by MGM.  Dorthy was NOT 17 years old(as was Judy Garland).  Glinda the Good was a beautiful young girl(not someone who could have bested the Wicked Witch of the West in an ugly contest like Billie Burke), and the wizard of Oz was not a carnival huckster.  This movie is a travesty.  Many may call it a classic, but if these people had read the books, the Wizard of Oz would have closed after 10 minutes.	1.0	This movie is NOT a classic	2013-06-08	22	1	21

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ	"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover"""	"Like other movies, The Wizard of Oz has been subjected to a number of re-issues, each one trying to top the previous one.  I can't imagine anything topping this one though.  First (as DVD 2 tells us), for this one the producers have taken the negatives and made a wholly new clean-up, realligning frames that had only vaguely matched before.  The result is digital clarity and incredibly indellible colors.  The performance is still as great as it always was, but we just see it so much better.  The added material of home movies, movie-tone news clips, and deleted scenes has been available before.  The 3rd DVD has several VERY early Oz movies that were produced by L. Frank Baum himself.  One of them even features a young Oliver Hardy.  They are a strange assortment of movies, but each one has points of interest and they amount to over 3 hours of viewing.  With this release we are taken ""over the rainbow"" to a kind of release which, like Ben Hur's new 4 DVD special, is very appreciated and goes as far as a company needs to go in presenting interesting features."	5.0	Restoration and so MUCH more.	2006-01-15	0	0	0

Amazing service and whoa the 3D transfer does add a joyous dimension to the film. I actually prefer this subtle 3D effect over the modern, poke everything towards the screen 3D. If you are in the UK then order it from amazon, as it appears not to have a release date in the UK and it plays fine on my PS3 (not tested on a blu ray player, yet).	5.0	Amazing Service and Product	2013-11-01	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3CSRP3P4U9HI	Alan R. Holyoak	During casting for THE WIZARD OF OZ the leading contender for the role of Dorothy was Shirley Temple, one of the top box office draws of the day.  Am I ever glad that things worked out so that Judy Garland ended up as  Dorothy.  She makes a much more convincing Kansas farm girl (beautiful,  none-the-less) than Temple would have with her perfectly curled trademark  appearance.  I fear that if Temple had gotten the lead this film would have  been just another vehicle for her, not the classic that resulted from the  casting of Garland. That casting, along with that of the other lead players  produced a chemistry of actors and characters that caused this movie to  become universally acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all  time.The use of black and white film for the opening and closing scenes,  and the use of the then (1939) new color technology for the main part of  the movie was a stroke of genius.  The only reason this movie didn't win  the best picture Oscar in 1939 was that GONE WITH WIND also came out that  year (which also used the new color film technology to dazzle audiences,  plus it had Clark Gable!).THE WIZARD OF OZ the film adaptation of Baum's  classic book of the same name is a masterpiece of fantasy and musical film  making.  The special effects are first-rate, especially considering the  fact that this film was released 61 years ago!  The unlikely heroine,  Dorothy, still endears herself to audiences today.  And we still love to  hate the wicked witch and her counterpart in the real world.Don't all  of us seceretly hope to be able to enter a magical place like the Land of  Oz, meet enchanted characters, and have an adventure memorable for a  life-time.  That is what the Wizard of Oz is -- an adventure of a life  time.This film is watchable by viewers of all ages, though I still  cringe when the wicked witch melts away -- something that somewhat  traumatized me as a child.  Winged monkeys didn't really bother me, much.If you are paying close attention as you watch this film keep an eye  open and you will realize how deeply engrained this film now is in  mainstream American culture.A classic movie for all time!Definitely 5  stars.Enjoy -- Alan Holyoak	5.0	Am I ever glad Shirley Temple didn't get the lead!	2000-06-27	1	0	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ALOASKC3N1KDR	Alan Soyars	"Let's face it. Everyone and their mother and their mother's mother has seen ""The Wizard of Oz"" at least a dozen times in their lifetime. Yes, the movie can be a bit corny and cheesy at times, but I think that's one of the things that made this movie so charming and innocent. Judy Garland plays as Dorothy Gale. Dorothy is a young girl who, to sum it up in a nutshell, wants more than the life she has. She wants a perfect place where she will have a perfect life. She runs away from her house and meets a faux- psychic who convinces her to go home, and in the meantime, a storm is brewing in Kansas. Just as Dorothy makes it home, as she's searching through her house for her beloved Auntie Em. During the storm, a window blows out of the frame, and its Dorothy in the head knocking her unconscious. When she wakes up, she finds her house caught in a twister spinning high into the sky. When her house lands, she opens her door and enters the brilliantly colorful town of Munchkinland. She is greeted by tiny people called Munchkins and Glenda the Good Witch of the North, who are celebrating over the fact that Dorothy's house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. They celebrate that is, until the Wicked Witch of the West shows up and wants her dead sister's ruby slippers which Glenda magically placed on Dorothy's feet. The Wicked Witch leaves but warns Dorothy that she has not seen the last of her. Glenda and the Munchkinlanders tell Dorothy to travel to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz to return her home. So she follows the yellow brick road out of Munchkinland and into a magical adventure. She encounters a talking Scarecrow, a rusted up Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion. Together they go on their quest to talk to the Wizard.""The Wizard of Oz"" is not just a movie. It is a tradition. It is a child's birthright to be able to experience such an amazing film. And this set is just that ticket. It is a marvelous transfer of the movie as well as some really great special features. Take the deleted scenes for example. It's different seeing deleted scenes on a movie in today's time, but to see deleted scenes from such an icon in movie making history, is just amazing.I highly recommend this set to anyone who has children, who was a child, or who is still a child at heart."	5.0	Beautiful set of a timeless classic	2005-11-08	13	12	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3L84JNFS2DJBM	Alan W. Armes	there have been only a few films to achieve the legendary status of &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;, such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; but even those 2, as magnificent as they were, still didn't quite achieve the legendary magnificence of &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;. this film will be immensely enjoyed by generations to come. it has been loved by all ages since initially released in 1939.as for the DVD, it is absolutely loaded with special features including a very special documentary hosted by Angela Lansbury. the picture and sound are astonishingly so well-preserved and transferred to disc, it's absolutely incomprehensible that a movie this old (62 years) could look this great. if you don't buy it now, you will regret it if it goes out of print.	5.0	perhaps, the most legendary film of all time	2001-11-19	1	1	0

And we've seen it 5,678 times on both the big and small screens. And we seen it restored and remastered and crammed with all the ""bonus tracks"" Warner likes to insists are ""new.""But this time, Warner is not only reissuing it  the flick in Blue-ray, but they have teamed with Turner Classic Movies and some outfit called NCM Fathom and showing around the country in an event that bears the original title, The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Hi-Def Event.In other words, try it before you buy it.For one-night only, Wednesday, September 23 at 7 p.m., 449 selected theaters across the country will be showing Oz, ""first time ever in high definition.""The flick will be introduced by our pal, TCM host Robert Osborne, who will share facts and stories about this ageless classic. (Mr. O will be on screen, not in the theaters.) We are promised this will be The Wizard of Oz like you've never seen or heard it before!The screening  will also include an ""exclusive cut"" of To Oz! The Making of a Classic, which offers audiences a unique peek into the Land of Oz through interviews with original Munchkin actors; an audio outtake of ""If I Only Had a Brain"" with Ray Bolger and July Garland, complete with stills and home movie footage; and a look at how the MGM artists and craftsmen created the music, costumes and amazing special effects for The Wizard of Oz in the '30s.Warner Home Video swears that once the ""limited, numbered version"" packages of The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition are sold out, ""they will never again be available to consumers.""Too much straw in their heads? Obviously they never hard of eBay.All this Oz hoopla kicks off on Thursday, September 24, in Madhattan with a series of ""sparkling events.""There'll be an ""Emerald Gala"" at the Tavern on the Green, hosted by its owner and CEO Jennifer Oz LeRoy, granddaughter of The Wizard of Oz producer Mervyn LeRoy. (Let her explain her middle name: ""My grandfather declared I would be forever tied to it by giving me Oz as my middle name and the movie has been integrated into family celebrations all my life.)The restaurant and grounds will transform (just for a night) into Emerald City, replete with a winding Yellow Brick Road. To make the event politically-incorrect, five of the original wizened actors who played Munchkins will be hauled out.And Judy's younger daughter, Lorna Luft, will  once again dig into her Mama's past to  ""honor her mother's legacy with a special musical tribute."" (Luft played the Wicked Witch in a London 2008 stage production of The Wizard of Oz.)After all, this years marks the 40th anniversary of Judy's death. On the morning of June 22, 1969, Judy's fifith and final hubby Mickey Deans woke up to an empty bed. He called for his wife. The bathroom door was locked. He banged again and again. No answer. Deans climbed onto the roof of the flat and peered in the open window. There was Dorothy Gale, Mrs. Norman Maine, Frances Gumm, dead, at 47, her arms on her lap; her head slumped forward, on the toilet. Deans crawled through the window. Judy's skin had turned blue, and blood was gushing from her nose and mouth. A comeback was certainly out of the picture.Our ruby slippers were in the shop."	1.0	The Wizard of Oz? Another DVD version?

This has always been a stunning Technicolor production - seemingly well preserved - actually an almost perfect classic film from Hollywood's Golden Age in just about every respect!  Depending on what generation you came from, it is also a film you probably have seen many times. So, you might be tempted to take a ""Ho hum"" approach to this newest release of the film.  That would be a mistake!  You might also be tempted to pass up the opportunity to see the IMAX release of the 3D version now in IMAX theaters.  That would be an even bigger mistake!Watching this release of The Wizard of Oz will be a whole new experience for you whether you've seen it only once or a hundred times before! Everything about this film - the story, the performances, the entire production is shown in an entirely new light! The 3D is absolutely superb and not the least bit ""hokey""! The sound is a revelation, partly because Warners has found new elements that have not been used in previous releases. It is a stunning presentation that will put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. The whole theater (or your living room) will clap in appreciation as it ends.This restoration is a game changer for Warner Brothers and the whole preservation/restoration industry.

I didn't buy the ultimate edition (what a load of junk, especially since I already got the 2005 2 disc DVD Special Edition). Image is only marginally sharper (very marginally!) then DVD. Brightness fair better the Gond With The Wind BD (GWTW BD is a disappointment!) Grain is also more obvious due to HD.I should have expected this, as there is only so much WB could do to the 70 years old source material. No matter 4K or 8K remastered, the image is always going to be soft and grain is going to be obvious.It's still worth an upgrade for me as the 2005 DVD have problem with noise on the right front channel, I have to watch with Mono soundtrack.

OK, this baby boomer isn't a 3D tech wiz so all I can tell you is my opinion.I watched the movie on a Vizio 32 inch with Passive 3D capabilities using glasses I took home from the movie theater. My Blu-ray machine is a 3D Samsung.I could not help to notice during to opening credits the text jumped out at you. The Sepia portions of the movie were unexpectedly in 3D too. Once Dorthy arrived in the Munchkin Village I kept removing my glasses to see if there was any difference. While the glasses were removed portions of the movie looked as though it was a very good quality 2D with some scenes appearing as a double figure.The color quality and contrast is beautiful. The movie appeared as I have never before seen it. Sure beats the cardboard glasses movies I grew up with.

I am always referencing quotes in the movie (like someone should drop a house on that woman) and now he will now where it came from.

I prefer renting movies, and obviously Redbox would be a crapshoot for this. I tried the library...missing. I tried the local video store...damaged and unwatchable. We were all delighted to see that it was available instantaneously on Amazon.The only problem that we encountered was that the video stopped and reset to the beginning several times in the same spot. I would suspect a problem on our end except that we haven't had that trouble on other videos. We solves the problem by skipping to just after that spot and had noire trouble.As for the movie: I wouldn't want to try to review a classic for its content.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3OKT2G33Q2YKO	Amazon Customer	I bought this version because I love learning what goes on behind the scenes.  This disk is full of special features.  My only problem is that this copy of the movie is missing some footage.  I always thought it was and when my mother-in-law watched it with my son, she mentioned that it was missing some footage.  There is some parts where it cuts away from the witch in the beginning really fast as if there was something about to happen but it wasn't shown.  Then, after Dorothy melts the witch, all the witch's clan and Dorothy and her friends walk around singing.  This was removed.  I remember seeing this on my VHS copy as a kid.  Not sure what other DVDs would contain this but I'd rather buy that version instead of this one.

Imagine my frustration when it came to my house and it was standard aspect ratio - even the box clearly states it's the standard version.Why Amazon would list it as Widescreen is beyond me.

The crisp, wonderfully clear transfer opens up new colors and details that just slip by the viewer in standard def, and the soundtrack (with Garland's gorgeous voice) will amaze you.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1ZRYVKJJX24KX	"Amazon Customer ""shortywithtwins"""	Of the DVDs I own or have rented, this one is the most impressive.  The special features are numerous and incredible.  Who knew that Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the Tinman or that Ray Bolger had a wonderful dance  scene that was deleted from the final cut of the movie?  I especially  enjoyed the interviews with the cast and the commentary on the other  vintage movies that were also released in 1939 (if only we were so lucky to  have as many outstanding movies to be released in one year as were released  in 1939).Besides the special features that make this DVD a must own,  the sound and picture qualities are superior.  Since I was old enough to  remember, I watched The Wizard of Oz on TV every year.  Now, I get to watch  it with my daughter in all of its glory and splendor on DVD.  Though the  hallway to the Wizard doesn't seem nearly as long and the Wicked Witch is  not quite as scary (as when I was a child), the magic of the movie remains.  If you loved the movie as a child and you are looking for an exceptional  quality DVD that your family will enjoy for years and years, you must buy  this DVD!

I felt privileged to be sharing the experience with my kids who now have a real love for the movie as well *yay, another generation indoctrinated*. From the watch to the running sheet from 1938, the book on how to advertise the movie etc.. it is a really special collection of memorabilia.The only drawback for me was the poor quality of the recording of The Dreamer of Oz. On our copy it was blurry which made it frustrating to watch. Conversely, the recording I copied to video from our television fifteen years ago is much clearer. So that was a disappointment as I really love that movie.Nonetheless the Wizard of Oz (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] is a really luxurious purchase but well worth paying that bit more for the experience.	5.0	Blown Away	2010-02-03	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"Reviewing a film like `The Wizard of Oz' almost seems as pointless as reviewing `Titanic' or `The Godfather'; there really isn't much more you can say that hasn't already been said.  It's a classic film that has been seen by millions, nearly every living, breathing soul, and it is lauded and loved and praised so much that doing so anymore almost seems like overkill.  I reviewed `The Godfather' to the best of my ability, and so I plan on reviewing this one as well, despite the lack of necessity.I also plan on one day reviewing `Titanic', although I already have on this site once under another name and felt the review was spot on perfection, so writing another seems almost cruel.I want to start by saying this; I saw `The Wizard of Oz' for the first time about 6 months ago.  I know, I know; the immediate response is ""what rock did you just crawl out from under"" and that is perfectly acceptable.  To be honest, I did see the film one time when I was almost too young to remember.  I guess I didn't like it too much because I had no desire to see it again, and so I didn't.  As my daughter keeps getting bigger my wife and I are adding to our children's movie collection and the topic of this film came up.  My wife was all for it, and the great husband that I am gave in and decided to sit down and give it another go.  So when I say that I saw `The Wizard of Oz' for the first time 6 months ago I mean that I SAW it, as in I really completely took it in.And then I went and saw `Wicked' and was completely blown away, but that's for another conversation.So, what makes `The Wizard of Oz' so special?  The answer is right at its center; the heart.  There is so much love and joy wrapped up in this intriguing (yet rather simple) tale of a young girl who is taken from her home and thrown into a world she can only imagine.  Filled to the brim with characters as vibrant and likable as they are strange and intimidating, Oz is a fantastical world unlike any other in the history of cinema.  Dorothy, along with a few friends, makes her way down the yellow brick road to ask the wizard to send her home.  Along the way she meets the dastardly Wicked Witch and is given the seemingly impossible task of defeating her.Some have analyzed the meaning of `Oz' (which, to be honest, it quite self explanatory), and I applaud their dedication to their analysis.  Yes, `Oz' delivers to us the blessed realization that, with a little heart, a little brains and a little courage we can do anything.  To me though, the purpose of `The Wizard of Oz' is to excite our senses and put a smile on our faces; and it does just that.Judy Garland delivers a star making turn here as the young Dorothy.  With a voice that could warm the coldest of souls, and the needed layers of naivety and strong willed determination, Garland sours above the rest and makes her mark as an iconic screen presence.  The supporting cast is also marvelous, from Ray Bolger and Jack Haley (and especially Bert Lahr) to Billie Burke and Frank Morgan.  Margaret Hamilton is absolutely remarkable as The Wicked Witch, completely shrill and ultimately terrifying.  It's as if the role was written for her, and to hear it from her agent you'd think that it was.So, all in all this is a sublimely beautiful movie that the whole world has fallen in love with, and for good reason.  Hopefully this one will bring a smile to your face as it has mine.I'm sure it already does."	5.0	The wonderful, wonderful `Wizard of Oz'...	2009-09-18	12	5	7

Lewis ""Eveready"""	When my wife un-wrapped her Christmas gift of the OZ collectors set, it was fun to watch as her eyes lit up with excitement and amazement. But her fun didn't end there. As she began to then open up the boxed set, her joy only continued with everything that was inside as she went through it piece by piece loving everything that was included. I am very happy that I bought it for her, and I am absolutely sure she is too. now she can look forward to years of enjoyment watching the DVD set whenever her heart desires, and my daughter too who now also loves to watch it, and the sing along? I can see it now her and my daughter and her friends during sleepovers the fun will go on and on for them. I am so glad I bought it for her and made her so very happy (for years to come too). It felt good for me too. It's well worth its price for someone who loves the wizard of OZ and the traditions it brings.	5.0	My wife loved it	2009-12-26	0	0	0

A tornado appears and carries her to the magical land of oz. Wishing to return, she begins to travel to the city of Oz where a great wizard lives.Adapted from L. Frank Baum's timeless children's tale about a Kansas girl's journey over the rainbow, THE WIZARD OF OZ opened at Grauman's Chinese Theater on August 15, 1939. The film was directed by Victor Fleming (who that same year directed Gone With the Wind), produced by Mervyn LeRoy, and scored by Herbert Stothart, with music and lyrics by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg. Ray Bolger appeared as the Scarecrow; Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Jack Haley as the Tin Woodman. Frank Morgan was seen in six different roles, including that of the ""wonderful Wizard"" himself. Dorothy was portrayed by a 4'11"" sixteen year old girl who quickly earned her reputation as the world's greatest entertainer: the incomparable Judy Garland.The Wizard of Oz received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and captured two Oscars -- Best Song (Over the Rainbow) and Best Original Score -- plus a special award for Outstanding Juvenile Performance by Judy Garland. The film was an overwhelmingly popular and critical success upon its initial release and repeated its ability to captivate audiences when M-G-M reissued the film in 1949 and 1955. The film made a new kind of history with its network television premiere in 1956 on CBS. Nearly 45 million people tuned in for this initial telecast, marking the beginning of an annual tradition. Ever since, The Wizard of Oz has been shown virtually annually on network (and then cable) television; its magical story and heartfelt performances have enabled it to grow from a perennial classic to its current status as a treasured icon of popular culture."	5.0	Revisiting Oz Again (Release Date9/29/09) Numbered Collectible Packaging, Limited Time Rlease	2009-06-22	8	7	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	"Along with Cole Porter and Lorenz Hart, THE WIZARD OF OZ's E.Y. 'Yit' Harburg (it's often misspelled 'Yip') was one of the most original lyricists of his generation. Besides the many great songs he gave voice to inFINIAN'S RAINBOW, Harburg's unique style of wordplay is most evident here in Bert Lahr's ""If I Were King of the Forest"" and the poem that follows, ""Courage"":Dorothy: Your Majesty, if you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?Lion: Not nobody, not nohow!Tin Man: Not even a rhinocerous?Lion: Imposserous!Dorothy: How about a hippopotamus?Lion: Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomamus!Dorothy: Supposin' you met an elephant?Lion: I'd wrap him up in cellophant!Scarecrow: What if it were a brontosaurus?Lion: I'd show him who was King of the Forrus!All three: How?Lion: How?Courage! What makes a king out of a slave?Courage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave?Courage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk, in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?What makes the muskrat guard his musk?Courage! What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?Courage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder?!!!Courage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the ""ape"" in apricot?What have they got that I ain't got?All three: Courage!Lion: You can say that again! Huh?From Scarecrow's loose-limbed dance during ""If I Only Had a Brain"" to Tinman's 'hard'shoe routine on ""If I Only Had a Heart"" to Dorothy's sweetly poignant ""Over the Rainbow,"" the music of this classic movie raises it to a level that few others have ever even approached.So many of us grew up watching ""Oz"" every Easter season on CBS-TV. Forty-plus years have since passed and with them our youth. Can one so along in life still relate to this ""kid's"" movie? The answer is a resounding YES. Its theme of visiting a mystical, mythical land far, far away is as old as humankind's first yearnings, a timeless, ageless desire that when fulfilled in our imaginations gladdens the heart, warms the soul and enriches the spirit.If you haven't seen ""The Wizard of Oz"" since childhood, please do so again. You'll discover things in it and in yourself that may have been forgotten long ago. To those who still haven't glimpsed that land at the rainbow's end, the time is now. There's a scarecrow, a tinman and a lion waiting to escort you along the yellow brick road to Emerald City, home of ""the great and powerful Wizard of Oz!"""	5.0	"Dorothy (to Scarecrow): ""He said 'oil can'."" --- Scarecrow: ""Oil can what?"""	2010-10-11	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A14GOIC2XB5CAD	"Anthony Chiappette ""chippe01"""	Of course this is a wonderful film.  The newly created 3D naturally does nothing for the story itself, but was visually entertaining and kind of odd seeing.  There was nothing wrong with the 3D, as it was done very well.  It was just a little strange seeing this in 3D after watching it in it's normal state for 50 years.Picture seems very bright and clear - it was cleaned up very well.  For a converted 3D movie, it looks good, but of course would not look as any film shot natively in 3D.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AE8RQHFMSLN0D	"Anthony Damato ""Law professor"""	Other reviewers before me have praised &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; to the heavens.  Who can disagree?  It's actually an improvement on the L. Frank Baum book, and that's saying a great deal for any movie.  If you look at  the scenes that were cut from the movie, you have to agree that, good as  they are, they would have detracted overall from the film instead of adding  to it.  No &quot;director's cut&quot; here!  This is a movie that is almost  as good as it could possibly get.  Why &quot;almost&quot;?  Well, they  missed one good bet.  No one has ever said this before, but the bet they  missed was, at the very end, when Judy Garland is in bed back on the farm  and we see that she is wearing the red slippers, the slippers should have  been colored red!  That would have been the icing on the cake. I had this  idea way before I saw &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; where the color pink  was inserted in a black-and-white scene, to tremendous effect.  But as good  as the Schindler movie was in using this effect, &quot;Oz&quot; would been  even better, since the redness of the slippers in a black-and-white movie  is a PLOT thing instead of, as in Schindler, just a visual thing.  Maybe  some remastered version in the future will color those slippers red, and  thrill a new generation of viewers!  But it won't happen, because all the  purists will complain!  Purists are like censors; once they see it one way,  they don't want anyone else to see it another way or even (in the case of  censors) to see it at all.	5.0	One of the Best	2000-07-18	4	0	4

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A186CE1JM5M392	Anthony	The Wizard of Oz, I can safely say, is THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME. I've been watching this movie for the last 20 years of my life (I just turned 20) and I've never seen any other film as much as I have this one and I have never gotten sick of it. It's a fun-loving, fantasy-driven, warm-hearted tale that everyone can relate to. The fact that the majority of modern cinema takes from this film is just another attribute to what makes this film so incredible and classic. It's timeless and every generation will love it, guaranteed.I have to agree with the reviewer below about the bonus interview with Oz expert John Fricke that comes in the Ultimate Oz laserdisc edition. That is a loss but there's so much in this package that is worth of praise that the there's no room for complaint or any negativity. This DVD deluxe edition is completely out of hand. It not only contains the 1999 release of the film with all it's bonus materials and extra footage, but it also contains 6 photographic stills and the original 1939 script with everything that was taken out of the film italicized. It's truly amazing and a must-have for all Oz fans.	5.0	THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME	2004-11-24	6	5	1

Very amazing are the bonus features 16 hours of the movie itself + 6 hour MGM Roar's documentary.The Picture Quality looks in my eyes very good, even for a old movie (just Gone with the Wind was a little bit better)The Blue Ray is codefree and contains german language (soundtrack + subtitles also the menu)Update october 2013:bought now the 75th Anniversary 3D limited Collctors Edition when I had been in LA.Its the 3D necessary or not is one question. Maybe you like it or not. Myself I don't have yet 3D at home. But the ""normal"" (and original flat) version looks very good and don't think that its grainy like other says. The picture is clear and free from dirt or pixels, damages etc. Its maybe not quite sharp as GONE WITH THE WIND it was but still very good!!!Its a limited Numbered Box-Set!Just one more All-New Feature Length Documentary ""The Making of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" as bonus features is added. So when you don't want this Box there is cheapier Version with 2Disc available with the same bonus-features (but without the 6 hours MGM documentary!!!)Incl. in this box is a booklet, Oz-Land-Map, Lobby Card, pins, plus a Diary-Book in Wizar of oz look.

This is an amazing movie that got the deluxe treatment it so richly deserves.If you like the Wizard of Oz, you like classic movies, you like bluray, or you like HD, get this.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2E3IGGAGA8OCS	A reviewer	I used to enjoy this movie every year as a kid, and I recently watched it again after a hiatus of several years. It just did not hold up! While I'll grant that the visuals and special effects were great for a film from the '30s, the movie is too long, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the script is silly. The only engaging performances (other than Garland's singing) were from the Wicked Witch of the West and Toto (and I guess the Wizard, to some extent). A good example of the wonders of Hollywood and mass-marketing.	2.0	Willy Wonka is so much better.	2002-11-24	36	2	34

One problem with that is on every box including US you get a ""BONUS DIGITAL COPY"" message on the packaging but when I opened mine I have ONLY until Sept 29 2010 to download it. I hate that!

The rivet on the bridge of the Tin Man's nose did it for me and all they did was scan the three technicolor negatives, digitally clean and repair them and matched the three up exactly which couldn't be done 65 years ago.  The details brought out by this will astound you.A definite must have for all Oz and Judy Garland fans.  5 stars just doesn't do it for this, I would give it 100.	5.0	Oz Shines Brighter Than Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-10-25	11	10	1

There was a hand-written serial number at the top of the cardboard cover, and the plastic wrap covering it was very shoddy.The DVD itself was dirty, but I cleaned it and played it to see if that was the extent of the damage. It wasn't. The sound goes in and out--with long periods of silence--during the 1979 interviews with surviving cast members Margaret Hamilton, Ray Bolger, and Jack Haley. The rest of the behind-the-scenes extras seems to have been spared. I haven't watched the movie itself yet, so I'm hopeful that at least the movie is intact. If not, I'll return the DVD and wait for the October release of the Oz DVD package.The film is a classic, beloved by million and millions.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3EUSH8DPW75LR	barry	THE WIZARD OF OZ, one of the most classic movies there are, is finally on blu ray.  Wow!!  The first question from all will be how does it look?  Amazon stopped selling this blu ray boxed set for a couple of days as they looked into possible issues with the product they weer selling.  It is now back up for sale as it should be for there is nothing wrong with the blu ray or the dvds.First off, the blu ray version of the film is so striking and magical that I practically held my breath throughout.  It was like watching the film for the first time.  Many people will think that this blu ray is not a huge improvement for it is not in widescreen.  They do not understand that widescreen did not exist 70 years ago and if they had tried to make it fit that ration it would have totally stretched our beloved film.  The film must be shown in the ration it was filmed so there will be black bars on each side of the movie.  Also when the movie begins the black and white is somewhat golden and this is on purpose for the beginning and ending were filmed in sepia tone.  There is some graininess at the beginning that may also make some say they thought blu ray took that away.  The graininess is there for a purpose.  I have read many reviews and articles of this blu ray plus those who created it.  It was very important to remain true to the original source.  To put THE WIZARD OF OZ on blu ray did not mean enhancing colors with modern techniques that covered the original or wiping clear the original grain so the film looked like it was made today.  This is a classic and it is 70 years old.  This blu ray is a perfect example of how blu ray can immensely enhance an old film while keeping true to its film purist originality.Now accept the slight graininess and see how crisp and clear all the scenery is.  Dorothy and Toto are glorious in theit close ups.  And Miss Gultch is so much more evil and the tornado is quite scary and it is amazing to see how well they filmed such a thing 70 years ago.  You can now see all the backdrops closely and every small detail is crisp.  But the true magic occurs of course when Dorothy exits the house into Munchinland.  As the first shot slowly pans over the entire area everything is striking.  The water in the lake ripples in a bright blue, the brown tops of the hut are beautiful.  Bottom line, you can see every little tiny spec of every object, person or scenery.  Glinda's dress glitters spectacularly.  And the ruby slippers glimmer throughout the entire film.  From this point on I was awestruck till the end.  The green makeup on the wicked witch is so menacing and to see Dorothy, the scarecrow, tinman and the lion in bluray allows you to see how exquisitely their costumes were made.  You see every mark of rust on the tin man.  Bottom line, the whole techniclor part radiates in brilliant colors and never falters.  I could describe the whole film but the thing is the entire film is so amazingly improved that with every scene the clarity allows you to see things you never noticed in previous versions of this film.And the boxed set.  Just read in the item description all you get.  The box is emerald geeen and very sturdy like a magical treasure chest.  The keepsakes including the book and the watch are priceless.  And the features and extras included are worth the price alone.  At least 5 different versions of THE WIZARD OF OZ made over time, the 6 hour documentary MGM: When the Lion Roars and a wonderful WIZARD OF OZ documentary narrated by Angela Lansbury.  Many have thought their set was flawed because the extra on disc 2 THE DREAMER OF OZ has video that is so dreadful that it could easily be mistaken as a flawed disc.  This is a 1990 film starring John Ritter.  I resarched many reviews and the release data of this set and the quality of this is known and not an error.  One review stated:  The Dreamer of Oz (SD, Disc 2, 92 minutes): This 1990 NBC Baum biopic stars the late John Ritter as Baum, Annette O'Toole as his dutiful wife, and Rue McClanahan as her mother. Awful video quality aside (the transfer looks as if it's meant to be viewed with 3-D glasses), this Finding Neverland precursor is a decent, if not unnecessary addition to the set that will nevertheless please completists to no end.This set has so many extras I am thrilled and the blu ray movie takes a movie that is already magical and without taking away its purity makes it a brilliant masterpiece.  With the separate sepia and technicolor sections this film is a perfect one to use as an exalmple of the excellence of blu ray.  This is a must have.  Dorothy has never touched your heart as much as she will with the clarity of blu ray.	5.0	Pure magic in an amazing box set	2009-10-16	6	6	0

I just watched the thing last month for probably the one billionth time and I sit there with a big smile on my face like a little kid no matter how many times I see it. I sit there, I make myself popcorn, I recite all the lines, I sing all the songs, I get amazed at how clear the color is, I look at how pretty Judy Garland is, I rewind the Over The Rainbow part so I could watch it again because no one on Earth sounds as beautiful as Judy Garland is when she sings that song, I laugh at the Cowardly Lion every single time, I cheer for Toto when he runs away, I boo the Witch, and I get mad at the mean old Wizard every single time without fail. The time you spend as a youth seems like it lasts forever but its very fleeting, and it isn't long before you have to join the Real World and pay bills and deal with nutty significant others and get jobs - but every time I watch The Wizard of Oz it just makes me so damned happy and I feel like a little kid when its on.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	"Ah, the Wizard of Oz.  Who HASN'T seen this movie?  This is probably the best movie ever.  Seriously.  The ""best movie ever"".  How many times have people said such and such is the best thing ever?  More times than we can count, for sure.  But in this case, there's honestly a lot of truth to it.What makes this movie so good?  How about I start with the less obvious things?  I actually started admiring tornadoes and having urges to become a storm chaser because of this film.  Now, whenever a major storm is in the forecast and the entire day feels hot and humid before the thunder clouds start rolling in, I feel the excitement for what lies ahead later that evening.  I feel that rush that I felt when I first watched the tornado hit Dorothy's farm in the movie.  The build-up to that tornado scene, the wind blowing everything around, the excitement, the horror... just fantastic acting all around by ALL the characters in the movie during this scene.The OTHER reason this is probably the best movie ever is because of the adventurous feel to the entire main storyline.  You get to see Dorothy walk down a yellow brick road and discover LOTS of mysterious creatures along the way while watching a beautiful scenery?  What does THIS remind me of?  Oh yeah, being a little kid and walking through forests, collecting salamanders near the streams, discovering deer paths to walk through, and finding raspberry stems along my way for whenever I get hungry... all while walking my dog for a nice bit of exercise and a breath of fresh air.I NEVER forget memories like that, and the Wizard of Oz perfectly captures the refreshing thrill of excitement when we were young and willing to explore, and to be adventurous and free.  The Wizard of Oz strikes me on a more personal level than it does most people probably, but I can't help it- this is just a really good movie, the kind that sticks with you for the rest of our lives.So the Wizard of Oz hits me on a personal level,  no doubt about it."	5.0	wizard of brilliance	2009-05-27	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2T74RP19O2K4Q	Ben	"a musical.  It is so much more.  Yes, Judy Garland sings ""Over The Rainbow"" and it truly is the definitive version (well, there are 2 definitive versions and both rendered by Garland; Oz and Carnegie Hall).The film is a profound documentary in and of itself of the power of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer circa 1939.  The wild use of Technicolor, the catchy songs of Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg.  The horrifying (to children and yes, to some adults) witch, the over-the-top Glinda.  The Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion.  You know their names, so there is no need for me to rave about them (even though I want to!!!).MGM had never attempted such a spectacle on this grand of a scale ever before in their 15 year history.  (Look at ""Ben Hur"" (1925), ""He Who Gets Slapped"" (1924), ""The Wind"" (1925) or such 30's crowd pleasers as ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), ""Dinner At Eight"" (1933) or the hugely over-rated ""The Women"" (1939).  And MGM released ""Gone With The Wind"" (1939), they didn't produce it.This production was a near impossible feat for MGM, yet everyone involved kept working at it and obviously believed in it.  This was a film so very far removed from the typical MGM product.The acting of the young star is incredible, still allowing the goosebumps and lump in the throat oh so many years later.  I never tire of seeing this film.One of the stories surrounding this classic is the near-deletion of ""Over The Rainbow"", supposedly because it slowed up the film.  Now available on YouTube, however, is a reprise of the song which Garland sings while trapped in the witche's castle.  (I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!).  She chokes out the words and is obviously very upset.  I think it may have been this reprise of the song that got the axe.  Sadly, no film footage of this scene has come down to us."	5.0	It really isnt	2012-07-16	3	2	1

She returns home just in time for a tornado to whisk her away to another land in another time what she believes would have been safer for her dog.The screen changes from Brown white monochrome to glorious color as she meets new friends that seem familiar and has adventures that lead her to believe that there is no place like home.Seems like everybody and their bliss forgot about the original dilemma of what to do with poor Toto.The film now a bit dated is a classic and it is imperative that you have a copy on your shelf. You may even find yourself taking it down periodically to watch.-----------------------------------------------------I like to restrict my review to just the movie itself. However there are those people that are interested in all the extra goodies in the add-ons and commentaries in adjustments and whatnot of all the special versions in capabilities of today's technology. You can choke on with ""The Wizard of Oz (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Digital Copy and Amazon Exclusive Set of 4 Collectible 8x10 Character Posters) [Blu-ray]"" version. If I were to gain were discussed every extra goody in this package it would take pages. Of course there are the usual commentaries and then some extra commentaries there is the audio and then there's the music effect track. There is the sing along, and extras, and the trailers, and additional footage. Today more than little techie stuff there is even the BD-live option. You might find a larger package but not techier package.I'll bet you donuts to dollars that before this review is obsolete someone will complain that this is not the widescreen version.For me and don't take this in a negative way the high definition allowed me to see Dorothy freckles but at the same time allow me to realize that Judy Garland was much too old for the part."	5.0	We're off to see the Wizard and then some.	2009-10-04	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2VNHNS58QI0NO	"Betty L. Wilkins ""star gazer"""	This is the classic that everyone refers to when comparing stories from Oz. This is one I sincerely hope they let stand as it is, as remaking movies seems to be the rage these days. Yes, no doubt they could remake it, but it would never stand up to the energy of the original and no doubt lose a lot in translation despite the flash of current CGI. These were classic characters and with all the flaws of the moviemaking industry at the time, did a wonderful job of creating the Land of Oz. I think some things should remain as they are, to show future generations of the past, as well as keep alive a wonderful tale, a fairytale story that didn't generate in Europe, or anywhere else, but was created right here in America.	5.0	Beyond the Rainbow...	2013-05-03	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A11HTL4CPR5PAU	"BEVERLEY ""Patrick"""	"Here's an amazing thing you can do with this DVD. You will need a copy of 'Dark Side of the Moon' by Pink Floyd. Set your CD player to REPEAT : ALL. Don't panic if you can't do this. Push play and then pause on the CD player so it is paused at the start. When the BLACK & WHITE MGM LION roars for the THIRD time, press play. You will know if you have done it right if the keyboard comes in at the exact same moment as the credit for Mervyn LeRoy comes up.There will follow a series of incredible coincidences between the music and the film. For example, the line ""Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry"" coincides with a shot of two farmhands smiling and one crying, in the next line the word ""touch"" coincides exactly with Dorothy touching a farmhand's arm, and after the line ""When at last the work is done"" a farmhand hits his hand with a hammer exactly on the drumbeat, and for the time being, his work is done. Also watch out for the tornado scene (with ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", track four). Seriously, try it. It's amazing. The coincidences carry on right through the film!When the CD finishes, if it is on REPEAT : ALL, it will repeat, and the coincidences carry on.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3J2FKBWL0XJFA	Bill C.	L. Frank Baum never made an Oz film with Oliver Hardy as the Tin Man. That Mr. Baum past away in 1919. Baum's son made the Hardy film but it is more accurate to refer to the youngster as (I believe) L. Frank Baum Jr (though he actually had a slightly different name than his screen one). The films the original L. Frank Baum made were Patchwork Girl of Oz and so on all before 1920.On other matters.I don't think enough praise goes to the superbly talented head of MGM at the time of the '39 Oz. I am speaking of course of Louis B. Mayer. Next OZ dvd set should praise him more.	5.0	To poster Alan Montgomery	2006-01-29	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1G9O5ETRW8EXZ	Bill	This is my favorite movie of all time.  When I finally got a DVD player, this is one of the first DVDs I bought.  I have seen many of the outtakes, deleted scenes, and the documentary with Angela Lansbury about the making of The Wizard Of Oz, which are all included in the DVD.  However, what impressed me most was an audio-only supplement of rehearsal recordings and outtakes.  There are so many of these that are very interesting.  Also included are two MGM radio shows from 1939, touting the movie.  This is well worth the cost of the DVD.  The only thing I wonder is if the people who preserved the audio recordings so well would have preserved the deleted video footage, we would have all found some precious gems.	5.0	One of the greatest....better on DVD!	2001-05-29	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1MTAVCU7TD076	Billy Clarke	I have seen this movie more times than any other. (I watch it sparingly now as I don't want to cheapen the experience. As If!). In the movies, on video, (many different versions), and now on DVD. Each time it is a new experience. The DVD version has introduced a new dimension to this great film. The picture quality is astounding as is the sound. Everything is so much more in your face and that's how it should be with this kind of movie. It's like sniffing a bouquet of flowers for the first time since last spring and realising that summer is just around the corner. I love this film. This is not 'ET', or 'The Sound Of Music', or 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. This is - &quot; OZ! The Great And Powerful&quot;. It really IS that big a film and it deserves the respect that it commands as one of the very biggest movies of all time. For me it is! The cast are loveable and you really do feel like a kid again just by sharing this wonderful experience with them. Be it for the first time, or the 100th or beyond. I feel like I've just been home when I watch this movie. And you know what the motto is - &quot;There's No Place Like home!&quot; If you are wondering about the extras on this DVD there are no worries. It is full of extracts and outtakes and cast information. The 'Jitterbug' rehearsal, behind the scenes home  movie footage is present too. A great insight as to what might have been in the movie. Please don't be put off by the fact that the soundtrack for the 'Jitterbug' is not the recording of the cast members (Judy Garland etc!). This is a vocal coach recording that was used to play over this silent film. As this is an outake and has nothing to do with the actual finished film no one should complain. However it would have been nice to have had the original cast sing the song as in the '50th VHS Anniversary Edition'. The DVD deserves 5 Stars. 'OZ' is timeless. No one should be dissapointed with what we get as as 'EXTRAS' on this release.  After all that is what they are. For example - Angela Lansburys 'OZ' Documentary'. Great stuff!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AJDQ5EBQNDGLF	Bob L	"Let me start by saying if you have never seen this movie, no matter what your age, you haven't lived. It is a thing of wonderment. Really, there is nothing else like it. Though it's made for all ages, it can be a little intense for the very young. The Flying Monkeys still freak my wife out at the age of 38.There were lots of great studios. Warner Bros., RKO, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Universal and Metro Goldwyn Mayer. MGM's real heyday was in the Silent Era. The overall results of their efforts in the Sound Era (at least in the thirties which was the golden years of the movie studios) didn't really come up to the standards of the other studios, despite their lofty production values. The exceptions to this were very big exceptions to say the least. The main ones were Dinner at Eight, Grand Hotel, Greta Garbo's films, Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. These few direct hits make up for a world of misses.The Wizard of Oz by itself is enough for a studio to base its entire reputation. Having it and Gone With the Wind released in the same year and that year, 1939 being the greatest year of the Golden Age, is probably THE greatest achievement in Hollywood.Frank L. Baum's story has definitely been ""Hollywoodized"" in the best tradition. The formula has been worked again and again by Andrew Lloyd Webber, without the same results. Baum's tale has been turned into a musical with ""Oh My"" Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Vaudville's Bert Lahr and in place of originally slated Buddy Ebsen, Jack Haley carrying the tuneful load and doing a marvelous job. This is near the top of the ""best"" fantasy films, musicals, kid's movies and over all greatest movies of all time. Not to mention it's very funny and has a truckload of charm. It can be argued that Somewhere Over the Rainbow is the single greatest song ever. It can't be argued that Judy Garland did it better that anyone ever did or ever will. It is one truly classic moment in a truly classic movie. Frank Morgan, Billie Burke and the ""little people"" are all excellent as is the Arlen and Harburg score. Special mention must made of Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West that would have won the Oscar in any other year.The prologue at the beginning of the movie says it a milliom times better than I ever could, so start up the movie and i'll...See you over the Rainbow"	5.0	There's no place like home	2004-10-25	3	3	0

For example, you could see every blade of hay blow by during the twister scene.  It's just a wonderful movie, excellent pacing, heartwarming songs.  I'm 56 years old, but once again I'm 8 years old after watching this.  The DVD also offers outtakes, bios and the making of the movie which I found fascinating.  I still get misty-eyed watching it after all these years.  I really don't see anything wrong with the DVD transfer.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A36AH31X84FIC8	Brent Hilton	I just  love the way this picture looks for a 70 year old picture, time and care were taken in restore this classic film.  What a wonderful transfer of this film you can see things that you could'nt with the other releases of this film. and the  extras are just wonderful , with one exception, the tv special of the Dreamer Of Oz was'nt transfer very good so it's slightly blurry,too bad because it's a great special on  the life Mr. Baum told through the eyes of his wife. i mean you can still watch it and enjoy, i just wish they would've transferred it better, other than that problem, the Set is fine.  and yes it in it original Fullscreen format, since it never was a widescreen film in  the first place. Buy without a care, The Wizard Of Oz Was Meant for Blu Ray. relive the adventure with Dorothy and Toto , Scarecrow, Tin Man and The Lion , plus The Witch.Highly Recommended.	5.0	Wonderful Wizard Set	2010-10-20	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K	"brewster22 ""brewster22"""	It's nearly impossible for me to write objectively about the quality of &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; so bundled up is it with associations from my childhood.  It's like trying to do a critical analysis of &quot;Star Wars.&quot;  Sorry, can't be done---at least, not by me.&quot;Oz&quot; is such a strange movie, in some ways so creaky and old-fashioned, in other ways so incredibly ahead of its time.  Few films I've seen during my lifetime have such a complete vision as &quot;Oz&quot; does---such painstaking care went into the look and design of the film; it's as if the filmmakers really did create a whole other world for this film to take place in.  It's odd that during a time in American film history, when movies were being cranked out like cars on an assembly line, a film could feel like such an auteurish product (increasingly odd, since the credited director, Victor Fleming, actually shared directing duties with several others.  The same is true for &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; released in the same year and also bearing Fleming's name as sole director.  He was quite a lucky guy in 1939).The plot and feeling of &quot;Oz&quot; veers quite a bit from that of the book on which it is based.  The book is much nastier and darker, but the film manages its fair share of grimness for all that.  The Wicked Witch is spectacularly scary (Margaret Hamilton admits to regretting the intensity with which she approached this character) as are the Flying Monkeys.  There's such a feeling of ominous dread underlaying this entire film.  As if the land of Oz is a bit too beautiful and perfect, like a perfectly ripe piece of fruit that at any moment can begin to rot at the edges.Really, despite her scariness, the Witch is the most fun character in the film---it's really a riot to watch this film as an adult and enjoy her sarcasm and nastiness; it's refreshing as juxtaposed to the goody goodiness of the other characters.  Frank Morgan in a variety of roles is also great.A cloud of darkness has come to surround this film over the last couple of decades, due to the urban legends about the stagehand supposedly caught on film hanging himself and the truly bizarre stories about the arduous process of making the film (and the many accidents and tragedies that occurred along the way).  This reputation may be responsible for the cult status that has arisen around this film and perhaps even for elevating it to the level of admiration it has received.On a side note, an excellent book by Gregory Maguire called &quot;Wicked&quot; offers back story to the events leading up to &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; and most particulary focuses on the early life of the Wicked Witch of the West.  It's an outstanding book, and I venture that you won't be able to watch &quot;Oz&quot; in quite the same way again after reading it.Grade: A-	4.0	This One Takes Me Back	2003-08-20	1	1	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1Y2IXV18WESTM	Brian A. Kates	The greatest thing about this DVD is that it includes nearly the entire original score of the film (background music.)  Many people own the  classic Wizard of Oz  &quot;original soundtrack&quot; which was a quick-paced, heavily edited assembly of dialogue and songs--cute, but certainly not what folks have considered a &quot;soundtrack album&quot; for the last 3 decades. The ACTUAL musical score -- a serious work of art in its own right -- has never been available, to my knowledge, until 64 years later with this DVD.  Words cannot describe what a revelation it is to hear Harold Arlen's score naked in its unedited form. Its thematic intricacy is shocking even if you think you're familiar with the score already, and the marathon endurance of the performers in the orchesetra is incredible as you hear take after take. To any serious Wizard of Oz fan this is required listening -- exciting enough to merit it own CD release.	5.0	FINALLY: The score has arrived!	2003-02-16	3	1	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2ZWUKQ0JL75NI	"Brian T. Waldvogel ""nobrainer"""	I posted some corrections but was unable to explain why I had not checked the black and white box with color.  The original premiere and release of the film showed all the Kansas scenes in sepia tones, not black and white. This DVD brings back those original &quot;colors&quot; of the first release and subsequent release in the 1940's.From 1956 to 1988 all releases had the Kansas scenes shown in black and white. The 1989 50th anniversary video release restored the sepia color.All theatrical re-releases, television viewings, and video releases since then have the scenes back in the sepia tones, including the many issues of LaserDiscs that were mastered long before this DVD.I just wish we had all the outtakes, behind the scenes footage and photos, screen tests and other neat stuff like the LaserDisc versions had.I have not looked at the new DVD so perhaps that was finally done.  Also, the premiere version was eleven minutes longer in 1939 and was cut before the public release.	4.0	The Wizard of Oz - Original DVD Release of 1997	2001-03-06	3	3	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1GB0HW46Y2EB	Bruce G. Taylor	"The first time I saw this was in a local theater during a re-release sometime in the 1950's, I think.  This was before it became a perennial favorite on TV.  I bought it (much later) on Laserdisc which was pretty well done for its time.  The first DVD  issue was a complete misfire from the standpoint of video quality.  The second was very good.  The third DVD issue, I didn't bother with.  The Blu-ray is quite stunning and although in some shots a certain amount of grain is visible, which is to be expected, the over-all impression is delightful.  More than ever, you can now clearly see where the sets end and the painted back-drops begin, but,  at the same time,  the artistic and technical genius that went into this picture is more obvious.  The great video quality notwithstanding, I was most pleased by the improvement in the audio quality of this issue.  For a soundtrack originally recorded in the late 1930's, it's pretty impressive.I was glad that the audio feature called ""Jukebox"" was included consisting of test recordings and various takes for different musical parts of the movie.  You get the impression that in those days there was little allowance for wasted time during recording sessions.  After a take with only the orchestra, the conductor says: ""That stinks! Come on, stay on your toes boys. Let's watch it!""  It also becomes clear as to how the speeded up voices for the Munchkins could be combined with the orchestra playing in its standard pitch.  Not an easy task in a time when magnetic tape was not yet available.Overall an excellent presentation of a brilliant film."	5.0	Wizard a Real Joy in Blu-ray	2009-12-17	3	3	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AKBKTA49ZTT2T	Bruce	What else is there to say about this classic film that hasn't already been said? That it has been declared a National Treasure just about says it all. So let's talk about the DVD itself. If you love this movie (and who on the planet doesn't?), the DVD's special features offer a veritable banquet of behind-the-scenes information and outtakes. It starts with the documentary about the film, warmly hosted by the wonderful Angela Lansbury, and includes a fascinating audio program of some of the original recording sessions, including several takes of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, and amazing segments of Munchkin songs--hear how the voices sound BEFORE they were sped up to create the now classic Munchkin chirps. One Munchkin voice is also the familiar voice of Disney's Goofy, unmistakeable when heard at normal speed, but virtually indetectable when played at Munchkin speed.

The test shot of the tornado approaching Dorothy's house appears totally surreal out  of context.The screen tests of the cast members in different make-up  styles...very interesting.Production notes and cost estimate logs (in  case you ever wondered how much that tornado cost).Trailers, new and  old, since the film's release.Clips from earlier silent productions of  Oz, which you probably won't see anywhere else.etc., etc., etc.It's  amazing ANY of this survived, considering the film was a critical failure  upon it's release.THIS is the Oz to own.

We all know the story of Dorothy and Toto being swept away in their home by a tornado. When they land they kill the wicked witch of the East with the house. The wicked witch of the West blames Dorothy and wants the ruby slippers she magically gained from the witch she killed. Margaret Hamiliton's line ""I'll get you, my pretty! And your little dog, too!"" is burned indellibly into my brain. As a child she was quite frightening. In order to get home Dorothy is told to ""follow the yellow brick road"" to Oz by the Munchkins. Along the way she meets a Scarecrow without a brain, Tin Man without heart, and Lion without courage in a forest full of ""Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!"". They all discover they already have what they need, and all they have to do is believe in themselves. Interesting that the author L. Frank Baum felt this way, that magic should not be relied on for the benefit of children, when in fact in his story it took magic to get Dorothy to Oz and back. Was it my hearing or did it sound like the witches soldiers were singing ""Or-e-o, Oreo""? Maybe they liked Nabisco cookies.Baum's fifteen Oz books are a wonderful read and contain many other magical creatures not in the movie. This particular DVD set not only has what the three disc set features, but it has been totally restored by Warner Home Video and contains a ship load more of extras on two more DVDs. The extras? Well I wish I could tell you but Warner hasn't released them yet for this five disc set. It will obviously contain the orginal commentary, documentary, stills, and whatever else they felt necessary to earn this higher price tag for this five disc set. The original three disc DVD sets can be found still and those extras are listed. If you are a big fan of this movie I recommend this set which will contain some collectables per press releases. Granted they won't have the value of the original lobby cards, but they will still be worth having. Excellent quality restored movie picture and sound. Excellent replayability. No DVD library is complete without ""The Wizard of Oz"". For many years prior to VHS tapes and DVD this movie was televised once a year. Families gathered around the TV set typically on a Sunday afternoon to watch it. Keep the tradition alive and gather the family once a year to revisit this classic. If you enjoyed this catch ""Princess Bride"". Although the price is a bit steep, Warner is charging the same forGone with the Wind (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] as well so I have pre-ordered Oz.CA Luster"	5.0	The Wizard of Oz (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]	2009-03-18	17	4	13
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	We sometimes forget that access-on-demand to classic films is something that is relatively recent. I still remember as a child when the once-a-year broadcast of the Wizard of Oz on CBS was a big event. And it was 1976 - 37 years after it was filmed - before Gone with the Wind was televised at all. However, in my humble opinion, Warner has done all that they can do for both of these landmark films as far as extras and quality go in the case of standard DVD.I own the three disc edition of the Wizard of Oz, and from my standpoint it is perfect. It is practically a Wizard of Oz Museum in a Box. The picture is as good as it is going to get without going to Blu-ray, so why is Warner Bros. doing this? The only answer I can come up with is that they are looking for a sure fire revenue generator in tough economic times.Here is the content of the three disc set in case you doubt me:DVD Features:Audio Commentary:Commentary by John Fricke and multiple cast and crew members.Biographies:We Haven't Really Met Properly - includes 9 orginal cast biographiesDeleted Scenes:If I Only Had a Brain; If I Only Had a Heart; Triumphal Return to Emerald City; Over the Rainbow; The JitterbugDocumentaries:L.

The box and Bluray case looks real but the bluray case didn't have the normal plastic wrap and the security tape that holds the case together. the Disc's look good but two of three disc's are empty which means that they don't have anything on them. My bluray player kept kicking the disc's out. The third disc played but it was fuzzy not high quality like something I could transfer from VHS to DVD. As I checked the Disc they look clear like my empty CD's I checked my normal DVD and you can see that the disc has been scribed these two ""FAKE"" DVD's have not been scribed.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A33RDFYADJUYJQ	C. Clark	Probably the greatest children's/family film ever made is The Wizard of Oz.  Everyone of my generation can remember the yearly ritual of watching it on TV, as American as watching the Super Bowl or something.  But it is  even better on this DVD thanks to fantastic color and excellent special  features.  In fact it is probably the most packed-to-the-gills DVD I've  ever seen, special feature wise, even if the menu is a bit temperamental at  the outset (DVD makers need to start putting menus exclusively on dark  backgrounds so you can clearly see your choices highlighted, by the way).The making-of-documentary is quite good.  Going into detail about  casting choices, costume development, problems with cumbersome costumes,  and the special effects tricks being revealed--why, the movie was truly  like the Star Wars of its day.  In fact, I think the tornado effect still  holds up (i.e. the one in the background while Dorothy is trying to get  into the shelter while the wind is blowing like crazy).  The lady who  played the Wicked Witch is actually quite funny in real life, as she  recounts when the producer said she would be the witch.  &quot;The  witch?&quot; she asks.  &quot;Yeah, what else?&quot; he replies.I  believe every home collection should have the finest examples of films in  any genre, so this one definitely belongs.	5.0	Belongs in everyone's collection for its magic	2000-07-15	14	13	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A13MM94OD9HMEO	"C. Frederick ""bigswell"""	I couldn't wait for my kiddo to be old enough to see this movie. A wonderful children's classic from a time when sassy, disrespectful dialogue, rudeness as a matter of course, and immodest clothing were unheard of in children's entertainment. The original Wizard of Oz film, while lacking in racial/cultural sensitivity, is still imaginative, creative, and miraculous for its lack of digital visual effects.I am one sentimental fool but the same pure raw talent young Judy Garland displays in this innocent role brings tears to my eyes in the same way that hearing early stripped down recordings of Michael Jackson as a child puts a lump in my throat. She is miraculous in this role.We purchased this to stream over broadband. It wasn't crystal clear for a good 40% of the film (showed digital compression artifacts and blurry images). It would stall occasionally. This is probably not Amazon's fault but due to our location in a rural area. Not a deal breaker for me. Spring for the DVD if you're not needing instant Oz gratification.	4.0	Classic, wonderful film. Streaming over broadband - pretty good.	2013-07-30	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2OTT4J4JLCL1G	"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory"""	I grew up in a time where the Wizard of Oz was shown once every year near the holiday season. Much like a Charlie Brown Christmas this is one of my fondest childhood memories/traditions. The movie speaks for itself so I'll comment on the gift set. The book is really nice with great photos/information, the print is great and is frameable but since it's part of a collector's set I doubt anyone is really going to take it out of the box except to look at it. You get the blu ray with the regular 2d move as well as 3d and a dvd version as well, you also get a bonus feature with tons of extras as well as many extras on the main disc itself. There is also a bonus dvd of the Warner Bros. story with Patrick Stewart narrating.you also get three pins one each for the three heroes. One is for courage, one is fore a heart, and the other is the diploma representing intelligence. You also get a very nicely bound journal with a nice cover and beautifully illustrated cover page. However since this is for a collection, who would actually use the journal? It might have been better if it would have been a faux journal written by Dorothy detailing her adventures in oz. Of course I have read the novels so I know in the novels it wasn't just a dream as in the movie, but it would have been nice if the journal would have touched on her further adventures as well. You also get a mazp of Oz, which is a treat for fans of the movies as well as fans of the books.Included here is a usb drive that looks like the Wicked Witch's legs. This is an amazon exclusive...so it's best to buy this set here.there is also a companion book that I would suggest you buy, it has tons of information on the making of the movie as well as tons of pictures. Some of the info overlaps with the book in this set as well as includes information you might hear in the documentaries, but it's very nice and includes a lot of little inserts that are great. Such as the death notice for the Wicked Witch. it was a rather strange addition to a story that's delighted kids for ages, but I guess if any child gets scared at night thinking about the witch you can just show him or her the paper.:)Overall a great addition to any movie library with great collectibles. a must have for any fan of the movie.One last note, I see sometimes on Amazon that people will give the product low stars for something damaged in shipment or something the manufacturers screwed up. This is a forum for people wanting to know about the products not about a bad experience with an order. I will add that I did have an issue with this order, and Amazon took care of me, as they always do. That's why I purchase so much from Amazon. You are always  guaranteed the best customer service.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3EHD2IZEYRU25	Chad Wilson	As a kid I always awaited that time when The Wizard of Oz would play on TV. Me and my brother would stare transfixed at the TV all during the  movie. And when I started my video collection this was the first movie  bought. Judy Garland gives a spectaculer performance as Dorthey Gale an  orphaned girl living on her Auntie Em &amp; Uncle Henry's farm with her dog  Toto. Dorthey dreams of flying over the rainbow to a land where there are  no worries or troubles. She gets her wish when a tornado whisks her, Toto,  &amp; even her Kansas farmhouse over the rainbow to the land of Oz. There  she meets munchkins, a cowerdly lion, a talking scarecrow, &amp; a tinman  without a heart.By the advice of Glinda the Good Witch of the North  (Billie Burke) Dorthey follows the Yellow Brick Road to ask the Wizard of  Oz to go home, Glinda also places the powerful ruby slippers on Dorthey's  feet which attracts the attention on the Wicked Witch of the West (Margeret  Hamilton) to follow her. On the way down the Yellow Brick Road Dorthey  befriends a Scarecrow who longs to have brains, a tinman who wishes he had  a heart, &amp; a cowardly lion who'd give anything to have courage. With  these new friends Dorthey reaches the Emerald City were they ask the Wizard  of Oz to grant thier wishes  instead the wizard tells them to bring back  the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West and then he well grant their  wishes. And from that point the story gets exciting when the four go  searching for the castle of the Wicked Witch.The movie was followed by  a sequel made by Disney which was a total disgrace to MGM's 1939 classic.	5.0	The Greatest Movie Ever Made!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AIFBK1PBWBWV5	Charles F. Dransfield	"With each re-release of The Wizard of Oz, I keep wishing that  someone would locate a rare episode of Sesame Street from the mid 1970's in which Margaret Hamilton recreated her role of the Wicked Witch and include a clip of it in the supplementary section.  I vividly remember seeing this episode as a child and would love to watch it again.  In the premise, the Wicked Witch was flying over Sesame Street when her broomstick slipped out from under her and landed on Mr. Hooper's storefront.  She could not return to Oz without it and was in a quandry.  To the witch's great chagrin, Mr. Hooper refused to give the broomstick  back to her until she learned proper manners and asked politely.  It just about killed the witch to have to say, ""Please.""Well into her seventies at the time, Miss Hamilton clearly loved recreating her iconic role and played it to the hilt.  I do hope that the video tape still exists and one day will be found.  It is absolutely historic.There was also a charming episode of Mr. Rodger's neighborhood in which Miss Hamilton also guest starred.  On camera, she put on her witch's costume piece by piece and loving reminded children that the role of the witch was only an imaginary character in a motion picture and they should not be frightened by her."	5.0	Ultimate Is The Word	2009-10-24	3	2	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A142W8NH9SRXS0	"Chay Chay Walker ""DVD and book reviewer"""	"This is a true Hollywood classic. Normally seen as a children's film, it is also a splendid joy for adults, as well. Who can forget the catchphrase ""there's no place like home"" or some of the songs-""Over the Rainbow,"" ""Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead"" and a few others?In case you just came to Earth because you lived on Mars for your entire life, the story is about a lonely Kansas girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland-her most famous role)who hits her head in the middle of a tornado. She then has a dream that she is in the magical land of Oz, and tries to get to a Wizard to go home. She ends up making friends with a man out of tin, a lion and a scarecrow all who want things from the Wizard too. There is a witch in the way, however, and things get worse when they get to the Wizard and he wants them to kill the witch.The movie, made in Hollywood's Golden Year 1939, was one of the first in Technicolor and it is probably the most glorious use of color in a movie I have ever seen. When Dorothy first gets to Oz...it's one of the best moments in movie history. The acting-Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Billie Burke and the biggest assembly of ""little people"" ever recorded-is great and you have to love some of the ""little"" characters, the Munchkins especially."	5.0	There's No Place Like Home...	2005-02-01	6	5	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3QIW6ULPIPM2V	Chip Kaufmann	While this set is a dream come true for fans of the 1939 WIZARD OF OZ, it is even more so for those of us who have waited for years to see quality prints of the various silent film versions especially the 1925 feature directed by and starring Larry Semon. This version (along with ones made in 1910 and 1914) has long been available only in substandard editions that feature  copies taken from a worn, faded 16mm print with terrible music and voiceover narration of the intertitles. Turner Entertainment/Warner Home Video has not only given us a beautifully restored print with silent film tints and proper speed correction, but they have also given us an appropriate new score from Robert Israel which goes a long way in enhancing the viewing experience.While this version cannot compare (I give it 3 stars) with the 1939 film, it does have a lot to offer for the silent film enthusiast. Director Larry Semon who plays the Scarecrow was one of the top silent comics of the early 1920's. It was he who gave Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy their first big breaks. In fact Hardy plays the Tin Man here. Semon was known for his outrageous large scale sight gags and frenetic chase sequences which made his movies very expensive to produce. This WIZARD (just like the ones before it) was a financial flop and brought about the end of Semon's career. He died in 1928 at the age of only 39 and virtually all of his films were forgotten.As you watch this movie, try and put all thoughts of the 1939 version aside and think of this as an amiable fantasy featuring the L. Frank Baum characters with heavy doses of slapstick thrown in (it is a silent comedy after all). Under those conditions you'll find the 1925 version has a lot to offer especially in this gorgeous new transfer. The 1910 and 1914 films which are much closer in spirit to the OZ books (Baum himself produced the 1914 versions) have never looked this good before. Neither has the 1939 version. And so you have it, a collector's edition that lives up to its name and is worth the money. Check out other reviews for descriptions of the 1939 film and all the many extras that come with this set. OZ lovers rejoice and silent film fans do the same for now we have something to celebrate. Five stars all the way.	5.0	This Review Pertains To The 1925 Version On DVD 3.	2005-11-01	7	5	2
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AIYPZWGGSUSP6	Chip P.	"If you love the movie ""The Wizard of Oz,"" then get this, this is the best version since the theatrical release in 1939! This wonderful Blu-Ray DVD version fulfills your vision for why you bought that big TV and Blu-Ray player in the first place! Now it all pays off!If you have children, even 2 or 3 year olds, give them the wonderful world of Oz. This is an all time favorite for all ages, but just so special for children.This is also a favorite of almost all adults! Oz makes all viewers feel young again, their breath baited and their eyes glistening with fantastical wonder, suspense, and adventure! Now I'm going to buy another one!This Blu-Ray version was specially prepared from the original archive film negative. They worked wonders and made what seems a completely different, and perfect presentation of: ""The Wizard of Oz!"" This Blu-Ray disk makes all the previous VHS tapes & DVDs of the 1939 Oz seem pathetic and meaningless by comparison. It is that good!They got the entire movie on one disk, so you don't have to lose the continuity of experience when the thing stops with ""Insert Disk 2"" on the TV, get up, eject, swap, load, play, go back and sit down. I hate that, but this is all on one disk with no interruptions! Yea!The ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" has 4 DVDs and several extras. You'll love all the history and information in the ""Behind the Curtain"" book, the ""Campaign Book,"" the studio's Oz production expense accounting sheet. Then there's the 'other Oz productions' DVD from 1910 - 1914 - 1925 - 1933 & 1990. They include the 6 hour ""MGM: When the Lion Roars"" DVD, a wonder tour through the decades and the thousands of MGM movies. Also they include the ""Bonus Digital Copy"" DVD, for your computer or iPod or iPhone. And let's not forget to mention the cool 'art deco' wrist watch!Yea, you get all that great stuff!I recommend this product with my whole heart, and all my enthusiasm!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A396SBGKAOLTZE	Chris Aldridge	For me, 'The Wizard of Oz' was a family ritual. It was so imbedded in my childhood that it was no longer a movie- due to its annual pilgrimage on television. Strangely enough, I didn't first see it on CBS. That network's contract with the film lasted from 1956 until 1967 (I was only five then), and NBC contracted the movie until 1975- after which it went back to CBS where it ran until Turner scooped it up. I watched it during the NBC period and it was always introduced with the logo of the 'living color' peacock- but with a special reminder that the first nineteen or so minutes were in black and white. We would bookmark the TV guide to make sure we didn't miss it. It was always a spring broadcast, airing on or near Easter Sunday. And when the tornado sequence ended with the house crashing down, you could hear a pin drop in our living room. My favorite part of the film- since I was five- is watching the film change from b/w to the color of Munchkinland all in one shot. I used to think Munchkinland was a real place, with its rich colors, dometop huts, the footbridge, the lily pond, the big glossy flowers and the spiraling yellow-and-copper brick road. (I saw the film years later as a college senior in a theater, and this scene actually brought whistles and applause from the audience.) I later got a DVD player as a gift and the first DVD edition of the movie was included. This is the only way to see a film of this scope.	5.0	Still magical after 64 years.	2003-03-10	4	4	0

Truly, this series was the ""Harry Potter"" of its day. Within just a few years of the 1900 publication of the first book, there were several sequels, a Broadway musical, a series of traveling plays and, as we see in this boxed set, even a movie that premired in 1910!But what most people are familiar with is this movie. The 1939 version of ""The Wizard of Oz"". Judy Garland was far older than Dorothy, but still managed to do an excellent job playing her. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow was unforgettable, as was the Wicked Witch of the West, played with cackling glee by Margaret Hamilton. They, along with the other actors, the incredible set design, the wonderful music and the bright, cheerful Technocolor fantasy combined to make this a truly iconic film.I wonder to myself what audiences felt about this movie in 1939? It's my understanding that it didn't have the best box office performance. It didn't do well at the Oscars. Perhaps it just stood out to many as being TOO bright and cheerful, given the events unfolding in Europe when the movie was released.Regardless, by now its a timeless classic. I remember when I was a kid watching CBS broadcast the film annually, and since then have caught it from time-to-time on TCM (aka: Ted Turner's penance for inflicting colorization on the world). The film has been around for my entire life, and I'm pleased to see that after two previous attempts, it finally got a DVD worthy of its legacy.The three-disc collector's set includes the movie itself, complete with a fascinating commentary, several behind-the-scenes documentries and trailers. What was really interesting to me was the disc that contained the 1910 version of the film, as well as other silent-era movies. They aren't the best films ever made, but they're interesting. Even more interesting is the cartoon version of the materiel, which featured the stunning inovation of showing Kansas in black and white and Oz in color. Rounding out these extras is a documentry on the life of L Frank Baum, which is well-worth watching.Equally interesting are the printed items that come with the discs, including reproductions of the press-kit and an invitation to the premire screening. If I ever get my hands on another time machine, I'm so crashing that party.Is this set worth what Amazon is asking for it? Heck, yeah! Worth every penny and then some. If you like Oz, like musicals or just like good films, this is the set for you. With the combonation of a great movie and some wonderful historical items, this set is a perfect 10."	5.0	The best movie of 1939 gets the DVD treament it deserves!	2007-12-14	2	2	0

Although I grew up watching it on TV every year, I somehow forgot the scary parts....So, buying it to watch with my 3 & 5 year old grandchildren was a bit premature.  Nonetheless, I fast forwarded it through those scenes, and enjoyed the wonderful music....As a note, some of the scenes from the current movie ""Santa Paws"" were much scarier and just plain mean which affect the kids much more than the wicked witch."	4.0	great!!!	2011-03-23	0	0	0

(did this person attend a test screening back in 1939, that's the only way they would have saw it!) You can see a quick glimpse of it in the trailer (which are created before a movie is released).Also, another reviewer is waiting for a widescreen version of Oz before buying it...well, pal, you'll wait forever, beacuse widescreen movies didn't come along until about 12 years after The Wizard of Oz was released!Sheesh!!!	5.0	What's with some of these reviewers?	2003-07-07	11	9	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3FLEK6G5M34SH	Chuck Donegan	"As a lifelong fan of this timeless classic, I found myself counting off the days until this 3-disc collector's edition was released...while (as others have pointed out) the extra $20 might be a detraction for some, if you love Oz as much as I do, it's worth every penny. Besides all the features on the 2-disc version, including:- A magnificantly-restored print of the film itself- The 1990 ""Making of a Movie Classic"" documentary w/Angela Lansbury (plus the chapter selection feature from the 99 release!), along w/the recent 2001 ""Memories of Oz"" doc from TCM, plus a coupla brand-new retrospective pieces- An audio gallery featuring the original recording sessions and other goodies- Special effects raw footage- Extensive stills galleries- Bios on the cast, complete w/clips of their notable pre/post-Oz roles- Deleted scenes (and thankfully, they gave us the actual film track of ""The Jitterbug"" this time, after inexplicably using a piano rehearsal track that didn't even feature Judy Garland, on the 99 release)- Composer Harold Arlen's home movies (extended from the assortment seen on the 99 release...and is that some Thorpe-era backstage footage seen at the end??)- The COMPLETE version of Ted Eshbaugh's 1933 cartoon short (unlike the 1-min. clip from the 93 and 99 releases, you can now get an idea of how little it had in common w/the actual story)...and narration/intros by the aforementioned Angela Lansbury (a nice change compared to the text-based intros used on the 1999 release), you also get:- A 3rd disc exclusively devoted to original Oz author L. Frank Baum and earlier film versions of the story- A set of 10 Kodachrome publicity photo reproductions- A complete set of publicity material reproductions from the original Hollywood premiere (programs, an invitation, and a ticket!)My only complaint is that the special effects raw footage could be of better quality...some of them (particularly the ""funnel advancing towards the camera clips"") have a rather grainy feel. Also, while the complete ""Romance in Celluloid"" short (which contained a brief clip of the cornfield set during Thorpe's tenure, as seen on the earlier 90s releases) was interesting, the rest of the piece has absolutely no relevance to anything Oz-related and is unnecessary at best...if they (rightfully) felt no need to include the full version of the ""1939-40 Calvacade of Academy Awards"" short, I don't see why they couldn't have sacrificed the non-Oz portions of RiC for, say, the 1979 Hamilton/Bolger/Haley interviews, which were not included on this set at all...while it doesn't matter much to me, having the full-screen versions off the 1993 release, there are those who only have the God-awful ""screen-saving"" presentation of these clips from the 1999 DVD.And it would've been nice, for Ray Bolger's deleted ""If I Only Had a Brain"" dance, to hear the story of how it was originally staged by (film choreographer) Bobby Connolly before being scrapped as ""too tame"" and redone under the aforementioned Busby Berkley during the Feb. 39 reshooting period (again, no major issue for me, but other Oz fans who didn't get the 99 release might not know that)...instead, Lansbury gives a bare-bones intro that just mentions how a clip of the dance can be seen in the 1990 documentaty she hosted, but is presented there in full.Minor complaints aside, everything else looks great, and I'd def recommend it to any diehard Oz fan like myself...over 65 years later, there's still ""no place like home"" for a classic like this! :-)"	5.0	Oz has granted your request...and how!	2005-10-26	12	10	2

I was reading through some of the material that came with the 3 dvd's yesterday. Fascinating. The Cowardly Lions costume was made from real lions skin? Great. Judy Garland had to go through 9 different dresses whil making the Wizard of Oz? Terrific. The Wicked Witches nose was metal? I thought it was rubber. Wow! So many interesting facts, and thats from just reading the booklets that came with it. I'm waiting to watch it with my whole family.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AUCISQA1YXX86	Confederate	The video itself is a wonderful transfer, but Warner Brothers' continuing problems with Blu-Ray disks that go flaky with little if any warning makes buying this a questionable proposition. I've had a number of Warner Brothers Blu-Rays just stop working without a scratch, smudge or dimple. I've tried contacting WB about this, but they don't respond. The regular DVDs seem to work well, but the Blu-Rays seem to have some production problems. (And just try to get one replaced after several months, which is how long it takes for these disks to fail.)If anyone knows if WB is ever going to address these problems (Wiz. of Oz, Willie Wonka and others), I'd like to know. I've tried these disks on multiple devices and they've failed to play -- and this after playing flawlessly six or seven times. It's as if suddenly, boom -- they stop being recognized.I've had no problems with the DVDs, though.	3.0	Warner Brothers' Poor Blu-Ray Quality	2010-09-24	8	4	4

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ATZ5ILAPTLZ2B	Connie C	"I write the ""sepia"" descriptor in quotes because this DVD doesn't even offer a true sepia.  The opening segment is RED!  It was so irritating to my sensibilities that I finally had to turn the color off on my TV to get thru the Kansas segment, turning it back on in time for Dorothy to open the door to Oz.What's even more irritating is that the Kansas segment was never meant to be sepia.  It was filmed in b&w; and printed on b&w; stock as the first reel of the film.  Old Louis B. Mayer of MGM would never have put out the money necessary to supply the then-outrageously expensive technicolor stock necessary to make the first reel appear in sepia.  Somehow, those responsible for the otherwise magnificent remasterings done since 1989 got the idea that this segment should be sepia.Once it goes to color, of course, this rendering is beautiful, and the film is one of the all-time greats.  The add-ons for this 3-disc version are wonderful and worth the investment.  Purist that I am, I could even live with a true sepia in the Kansas segment, although it would make me cringe.  But the red tones generated in place of sepia are horrific and drop the overall review of this DVD to mediocre."	3.0	"Horrific ""Sepia"""	2005-11-18	19	1	18

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens of times? The film line difers somewhat from the original book, but the film has such heart and is so earnestly done you can't help but love it. Judy Garland is so perfect as Dorothy, the young girl from Kansas, you can't imagine anyone else in the role. Originally only marginally successful in its theatrical run, the film gained a whole new life on television and home video, becoming the most beloved film of all time. ""Over the Rainbow"", the theme song of the movie, has become a universal favorite, as well as Judy Garland's signature song. The extensive restoration done was evident from the opening on. The part that really shows, though, is the entrance into Oz. The colors just leap out, everything just shines and drips with color, to illustrate how dull and colorless Dorothy's life at home had become.The make-up work was inspired, with all major charactors wearing extensive prosthetics and heavy make-up. The tornado sequence in particular is great to watch to this day. What really holds this film together and makes it work is Judy Garland. She is the picture of innocence and earnest yearning for something better. Ms. Garland herself said it was her favorite of all the roles she played, and ""Over the Rainbow"" never got tiresome for her to sing. Many people over several generations have fallen under the spell of this film, and all it takes is to watch it yourself to see why. Actually this movie should be required for any DVD collection, as it is the epitome of film classic. Get it and be whisked away to Oz again and again."	5.0	In the Merry Old Land of Oz	2006-12-27	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A25CZCHLNH3OMO	Cuckoo Pine Nut	I do not like the Wizard of Oz. For one thing, I don't like to watch things with witches in them, especially if one of them is portrayed as a &quot;good witch&quot; - that's an oxymoron I can't reconcile with. For another thing I don't like Judy Garland's breathless diction or Frank Morgan - The star I give this goes exclusively to the Tin Man, who was always my favourite and still is. But I can't stand sitting through this movie just to watch him, though I might if I could fast forward the other parts. It's all just such fantasy fluff, and I like something that has a bit more reality to it. This falls perilously short of the mark.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A19J6O9B1VDJO9	C.White	I have assigned this 5 out of 5 stars due to the quality of this collector's edition. With Amazon Prime, the shipping was on time and there was no damage to the packaging, opening it the quality of the edition itself is excellent. All of the items were complete and in perfect condition with no damages. As someone who had only previously been watching the Wizard of Oz on a lazer disc or on television, it was nice having such a complete set of copies which will prevent me from wearing them down. The extras are definitely worth the cost and due to a $5 promotional credit that Amazon was running near the holidays and gift cards, I got the price down in half but even without that, I still feel that it is affordable especially if you have Prime which provides you with the free two day shipping. There is nothing here to complain about. I plan on getting the pictures it came with framed as I am big fan of both the Wizard of Oz and the musical Wicked as well and love the Map of Oz. If you have an earlier collector's edition, I do not know if the need would be there but for someone without, it's definitely a worthwhile investment.	5.0	75th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition	2014-01-07	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	It's hard to write about this simple yet wondrous and magical all-time classic.  What hasn't already been said about Dorothy's trip to Oz, her meeting four funny-looking friends, who skip down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Dorothy's red ruby slippers?  Its 60th anniversary theatrical release was definitely a high point of 1999, when its remastered colour jumped right out at me.That's probably the biggest asset of this movie--the bright colours of Oz.  The yellow-brick road which begins as a spiral before branching into three forks in the road, the sparkling green Emerald City and the green worn by its folks, and the field of red poppies.For me, the most magical line that hits home is when Auntie Em tells Dorothy to find a place where there isn't any trouble.  To which Dorothy says wonderingly:  &quot;A place where there isn't any trouble. ... It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away.  Behind the moon, beyond the rain.&quot;  She then bursts into song after that, but I've always been looking for a place like that--I just can't find it.  And behind the moon?  I wonder if she means the dark side of the moon.Then there's Judy Garland, wide-eyed, innocent, polite, and simply fun to watch.  That refreshing smile, blue dress, ruby slippers, and that immortal &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; really earned her that special Oscar as &quot;best juvenile performer of the year.&quot;  And Shirley Temple was originally slated to play Dorothy?  Puh-leeze!  And this movie lost to Gone With The Wind for Best Picture?  Double puh-leeze!Along with Judy, the rest of the cast are perfectly suited in their roles.  Ray Bolger (Hunk/Scarecrow), Jack Haley (Hickory/Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Zeke/Cowardly Lion), Frank Morgan (Professor Marvel/the Wizard and three other roles), Charlie Grapewin (Uncle Henry), Clara Blandick (Auntie Em), Margaret Hamilton (Almira Gulch/Wicked Witch), and Billie Burke (Glinda) are simply memorable.The special program hosted by Angela Lansbury and behind-the-scenes is great to watch, as there's background to author L. Frank Baum and reminiscences by Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, and Frank Arlen, among others.Post-script:  I saw this classic in a new, different, and interesting light just this year in my Blues, Jazz, and Rock final.  Hint:  it took me Over The Rainbow and straight to the Dark Side Of The Moon--and I'm still there.  And I didn't need to click my red ruby slippers together.

I can remember just about every weekend as a child, while my mother would prepare my hair for Sunday's church services, I watched The Wizard of Oz. I couldn't get enough of it, and I still watch it from time to time. You can never get tired of it because it's so funny! It's to the point that I've memorized most of the lines in the movie. Now that's pretty good. As I've said, this is a great movie and it's something that people of ALL ages can enjoy. There's no sex scenes to shield your kids from, and the humor is classic, sometimes slapstick. Either way you go, you can't go wrong with the Wizard of Oz.

I highly recommend this DVD version to anyone that wants to see the truest clarity over the old VHS copies.	5.0	Excellent	2013-10-06	1	1	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A17WGEUH86HDSK	Daniel Roman	Where does one begin?  In Kansas or the Yellow Brick Road...both, I figure.Frank Baum would have been more than proud of this film, he'd also be very rich.  There are possibly more off-camera stories told about the making of this film than any other.  The rich dynamics of its staging, the production values, the characters, the &#34;real-life&#34; actors and every munchkin who ever lived should be more than proud...they should and can be remembered.  The Wizard of Oz was important viewing when I was a kid and even more important now.  If you look beyond the story, after seeing the film, and address the issue of the performance of those who brought it all together and then recognize that, because of this great picture, they, the performers, still live and they never grow old or older.  This is a wonderful &#34;Holiday Film,&#34; but in my view its an all-around family film and it doesn't matter how old you are, it works.Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Burt Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Margaret &#34;The Wicked Witch&#34; Hamilton (a kinder more intelligent woman never existed).  Stage star and wife of producer Florence Ziegfeld (the Ziegfeld Follies) was in reality &#34;Brenda, the Good Witch&#34; touring the world as the affable person she truly was.  These are the people Victor Fleming and all of Hollywood chose to show their talents, and show them they did.  A character actor who performed in the film, Jerry Maren, now 94 could have written a book about these lovely and often naughty characters on and off screen.  Maren, when I met him, was an avid golfer... and not at all bad with a club in his hand.  This film is Americana and has been seen in possibly every theatre and home around the world.	5.0	The Wizard of Oz	2014-03-18	1	1	0

Quality seems to be worse than DVD if possible, like watching on standard definition television when I was a kid. Spent $60.00 on this item and was very excited to see it in a new light and add it to my collection. Extremely disappointed and will never do business with this company again.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A17EEDW1ZFUWA8	DANNY WILLIAMS	This Anniversary edition is wonderful and informative. Loved the information and trivia on the second disc. Cleared up a lot of rumors about a possible hanging during the filming. also Great info on the characters, the Munchkins as well as Buddy Ebsen's  make up problem causing him to give up the role of the Tin Man. An who could forget Judy Garland. She was the perfect choice in my opinion. Our whole family just enjoyed this classic movie. Year after year, It's one of our favorites of all time. And now my Grandkids can enjoy it as well.Thank you so much for putting this  70th Anniversary edition together.The Williams Family	5.0	Danny	2011-01-09	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	I've looked and looked! One of the most popular Hollywood urban legends, I know what scene you're supposed to see the hanging corpse of a suicidal munchkin but I can never find it! Oh well, I guess that's why they're called urban legends. Anyway, I don't think there's ever been a movie that's been referenced, homaged, parodied or quoted as much as this one. I'd even go as far as to say this was probably one of the first movies I ever saw (but I also have conflicting memories of Snow White and Dumbo). I probably won't say much about this movie seeing as how everybody and their mother has said just about everything there is so I'll try not to repeat anything. The actors are great, the songs are memorable and the story simple yet charming. I've never read the original book so I don't know how much was changed. The only two things I know of that were changed from book to screen was the exclusion of the Witch of the South and the color of the slippers from silver to ruby (silver being to hard to film in color against the yellow brick road, I assume) so maybe one day I'll give it a go. The special effects are great, even in today's CGI world, I prefer the practical effects, especially the make-up used on Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. One thing that puzzles me though is why people are afraid of the Wicked Witch. She's a good villain and all but as a child I never felt scared by her. Oddly enough though I WAS scared of the Wicked Queen from Snow White but wasn't scared when she transformed into the old hag. Yeah that is a bit strange; the Wicked Witch, Danny DeVito's Penguin and Lord Zedd (the Power Ranger villain who was so scary he gave children nightmares and soccer moms complained) don't scare me at all yet a queen whose only goal is to kill a young girl just to be the most beautiful woman in the land does. I've also never seen the musical Wicked but from what I heard about the story, they try to humanize the Wicked Witch. Great job guys on trying to lessen the impact on a character that's been scaring children since 1939! A great classic movie that'll continute to charm each new generation that watches it. I know I'll give it a few more in the future.	5.0	Great Movie	2012-01-16	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A27CFNHYZG6WS8	darragh o'donoghue	'The Wizard of Oz' is so resonant and enduring and vital, not just because it deals in archetypal narratives about home and escape, duty and desire, good and evil, friendship and individuality, or the strange changes sparked by adolescence; but becauuse, more than any other film to which we are exposed from a young age, it explains to us why we watch films.  When Dorothy wakes up in the middle of a twister, she looks out the window which plays like a cinema screen, and sees not her life flashing before her as she nears certain death, but the other characters in her life comically and ominously transformed - two farmhands in a boat, a flying cow, Miss Gulch on a bicycle becoming the Wicked Witch etc.It's always assumed that we go to the cinema to escape, but our relationship is more complicated than that.  The black and white prologue is more distressing than anything in Oz - not ony is Kansas the bleakest wasteland imaginable; not only is Toto snatched for execution; not only is the precarious farmstead at the mercy of large landowners, banks and the law (I hadn't realised how political 'Oz' could be), but Dorothy herself is de trop, a nuisance, her seemingly petty or childish concerns having no purchase in the hard, economic realities around her.  Literally weighed down by home, with all its negative connotations, she dreams of escaping into an abstract realm over the rainbow.  The twister becomes a projection of her natural feelings suppressed in a home that ignores her, just as we project our desires on to the phantoms on the screen.  The house is literally freed from the land that burdens it (by needing to be worked), and from the laws that turn citizens into slaves.But Oz is no escape.  Not only is it defined in terms of what Kansas is not - verdant not desert; watery not barren; urban not rural; colour, of course, not monochrome; a place where Dorothy is central, life- or freedom-giving; a place where death can be liberating, and where the inanimate become animate - but also by what it is: the metamorphosis of characters from one section to the other; the attempts to steal what little 'property' Dorothy has (this IS an American story!); the transformation of the farm's drearily familiar landmarks (fences, prison-like wheels) into the architecture of Oz (especially the Emerald City).  We don't go to the cinema to mindlessly escape, but to 'play' with the idea of our own lives, to test other possibilities, to realise the viability of dreams; to enquire who we are.  It is Dorothy, the audience, if you like, who negotiates Oz, not the studio-producer-like manufacturer of fantasy worlds, the Wizard (ditto, the crystal balls, another form of image-projection - cinema as surveillance - controlled by dubious adults).  In that hurricane sequence, the uprooted house, the bedroom, the dream, the natural force as Id-like disruption and the cinema are all connected.Whatever.  Judy Garland aching 'Over the Rainbow'.  Margaret Hamilton in one of the immortal dual roles.  The first dazzling panorama of Oz.  The scary Lollipop Guild.  The twinkling ruby slippers.  The inspired melange of European fairy tales, Ruritania, operetta and folk Americana.  The fight between the apple trees and the Scarecrow.  The Tin Man's lunging dance.  The engineering feat of the Cowardly Lion's moving tail.  Snow sprinkled on the poppy fields (cold reason resisting the soporific lure of Hollywood?  Arf!).  The vaulted corridor of the Emerald City.  The truly terrifying broom-seeking/escape sequence in the witch's castle.  The Alice-in-Wonderland subtext, with Dorothy's puberty matched by the interest in vulnerable bodies and things budding, blooming, changing and falling apart.  Frank Morgan in many roles and one.  The Wizard's refreshing cynicism about worldly intelligence, courage and philantropy.  'The Wizard of Oz'.  No place like it.	5.0	He's wonderful.	2002-01-23	6	5	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1OM5269E8J401	"Darryl M. Haase ""dothehucklebuck"""	&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the three essential films from Hollywood's golden age (&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot; are the others).  It still has the power to enthrall viewers old and young alike.  The story-telling is direct, lean and every musical note compliments the action completely.  Despite having a number of directors, as well as now-famous bloopers (watch Dorothy's braids magically change length during her first meeting with the Scarecrow), the final product is near perfection.  The film has a great sense of humor as well as lots of tension, which makes it exciting no matter how many times you see it.  The character make-ups for the film are timely and ingenious because they don't overshadow the facial characteristics of the three actors beneath them.  Even that could not be said for Jim Carrey and his frightening make-up as &quot;The Grinch&quot;!  &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is a once in a lifetime treat from Hollywood's Technicolor dream factory and its greatest studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  The DVD issue is phenomenal, with a print so clear that you can even see the black roots of Judy Garland's red dyed hair- CBS didn't even have a print that good over the years!	5.0	&quot;MGM'S CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT&quot;	2001-12-22	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Like most Americans of my generation, the annual television broadcasts of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; were a part of my childhood.  I still remember the delight I felt as a child when Dorothy would open the door of her cabin and step into the land of Oz--suddenly the screen would explode with color.  This was a family film that wasn't afraid to be scary--I was terrified by the scene in which the flying monkeys captured Dorothy and Toto and attacked their friends, tearing the Scarecrow to pieces in the process.Years went by and I fell out of the habit of watching &quot;Oz.&quot;  Of course, I was aware of its status as a pop icon.  However, what surprised me upon a recent viewing is how well the flm holds up.  This is truly a film that has something for all ages.  Now I can appreciate the wonderful performances, the classic songs, and the well-written script.  This truly belongs on any list of essential American films.And those flying monkeys still scare the hell out of me.	5.0	A true family classic	2001-12-08	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	I too have seen this film more times than I can remember but, nevertheless, never fail to be moved and amazed at this marvelous product of 1939 Hollywood.Since the story is so familiar I will focus on this 70th Anniversary Blu-ray version. First of all the video quality is much better than the 50th Anniversary LaserDisc version that I have used to this point. I'm also appreciative of the audio options which include Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound. I doubt very seriously that I'll be around for the 90th Anniversary version but I can't help but wonder what that format will look and sound like.There are seven groups of Extra Features available to the viewer including a Sing-Along, Extra Footage, Audio, Behind the Scenes, and On-line. If your Blu-ray disc offers BD-Live, this feature is available by signing up on the player or on-line. I recommend using the on-line alternative as trying to use the player to register, while possible, is rather awkward.I have watched several of the Special Features and so far they've been interesting with some new material that I had not seen before. I am not that much of a Special Features fan and do not spend a great deal of time checking them out; to me the movie is the focus and this recording of the movie is very good.For $21.99 it would be hard to go wrong on this disc; try it and I think you'll be glad you did, I know I am.	5.0	An Effective Remembrance of a Memorable Film	2010-05-22	2	2	0

Thier mentality was to go for the fast buck, and move on.  Hundreds od thousands of films were allowed to rot into dust before they discovered that there was gold in them thar films, way beyond anyone's dreams at the time they were being made.But I digress. It is boxed  sets like this that truly preserve film classics for future generations to enjoy. Wizzard of Oz is one of those few films that have wistood the tests of time, and have truly developed a life all thier own. Many of the archivial items included in this set would not have been available today, if not for the dedication of film collectors, and film lovers. I feel if not for them, such boxed sets would not even exist, let alone the films themselves.	5.0	Truly amazing Collector's Edition...	2010-01-09	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	APTF9UDVDUPGU	"David McEldery ""TV Junkie"""	"I'm reviewing the most recent release of the Wizard of Oz Blue Ray single disc. It's from the 70th Anniversary offering, minus all the boxed extras. The Amazon screen aspect ratio is described as 1.77:1, which it's not, it's 1.33:1. This is close to the original screen version which was 1.37:1. You'd need a screen aspect ratio of 1.78:1 to fill a 16:9 HD TV. I saw this when I bought the disk, and was sweating bullets that maybe someone had edited the print to fit - thankfully they didn't. You get the kind of side bars you do with SD TV 4:3 ratios, but it's still not as disturbing to me as pillar boxing or letter boxing. Don't get me wrong, I believe all the original material and directors' intent of films should be preserved in their native aspect ratios, and not whacked to fit a 16:9 HD screen. It's just that I really like a full screen. Oh well - maybe I should have opted for a 60"" screen instead of a 42"" just to get more width for letter boxed movies - not your problem. The downside is that the bigger your screen, the more noise or pixellation shows up, unless you sit farther away. Oh well.Back to the disk. It is a gorgeous remastering of the movie that is bright, rich with saturated color, clear, and full of detail. The sound is good too. I did discover one thing that I'm puzzled by. When the home screen comes up, it's the movie only, with no menu that allows for scene selection or the few extra features embedded in the DVD. I have an LG Blu Ray player manufactured in Nov. 2009 and I updated the firmware/software with an April 2, 2010 update, so I should be up to speed. By playing with my remote menu options, I discovered that I can access various language dubbing and the voice-over interviews and narrative about the film creation by selecting English 7, 8, or 9 on the player device menu. This also gives me the option of just listening to the music and sound effects minus dialog with the film, but why anyone would do this, I'm not sure. This is kind of cumbersome to find, and nothing is explained as it would be with a regular disk menu. The back of the disk container shows you what extra material is on the disk (in the very fine print), but I had to play with my machine to access it.You may notice that with 1080p resolution, some scenes or segments of the film exhibit a very fine grain or texture. Don't panic, it isn't ""noise"". This is similar to what you get when you look at emulsion films under high magnification. If the restoration team were to try and smooth that out, you would lose detail. It's more noticeable in low light and some indoor shots, and contrasty outdoor shots. I was really looking for digital noise and specks, scratches, etc., but they aren't there - it's  really cleaned up. It doesn't detract from the viewing at all. Keep in mind that this film was made in 1938-1939, a long time ago. The original sepia toned beginning of the story is there, instead of the later generations of B&W.; This was the first film I saw as a child around 1955 or 1956 at a drive-in theater (it was re-released), and it has remained a favorite. You'd have to have grown up without TV to really have a feel for what it was like when those damned flying monkeys flew off with Dorothy. It scared the heck out of me - as did the haunted forest. However, the film led me to read all of Baum's books (17 or so) when I was 9, and Ruth Plumley Thompson's very good continuation of the series. Some Ozites would say she was a better writer than Baum. You be the judge. I later revisited the series when I re-read it to my daughters in the 1990s, and I discovered a lot of things I missed as a child, such as Baum's views on ""modern"" education (too much emphasis on athletics in college) and infernal modern music (ragtime versus Mozart). He also had a wonderfully impractical, utopian worldview - you didn't need money in Oz. Your work or trade was equally valuable with other types, so barter was the currency. The army was composed of many officers, and one private soldier. It was well known that officers have the finest uniforms and look best on parade, but it's the private soldiers who fight and die in battle, so if you have only one private, you have no war, but with many officers, you have a great spectacle. The reference I made to athletics comes from book 4 (?) and Professor Woggle Bug who founded the College of Athletic Science - he invented a pill for mundane things like Greek, Latin, mathematics, etc., so students could devote their time to what was really important - baseball, rowing, football, etc. This all before 1920!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3G3O4VG6O2S1Z	David Vaughn	"Adapted from L. Frank Baum's timeless children's tale, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto are caught in a tornado and end up in the Land of Oz. In order to return home to Kansas, she must follow the yellow brick road to visit the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan). Along the way she meets the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) who wishes for a brain, the Tinman (Jack Haley) who's longing for a heart, and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) in search of some courage.The Wizard of Oz received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and won two--Best Song, ""Over the Rainbow,"" and Best Original Score. It sits at #10 on the American Film Institute's top 100 Greatest Films. Amazingly, the film was directed by Victor Fleming, who in the same year also directed Gone With the Wind, #6 on the AFI list.The film was a critical success upon its initial release in 1939, and it was released again theatrically in 1949 and 1955. In 1956, it made its network-television debut on CBS with an estimated audience of 45 million, which marked the beginning of an annual tradition. For people in my age group (40s), these broadcasts led us to fall in love with the enduring classic. Thankfully, Warner Brothers has now given the film the ultimate restoration.I won't rehash all the technical details of the restoration here--suffice to say, it is simply amazing. Details that were obscured on DVD over the years are clearly visible now, such as acne on Garland's chin and forehead, the oil squirting out of the Tinman's oil can, and the boundary between the yellow brick road and the matte painting! Color saturation is breathtaking, shadows are clearly resolved, and the sepia tones of the scenes in Kansas have never looked clearer. Some may think the print is on the soft side, but this was how the film was originally shot.The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack won't be confused with a modern musical, but considering its age, it sounds great. The fidelity is very good, although slightly on the tinny side, the stereo spread across the front is wide, and the dialog is intelligible and rooted in the center speaker. Ambience is limited, but the occasional discrete effect emanates from the rear speakers in the Land of Oz and when the tornado whisks Dorothy over the rainbow.Warner dubs this the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition,"" and considering the swag and other video-based materials, the designation is understated. First, the limited and numbered boxes bear a silver label (mine is 44,281 out of 243,000); once they sell out, the studio says it will never again be available to consumers. Inside the box is a rendering of the original 1939 Oz campaign book that includes promotional materials such as full-color ad reproductions and press sheets. Also included is a replica of the original movie budget; ""Behind the Curtain,"" a 52-page hard-cover book assembled by Oz historian John Fricke; and a collectible 70th Anniversary watch created specifically for this release.In addition to the swag, the video bonus materials run over 16 hours, including four hours of never-before-seen footage. New features on this release include a sing-along track; a documentary on director Victor Fleming; a featurette on seven of the original ""Munchkins of Oz""; ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz,"" a feature-length Baum-produced silent film; and ""The Dreamer of Oz,"" an NBC television movie from 1990 that chronicles the life of L. Frank Baum. Other supplements include numerous behind-the-scenes featurettes, a digital copy of the film, and ""MGM: When the Lion Roars,"" a documentary exclusive to Blu-ray that runs six hours and chronicles the most powerful studio from the early days of Hollywood.This is the most comprehensive Blu-ray set I've reviewed to date, and given the film's pedigree, it's more than justified, but it comes at a steep price."	5.0	Remarkable restoration.	2009-10-10	2	2	0

For a time, the sepia tones were dropped, and Kansas was shown on television, in theaters, and on videotape in black and white, and the only sepia in The Movie was Aunt Em's appearance in the Witch's crystal ball. For The Movie's fiftieth anniversary in 1989, the sepia was restored, and has been there ever since.""I have not watched this version yet (I am ordering my copy of the 3-disc set tonight), so I can't comment on the reddishness of the sepia (her other complaint), but the sepia tone does belong.And this movie is DEFINITELY FIVE STARS!!!"	5.0	"Maybe Not So ""Horrific"" Sepia"	2005-11-19	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1HCHCL86MKX3G	Dean Glass	"""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of those rare movies--like ""Star Wars"", ""Grease"", ""Meet Me In St. Louis"", ""Amadeus"", and a few others you may think of--where everything seems to have gone right and despite production problems the producers seem to have actually captured magic on celluloid.  Even after 60+ years of technilogical advancements, it would be virtually impossible to improve this movie.  The Warner Bros. DVD is a transfer from the latest restoration which was released theatrically for the film's 60th anniversary in 1998.  The folks at Warners, who surely have skills in many areas, seem to be lacking in the math department, since the movie was originally released in 1939 and '98 was only 59 years later and not 60.  That's a very minor point, though. Feeling that ""The Wizard of Oz"" being such a great movie and a national treasure, I doubt I could ever be completely satisfied with a restored DVD.  In this review I will mention some problems I have noticed with this DVD with the caveat that these are only tiny flaws and this DVD is still a must-have for any collection.  If my complaints seem petty, please keep in mind I gave this DVD 5 stars.Like the other great Victor Fleming movie of 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Oz"" was filmed in ""Three Strip Technicolor"", which was made up of three separate black and white negatives with primary color dyes added to the prints one at a time during processing.  Unfortunately, in the 60 years since, these negatives have been shrinking and not at a consistant rate.  Therefore, the three negatives which used to be in exact alignment when the films were printed do not match up quite so perfectly any more.  This results in occasional blurriness and ""color fringing"", as was noticed and complained about by critics and fans who saw ""Gone With The Wind""'s 1998 theatrical rerelease.  Warners promised that when ""Oz"" would be released a few months later, these problems would be corrected.  I saw the rerelease of ""Oz"" and was disappointed that they had not kept their promise.  The film looked out-of-focus a great deal of the time.  Unfortunately some of the blurry patches made it onto the DVD.  These brief blips may go unnoticed by most viewers, but if you've seen the movie sixty thousand and two times--and have never tired of it--like me, you will probably spot them.  [For an example, pause the film just after Dorothy steps out of the house in Munchkinland and step forward frame by frame until you see Dorothy's back.  You will get a few frames of hideous distortment.]  The previous MGM DVD version, which is now out-of-print, did not have this problem even though the restoration was done relatively recently.  I wonder why Warners couldn't have replaced the flawed frames with ones from the previous release--you'd think that with all the technology available--and the fact that they digitally removed scratches and dirt frame by frame with a computer--this would have been a simple task.  I also notice that in the Kansas scenes, Dorothy's dress shows a lot more ""moire"" distortion--when you see all the colors of the rainbow in a checked or striped black and white image on a color television--than did the MGM version.  Turning the color off on your set won't help, since these scenes are printed in sepia tone. I also feel that, although the Warners restoration has removed a lot of scratches and dirt making for a cleaner image, the MGM release had brighter and more vivid color; some people will prefer the new DVD's natural, life-life hues, but I think that a fantasy like ""Oz"" looks better when the colors jump off the screen in all their garish glory.On the plus side, the new DVD is the first home video release with a stereo soundtrack.  Naturalists may prefer the original mono, but the stereo (even with 1930s source material) sounds awfully good.  Interestingly, the back of the DVD box states that the DVD has both stereo and mono soundtracks, but I cannot locate the mono track anywhere on this disc.  The menus, which are downright beautiful, are somewhat confusing at first, but once you master them you will find a treasure trove of ""Wizard of Oz"" extras (the MGM DVD only added the trailer).  From a stunningly clear and crisp print of the ""missing"" ""Scarecrow Dance"" number, to Harold Arlen's behind-the-scenes home movies including a dress rehearsal of ""The Jitterbug"" to the ""Making of"" featurette to the vast amount of additional audio material, you can spend hours exploring this DVD.So despite a few flaws only someone obsessed with this movie would care about, this DVD is a stunner.  Any household with a DVD player and someone who is young or ""young in heart"" will want to add this to their collection.  Although Warners could have charged a bundle for this DVD--and it would have been worth it, what with the movie's rewatchability and the mint of extras--this DVD is very affordable.  You have no excuse not to buy it. Happy journeys over the rainbow!"	5.0	Magic Captured On Film	2003-07-21	3	2	1

I had my doubts about a 3D conversion of a 1939 film not shot in 3D, but the work here was extensive and impeccably convincing as I never could have imagined. The result is characters and sets coming alive as never before, delivering the most engaging experience since the first time you saw The Wizard of Oz as a child.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3PPSZB0W5DZH6	"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN"""	"With MGM's""The Wizard Of Oz"" now so firmly established as a ""cherished classic"" and an essential aspect of the American pop-culture fabric, it is easy-- perhaps too easy-- to forget what a great film it is, and just how cinematically groundbreaking it was in 1939.  The behind the  scenes trials and tribulations of ""Oz"" are well known by now. ""Oz"" was an arduous shoot, enduring ten screenwriters (final credit went to Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf) and four directors. Richard Thorpe was fired. George Cukor, busy with pre-production on ""Gone With The Wind"", wasn't interested, but he did offer important production suggestions and advice. Victor Fleming directed most of ""Oz"" until Clark Gable threw a hissy-fit and demanded that Fleming replace Cukor on ""GWTW."" So King Vidor finished the final scenes of ""Oz"". Fleming, meanwhile, directed ""GWTW"" by day and supervised editing of ""Oz"" at night.With a recent gift of a new HD TV and Blu-Ray player, I couldn't wait to see how this Hollywood gem would look and sound on Blu-Ray.L. Frank Baum spends about two and a half pages of his original book ""The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz"" describing what a flat, dull, grey, lifeless environment Kansas is. Then, the cyclone blows Dorothy and Toto off to Oz. The screenplay spends  the first 20 minutes in Kansas, and it's a much more horrible environment than Baum described. In effect, the screenplay gives Judy Garland's Dorothy every good reason to escape Kansas;  and I don't think a very good reason to return to it. This Kansas environment is beyond oppressive. It is toxic.Dorothy must content with adults who don't have any time for her; for her feelings or concerns. More than overworked, Auntie Em (Clara Blandick) seems downright mean. Mean doesn't even begin to describe Miss Gulch (Margaret Hamilton), who is on her way to take beloved dog Toto away and have him ""destroyed."" When Judy Garland sings ""Over The Rainbow"", it is not merely Dorothy's poignant wish expressed against the backdrop of a  dull barnyard. It is a cry from the soul, not just Dorothy's soul, but a universal cry from the soul; from anyone who ever wished for a better life; for a way OUT of a hell on earth environment. Judy Garland is right on the emotional mark; the lyric line ""where troubles melt like lemon drops"" perhaps  foreshadowing Dorothy's battle with The Wicked Witch Of The West in Oz. After Toto escapes Miss Gulch's bicycle basket, Dorothy grabs her beloved dog baby and, understandably runs away; meeting Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan) alongside a dusty roadway. Marvel knows what's up when he says to Dorothy, ""They don't understand you at home, they don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands, big cities, big mountains, big oceans."" Dorothy, clearly relieved, replies, ""Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me."" The Cyclone finally blows Dorothy and Toto out of Kansas hell, the real adventure begins, and the movie explodes into beautiful Technicolor and Blu-Ray brilliance.On Blu-Ray, everything in Oz, from Dorothy's simple blue gingham dress to the famous Ruby Slippers. is dazzling. Judy Garland looks beautiful, perhaps because, in Oz, Dorothy is finally entering into her full glory.  If Kansas is hell, then Oz is definitely heaven (well, except for the Wicked Witch, of course). Glorious is the only word to describe Harold Rossen's Technicolor photography, Edwin B. Willis' set decorations, and Adrian's costumes, seen and appreciated on Blu-Ray in maximum  splendor,  perhaps for the first time since 1939. The scenes in the Scarecrow's cornfield and Poppy Field are particularly vivid and eye popping on Blu-Ray.The movie, of course, is not about  Classic Movie magic;  or technical artistry and special effects. The fantasy  would matter without the excellent story and cast.  The impeccable cast makes everything work. As the original ""Boys From Oz"", Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr delight as the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. Lahr is especially outstanding. Judy Garland is the emotional center, the heart and soul of the movie. Bert Lahr provides the brightest, pure comedy moments. And Margaret Hamilton takes the movie to amazing psychological levels. If Miss Gulch was a nasty, annoying battle-axe on a bike, then her Oz incarnation, the Wicked Witch of The West, IS THE Wicked Witch who has haunted countless nightmares for 75 years now. More than frightening and beyond vengeful, Hamilton's Witch is the stuff of pure evil. To her credit, Hamilton, a sweet woman and talented character actress who loved both children and dogs dearly, plays her roles perfectly. Hamilton is a wicked and wild hoot.If the movie has a flaw, it is the sentimental insistence that ""there's no place like home""; saying that ""home"" is the best place for Dorothy and, by extension, everybody in the audience. The ""Oz is all a dream"" ending is the most serious violation; attempting (unsuccessfully, Thank God) to invalidate and negate the entire ""self-discovery to eventual self-actualization"" experience of Oz for Dorothy and the audience. Once again, Judy Garland saves everything. Her intense conviction on the line, ""No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place"" carries more weight than ""there's no place like home."" The MGM ending is a lie. Judy Garland, as always, knows and reveals the the real, emotional and  honest truth.Most of the Special Features from previous DVD editions of ""Oz"" are on the Blu-Ray. But hang on to your Oz DVDs, especially if you have the big green Oz 3 DVD Collection Box that was issued several years ago. On the Blu-Ray, a new making of documentary completely replaces the 1990 ""50 Years Of Magic"" documentary hosted by Angela Lansbury. I can understand wanting a new documentary for the 75th Anniversary. It's all fascinating stuff, and Martin Sheen's narration is especially enthusiastic, but I miss the 50th Anniversary documentary with Lansbury.""Memories Of Oz"", ""The Wonderful Things It Does"" and the DVD entirely devoted to L. Frank Baum, are also NOT INCLUDED on this particular Blu-Ray release; resulting in my rating of 4 Stars instead of a full 5.Fortunately, ""Oz"" can be enjoyed on multiple levels. Never warming up to ""there's no place like home"", I received an alternative message from ""Oz."" I learned that leaving home and having adventures was good and necessary for personal growth and self-actualization. And if you have adventures with good friends and a beloved dog, life was a perfect  Technicolor rainbow experience after all."	4.0	"""IT'S BEAUTIFUL, ISN""T IT?

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AQBATPPS5UGUK	"""dieaffa"""	here's something to do when you have some time. I suggest that you have seen the movie before. but, Turn the sound of the film all the way down, and turn the sound of the album up as high as you can stand. first, get the album Dark Side Of the Moon by Pink Floyd. First load the Dark Side of the Moon CD into your CD player and hit PLAY (&gt;) and then immediately hit PAUSE (II) so it is cued up and ready to roll. Be sure also to set your CD player to continuous replay. This in most CD players is done by hitting the &quot;REPEAT&quot; button twice. Hitting it once will usually repeat only the presently playing track so hit the button two (2) times and it will replay the CD over and over. The CD will play roughly two and a quarter times through the entire length of the movie.Now start at the very beginning where the BLACK &amp; WHITE MGM lion roars. After the BLACK &amp;WHITE MGM Lion roars for the THIRD (3rd) time IMMEDIATELY hit the play button on the CD player.The credits begin to roll, and the ambient noise that opens the album begins. You know the synchronicity will work if the music kicks in just as Produced by Mervyn Leroy pops up.now, the coincedences that occour are just too cool. such as, when dorthey is on the fence balancing, the lyrics &quot;balanced on the biggest wave&quot;  can be heard.watch for the scene when she first reaches oz. too cool!	5.0	here's a fun little thing to do when you are bored	2001-12-13	3	0	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3S20JNUMADEZ1	D.M.B.	"For most film-enthusiasts, this Blu-ray Emerald Edition is the version to get.  It has all the same stuff as the big monster collector box, but without the trinkets and price - though the big box might be a must for OZ fanatics (why not splurge?! right?).  I wouldn't call myself an Oz fanatic by any stretch, so this version is the ""sensible one"" really:  3 discs, 2-blu and 1 standard DVD.  It includes the film and a heap of supportive information to help restore interest in what this film truly means -- which is far more than nearly any film that has ever existed.  I cannot think of a competitor.An innocent girl from Kansas with a cast of strange characters, lost in a strange foreign land -- just trying to go back home to Kansas, after sorely wanting to ""get away from it all.""  It is the icon of all movie icons.  For the record, I enjoy the Kansas scenes the most...for you see, there are two types of people in this world...I enjoyed the standard DVD, which told the exhaustive story of MGM studios...really cool.  I haven't explored all the bonus stuff on Disc 1 or 2, but there's a lot there (seriously!) and any bonus material is always welcome.  I look forward to checking those out.  There's also the budget single disc version, which may be fine for some -- but honestly, for the money, I still think this 3-disc version is a better buy.  But whatever suits you.Most importantly, the original classic that is the ""Wizard of Oz"" looks absolutely stunning on blu-ray.  You have to see this.  It is a revelatory treat for anyone who has seen the film all these years (which statistically should include just about everyone in the free world and beyond) to behold.  It's such a joy to see what is essentially the epitome of American cinema, and an emblem of our culture, values and innocence - look this good.I loved looking endlessly at all the little details; the gritty, sepia-toned Kansas dirt, the true-to-life reflections on everything from Dorothy's screen door to the plastic flowers of the wacky, old land of OZ.  The nooks in each yellow brick, the strands of straw on the burlap Scarecrow, and the rust spots on the Tin Man -- all the quaint details in the staged fantasyland are revealed.  It feels like you're almost revisiting a dream -- able to analyze it in the light of day.  As a result, the experience becomes quite surreal -- transporting you back in time or back into something that's only existed in your memory - everyone's memory, frankly.I enjoyed just looking at it.  All its faults...where the stage ends and the backgrounds begin.  Ah...what a time.  Yep, that's clearly a pelican's wing in the background and not a munchkin hanging himself! :)  There's no reason for future generations to view this film in lesser quality.  Everyone who has ever seen this film (which again is everyone on earth) should see it this clear and pristine.I look forward to what even higher resolutions in the future can reveal to this and all great films.  But honestly we're probably reaching the limits of how good a film like this will ever look -- forever.  This, as with every classic blu-ray I've seen, reveals everything that was captured on the film.  It's to the point that you can see the actual film -- the nature of its film properties and it's grain.  What's left to reveal?  I'm not sure.It's important that we care for these types of things...since we'll all be dead someday.  So, do see it -- in every detail.  Sure, it's quaint, it's old, it's a ""kid's movie"" to most now -- one filmed on a stage in Culver City California in 1939.  But it's fascinating to revisit, with such clarity, something that is this foundational and fundamental to our culture and persona.  And there will never be anything as real, as honest, as true, and as historic, as the original."	5.0	Amazing Looking - Best Version To Get	2010-09-13	10	10	0

So I was excited to find it on Amazon. The DVD arrived in perfect condition - and very quickly - but when I saw foreign writing all over the case I opened it right away.  You see, it was to be a gift for my 4-year old grandson who is (to date, anyway) only proficient in English, and I needed to be sure that the film's dialogue was in English, too. All was well, as the foreign language turned out to be Korean, which was only an option for the closed-captioned feature. After I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled a bit, I mailed it to him and he absolutely loves it. He had never seen it before, and my daughter tells me that the first time he watched it, he was glued to the screen when the witch melted. It is now an ""old"" favorite of his.

She was a little scared by the witch and the flying monkeys, and commented she never knew monkeys could fly.The magic of this movie is still there, with yet another generation to enjoy it.  And she loves the music too.  Would highly recommend this classic.  Looking forward to watching it with her."	4.0	Review through the eyes of a 5 year old	2011-01-08	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A37SFXAWN1CXO0	"Doug Danzeisen ""frankfan42"""	This review is for the single Blu Ray disc of the 1939 version of the Wizard of Oz. I assume you have either seen the movie, or are familiar with the storyline so I won't delve into that here.  There are other filmings, and other versions, but to most all people THIS is the definitive version of the L Frank Baum classic. As one who has had and watched this classic through the years on many different home video technologies I can honestly say I have never seen this movie look better, even in the theater!Not just a restoration, but a revelation of detail and texture are revealed in this wonderful classic. Almost everywhere you look you find textures, details and images that literally bring the story to life. Additionally the audio is crisp and clear and thankfully is free from crazy gimmickry. This is movie restoration done correctly and with respect to the original film, which has become a classic in American family life.The single disc version has the movie we almost all know and most of us love. Judy Garland has never looked more clear, nor the costumes of her compatriots more detailed. Its almost as if this movie were not made some 75 years ago, it looks THAT good. My youngest son, who usually does not watch &#34;Old movies&#34; with me was completely captivated and did not move until the movie was done. He was shocked when I told him when the movie was made. The old effects, particularly the tornado still look great and really show how movie making can be a wonderful art form.The commentary track is really a wonderful source of some interesting information, including the original choice of Buddy Ebsen, from the Beverly Hillbillies, as the tin man. I have quite a few movies in my collection and seldom watch and listen to the commentary, but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. It even had interviews with original cast members interspersed throughout in a manner tha added to one's understanding of the movie. Far from giving us a glimpse behind the curtain which destroys the magic this only burnishes the incredible work that make such a movie. Highly recommended.This is truly an incredible bargain at the current price of 8 dollars, that I cannot recommend it more highly for those who wish to have the definitive version of this classic. If one wishes there are lots of add on versions that have more content, but for this paltry sum you get the definitive version of the movie and a very informative commentary. You will enjoy it, so will your kids, and likely THEIR children. It is pure pleasure to watch how faces light up when watching this movie, and perhaps that is the best recommendation of all. God Bless ya and may you enjoy many movies!	5.0	The Wizard and Dorothy as you have never seen them before.	2013-12-16	1	1	0

Most people have forgotten that the movie starts off in black and white, then turns to color when Dorothy reaches Oz. This is the way it was shown originally in 1939, and that's the way this import version presents. The only minor distraction is the default foreign subtitle. But that's what the DVD remote is for. Click the ""subtitle"" button a couple of times, and the subtitle is completely gone. Heck, what could be easier. The best thing about this import is it's a lot cheaper than the domestic version.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	"That this is one of the greatest family-friendly movies ever made is without question. What I find curiuos about it is how it has endured as such an overwhelmingly beloved film for over 60 years. This, despite the fact that it is a rather obvious allegory of atheism.Now, my point is not whether atheism is good or bad. Rather (and I don't think too many people would argue with me on this topic), it is and has been a rather unpopular philosophy, at least in the United States. That THE WIZARD OF OZ has gone un-noticed by religious groups as a champion of atheism all these years is something I find intriguing.Of course, one of the primary reasons for this lies in the fact that it is, at heart, a movie for children. Most parents merely think of OZ as a neat story and don't give the philosophical implications of the movie a second thought. And, of course, children are generally too naive and inexperienced in life to see much of anything beyond the tale itself.For many of us, like myself, who do see how the allegory operates, life is string of questions where we ask what (or who?) is REALLY behind the curtain? If anything? Is there a ""yellow brick road"" of pre-destination that we're supposed to follow? Or does everything that happens to us in life come about by chance? Does God exist? Or is he nothing but a phantasm that is generated by a priest working behind the curtain?These are interesting questions. But, if nothing else, one thing I believe that all of us can agree on is that a successful life is one where, at the end of it, we can like Dorothy look back over it and say that ""Some of it wasn't very nice, but most of it was beautiful.""Enjoy the Wizard of Oz."	5.0	What is REALLY behind the curtain?	2002-04-27	7	4	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1E164D6SPHANN	"Dr. Robert N. Goldberg ""nissen"""	I just bought my first 3D plasma TV and wanted to try it out.  I didn't buy the TV for the 3D, but wanted to see a few films in 3D to find out what they look like at home.My prior copy of the Wizard of Oz was pre-Blu-ray so it was reasonable to upgrade it to a higher resolution copy.  I don't think I have to convince anyone of the merits of the film itself.This edition comes with both 3D and 2D in Blu-ray format, so you have your choice.  The 3D turned out to be effective.  When Dorothy sings &#34;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&#34;, and is walking around the outside farm set, it really feels like you're there.  A piece of hay is sticking out of a bale near her head at one point, and you can clearly see it in front of her.  I never noticed that piece of hay or some of the other props before, even though I've been watching this movie since the late 1950's.Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch) is a little extra scary in 3D, as you might imagine.  She just jumps out at you from the roof.It is surprising that they were able to reconstruct the 3D information from such an old film.  Whatever they did, it was surprisingly good.  I am not a big fan of 3D, but this edition is worth owning and the 3D is fun.The disc also comes with many extras, which are fascinating.  They gave me even more of an appreciation of this film, and how difficult it was to make at the time.	5.0	Surprisingly good 3D - Great Blu-ray edition	2014-01-31	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1BMKEJ61X57EU	Dr. W. G. Covington, Jr.	Fantasies are fun. Everyone likes a mysterious story well-told. The writing, acting, visual effects, and other elements of this film all add up to make a classic that has entertained generations of audiences since its debut in 1939. With each repeated viewing it is like going back to childhood and seeing familiar friends. There's an innocence in the way the characters relate to each other. Good and evil are clearly delineated. Ambiguities and gray are lacking in this era when sides were distinctly identified.The sets, the technology for the time demonstrate what its like to do work that endures. The plot unfolds in such a way that you're captivated, although you know what is going to happen next.This is good, clean, family entertainment. Good wins, bad fails, and Dorothy wakes up in her own bed in Kansas in the end. All is right with with world. Enjoy!	4.0	A Classic	2003-11-01	1	0	1

Now I must consider whether paying the extra 15 or so dollars for a 3D blu ray which I did not care about was better than the less expensive Blu Ray version that correctly identified itself as the 1.33 aspect ratio.This is an unfortunate case of a product not conforming to the online description.I have not opened the case or broken the wrapping because I think I will return it... but the inconvenience is a trade-off.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A4ZD0039ULBZY	"D. Weissmann ""dweissmann5"""	"In response to a previous post, I'll share the following:1. Films WERE released in stereo prior to 1953. MGM recorded several of their musical numbers in stereo in the 1930's -- just to entertain themselves? I doubt it. The fact that Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940) was released in an early form of stereophonic sound only bears out my statement.2. When the soundtrack to TWOO was restored in the 1990's, the entire score was found recorded in several ""stems"", microphones placed throughout the studio that would certainly provide a stereophonic sound. Why the powers that be chose to release the two CD soundtrack in mono is anyone's guess. (Perhaps because a few ""stems"" were missing, which is duly noted in the deluxe set's booklet. Missing or not, it could quite easily be mixed down into stereo mix -- if not quadraphonic or some other multi-track system.In fact, if memory serves correctly, the score HAS been mixed into stereo. The current single CD of the music and songs is in stereo. There's really a lot of stereo surrounding this project.Let's not put ""The Robe"" into a more important slot than it deserves."	5.0	Tiny corrections	2005-08-28	8	1	7

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2KFUCHHOKGD7O	"ED Detetcheverrie ""Q"""	Amazon recommends this for ages 3 to 6? Who decided that was a good idea? I think I was six when I first saw this movie and it left me with nightmares! I have never held any great affinity for the great classic Wizard because it traumatized me so, but then again, I was also terrified of the Snow White ride at Disney when I was about three. Everyone has to see it simply because it's such an integral part of our great American lifestyle--there are so many references and spinoffs concerning it, if you haven't seen or read the story everyone around you will think you're an idiot--but if you're with a child who's watching it for the first time, be sensitive to the fact that some of the stuff in it is rather disturbing, and be sure to talk about it afterwards with your little friend. Sorry, people, but this surreal stuff for kids (like Alice In Wonderland and Dr. Seuss) always makes me wonder what drugs the authors were taking when they conceived some of this stuff. I can endure Wizard and the like now and be bored, but a 3 to 6 year old might grow to fear flying monkeys for awhile or green witches who crumple and dissolve like salted garden slugs. Classic American weirdness. Was it really just a dream? Run, Toto, run! Why own it anyhow? It's played with a lot of pomp and hype at least once a year on regular tv. D'ya really need to see it more often than that?	2.0	Oh Great Oz, Grant Me Something Less Scary!	2002-03-20	27	5	22

I am reminded why I still remember so many scenes, lyrics, and charachters from this movie-it is one of the best movies ever made!  This is edition is a wonderful addition to any home movie collection.

The colors have never looked better. I went to see the theatrical re-release in 1998 and was disappointed as most ""chain"" theaters use bulbs of lower wattage so that they save money. What happens though is you get a muddier, darker look to movies which just doesn't do justice to ""The Wizard of Oz"". If you happened to be someone who viewed it in one of the bigger cities that had those big ""premieres"" you probably viewed with the right wattage bulbs and were blown away by the stellar copy showing. At any rate this movie and Judy Garland and cast are for now and forever more...And you won't find a better copy than this DVD offers. Not no how! To continue to correct some of you though-movies pre-1953 were not shot in widescreen that was a process that wasn't used in 1939. The screens then were square just like your tv set screen.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2F8VFP7BAPGY9	"Edward R. Fette ""E.R. Fette"""	"Reviewer: Edward R. Fette ""E.R. Fette"" (Los Angeles) - See all my reviewsthat The Wizard of Oz was filmed totally in B&W.; What have they been putting in that Pepto Bismo of yours, Scott? Poor thing, if you were a true fan of The Wizard of Oz like I am and so many of the reveiwers are here you would have known the reason the film was filmed in B&W; (with those scenes released in sepia) and Technicolor. I'll help you out with the words of John Fricke, from his wonderful narration of the film on the Ultimate Oz laser disc version: (Mr. Fricke is probably the consummate authority on the Wizard of Oz. He co-authored the Official 50th Anniversary Pictoral History of The Wizard of Oz, and is the author of 100 Years of Oz.)(As Dorothy opens the door to Oz) ""This is the moment of the film that took audiences and critics by surprise and by storm in 1939. It was at this point that the Wizard of Oz probably was first regarded as history making and as a film that could potentially change popular entertainment. It wasn't the first technicolor film, there had been earlier technicolor motion pictures. But the idea of contrasting Kansas with the land over the rainbow in color, was first inspired by L. Frank Baum's book. Although as I said the tornado takes Dorothy away almost immediately in the book, L. Frank Baum managed to use the word gray nine times in those couple of pages to describe Dorothy's surroundings and her aunt and uncle. It set up the song, 'Over the Rainbow' when Yip Harburg was looking for a peg on which to handle the transition of Dorothy's emotions from Kansas to Oz and certainly gave MGM the inspiration to do the Kansas scenes in black and white, although wash them for the 1939 release in that warm, brown, chocolate sepia tone that you've seen here in this restored version.""(From John Fricke's narration of the Wizard of Oz on the Ultimate Oz laser disc collection)So, you see, Scott. The movie studios haven't tampered with this classic film by ""colorizing"" it. Oz, as was pointed out by Mr. Fricke, was deliberately filmed just they way you saw it to show contrast between Kansas and the land of Oz. It was your misfortune to have veiwed the movie on a b&w; TV for so many years and not notice during the film credits that the movie was filmed in Technicolor. I hope that this has been some help for you and your confusion.(This review in reply to a review by Scott who gave a negative review of Oz on DVD)"	5.0	Amazing, that anyone could believe	1999-12-27	1	1	0

I loved Dorothy and her little dog, Toto, and her three new friends, Scarecrow, Tinman, and the cowardly lion. And most of all loved the music.  As I grew up and continued to watch the annual t.v. viewing of it, I was able to watch the whole thing but in Black and white! At the time it didn't bother me as I loved the fantasy of it all and it had appealed to me so well.  Then one year, I was invited to my best friend's house to watch it, well, all I can say is WOW.  The colors! They actually made the story all that more my favorite movie.Through the years I watched it less and less but always treasured it as my absolute favorite movie of all time.  My husband bought me this dvd, and it is just an amazing feast for the eyes.  With oodles of extras to watch, even some parts that originally met the editting floor show up here, this is just a perfect dvd to add to your collection.Even if the dvd didn't have all that supplemental stuff, I would still love it. The movie just sets the imagination free and let's you go with it.  I sing a long with the entire cast and have a ball!  The witch doesn't scare me anymore, and I watch it on a 42 inch screen so I am getting a pretty good showing.I highly recommend this dvd. It's a perfect family film and for any fans of older movies, this is the one to have.  It will not disappoint in the least. I've only met one person in my entire life that didn't like this movie.  What's not to like?  You have a good story, motivation, fun songs to sing a long with, awesome acting by all in it, and glorious cinematography. It's a wonderful film that will remain forever in my heart and always remind me of my youth.""There's no place like home"", Dorothy says.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1ARCH8VXO6PLT	"E. Karas ""Eric"""	This film showcases the american studio system of the past at it's best. They had the greatest craftsman, musicians, actors, singers, designers, costumers etc etc etc all working together to create magic and in this case it was a complete success.All the elements work to make this a joyous spectacle that never fails to touch your heart.It still succeeds because it is not too sweet - who can forget Margaret Hamilton's scary Witch, the terrifying flying Monkeys or even the scary Wizard. (well scary until he is unmasked)Another reason this film holds up so well are that the supporting cast (Jack Haley, Ray Bolger &amp; Bert Lahr) were just incredibly talented comedians. They really shine even the 100th time through.Need I say anything about Judy Garland in this film? Her performance is spot on terrific. She is the one who makes this whole fantasy believable without being sickeningly sweet. If there is any doubt she was a great actress just rewatch the scene of her crying in the witch's castle. Heartbreaking. (and her singing voice was just incredible but you know that)This is my favorite film - the one film I would take with me to a dessert island.	5.0	Best American Film Ever Made	2004-05-25	3	2	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2N1EQWZ1Z4IMM	"E. K. B. ""eblunt777"""	"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: You may ask yourself why you need The Wizard of Oz 75th Anniversary Edition two-disc DVD. That's a fair question. It's in the sentence there...two-disc. As DVDs become the heirlooms among families, the extras become better and better. Here, if for ""The Making of"", and no other reason, you should order this immediately.But there is more. Four hours of features. And the film has been meticulously restored; sound and image. The result is HD TV perfection. The film, born in 1939, looks as if it opened this past summer at your local megaplex. A dynamic crisp, clear, picture dances in step with all that glorious music you probably remember and want to share.The audio commentary is wonderfully unique. They have a scholar sharing gourmet facts along with vocal clips from the cast over laid the scenes.And, if you're watching as an adult, you'll realize this film basically started the journey film. Starting with ""Over the Rainbow,"" we are shown Dorothy longs for more. She gets her wish...has a tremendous adventure filled with would-be disasters, hoops to jump through, meets helpful follow seekers, flying monkeys, and good and bad witches. But those events only lead her to an epiphany we have been watching on a big screen since; There is no place like home, and we carry with us the power to find our joy at all times. Sniff.Story goes...Young Dorothy (Judy Garland) is having a really tough day. Her beloved dog has been snagged by the town's local hag (Margaret Hamilton). The precious pup bit the bitty and she has pulled strings to have the pup destroyed.Fear not. The dog, Toto, gets back to the doll and the two run away. About an hour into the plan, Dorothy meets a traveling talk smith who looks into his crystal ball and sends the would be run away home.As she arrives a tunnel of storm is fast approaching. Dorothy is stuck taking cover in her home and the winds whisk her away.When the storm passes she awakens in a strange land. She is greeted with cheer and happiness by a small hamlet of small folks. See it just so happens that while spinning about upon entry her home landed right smack bam on top of a pesky wicked witch.All this is explained by a good witch, Glenda (Billy Burke), just before the completely and sincerely dead wicked witch's sister, WWoW, arrives.The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton again) wants the powerful ruby slippers from her dead sister's feet. But, faster than you can say Jiminy Cricket, Glenda has hocus pocus'd them onto Dorothy's toes.Poor Dorothy; All she wants is to get home! Now she has a big green meanie after her and is told only the great and powerful Wizard can help her. She must follow the yellow brick road from Munchkinland to Emerald City where this wonderful wiz of a wiz is.Off she goes. Shortly she runs into a talking scarecrow (Ray Bolger) who would love a brain and maybe this great wizard could manage the task. A few bricks later the two meet a tin man (Jack Haley), long stuck solid. He is invited to join the road trip to get a heart. Dancing forth over more golden footage, the three are ambushed by a bully who's really a big cowardly lion (Bert Lahr). He admits he could do with a tad more (some, any) courage. What the heck, the Wizard is such a great man, surely he can help this pussy cat get a powerful roar too...The Wicked Witch follows the quartet via crystal balls and poppy fields of sleepy dust. She has a plenty hurdles put before them. She wants those pretty slippers and the little dog too.The story is famous to all who have seen. Each character warms your heart as their stories are unfolded in song. The features share how studio execs wanted to ax ""Over the Rainbow"" due to time. Crazy talk. To new generations, no more should be said - they need to experience this iconic treasure chest of film; Adrian did every costume, there were about 12 writers, five directors, a dozen infamous missteps en route to completion. In other words it's as magical a film as you can find - if for just existing at all.In the ""Making of"" special feature, you learn all about the production. In another you learn about the legacy of the film and how it became an iconic part of American culture - they talk about women's' empowerment in here too. There are 4.5-ish hours of fun-filled frolic here.Buy it!"	5.0	A Wonerful Fim with Tons of Extras!	2013-10-18	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3FHSLWEMH7JD8	"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana"""	It is difficult to comment about a film this well known - speaking of Judy Garland's wonderful voice and the magical (in fact, rather farcical) scenes seems practically overkill. Yet this film, which bears little resemblance to the Oz books (where Dorothy actually IS in Oz, not dreaming it all), is particularly delightful because it &quot;laughs at itself.&quot; Back in the days when no kid missed Danny Kaye's annual hosting of the televised version (though no one had a colour television, so much of the Oz set was rather lost), one of the best parts was seeing which glaring but funny reference one caught which one had missed in less mature years (say, at 6 rather than 8.)Of course, once the Wicked Witch is dead, one wonders why Dorothy still wants to return to Kansas... but, on second thought, one who would risk approaching the witch's castle for the sake of home sweet home clearly is determined. Right from the beginning, when Dorothy's farm hand (later Scarecrow) tells her she acts as if she &quot;has no brains,&quot; the die for references is cast. &quot;If I Were King of the Forest&quot; captures the wry yet slapstick mood best of all.	5.0	Love the &quot;inside jokes&quot;	2001-08-17	3	2	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	APPIPRRQR55EC	Emily Chase	I have been enchanted as I now watch the movie as an adult.  It is not just a story about a girl from Kansas trying to get back home - actually, that was added into the movie: &quot;There's no place like home&quot; wasn't in the book even.  I think it was a story of things that we want, and that we imagine these things may be granted by the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.  The scarecrow wants a brain, the tinman a heart, and the lion courage.  On their journey off to see the wizard, they encounter the wicked witch of the west - who is determined to get the ruby slippers off of Dorothy's feet.  Now, the thing I am puzzled by is at the beginning, Glinda is the one who reminds the wicked witch about the shoes.  Then she is the one who places them on Dorothy's feet: &quot;There they are and there they'll stay.&quot;  Had she not had the shoes, her journey to the wizard would not have been so troublesome.  Not to mention that the &quot;good witch&quot; sent Dorothy on a journey to a phony wizard.  I wonder now if there was some kind of irony in that - since she was also the one who in the end tells Dorothy that all she has to do is click her heels together and say &quot;there 's no place like home.&quot;  While the movie is totally a classic I love and will watch over and over again, I am wondering about the book:  Were the &quot;ruby slippers&quot; (which were silver in the novel) as magical - and - if there was no &quot;no place like home&quot; in the novel then I am wondering how Dorothy got back to Kansas.  I think that because each time I watch this film I realize something new, it will always remain one of my favorite movies ever.	5.0	The Wonderful Movie of Oz	2004-07-04	2	1	1

It's about a girl that wears shiny shoes, and the wicked witch wants her shoes. Then, one day the witch gets the monkeys to get Dorothy's shoes. The monkeys catch the lion, the girl, the scarecrow, and the tin man. Find out what happens when the monkeys catch them.The part when it was the most terrible was when they got massages, and then they do nothing after that. It was so boring! ""Come on!"" said my mother. Then my dad said that this was the worst movie ever for him.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A31QLSGDGB30H5	Eric Paddon	The ranting I've given is for the DVD, not the film which is five stars and one of the greatest of all time.  If you've owned the previous DVD release of this film, and also have the magnificent &quot;Ultimate Oz&quot;  laser disc set, I can guarantee you, you will be in for a disappointment  with this new DVD release from Warners.  The incredible deep color of the  film's look in the &quot;Ultimate Oz&quot; set is shockingly gone from this  transfer.  Now instead of looking magical, Oz looks just....well, normal.  John Fricke's wonderful audio commentary has been eliminated too (probably  because it is technically licensed by MGM/UA video, which no longer owns  the rights to the film), and while the rest of the supplements are  duplicated there is one incredible goof that I can't believe no one else  has caught on to before. For the &quot;Jitterbug&quot; deleted scene  supplement Warners has erroneously used the stills/home movie segment and  set them not to the finished song track (as laser disc supplement does) but  instead to the choreography rehearsal track where we hear the flat monotone  of Donna Massin standing in for Judy Garland with the rest of the cast to a  piano track instead of the orchestrated version.  It makes for a very  unpleasant looking juxtaposition and left me feeling that I hadn't gained a  thing with the DVD release.  I plan on sticking to the laser disc set  myself.  And for a better picture that shows the magic of Oz as it  *should* be seen snatch a copy of the out of print MGM DVD while you still  can!	3.0	Botched DVD Presentation Of  A Five Star Classic	2000-06-16	110	93	17

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	Even though it's not one of my personal favorites, I can still acknowledge The Wizard of Oz as a timeless classic. Yes, you simply cannot escape the fact that this is a very well-made film. Take a look at the sets, and how incredibly crafted they are. Examine all the colors before the tornado sequence: there hasn't been this much color in a film of the late 30's (except, of course, Gone with the Wind). Listen to the music, and realize why they are so memorably loved. It's a beautiful-looking film with some creative sets and spectacular music. But here lies the problem that I have with the movie, and I'm sure I'm going to get many negative points for this. The tone of the film is very light-hearted. In fact, it's so light-hearted that it's almost irritating. Granted, it's not as cheery as the musical called Salad Days, but the overall light tone of the film is a bit off-putting. I know it was intended to be like this when it was made, but still, it looks a bit dated. It does have some dark moments (what with the flying monkeys and all) but in my honest opinion, I do feel that this film doesn't hold up with its fairly light tone. But does that make this a bad movie? Certainly not. Like I said, it's not one of my favorites, but that doesn't stop me from calling it a great movie. The look of the film is dazzling, the music is brilliant, the characters are likable, and the overall message of the film works very well. Despite the one problem I have with the film, I would still recommend The Wizard of Oz.	4.0	"""We're off to see the wizard! The wonderful wizard of Oz!"""	2010-03-12	4	1	3
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AIIG6XUI1LM3X	Eric S. Richard	I'm being generous giving this any stars. The original 2D version is the same, flawed 2009 Blu-ray featuring the altered 1998 track. The audio deletes a portion of one of Judy's lines, a digital glitch of dropped frames (fixed for the 3D version), scratches during the opening credits, etc. WB knows about these flaws and refuses to fix them.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3M3DO4VRFERXA	Erma Jean Hanson	I had to do some fast talking to get my 4- and 6-year-old grandsons to watch some old move called The Wizard of Oz. Of course Dorothy starts out in black and white Kansas, not the most exciting place in the world. But just before we lost them both, the movie switched to full color and the Munchkin Lollipop Guild piqued their interest. The 4-year-old loved the scarecrow, tin man and lion, but what really grabbed the 6-year-old video game action dude was the wicked witch and her flying monkeys. Before this classic was over both boys were glued to my laptop monitor. I was surprised that the movie didn't drag as I feared it might.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ADWQPR0LJD4J	"ERSInk . com ""Eric"""	For better or worse, 3D is all the rage right now. I thought I'd seen it all when a copy of Hitchcock's &#34;Dial M for Murder 3D&#34; crossed my path. Words can't begin to describe how ridiculous the idea is to me. Why does a classic movie like that need to be seen in three dimensions?With every vaulted Disney film being converted to 3D, it was only a matter of time before one of the greatest masterpieces of all time got the treatment. If it worked for the prequel, why wouldn't it work for the original? Therefore, it's no surprise Warner Bros. has released &#34;The Wizard of Oz 3D&#34; on Blu-ray.I'll be honest. I don't have a 3D TV, so I didn't see it in that format. I'm sure it looks just as good as any post-converted 3D movie. There will be added depth to the picture for sure. The witch's broom of fire will stick out of the screen and other classic moments in the film will leap out at the viewer.My review of &#34;The Wizard of Oz 3D&#34; will concentrate on the high-definition conversion of the film presented for its 75th Anniversary in 2D. First, let it be known this is the same version released in 2009 for its 70th Anniversary. Of course the picture looks better than it ever has before. I have to say I was expecting there to be a little less grain than there is. I'm sure there's no way to fix that when it comes to converting 70-year-old film to high-definition. I'm just happy it's been preserved and cleaned up as well as it can be for future audiences to enjoy.The 5.1 surround sound is something filmmakers in 1939 never even dreamed of or thought possible. It would be a great pleasure to see how they would have reacted to their under-estimated masterpiece now with the vivid sound effects and musical numbers bounding out at them from all directions. I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but even I make an exception in the case of &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; The &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; song is a bit tedious for me, but all the upbeat songs are a lot of fun.Consumers will be very happy with the special features included on &#34;The Wizard of Oz 3D&#34; Blu-ray. Bonus material on the 3D disc include a 69-minute documentary entitled &#34;The Making of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz&#34; narrated by actor Martin Sheen. There's also audio commentary provided by the late Sydney Pollack. It's enhanced with interview clips from &#34;Oz&#34; historian and author John Fricke; actress Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) and her son Hamilton Meserve; actor Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow); actor Jack Haley (the Tin Man); John and Jane Lahr (children of actor Bert Lahr, the Cowardly Lion); performer Buddy Ebsen; Munchkin actor, Jerry Maren and many more. The isolated music and effects track and original mono track are found as well.The 2D Blu-ray features the above audio commentary, isolated music and effects track and original mono track. It also includes Angela Lansbury narrating biographies of the cast and reading a condensed version of L. Frank Baum's book accompanied with original art and presented much like a motion comic. Original recordings and outtakes, Sing-Along Mode, still galleries, trailers, a theater broadcast, and radio promotions round out the bonus material.&#34;The Wizard of Oz 3D&#34; Blu-ray is the perfect combo pack for classic film collectors since you get the movie in both 3D and 2D versions. Everyone needs to experience the movie at least once in 3D. Even though I haven't yet, I plan on finding a way to do so. The 2D version gives viewers the best possible presentation of the movie available right now. It's a must-own item for any family's home entertainment library.	4.0	"""The Wizard of Oz 3D"" Presents the Classic in a New Dimension"	2013-10-15	4	2	2

Granted, the clarity (resolution) of the image is fairly high, but its a black and white (not color) image, just like you could get on any standard blu-ray disk of this film for half the money. Hence, unless you're into 3D, I'd pass on this one - just get the cheaper blu-ray version.	3.0	WIZARD OF O.K.	2013-10-08	13	2	11

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A4Q7OIBJW4UC2	Fang5	The idea of coverting classic films to an improved visual Blu-ray format is a good one but can also be disappointng.  Claimed display improvement on HDMI screens with Blu-Ray is not a constant and varies with different titles.  To justify the added cost one also has to consider the limitations.  There are variables like the specifications on equipment as is the number of compatible players in use.  The majority of individuals still do not have blu-ray players, so the limitation is with circulation.  Will it work on Mom's DVD player, friends, etc...  Owners of Blu-ray players/recorders, myself included, like the improved features.  Usually blu-ray owners can see the difference on an HDMI display and can justify the added cost.  Take the movie 'Gladiator'(2000), you see the improved display.  But a classic movie like the Wizard of OZ converted to blu-ray can leave one straining to see the difference between blu-ray and with traditional DVD format(s).df	4.0	1939 Wizard of OZ Movie in Blu-Ray	2011-08-07	3	0	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AABEMOX0O3PMP	Figowitz	Known to all,  this is the story of Dorothy Gale and her  journey to the magical land of Oz. She meets a Scarecrow who needs a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage.  The most popular film of all time , seen by over a billion people. It's timelessness is proof enough of its value . Certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years, but still most beloved. In 1998 rereleased on the big screen: magic. And admittedly the most important film of my life: As a child I was obsessed with the film and only a little less now.	5.0	The Best Version of the Wizard of Oz yet	2006-08-22	8	5	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3B42K3RQ0U3E3	Flamanar	I enjoyed this set.  The amount of extras is amazing.  The transfer looks great...until near the end of the movie (when it goes back to sepiatone after Dorothy 'returnes' to Kansas). There's a big fat hair on the lense of one of the cameras that presents itself on Dorothy's elbow while she's lying in bed. This happens in the scenes where this particular camera is filming from the side of Dorothy's bed toward the window and her relatives (everyone's in the frame). Pretty dissappointing after watching the special feature on how much care they took editing that kind of stuff out.  I wasn't even looking for stuff they missed.  It just really jumped out at me and now I can't watch the last part without my eyes being drawn there.  5 stars, but deducted 1 star for missing such a big artifact in one of the movies most important scenes.	4.0	Great set...even with the big hair they missed	2005-11-13	11	6	5

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A8V74RZY8TIRJ	"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher"""	"Words cannot describe the joy of watching this beloved classic as a child.  In the day of  ""tonight's special ABC, NBC, or CBS movie event"" films like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" and ""Gone With The Wind,"" were truly TV magic.  Remember these films were not readily available on vhs or dvd as they are today.  And movie theaters did not show them after their initial release.  ""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of the most sweet and inspirational films that has ever been produced.  Judy Garland's ""Dorothy' is played to perfection and the songs are pure magic.  The movie plays as a stage production, an MGM musical extravaganza, and a dreamlike fantasy that sweeps the viewer over the rainbow and into one adventure after another.  We join Dorothy as she encounters her fantastic friends, The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), The Tin Man (Jack Haley), and The Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) all characters are played with brilliant performances.  The b&w sepia tone of the beginning, as Dorothy struggles with the cruel Ms. Gulch (Margaret Hamilton) who comes for the beloved Toto, is a wonderful idea, as many films were filmed in b&w at the time.  This helped add to the beauty of the colorful Land of Oz, as Dorothy leaves the b&w interior of the farm house, which has just crash landed in the glorious Land of Oz, and steps into the bright and shiny world of Technicolor Oz.  Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, is played wonderfully by Billie Burke, (who I also loved in The Man Who Came to Dinner).  Glinda comes to Dorothy's aide throughout the movie and protects Dorothy from Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West.  Margaret Hamilton plays a really wicked Wicked Witch!  She's so believable in this part and also does well in the film's opening scene as Ms. Gulch.  This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies, not only of the late 1930's, but of Hollywood's cinema history!  I don't believe David O' Selnicks masterpiece, ""Gone With The Wind"" has been taken as good of care as this film.  ""Gone With The Wind"" was made the same year as ""Oz,"" which was 1939, and deservingly won all the major categories at the Oscars.  However, as I recently watched the 4-disc collector's release of ""Gone With The Wind,"" I couldn't help but notice several flaws, including color smears that wobbled down the screen (especially in the ""evening prayers"" scene), glitches and sound clicks from time to time.  I must say this 3-disc edition of ""The Wizard of Oz"" is totally amazing and well worth the price.  The dvd's are awesome in picture quality and sound!  The color picture cards and the booklets are a very nice addition for die-hard collectors of ""Oz"" memorabilia, like me!  If you're a classic cinema buff or a long time fan of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" this dvd release is a must!"	5.0	"""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" -THE ULTIMATE MUSICAL FANTASY!"	2006-11-29	5	5	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	"Coming from the great year in film of 1939 this is one of the quintessential musical, fantasy, and family films. It has some of the most famous songs around, a memorable cast including Judy Garland, and serves as a constant reminder that there's no place like home. Furthermore whenever we think villain the film's Wicked Witch is almost always ingrained in our minds. The story is adapted from the L. Frank Baum novel and it follows a young Kansas girl named Dorothy who lives on a farm with her aunt, uncle, the dog Toto, and three farm hands. When a big tornado hits, Dorothy becomes unconscious and when she wakes up she finds herself in Oz. There she encounters the good witch and the land of the Munchkins. As Dorothy begins her journey to the Great Oz to get home, she meets several unique characters. First there is a scarecrow who wants a brain, then a tin man who desires a heart, and finally a lion who aspires for courage. Together they travel to Oz and the wizard tells them they must kill the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy finds herself eventually in captivity but her new found friends rally to save her and inadvertently kill the Witch. When she gets back to Kansas Dorothy realizes that there is truly ""no place like home."" With iconic characters, memorable lines, and infectious songs it is easy to understand how this film became a classic. The added color does not hurt and also the special effects are not too shabby for 1939."	4.0	Wizard of Oz (1939)	2013-06-01	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"Calling this the best ever family entertainment flick is no hype or exaggeration.  Just as it happened way back 70 years ago, trying to keep up with Disney's ""Snow White"" has been a blessing for fans as now after ""Snow White""'s Platinum Edition treatment which included DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio enhancements plus visual restoration, we get a similar treatment unfortunately without the DTS option and yet I had to struggle for the first half hour to try and find any visual imperfections to this restoration but I had to give up as I could find none!  The visual effects, especially the tornado scenes still amaze me at just what they were capable of special effects-wise all those years ago.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround was a real plus for me and went a long way in bringing this all-time classic into the 21st century.  If it's so good already, I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version would be and I await the day of that release with bated breath!  Like a true classic, this movie has aged very, very well and has passed the test of time.  Whoever did the casting should have received an Oscar as I thought all the actors did very, very well.  Judy Garland was perfect for the role of Dorothy and Bert Laer was excellent in his role as the Cowardly Lion.The Special Features deserve honorable mention as well; we get a great behind-the-scenes documentary narrated by Angela Lansbury who also did something similar for the ""Snow White"" restoration dvd as well.  There's also a History of Oz, Deleted Scenes and many interviews with the cast.  Every child should have a chance to see this film and with all the great restoration work that has been done on this dvd, there is no other perfect time to get this dvd.  This a without doubt one of the best ever movies ever made.Very highly recommended!Updated 20 April 2011:Amazon doesn't allow me to review this separately and so I have to do this here.  The blu-ray version of this film is simply excellent!  After watching the dvd which was already very good, I am amazed at how much better this film looks on 1080p!  It also sounds very good and this blu-ray is certainly worth the upgrade from the dvd.Very, very highly recommended!"	5.0	A Timeless Classic Given a New Lease of Life!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K	Fred	I used to have this movie on dvd, but gave it to my older sister when she was over once. Well, i bought this mistakenly thinking it also included the dvd version as one of the 2 extra discs, i guess i got confused with all the versions they offer on Blu-ray now. Anyway i don't have the dvd version anymore to directly compare the versions, but to me this Blu-ray version seems very grainy. I know it's old materials they are working with but the colors look drab and dull, and like i said it's extremely grainy looking. Certain scenes look better than others but it seems like the dvd upscaled almost as well, i'd have to buy the dvd version yet again to compare the two.I think the most surprising thing is how dull the colors look. The picture seems dark and the contrast is low overall. I guess perhaps older color films are harder to work with?	3.0	Expected more	2011-07-08	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	THE WIZARD OF OZ is a paradox: although made with a juvenile audience in mind, the completed film has an unexpectedly adult sensibility, and children enjoy it on one level while adults find it a considerably more complex experience.  Like most fairytales, OZ deals in archetypes--but instead of merely referencing such archetypes, OZ specifies them in a uniquely literal way and transforms them into a brilliantly beautiful yet extremely menacing tale of innocence lost.  It is a surprisingly psychological film, and any one foolish enough to scratch its surface will soon find themselves dealing with more &quot;isms&quot; than a roomful of research psychiatrists could explain.Fancy &quot;isms&quot; aside, OZ is a tremendous amount of fun.  For one thing, it MOVES: the story begins with a tone of breathless anticipation, and the film somehow manages to maintain that level of energy throughout its entire running time with never a lag.  Although one or two of the famed special effects seem a bit dated, most are still exciting.  This is particularly true of the famous tornado sequence, the first half of which (in which Dorothy races the storm home) still outstrips any special effects storm footage made to date.  The look of the film, from the rich sepia tones of a painfully literal Kansas to the Technical vibrancy of a very surrealistic Oz, is as artful as a dozen famous painters rolled into one--and need we really mention the music, so famous that virtually every man, woman, and child in the western world can humm most of the score?But all of this would be by-the-way if not for a truly amazing cast.  Judy Garland is a remarkable Dorothy, with one foot in innocent childhood wonder and the other as firmly planted in a very sophistocated and extremely adult sense of humor (watch her very subtle series of double-takes during the Munchkin sequence), and the success of the film largely rests upon the success of her own performance.  But this in no way disparages the rest of the cast, which plays broadly but with considerable self-depreciating humor; every one is sure to have their own favorite among the famous performances by Bolger, Lahr, Haley, Hamilton, Burke, and Morgan, and all are equally brilliant.Although the original MGM DVD (now out of print) has been greatly praised, the Warner Bros. DVD is the widely available standard.  Whatever its failings in comparison to the MGM DVD, it offers picture and sound quality far beyond anything seen on any VHS.  There are also a number of extra bells and whistles that range from the very interesting, such as the Angela Lansbury-hosted documentary on the making of the film, to the ho-hum, such as old newspaper advertisements for the film.  But whatever the merits of these extras, the real reason to buy the DVD is for the film itself: THE WIZARD OF OZ is as timeless, fascinating, disturbing, and beautiful today as it ever was and probably will always be.  Put the kids to bed and watch the film with a critical eye--and you'll be amazed at what you've missed.	5.0	OZ: An Adult Film That Kids Enjoy	2002-01-06	3	2	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3F0XXV23ONHOZ	Gary Odom	The fakery of this bizarre classic fantasy is fully revealed in Blu-ray. The illusions that made this film about cluelessness and deception wondrous are replaced by stark shots of mediocre makeup and painted sets. In a way, seeing through the fantasy in the making of the film completes the circle of the story itself.The film is grainy, and presented in TV 4/3 format, not the original widescreen presentation that the movie deserves. A classic Hollywood cheat there, fitting for this film in a way.If you already own this in DVD, and think it is lovely entertainment, you need not shell out for Blu-ray and thereby fully disabuse yourself of the suspension of disbelief that makes such films enjoyable. The quality of the film is not improved. But if you want a clearer view of the proceedings, including surly munchkins and flying monkeys on strings, Blu-ray is for you.	3.0	deception revealed	2012-01-19	4	1	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AZXUYBGS0K78R	Gary Sundburg	If you can get this four disc blu-ray set at the right price, its worth it for the collectors watch alone if you collect this kind of stuff. The blu-ray pressing is wonderful. 30 years ago I was lucky enough to own a original IB technicolor 16mm print of this film and I can honestly say the blu-ray is as sharp or even sharper and the colors as vivid as the print I owned.  The extras are a mixed bag of older stuff that has been presented before in other formats along with some new stuff. And Warner Brothers should be ashamed to have put such a bad copy of the john ritter television production of The Dreamer of OZ for people to see. I have a vhs copy of this I made off the original tv broadcast almost 19 years ago that looks better. For those interested the disc (non blu-ray) of When the Lion Roars is a treat if your a fan of MGM movie history.  Overall a nice set with all of the extras.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AQRNI6QDWMWHL	Gehan Cooray	The Wizard of Oz is one brillaint movie. I LOVE the characters, the dialogue, the scenes, the songs and everything.......However, I still prefer the Wizard of Oz Original Book by L. Frank Baum better than this  version......I mean, there are tons of thrilling adventures and a whole  host more fo thrilling characters in the book, that arent in the movie....I  would say its a 7 seven star, but a 10 star book.  Anyway, if your buying  this NOT-TO-BE-MISSED timeless classic, which will enhance viewers of all  ages.....(You may want to keep watching this non-stop untill you get tired  of it, which I doubt you will), I also recommend reading the book, if you  havent.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2FDW0X0TAEYYF	George Sarant	This film is timeless, and holds up as well as anything made today. Under the steady hand of Victor Fleming, (who also made Gone With the Wind in the same year!) it is a masterpiece of fantasy that may never be equaled. This is one of the few cases where a Hollywood film actually improves upon the book. Critical blu-ray viewers should keep in mind that this is a restoration, not an enhancement, so you do see film grain along with the sharp images. One again has to marvel at how all of this could be done over a period of months. The package includes a lot of material about L. Frank Baum the author, including an excellent TV movie about his life. There are also some fascinating Oz movies made by Baum himself starting in 1914 as well as a profile of Victor Fleming.  There is a very nice production book, a reproduction of the original 1939 campaign book, and a copy of the original movie budget. There is a good amount of material about the Munchkins along with a series of recollections about the production. About the only thing superfluous is a 70th anniversary watch included with the package. On a separate disc there is also the 6 hour documentary MGM:When the Lion Roars (which was also included with the Gone With the Wind 70th anniversary package). For anyone who loves this movie this edition is a must-have. Everyone else will see it as you never have before, and certainly something that will be viewed over and over again.	5.0	A beautiful package for a great film.	2010-01-31	1	1	0

It makes the whole Wizard of Oz overall rating go down.  I have read thousands of reviews on Amazon, and none compare to the sheer anger I get by reading this guy's review. How can he think the whole film was in black and white? ARgggghhh! In fact I read his review several days ago and decided to watch the film again on  DVD. I couldn't. Do you know why? I couldn't get the thought of someone being so naive to think its all done in black and white. Truthfully, the guy has actually ruined my enjoyment of the film.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A20K570CN1QBS1	Giovanni Abrate	What can you do to a much loved classic to make it even better?  In this case the conversion from 2D to 3D provides an all-new viewing experience. The conversion is superb! The depth is quite natural and has an incredible range. There is no ghosting (except for a couple of seconds in a minor scene) and the depth gives a whole new grandeur to the interior scenes. One of the flaws of the original is the fact that the exterior scenes are, in fact, filmed in a studio (for various reasons, not least the lighting requirements of then-day Technicolor...)and the painted backgrounds always looked two-dimensional. The 3D conversion does not simply recreate the scene as it was (in the studio) when the movie was filmed: the conversion also processes the painted backgrounds and adds depth to the painted scenes. The overall effect on the visuals of the movie is fantastic! Scenes that previously looked like they were filmed in a puppet theatre, now look deep and three-dimensional. The work of the 3D conversion director is absolutely superb. No matter how many times you have watched this movie, you'll be surprised at the beauty of OZ! If you have a 3D TV, buy this movie. It must be the best 3D movie ever. This movie was made for 3D: now it can finally be enjoyed in all its glory!	5.0	3D gives this a new life!	2013-10-03	7	7	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A37BTU85F17716	"Glenn R. Smith ""WHO FREAK"""	Have seen this film probably 50 times! Played on TV every year for many, many years! Loved it as a kid and still do. Bought it to add to my collection. I remember when I introduced this to my oldest granddaughter one day. She always wanted to watch a VHS tape she called &#34;The Dinosaur Movie!&#34; (&#34;Land Before Time&#34;). She was in the bedroom watching that movie. When it was over she came into the family room where I was watching TV and said the movie was over. I asked what she wanted to watch next and she said &#34;The Dinosaur Movie!&#34;. I said &#34;You just watched it! Let's watch something different. OK?&#34; She says &#34;No! I wanna watch &#34;The Dinosaur Movie!&#34;&#34; I said &#34;Come on I'll put something in I'm sure you'll love!&#34; So I put in &#34;The Wizard of OZ&#34;. She had never seen it before and I was sure she'd love it just like every other kid in America did including me!So I told her to sit there on the floor and watch it. Every few minutes I would check on her by peeking through the crack/space with the door slightly open. I did this several times and each time I could see she was enthralled with the film. Then one time she saw me peeking and said &#34;Look Papa! Flying monkees Papa! Flying monkees!&#34; I always wished I had had a video camera to record that look of absolute amazement and joy on her little face! Makes me emotional now remembering her at that time. She stll loves the film and the Dinosaur movie too. I gave her the DVD to the Dinosaur movie for her 18th birthday! She loved it!When I was in college in 1970 I had a friend who insisted that the wicked witch was played by Jim Nabors. Of course my friend took too much LSD so he was just a little strange.

But more than that, the color in Blue Ray is superb and the 3D in many parts is exciting. No, it's not like having a dinosaur jump out into the middle of your living room, but having that extra dimension does add to the quality of this classic film. It moves much faster than having an interruption ever 10 minutes or so, and my wife even commented, &#34;Wow, they sure got to the Emerald City pretty fast.&#34; Of course, she forgot they had to depart again to go off and slay a wicked witch, but the lion and scarecrow and tin man and Dorothy did this in short order.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A19NLU301K2AWX	"G. Matot ""GMS"""	Got mine today, watched it right away. It's a good 3D conversion, comparable to the conversion of the 1996 film Titanic to 3D. Very well done. Picture quality is normal for bluray. Yes, I feel it's worth it if you are someone that likes 3D converted movies.I noticed a couple of things. First off let me say that making this film back in the 1930's was far more sophisticated than most people realize. As a kid I pictured scenes like those around the introduction of the scarecrow were just as they appeared on TV every year around Thanksgiving. It was filmed on a soundstage with fake corn and trees and a painted wall for a background. Later on I saw still photos that lots of the sets were matte paintings and most of the set was blue-screen. You can always see where the yellow brick road stops being floor and starts being painting. I understood that even as a child. What I later learned is that the actual sets were much smaller than I first thought. In some shots only the road, curbs, and grass immediately next to the curbs are actually there, the rest is blue screen and paintings.But there's much more to the movie than that. There's a whole collection of sound effects, today they are called Foley Artists in the credits. This bluray comes with a separate soundtrack that is nothing but music and sound effects (Foley artist work). So you can watch the film in 3D with just the sound effects, no dialog. I had no idea how much sound was overlapped and faked back in the 1930's. Very interesting to watch and spoil the magic of this film. The original mono soundtrack is also available to use.In scenes like the one mentioned above, even in the far backgrounds, when converted into 3D they also added depth to the backgrounds, which was totally unexpected and really neat. Watch the line of fir looking trees on the left side of the screen as Dorothy meets and be-friends the scarecrow, how they have distance between them and the rolling hills way in the back. So much attention to detail in this movie.They must have spent months working on the Munchkinland scenes!The Tin Man carries his axe through most of the film. This release makes it look much closer to the viewer than most anything else in the movie. The conversion makes it look like it was usually the closest object to the camera for lots of the movie, perhaps exaggerating how far he really held it from his body.When Mrs Gulch rides up to the house in Kansas there is a simple wire fence along the dirt road. The top wire seems to run at neck height for most of her short ride. This movie really makes the wire stand out since it's the closest thing to the camera for that entire shot, along with a few fence posts. Never really noticed it before.The picture quality is just like the already existing bluray version of this 1939 film. It's all cleaned up and color corrected. I thought it looked a tiny bit dark in 3D. All in all, a nice addition for your 3D collection.	4.0	3D Bluray Version 2013	2013-10-02	14	13	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A20OWYUGZ5W2CF	G. Miles	If you are expecting a crystal clear picture as if the movie was shot within the last year or so, this edition of the Wizard of Oz might be disappointing.  I was pleased with the total package, however.  And the actual movie is a nice addition to my collection, even if the movie was not filmed with High Definition, blue-ray television in mind.  I have and will recommend this movie to others if the price remains as it is on Amazon or is reduced to an even lower price.  The description of the extra features is listed elsewhere, but I was pleased with the small hardbound book featuring each major character in the movie.	4.0	Wizard of Oz 70th anniversary edition blu-ray	2010-01-07	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3FBTJCCNQXW2U	Goldenroom	Hurry up folks and buy this new Wizard of OZ DVD on Tuesday. Dont forget to get the super duper special 5 disk mega collection 2 years from now...This is a cool set for anyone who doesnt own the normal 1 disk DVD already, otherwise save your money. The 1 disk special edition was phenomenal.I give the greedy corporate machine 1 star for it's greed. I give Wizard of Oz 5 stars because it's one of the greatest movies ever. Oz had better special effects then most movies that came out 40 years later. Casting was great. Script was great. If I didnt love the movie so much I wouldnt mind the corporate machine bleeding it dry.haha, Im already getting negative responses. Whatever, throw your money away. The truth is that the 1 disk edition is almost equal to this 3 disk edition. This is just a big money making scheme. Hollywood cant make good movies anymore so they are leaching off the classics. go waste your hard earned money. How many times will you actually watch the extras??? uh, like once...Jessep was right. you cant handle the truth	5.0	American Capitalism at its finest	2005-10-23	56	26	30

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2NLDZ1ISQV2Z7	Grace	"Well, what else is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? For decades, this film has been highly regarded as an well-acted, sweet, and outstanding movie that is recommended for the entire family. I almost feel weird commenting on this one, because it's been around for so long and there's almost absolutely nothing about it that hasn't already been mentioned by other viewers. I guess all I will say is that it was an outstanding, AWESOME movie, and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. This isn't the type of movie that easily scares young children, and that's good because so many movies that are aimed for little kids end up becoming too intense. ""The Wizard of Oz"" doesn't miss its target audience. Glinda, the Witch of the North is enchanting, the Munchkins are so cute, and Judy Garland does a wonderful job in her role as Dorothy. But we all know that. This is a movie that's destined to remain a well-loved classic for all the rest of time!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWPardon me for a moment:  I'm three or four or five.  The year is 1981, '82 or '83, and I'm watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" for the first time mesmerized.  I was not aware this movie was made way back in 1939, and I didn't even care that a portion of it was in black and white.  I loved it, was of course scared by it, and wanted to watch it on an unending loop.I still love this movie.  The performances are perfect, the songs are amazing and the chemistry between Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley power the movie from beginning to end.  Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West is primal, whether just having made an appearance in Munchkinland or screaming at her winged monkeys.  In particular, the shot of her standing in her castle window silhouetted as the monkeys fly by in shadow is one of the most effective shots in movie history.  It couldn't be done better with all the computers in the world trying to visualize it.The songs, by E.Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen, do not call attention to themselves in the brash way of a musical but it is impossible to imagine the movie without them.  From ""Over The Rainbow"" to ""Follow The Yellow Brick Road"" and even a brief chant like ""Lions And Tigers And Bears,"" this is one of the perfect marriages of music to film.Most people have heard the casting stories of how Shirley Temple was considered for Dorothy and Buddy Ebsen was actually cast as The Tin Woodsman before being replaced by Jack Haley.  The cast that did eventually fall into place is one of the most perfect casts in movie history.  Judy Garland leads as Dorothy Gale.  Ray Bolger is magical as The Scarecrow, giving the complete performance of song, dance, and acting prowess.  Bert Lahr is irreplaceable as The Cowardly Lion, the most obvious costume on, but also so completely spot-on with his physical performance he enhances the costume.  Jack Haley manages to give a wide-ranging performance while encased in a costume for the ages.Also starring Clara Blandick and Charley Grapewin(""The Grapes of Wrath""), ""The Wizard of Oz"" is perfect."	5.0	"""The Wizard of Oz"" could have been made yesterday"	2011-03-10	1	1	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3TD7B0CT1NHO4	Gregory Nyman	"So many have come before this review, that it's almost impossible to add anything to this, but this I will say - if you are in search of truly good entertainment, without all the trappings of our ""modern film,"" this is a family place to land.  If you've read the Frank L. Baum book, you won't be disappointed in this one.  With Judy Garland in the lead (who, by the way was second choice - Shirley Temple was the first choice), and Frank Morgan as the Wizard, plus the ensemble cast of Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger, and others, this ranks among the best.It is interesting, in a sort of historical way, because the studio back in 1939 didn't think that this movie was going to go anywhere -- and they planned on a ""flop.""  My, has history proved them wrong.A great film for the entire family, with many of the classic elements which make for good entertainment, such as mystery, humor, edge of your seat suspense, and great music and dancing.  Then there are the Munchkins and the Wicket Witch of the West.  A fantasy tale come true!!!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1TMAVN4CEM8U8	"Gunner ""The GUNNER"""	"The Wizard of OzWhat most people don't know about the The Wizard of Oz is that is was originally written as a political satire in favor of the Gold Standard,i.e./ having a dollars worth of gold or silver for every dollar printed, hence the ""yellow brick road"".  Dorothy's shoes were silver in the book, but Hollywood in their ignorance thought that ruby would be prettier.  Kansas was used as a metaphor for ""middle America"" what is sometimes called the ""fly over zone"" today.  Each of the other characters were metaphors for other political figures of the times.  I believe the Wizard was for Williams Jennings Bryan.Highly recommended for the entire family.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1EYUZTL1RY5CV	"Guy Brown ""Guy"""	I don't think i've ever seen a movie that i've wanted to watch over and over again, except for the Wizard Of Oz. Just the creativity and the wonderful child-like quality that many movies do not have today.Although Victor Fleming is most mentioned when it comes to the Wizard Of Oz, there really was 3 separate directors. Victor Fleming, Richard Thorpe and King Vidor, Vidor replaced Fleming when he went to work on Gone With The Wind. Thorpe was used for footage that was shot but was never used because Fleming and studio executives were unimpressed.I love the music in this film, it all just sounds ageless, even if it was 1939. Judy Garland as Dorothy is absolutely terrific in this movie. Not only is she a great singer, but a fine actress. Frank Morgan probably has the toughest job in this movie, playing 5 roles. Professor Marvel, the Doorman, the Cabbie, the Guard, and of course the Wizard. Ray Bolger is a wonderful physical comedian, playing the Scarecrow and gets display all of his talent. Bert Lahr is also a great physical comedian, playing the The Lion. I thought he was the funniest of them all. Jack Haley is also very good, him and Bert Lahr probably had the toughest costumes to deal with. Buddy Ebsen originally had the role of the Tin Man but after becoming sick from the make-up, he was replaced by Jack Haley. After all these years, it is tough to picture someone else playing the Tin Man besides Jack Haley because he was without a doubt impressive. Also, last but not least, The Witch played by Margaret Hamilton. There was someone selected to play the role before her but i forgot the name. Either way, Hamilton was perfect for the role.I love the tone of this film, it has that mix of reality and fantasy. With real people and these made up characters like a talking Scarecrow, Tin man, and Lion. Also, lets not forget talking trees, that's one of my favorite scenes.Overall on the movie. The imagination in this film is really wonderful. The material still seems fresh today. Even kids today watch this film constantly, my niece sings songs from this film. This is a true family film and will never get old. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.DVD Extras are amazing. They show the biography of the book and the making of the movie, which people have probably seen on the previous VHS special editions. They also show outtakes and deleted scenes, some deleted scenes are audio because footage was lost over the course of nearly 70 years, which doesn't really matter, just hearing it on audio is great. Overall, the Extras are worth while and any Wizard Of Oz fan would be pleased.	5.0	No Other Movie Compares To This Classic	2006-01-17	2	1	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A32O5FZH994CNY	"G. Ware Cornell Jr. ""anotherlawyer"""	So you know how this ends right? It won't be spoiled if I tell you the Wicked Witch of the West gets her comeuppance and is liquidated at the hands of Dorothy the Small and Meek after she tries to ignite Scarecrow, right?This is the way The Wizard of Oz was meant to be seen, although how a 2D movie can be some successfully transformed seventy-five years after its release, is as mysterious to me as how members of Congress get there and stay there. If you have enough money, many impossible things are merely difficult.The one thing you will notice is where the sound stage ends and the background murals begin. I've seen this in mere Blu-Ray and never realized how flat and drab those painted canvasses are. However, the reason you notice this is because the 3D foreground with the live actors are so realistic and so state of the art.If you have a 3D set, this movie needs to be in your collection!	5.0	The Way We Were Meant to Visit Oz-In 3D!	2013-09-22	3	1	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A26AGFVWTXKZIC	Heather English	Of course I give the movie itself 5 stars. I'm going to focus my review on content and packaging.I purchased the 70th edition 4 years ago and I loved it contained some great gifts with it and it didn't seem cheap. The items that come with this 75th set (snowglobe and pins) are cheap and the watch that came with the 70th edition was a lot nicer and I spent just $50 for it VS. $80 for this set.This set comes with an ultraviolet copy and does not contain a digital copy. Ultraviolet is nice but I prefer digital or because of the price both. The prior anniversary edition did include a digital copy but the computer I had at that time is no longer in working order.My big issue with the set is it does not come with a list of bonus features and what discs their on.Bottom line: Great set glad I bought it but at $80 it's way overpriced.	4.0	Great movie great packaging	2013-10-04	5	5	0

The contenders are this film, Minnelli`s MEET MEIN ST. LOUIS 44 and Cukor`s A STAR IS BORN 54.This DVD is a real treat. The docu is a feast, especially when Judy and the rest of the cast tell their recollections of making the picture. There are questions asked why they cut the film, but from watching the deleted scenes(or what`s left of it)it was a wise move.JUDY GARLAND sparkles as Dorothy Gale and successfully creates a charafter of flesh and blood. Thanks 2 her voice, charisma, talent and good production values this is the 2nd Victor Fleming film that will be a testement that the art of moviemaking indeeeeeeeeeeed can be high-art of timess appeal.

I have the Wizard of OZ on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and Blu-Ray, but nothing compares to this 3D version. We saw details that never stood out before and colors so bright with a picture as crisp as anything shot today. The soundtrack was outstanding as was the levels of depth between the actors. The flowers, corn and talking trees had such detail. There&#8217;s no need to call on the flying monkeys to improve on perfection.	5.0	Like it was filmed 75 Days ago not 75 Years	2013-10-06	5	5	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	"Brain,heart,courage and home are the essential clues behind the beatiful and captivating story .This charming picture has engaged with people of any age , because its freshness , far from getting old , has got strong through the time , becoming in a cult movie from its initial release.The charisma of Judy Garland meant the new answer to Shirley Temple . The radiant freshness of Garland singing Over the rainbow in the first minutes of the film and the story telling represents a delightful journey to find the Wizard of Oz . The living tree , the tin man , the scarecrow , the no courage lion and the unforgettable dog named Toto will be the partners of Dorothy in this fantastic and timeless film . Watch it over and over and you will never feel the shadow of the time in this movie , what it proves we are in front a milestone issue of the cinema:  a masterpiece in the widest sense of the word .Finally the doubt emerges : Did Dorothy dream or not this fairy tale? ; no matter you analyze this issue , just only think in two clever statements , the first  belongs to Albert Einstein : ""The imagination is more important than the knowledge"" and the second comes from Alfonso Reyes , a remarkable Mexican writer from his book ""La &uacute;ltima tule"": ""The imagination is the nut of the house""The masterpiece of Victor Flemming and a necessary film just before the inminent belic conflict: WW2."	5.0	Hocus Pocus !	2004-10-04	1	1	0

But how do you respond to them?Anyway, it's still great.  The good ol' days.  No swearing, no suggestive language, nothing sexual at all.  Now poppies?  Well, that one's up for debate.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2YNT4QDEQX30F	H. Snyder	"No other movie in history has entered the fabric of the culture like The Wizard of Oz. Almost everyone has a childhood memory of the film, whether they saw it during its initial release in 1939 or subsequent theatrical releases in the 1940s and 50s, or in television showings that took place with great fanfare in the 1950s and 60s. Many a 70-year-old recalls sitting with his or her parents and siblings in front of the 14-inch screen of the Radiation King television to watch the annual presentation of Wizard of Oz in glorious black-and-white. The original movie is actually in full color, one of the very earliest of Technicolor films.I have a ""complete collection"" of Wizard of Oz home videos, from the VHS tape to the DVD to the Blu-ray. Each in its turn was amazing and treasured. Now the high-definition version, shown on a 42 inch or larger HD screen, is close to perfection. The Blu-ray transcription of this classic film stands out as one of the finest restorations in the history of film, and one of the extra features shows how this restoration was accomplished. You owe it to yourself and to any children of your acquaintance to get a copy of The Wizard of Oz and revisit its magic.We're still looking, Dorothy, for that place where troubles melt like lemon drops. The Land of Oz, with you and the Wizard and the Scarecrow and the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion, is a good place to start in our search for somewhere over the rainbow."	5.0	The Wizard of Oz Blu-ray	2013-08-25	0	0	0

This disc is setup very basic no extra nothing really, This Blu-ray should have been $5.00 because they give you nothing extra from the DVD but a very little cleaning of this movie. Sorry, I got it.Don't throw your money away just wait for a better version on Blu-ray. Blu-ray is still new and they will redo the movies a 100 times before the format dies and we move too something new. I think they did Wizard of Oz 4 times in the USA on DVD, So Blu-ray it will be done 8 more times before the format is die. lol	2.0	This could have been better!	2012-05-05	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX	Ian Phillips	The Wizard Of Oz (1939) is now well over sixty years old, yet the classic film still stands extraordinarily well, reaching generation after generation (and has also become a firm T.V favourite at Christmas).Its transistion to the DVD format is thoroughly impeccable making the whole land of Oz look even more enduringly beautiful, colourful and extravagant, even for its film age.Theres no doubt that the sole ingredients of this timeless classic was from the all-round excellent playing from the cast, the spectacular, eye-catching sets such as the dazzling Emerald City at the end of the yellow brick road to the wonderful dancing and fun, jolly, infectious songs. That yearning vulnreability that exists in us all somewhere is what the film so heavily and heartwarmingly draws upon.Judy Garland is totally adorable as the wide-eyed innocence of little Dorothy Gale, who is transported over the rainbow by a tornado into the magical world of Oz. The sequences of the tornado sweeping up the house into the air are still vastly impressive and its transistion from black and white during the Kanas sequences to colour when Dorothy lands in Oz are highly effective.All performances in the film are utterly fantastic! Billie Burke shines as Glinda - The Good Witch Of The North whilst Margaret Hamilton is incredibly effective and devilishly evil as the Wicked Witch Of The West (who used to scare me to death as a youngster).Ray Bolger takes on the role as the scarecrow, Jack Hayley as the Tinman and Bert Lahr puts in a marvelous interpretation of the Cowardly Lion. What can I say about these actors that hasn't already been said a thousand times. They all glow in their parts and capture the imagination. Frank Morgan displays the most versatility by turning up in anumber of guises, most notably in the role of the imposter, Wizard Of Oz.What The Wizard Of Oz has to offer is basically a little something for everyone - from wonderfully strange lands, many fun and scary moments, a positivley dazzling and delightful array of fairy tale characters and some fabulous numbers.Whilst Dorothy begins her adventures along the yellow brick road, the film holds many fun, light-hearted moments though the mood considerably darkens when Dorothy is captured by the winged monkeys and is taken to the Wicked Witch of the Wests eerie looking castle where she is held prisoner. Even at 24 years old now, I still can't help feeling that slight sense of anxiousness when Dorothy cries out for Aunt Em when she is locked away to her exciting escape.This DVD edition hosts a wealth of fascinating features that will enthrall any fan of this film. A series of out takes are included such as the wonderful Jitterbug sequence and an interesting documentary on the making of the movie, hosted by Angela Lansbury.The documentary details the films origanal ethos and it now seems unthinkable for The Wizard Of Oz to be any different but infact, MGM had its eye on Shirley Temple playing Dorothy. You really can't imagine anyone but Judy Garland play that role as she plays its so perfectly. Its interesting to also hear anecdotes and shared memories from the rest of the cast and this special is generally a celebration of the ever-lasting Oz phenomenon.Beautifully done, The Wizard Of Oz has proved to be THE quintesential Hollywood production and possible remains the best childrens movie ever made! Songs like Somewhere Over The Rainbow, sung so touchingly by Judy Garland made such an impact on a world sliding into the war at the close of the 1930's.	5.0	The Merry Old Land Of Oz	2006-04-25	5	5	0

Everything i could say about this classic has probably been said a thousand times before. The visual effects may not be as stunning as they once were but never the less this remains a well loved film with its staggering ageless appeal. Songs and performances from stars such as Judy Garland, Billie Burke, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger and Margaret Hamilton help make this the memroable film it is. A true, timeless, classic!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A31UXSBNL5HZK0	Idnef	"The Wizard of Oz (Three-Disc Emerald Edition) [Blu-ray]So begins director Victor Fleming's The Wizard of Oz, a timeless, truly magnificent classic that's as charming and endearing today as it was seventy years ago. Born in an age when soul and spirit were invested in every frame, when digital effects had yet to be conceived, when craftsmanship sat upon the same cinematic throne as creativity, the seemingly simplistic story of a young girl's quest to escape a strange land of talking animals and sneering creatures has emerged as one of the most indelible, recognizable, and untouchable films in history. From actress Judy Garland's unforgettable rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" to her cries of joy upon returning home, Oz has few equals. From the bustling land of the Munchkins to the frightening kingdom of the Wicked Witch of the West, it boasts stirring artistry and design. From Dorothy's declaration that she isn't in Kansas anymore to her first, hushed utterance of ""there's no place like home,"" it transcends age, capturing the imagination of anyone, young or old, lucky enough to set their eyes on the majesty of its yellow-brick road.Love everything..about it!.."	5.0	Emerald Edition	2011-06-12	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A18T1BKNDSBWGN	"ITBeast ""ITBeast"""	I just purchased the 3-Disc Blu-Ray DVD Emerald edition from a competitor (and for about $20 cheaper to boot). For those of us that has been watching this Gem since we ourselves are kids and now passing the experience to our kids you could have not asked for better with one exception (Witch I will get to shortly).The Pros:- The Main feature on Disc 1 had an awsome Blu-Ray Transefer for both picture and sound. The Colors were viberant and clear (Maybe to clear), even the Sepi sequences at the begining and end of the Movie, The 5.1 sound was awesome and made the experience very enjoyable for me and our family.- On Disc 2 Had loads of extras, Basically all the short or silent versions of the Wizard of Oz up until the 1939 version including the 1990 made for TV special with John Ritter playing Oz creater L. Frank Baum, The Dreamer of Oz. Including interviews with the creators of the movie. The Disc itself was Blu-Ray but you can tell they did not re-transfer any of the extra material, however with that said it was still fun to watch.- Disc 3 has over 6 hours of lost footage, pictures, makings of, etc... That had basically come from other editions of the Wizard of Oz over the years.The Cons:I had only one real con in this edition, While this being of excellent Blu-Ray transfer technolgy it may at the end have taken some of the fantasy/imagination out of the movie. For example: In DVD standard/VHS the background sets blended in well with the up close stage set to where you really felt that you were truley in the world of Oz; On Blu-Ray you can for sure tell the background painting in the back are just that, Paintings and when you see Dorothy and the scarecrow walking down the yellow brick road you can almost see them walk into the end of what is visibaley a painted wall before the sequence fades out. As my oldest son pointed out you can diffently see the conturve of the mask on the cowardly lion, something he never noticed (nor did I) with the Standard DVD/VHS editions.This is almost an example of when Ted Turner was trying to colorize many of the classic black and white movies back in the 1980's when they visibily looked better the way they were originally rendered. Maybe the same should be done for movies that should not get the Blu-Ray treatment that are from an era were HD takes some of the mystic out of a movie.Overall, I would still highly recommend it. With all the extra's a true Oz fan will most certinally enjoy. for those who watch stage production plays this may not be a problem but for me and my family it was. I guess I will just pop in the standard DVD I still have.	4.0	Blu-Ray takes some of the Fantasy out of the land of OZ	2010-04-01	5	4	1

One of the special features is a movie called ""The Dreamer of Oz"" which I thought would be interesting because Rue McClanahan is in it and I like her. It's a bio of L. Frank Baum and it was a good story. Kind of sad that a movie filmed in 1990 was kind of fuzzy while the 1939 Wizard of Oz was crystal clear, but oh well. I still enjoyed it. My one gripe is that there was a really nice feature called something along the lines of ""Don't I know you from somewhere?"" that had a few minutes of info about each cast member - even Toto! - and for some reason they left out Judy Garland! What the heck!The features also included a 1911 short silent film (13 minutes) which was moderately amusing and a 1933 cartoon which I did not particularly enjoy. It started out Wizard of Oz - that is, Dorothy and her 3 friends, and then morphed into something about a magician hatching eggs. It didn't make sense. All of the other features were great.Anyway, there are some really expensive Wizard of Oz sets out there with hours and hours of features and other special stuff and I'm sure they are awesome, but for a person on a budget this is a great edition."	5.0	Always a Favorite	2012-02-23	0	0	0

See The movie like you have never seen it.  Wizard of oz is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1:33:1(full Screen) there was no wide screen at that time.Wizard of Oz has been seen by generations of families as the movie nears its 70th anniversary movie is still great as ever no matter how many times I have seen it.  Wizard of Oz is the number one family film.For those who own the 1 disc edition if you love special features and all that good stuff you should upgrade especially with the movie looking better then it ever has.  If you do not like all the extras the 1 disc still is suitable but I defintely would reccomend upgrading to the 2 disc or the 3 disc.  Me however I can't afford the 3-disc edition at this time so for me it is going to be the 2 disc edition especially for the price Best Buy has.  Amazon has a good price too so I say this is definitely worth a purchase.	5.0	#1 Family Movie Of All time Fully restored	2005-10-25	6	6	0

As early as 1927 the final reel of Abel Gances ""Napoleon"" was shot in Widescreen using the same principle as 'Cinerama',  whereby 3 cameras were used side by side, photographing the entire vista.  This film is available on DVD from Australia and on VHS elsewhere.  The effect of the Widescreen is marvelous,  much the same as films such as ""How The West Was Won"" in 1962, where you can see a slight join in the picture at the edges where the separate reels are aligned...Then in 1929/30 came Widescreen.  A number of movies were shot in Widescreen that year including ""The Bat Whispers"" and ""The Long Trail"" with John Wayne.  Like 1930's other pre-CinemaScope experiments , ""The Bat Whispers"" (Directed by Roland West), was shot in two versions--the 65mm Magnifilm production and one in the conventional ""square"" 35mm format. Deprived of the widescreen's radically unsettling asymmetry, West's movie became just another old-dark-house picture. You can see both on the DVD, and compare the standard version against the lustrous widescreen restoration by the UCLA Film and Television Archive (different cameramen, different setups, and occasionally different rhythm and action.Regarding The Big Trail that same year,  here is an article written by Arthur Edeson,  the cinematographer of that movie:IF ANYONE had, a few months ago, told me that I would not only be photographing a big picture on wide film, but also rabidly enthusiastic over its artistic possibilities, I would have thought him crazy. For I had the typical, conservative cameraman's attitude toward wide film: it might be all right as a novelty, but as a practical medium for serious artistic work it was impossible. I could think of too many technical and artistic flaws in it to ever think that it could gain a cameraman's favor. Everything-especially the new proportion of its picture-seemed absolutely wrong.Since then, I have spent more than six months photographing the 70 millimeter version of Raoul Walsh's ""The Big Trail."" In this time I have shot hundreds of thousands of feet of Grandeur film, and the results have convinced me that I, and not the process, was wrong. And now that the production is completed, I know that I shall find it difficult, indeed, to return to the cramped proportions of our present-day standard film.For 70 millimeter photography has given me an entirely new perspective. Instead of regarding things in the light of the old, cramped, Movietone frame, I now see them, photographically, as my eye naturally perceives them-in much the same proportions as the low, wide Grandeur frame.Technically, 70 millimeter cinematography is much the same as ordinary 35 mm cinematography. The cameras are standard Mitchell cameras. The film is standard Eastman Type Two Panchromatic. The lenses are, in most respects, similar to standard lenses. It is in the lenses, however, that the chief technical difference is found, for any given lens will embrace a considerably wider angle of view on the 70 mm. film than on the smaller standard. Therefore, when, as in this present picture, two versions are to be shot, the 70 millimeter camera must use a lens of approximately double the focal length of the lens used to make a corresponding 35 mm. shot. Or, reversing the example, when the cameraman uses a lens of a given focal length, the standard cameraman must use a lens of approximately half that size to make his corresponding shot. The shortest focal-length lens that I used during the making of ""The Big Trail"" was 50 mm., although 40 mm. is claimed to be theoretically the absolute minimum useable. However, as this was actual production work, and not laboratory tests. I preferred to play safe, and never used anything below a fifty When I used a fifty on a shot, the standard cameraman would use a twenty-five to produce a corresponding shot on his smaller film; when his shot required a fifty, mine would demand a four inch, and so on In this picture, though the majority of the scenes were duplicated shot for shot, in each size of film ,as nearly as was possible, the Grandeur version, being considered the most important, received the greater attention. So it was the requirements of the 70 millimeter cameras that dictated the lenses to be used, the set-ups, action, and all such matters.If you need more information then go to [...]Cheers,  David Alp"	5.0	Early Widescreen movies.....	2005-09-28	23	8	15

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	"As captivating as ever, the Wizard of Oz never fails to entertain children of all ages.  My youngest daughter, 2-1/2, was immediately smitten by it, and has watched it repeatedly since I recently purchased the DVD.  The stunning colors, the wonderful music, the compelling story will grab you again and again.  It remains one of the greatest movies ever made.As an adult, you might be tempted to read Salman Rushdie's BFI book as it provides an engaging set of essays on the movie.  I can't help but think of the moral tone this movie sets and by reducing evil to a cast of witches and flying monkeys, we all too easily overlook the dynamics in conquering evil.  While the original book and this movie treated the theme in child-like terms, we as adults haven't seemed to grow past this identification with good and evil.  The wizard makes for a fine balancing force, as his cynical view of events contrasts sharply to the innocence of Dorothy and her new found friends.  It is all so neatly resolved by Glenda the Good Witch.I say this because in the opening credits the producers attach their moral view of the subject, noting that ""Time has been powerless to put its kindly philosophy (of good conquers evil) out of fashion.""  Of course, one has to remember that this movie was made in 1939, and although ostensibly a children's movie it deals with some very real themes such as death, in terms of ridding us of evil. It should also be noted that Europe was on the brink of war with Hitler forming his notorious axis of evil.There are some especially scary scenes for little ones, beginning with the tornado that whisks Dorothy away to somewhere over the rainbow. The killing of the Wicked Witch of the East is treated mostly in comic tones but not without its serious undertones, which became the focus of the movie as Dorothy has to run a gauntlet put up by the Wicked Witch of the West to get back to Kansas.  All this makes for riveting entertainment, which is why this film has grown into a classic, whereas the 1925 version is nothing more than a curiosity item today.  The Wizard of Oz is a cinematic masterpiece with the initial sepiatones giving way to stunning technicolor.  The film has inspired numerous interpretations over the years, including very dark ones such as David Lynch's Wild at Heart.However, this version of the Wizard of Oz remains the definitive intepretation of Frank Baum's story. The DVD includes some added commentary by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and others, providing some amusing notes on the making of the film. There are also some vintage movie and cartoon clips as well as the original trailers."	5.0	One of the great gems of Hollywood	2004-02-25	1	1	0

AS I grew into my teens and on from there I have always found OZ to be that warm comfort blanket to cover up with when I'm homesick.  It reminds me of simpler times and of course one can not get past the lessons learned from this amazing movie.1.  When you get lost, don't worry or panic there will always be someone to help you find your way home (Dorothy's three companions)2.  When adversity stands in your way you can overcome it.  (the wicked witch)3.  You can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all the time (the wizard)4.  And of course sometimes the answers you are looking for are right under your feet5.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	APF9MW1YUQMKO	James V. Ruocco	No matter how many times you've seen this film, once you pop it into your DVD player, you're transformed into a little kid again traveling down the yellow brick road to Oz with Dorothy, Toto, The Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow. Even though you know the songs and the dialogue by heart (well I do since I played the Tin Woodman in a college production), it really doesn't matter. You'll still have a ball. On DVD, the &quot;Oz&quot; story shimmers with vivid rainbow colors and sepia tones that have been remastered from the original print in the MGM vault. Despite it's 62-year-old age, the film looks like it was shot only yesterday. Garland is great as Dorothy. &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; is a classic. Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch is exactly right. The munchkins are still over the top. And that tornado that carries Dorothy from her Kansas farm over the rainbow still looks pretty good given the technology that existed in 1939. Those in Kansas may think otherwise (they've seen the real thing). But for those of us who haven't, why be critical.	5.0	Toto, I Have A Feeling We're Not in Kansas Anymore?	2001-05-02	1	1	0

It's a classic,with quotable lines, and songs that will remain classics for centuries to come. I think a part of every child, and adult for that matter, can identify with Dorothy: her insecurity and restlessness in her current situation, her dream for adventure, and her quest for happiness.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A26FS3Y5NFJWDI	Jan Dames	People say this is an idictment of American society in the 19th century but I say it makes just as good a symbolic jab at religion. There is the Wizard, an all powerful figure (god-like in fact) who proves just as fallible and unreal as a common man. There is the yellow brick road (one can call it the narrow road) which leads to the glorious Emerald City (Heaven) which in turn is nothing more than a sham of what it has been described as. There is the tornado which leads Dorothy to Oz (one could label that a traumatic event which drives the common person to embrace religion in the first place). There are the munchkins (cherubs). There is the cowardly lion (meek Jesus, come on now). There is the Scarecrow (common Christian who can't think for himself. Only when he discovers the Wizard [God] isn't real and he rejects the illusion of faith does he acquire the ability to think). Finally there is the Tinman (science trying to make sense of itself in a religious way). And of course there is the Wicked Witch, the true fanatic dead set on destroying those who do not see things their way. Then there is Dorothy, the common person trying to find their place in the world. I know, I may be stretching but whatever.	5.0	Oz as a religious satire...	2008-02-13	6	3	3

There are several versions right now of this out there, The Ultimate 70th Anniversary with all the trimmings(Two Blu-ray discs chock full off great stuff including the film, and lots of extras, When The Lion Roars documantery DVD, and a Digital Copy for Dorothy and Co. on the go on your favorite portable device, plus a WOZ watch, A book and more!), then there is a 1-disc blu sold only at Wal-mart that is the first of the 2 discs in the 70th ann set, still lots of extras, and a 3-disc ""Emerald Edition"" Target Exlusive(sold only there in very limited quantities) which has Both Blu-ray discs and the When The Lion Roars doc, it comes in a slim line case with an embossed slipcover but DOES NOT have the digital copy, watch, book. ect. the the 70th set has. So Whatever version you end up getting, you're getting this timeless classic in the best possible presentaion. To show how powerful ""The Wizard of Oz"" is, this is my 7 year old nephew's favorite film, pretty amazing considering it's 63 years older then him.

When I put it in to play, the Blue ray logo appears on the screen for an incredibly long time. So long, that I thought the DVD was not going to play at all, and after several attempts, and testing on another BluRay player, I sent it back for a new one. Received the new one, and it did the exact same thing. Only I was more patient and after a good 5 minutes, it finally started playing. It's very frustrating and disappointing and makes me want to just get the plain old DVD rather than Blu Ray in the future.	2.0	Weird issue on Blu-Ray startup	2014-03-11	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A69Z3F9A2ILNP	Jay	Nobody could ever claim that &quot;The Wizard of OZ&quot; is not a  wonderful film. Ever since L. Frank Baum wrote the original book in 1899,  the story has captured the hearts and imaginations of children and adults  alike, the world over. Encoding this film onto a DVD is of course a  necessity for film lover's. It is wonderful to see the film and all the  other extras on a DVD. The documentaries about the making of and the  history of the film are wonderful, and very informative. However, the film  is sown in full-screen. It really would have been nice to see it in a  panoramic view, the way it was filmed. Also, the gift set is simply not  worth the price. It is interesting to see the original script and some  photos. The photos may be rare, but that does not mean they are good, or  interesting. My advice: buy this DVD, but opt for the regular issue, not  the gift set.	4.0	Gift set not worth it.	2000-09-07	8	3	5

When I got it home and popped it in the player( I have a 3d player, 3d tv and glasses and high speed cable)it was kind of a let down. At times ( usually closer up scenes with one or two characters) you could see the 3d, but most of the time it just fell flat. I understand the movie is old, but the movie could have definitely had more 3d effect to it. I own other 3d films and I could definitely tell a huge difference. I have also tried it at a friend's house with the same setup and he said the same thing. So I know it's not my set or my eyes.

From the clear sound to the freckles on Dorothy's face to the burlap stitching on the scarecrows face to the red rusted tears on the tin man when he cried to the, well the list goes on.  What ever money was spent over the 16 months it took to restore and transform this film to 3-D was worth it.  Like the Beatles whose music I've repeatedly bought over and over again from vinyl to 8 track to cassette to CD to Flac files on a flash drive, and will continue to buy every update available, the Wizard of Oz is that good.  From Beta to VHS to Laserdisc to DVD to Blu Ray and now a 75th anniversary 3D edition, you HAVE to buy this latest version.  I haven't seen it on Blu Ray, but if it's close to the experience of IMAX, then it's worth it.  You don't watch this movie, you experience it.  In all it's glory, this could be the very best film ever made.  The sepia tone part of the film does not seem to be from elements as good as the technicolor.  That part of the film is gorgeous.  GORGEOUS!!!!  It's simply amazing what the early technicolor looked like.  The surreal make up only adds to the fantasy and the 3-D effect for the most part gives the film a depth and clarity that adds to the enjoyment.  Put all of  your other versions out for the yard sale or keep them as collectables.  This, so far, is the definitive version.  And...above all watch it.  Make the evening an event.  Plan a party for friends and relatives and enjoy.	5.0	Wizard of Oz is to movies as the Beatles are to music.	2013-09-26	25	24	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3C94LV082BV2T	"J. Davis ""Just a guy."""	"This is not one of my favorite movies. To be sure, to some degrees, it is a faithful adaptation of the book with certain liberties taken considering the time it was made and the technology for film at the time. I am a huge fan of L. Frank Baum, however, and long to see a much more faithful version brought to the big screen.The film's plot is a great condensation from the book. Although they made Oz simply a dream, audiences would not be expected to believe otherwise. The Wicked Witch appear near the beginning, making her the main antagonist, so the film has to end shortly after her demise.The acting is superb, as are the songs and directing. (And no, no one hangs themself in the movie!)One element that made this film the biggest version of Oz for a long time is often overlooked. Before this classic musical, the most beloved version was the musical extravangza, which debuted on stage in 1902. In order to make their film succeed and surpass this version, MGM went closer to the book, although taking the play's ideas of humor and contemporary-sounding songs with it. Like the play, Judy Garland's Dorothy is older than she was in the book, but not quite as old as Anna Laughlin's portrayal.There have been many other versions of Oz since this one, but they spend too much time trying not to resemble this version (or try to seem like it without completely copying it), that they are either largely forgotten or have become blacklisted. (Disney's ambitious ""Return to Oz,"" which almost followed the same pattern, for example.)If a new version is to succeed, it needs to see what made this film great, and try to incorporate that into it. (Sorry, Todd MacFarlane, you're not going to cut it.)Now for the DVD. The 3-disc edition is the one I own and reccomend. The picture is sharp and clear, now completely restored to how it should have looked since 1939. The audio is crisp and lossless. The whole movie now looks as good as a new film.And now the DVD is loaded with bonus features. An audio commentary hosted by John Fricke gives you a look into the making of this classic. Other audio features let you hear the film's original mono soundtrack, and the soundtrack without dialogue. Disc 1 also features cast profiles for the supporting cast (strangely, no biographical information about the star, Judy Garland, is given on the set, except very basic information), a documentary on the restoration of the film for this set, and an animated abridgement of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" read by Angela Lansbury.Disc 2 gets into the making and legacy of the film. Two previously made TV specials on the movie are included. The highly informative ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic"" and ""Memories of Oz,"" which is informative, just not as much. The new featurette ""The Art of Imagination: A Tribute to Oz"" features contemporary film-makers giving their opinions on the movie. ""Because of the Wonderful Things It Does: The Legacy of Oz"" features Oz fandom and the continuation of Oz after the 1939 movie, even featuring a few people I've contacted myself. Also, archival audio and video features round out disc 2, making just these two discs satisfying for any fan of the film.If you're a Baum fan, however, Disc 3 holds more wonders. An excellent documentary on Oz creator L. Frank Baum leads it. (However, in a few spots, the information does get confusing...) Also included is the earliest surviving Oz film: ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" from the Selig Polyscope Company in 1910. Then we have two of Baum's own Oz films, ""The Magic Cloak of Oz"" and ""His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz."" (There was also ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz,"" but it is not on this set, though the Baum documentary does mention it.) Following these is a restored version of the 1925 silent ""Wizard of Oz"" with Larry Semon, one of the worst Oz films ever. Wrapping up disc 3 is the first Oz cartoon, ""The Wizard of Oz"" from 1933.Also in the 3-disc set are print materials: reproductions of the film's premeire program, ticket, invitation, the MGM studio newsletter, a Photoplay Studies Guide for teachers, and restored publicity photographs. Also is a postcard sized... card showing several of the movie's poster.If you are a Baum or Oz collector, GET THIS EDITION! You will not be sorry!"	5.0	Why MGM Is The Best To Date	2007-11-21	1	1	0

If you saw this movie as a child then you probably consider it one of, if not the, favorite movie of yours.  What I will do is a quick review of the Blu Ray version.Short version:  The quality is lacking as I was very disappointed that the movie was NOT redigitalized.  I have watched the HD version on TV and I really see no qualitative difference.  It certainly it is not worthy of the Blu Ray label.That being said:  This limited edition version is kind of cool...it contains two other disks, a digital version and a couple booklets as well as a couple other little surprises...including a watch.  I will admit, it is a nice little collectors version.The bottom line:  For me, it's all about the quality of the picture so I can not recommend this edition on that basis.  However, this may be as good as it can get, at least for a few years, and if you like little funky editions or are a real Wizard of Oz buff, you may really appreciate what it has to offer.  It's a five star movie, a five star edition with only a three star picture quality.***updated to overall three stars as of 11.21.2011 to be more reflective of the comments***I stand corrected as it WAS redigitalized...which just goes to show you there are limitations particularly with older films.  My main point is the difference between the 1080i HDTV version and the 1080p blu-ray version are subtle and, if you have a DVR, archiving the film via DVR would be the way to go unless your focus is on other aspects of the Anniversary Collection rather than film quality alone.	3.0	Blu Ray Version	2009-10-07	61	25	36

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A259W5KIP41XFL	Jennifer A. Everhart	The Wizard of Oz, a great classic film in the novel franchise of the same name by L. Frank Balm. It is charming, funny, and heartwarming. There are also some memorable songs thrown into the mix and has a unique storyline. It is about Dorthy Gale (Judy Garland) who lives on the farm in Kansas with her Aunt Emily a.k.a. Em (Clara Blandick), Uncle Henry (Charles Grapewin), pet dog Toto (Terry), and three farmhands Hunk (Ray Bolger) Hickory (Jack Haley) and Zeke (Bert Lahr). After Ms. Elmira Gulch (Margaret Hamilton) tries to snatch Toto from Dorthy after an accident Toto caused, he gets away and the two try to leave Kansas for some time in order to get out of harm's way. Dorthy meets Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan) on the road and realize there is a tornado up the alley. Dorthy and Toto return to the farm and try to take shelter, but the tornado sweeps the house off the ground with the two inside. It sends the house falling into Munchkinland in the land of Oz and accidentally crushes the Wicked Witch of the East. Dorthy is greeted by the munchkins (Singer Midgets) and Glinda the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) who thanked her for the witch's accidental death. Then the Wicked Witch of the West (also Hamilton) discovers that the witch killed was her sister. Glinda teleports the mystical Ruby Slippers onto Dorthy's feet in order to prevent the witch from getting them. The Witch vows revenge and leaves for now. Glinda and the munchkins told Dorthy she and Toto could ask the Wizard of Oz how to get home, who can be found in Emerald City by following the Yellow Brick Road. On the way, Dorthy meets a Scarecrow (also Bulger) who is seeking a brain, a Tin Woodsman (also Haley) who wants a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (also Lahr) who was longing to gain courage. The gang goes to see the Wizard together and embark on a quest to obtain the Witch's broomstick.This film may seem like it was released in the 1950's, but was really released on August 25, 1939. Confusing, isn't it? It has a neat trend of a few actors playing multiple characters, one from Kansas and one from Oz. The film adaptations use sepia tone for the Kansas scenes and full color for the Oz parts which is really original. They also pulled off the visual effects pretty well for the time, despite that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion were humanoid which was pretty innovative for the time and helps provide full facial expressions. When Dorthy accidentally dumps water on the witch and she melted, I think it was probably holy water, but I don't know for sure. If you see this movie in stores, please see it. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. It won't disappoint. Oh, and before I go, there is also a darker and grittier spin-off sequel as well, known as Return to Oz released in 1985, which I will review next time.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A29460NEDCMSEK	Jeremy Porter	After watching this new film to video transfer from original 3 strip Technicolor elements, I have to wonder why the film industry do not make films using this wonderful process anymore. The three strip Technicolor process, similar to modern high end 3-CCD video camera, split light into 3 primary colors (Red,Green,Blue) and recorded seperately on three strips of 35MM films. When you recombine them you creat a full color image with astounding color quality, never possible with a modern single strip color film. This new DVD version they scanned the original nitrate Technicolor R/G/B negatives digitally with 4K resolution, and recombine them using digital edge detection for optimum alignment. The result is amazing with bright, rich colors and image details that is truely spectacular.	5.0	Great DVD box set in glorious Technicolor!	2005-10-26	21	18	3

WHEN I WAS TINY MY MOM TOOK ME TO SEE THE MOVIE IN A THEATER ON ARE-RELEASE AND I WAS ENCHANTED AS I STILL AM.  ONLY A JACKASS COULD HATE THIS MOVIE.  I LOVE THE ADDITIONAL STUFF WITH THE DVDS BECAUSE I ALLWAYS LOVED MOTION PICTURE TECHNOLOGY.  THE TORNADOSEQUENCE IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN; SCARY, BELIEVABLE AND UNMATCHED SINCE.  'TWISTER' WAS A CARTOON COMPARED WITH THIS.  IT WAS SO GOOD MGM USED THE FOOTAGE PLUS SOME EXTRA SCENES NOT SHOWN IN THE 'WIZARD' IN AT LEAST ONE OTHER MGM MOVIE.  IN MY OPINION 'THE WIZARD OF OZ' IS THE BESTFANTASY FILM EVER MADE, NOT WITHSTANDING THE EXCELLENT 'HARRY POTTER' FILMS.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1V7ADUMW69QF1	"J. Fees ""imaginart"""	When we are children, we have wild imaginations.  Our minds are powerful things, taking us to far off places where anything is possible.  On screen, the film that has that power is The Wizard of OZ.  How could anyone resist Judy Garland singing about a place that is far off, or Margaret Hamilton as possibly the most wicked and notorious villain ever, THE WICKED WITCH.  I vividly remember watching this film with my family when I was kid, and as soon as the Wicked Witch appeared in flames in Munchkinland, my brother ran and hid behind a chair.  This is one of those films that make us do those kinds of things when we are little and looking back, this film has created for me, a world of wonderful memories.  This DVD should be on absolutley everyone's shelf.  We get to see Kansas, The Yellow Brick Road, and the Emerald City in all of it's colorful glory.  While not being a big hit back in 1939, it certainly has earned it's place as one of the best films ever made.  There are also many features that will leave both the OZ enthusiast and the just plain curious pleased.  Get taken away all over again to the wonderful land of OZ and buy this DVD, you won't regret it.

Over the years I have collected the movie on a variety of different formats, everything from the very obscure super 8 to CED all the way up to the latest, greatest edition on blu-ray. And this is my favorite, not just because it's new, but also because the picture and sound quality of the movie is crystal clear. I have never seen it look so crisp and so sharp before. The 1-disc blu-ray ""70th Anniversary Edition"" is the same exact disc included with the blu-ray boxed set as well as the 3-disc ""Emerald Edition."" It includes all of the same special features, such as the '90 ""Wizard of Oz"" documentary hosted by Angela Lansbury. This also includes all of the Turner/TCM/Warner Bros. featurettes that are included on the 3-disc DVD set from '05 and a sing-along function. The 2 new featurettes that Turner/Warner Bros. produced in '09 are not included with the 1-disc set. I'm not overly crazy about the picture on the disc (I think the ones from '05 were much more colorful and vibrant).

I had actually started to not care much for this movie anymore in standard def as it was too easy to see the behind the scenses so to speak.  But with this version, it brought the magic back.  For instance in the part where they meet the tin man, many folks had pushed the rumor that a Munchkin had hung himself on the set.  Now you can see that it's actually a large bird of some sort, and later you see it again walking around.	5.0	See the other reviews that state how good the quality is.  It's true!	2014-01-21	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1CSU3QNEDPISC	JimK.	Whether it's Amazon's streaming service or the digital copy of the film itself, this beloved film was difficult to watch due to stopped action at what seemed to be every scene or camera angle change. The 'freeze' only lasts an instant, but was very distracting as it happened through out the streamed content. There was also flashing that was horrible during the b&w oncoming tornado crossing the field scene. I watch streaming vids all the time from Netflix and other sources and have never scene anything like this before from any other on-line source. It's too bad there were so many technical flaws in the streaming film content because the Technicolor restoration of the film is quite dazzling otherwise.	2.0	The Wizard Needs To Rework This Video	2013-02-09	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3QTP2CI1BDV0M	"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark"""	"There are movies that seem destined for greatness.  Though improbable and against the odds, these pictures still come out great.  ""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of these movies.It's been 75 years since it's initial release, but ""The Wizard of Oz"" still works today.  The special effect are still believable (the tornado, for example).  The wicked witch and flying monkeys are still scary.  And the performances are still fresh (rather than dated).  Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy.  Frank Morgan is a delight as the Wizard & Prof. Marvel.  Ray Bolger is simply wonderful as the Scarecrow.  Bert Lahr is excellent as the Cowardly Lion.  And Jack Haley is just fine as the Tin Man.Buddy Ebsen (Jed Clampet in The Beverly Hillbillies) was supposed to be the Tin Man, but he got very sick from the silver dust/paint used on the Tin Man's face, so Jack Haley was brought in. A good question is:  Who would have been the better Tin Man ... Jack Haley or Buddy Ebsen?  Buddy Ebsen would go on to have one of the most successful careers in show business history.  He was talented ... and lovable ... and, in a side-by-side comparison with Jack Haley, he was a giant (looking back).  But Buddy's acting style was always understated.  He liked being subtle.  And the Tin Man ... like the Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion ... was basically a cartoon character, and this needed over-acting ... or exaggerated acting ... to work.  Jack Haley was a veteran of Vaudeville, and Vaudeville was, if nothing else, exaggerated acting.  So I'll go with Jack Haley as the better Tin Man.  And besides, Jack Haley was the most decent person show business ever had.But despite the many production difficulties (The set was plagued by accidents.  They went through a total of five directors. More than a dozen writers were used (at various times) with there being numerous rewrites of the script.  And the whole production was in doubt until Victor Fleming was brought on board to direct.) ""The Wizard of Oz"" came out great ... and it has stood the test of time."	5.0	Still Wonderful After All These Years	2013-08-31	1	0	1

Michael Click	Like most baby boomers, I've watched this film dozens of times in the past on broadcast TV, then VHS tape, then LaserDisc ... but I had never actually SEEN &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; until this newly restored DVD came out.  It's an amazing transfer. The sepia-tone Kansas sequences are startlingly  sharp and clear, and the Technicolored world &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;  is truly dazzling.  I found myself fascinated by details I had never  noticed before: the glittering corn stalks in the Scarecrow's field; the  mirror-like floors of the Emerald City; the polished buttons on the  guardsmen's uniforms.  Incredibly, even the individual grains of red sand  in the Witch's hourglass stood out and glistened!  All these  minor-but-sumptuous visual details served to heighten the magical spell  that the film has always woven, enhancing the performances, the story, and  the music.The DVD extras are a mind-boggling embarrassment of riches.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary hosted by the incomparable Angela  Lansbury is worth the price of the DVD alone, but there's so much more: an  international poster gallery, interviews with cast members, deleted scenes,  production stills, radio clips, etc, etc.  There's enough material to keep  even the most casual viewer fascinated for hours, and a true Oz buff will  be occupied for days!If you only bought a DVD player to watch this one  disc, it would well be worth the expense.

This comes from one who likes the 3D gimmick in general. Yeah, it's kind of a kick to see some added depth to the scenes we all know so well, but it doesn't add anything to the overall enjoyment of this film. If you want a disc to show off your 3D TV (does anybody even do that anymore?) then look elsewhere. By all means don't hesitate to pick up a remastered Blu-Ray of this film, but save a few bucks and skip the 3D.	3.0	The Re-mastering is Great, But the 3D Doesn't Add Much.	2013-11-03	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AFFWAUAXJMUON	"Jocko ""jockogrinn"""	"Before Voldemort, before the Dark Lord Sauron, there was Glinda the (so-called) Good Witch of the North. Watch this movie, and see her masterful manipulation of naive Dorothy as she catapults herself into ever-increasing power.It all begins when a mysterious tornado brings Dorothy to Oz, landing her house on top of the Wicked Witch of the East. Glinda, for no apparent reason, gives Dorothy the deceased witches' slippers, earning Dorothy the enmity of the Wicked Witch of the West (masterfully played by Margaret Hamilton), and sends her beyond the Yellow Brick Road to the Wizard of Oz.It's all a ploy, though, as we discover at the end of the movie, when Dorothy learns all she had to do to get home was click her heels. So why does Glinda do it? Watch as the wizard sends Dorothy to steal the broomstick of the wicked witch and destroys her in the process, only to go and expose the Wizard of Oz himself as a clever con man pretending to have great powers.In other words, Dorothy unknowingly creates a tremendous power vacuum in Oz. And who do you think is going to move into that vacuum? Glinda, obviously. (The Good Witch of the South is mentioned but never appears. One can only imagine how Glinda dispatched her other rival before dropping a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.)Brilliantly directed and stunning in its storycraft, ""The Wizard of Oz"" remains a frightening and disturbing movie in the way it tries to diminish terms like ""good"" by masquerading evil in so pleasant a form. While this should come as no surprise, given MGM's history of addicting child stars like Judy Garland to speed and other drugs, it should be enough to make any parent think twice before allowing their children to watch such a movie before they are old enough to weigh the themes for themselves."	5.0	A study in Machiavellan manipulation	2003-01-04	18	9	9

The Amazon Exclusive flash-drive is nice. Some have said the flash drive is cheap plastic it is not. It is rubber. Word to the wise though. If you do use the flash drive and your computer gets hot, or if you are like me and use it in a TV, and it gets hot don't leave it in the machine very long it will get too hot.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2Q90UILXT8BNI	Joe	When I saw that the Wizard of Oz was released on DVD, I grabbed it without a second thought. I've loved this movie since a child, but never owned a  copy of it. I think everyone here has established that the movie is an  all-time classic, so this review will focus on the DVD itself.I think  this DVD should be used as an instruction manual, or rough guide in how to  make a great DVD. Studios in Hollywood, directors, and anyone else into DVD  production should be forced to sit and take notes. The extras and features  on this thing are amazing. You've got the wonderful movie itself, a  behind-the-scenes documentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, biographies of all  the stars, some great facts about the movie and the stars that will  probably surprise you, studio pictures, theater trailers and stills, clips  of the Wizard of Oz cartoon, many audio supplements, and a lot more! There  is also a few hidden surprises on the disc, if you know where to look....  (In the 'Oz Characters' section off the special features menu, go to the  first page of Glinda's info. Select the glowing orb above her wand, and  find some hidden pages on the Munchkins. On the first info page for the  Wicked Witch, select the hour glass for some hidden pages with info on the  flying monkeys).You can spend hours just going through the extras on  this release. While so many studios are using this medium to just shovel  their old releases onto and cash in, The Wizard of Oz release truly shows  the power of DVD, and is what all DVD releases should be like.	5.0	What All DVD Releases Should Be Like!	2000-08-28	41	38	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2KHPDJ33BH438	John A. Truett	&#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; has been one of my all time favorites since I fist saw it at the age of 12 and have seen it many times since, And, being a 3D enthusiast, I looked forward to this interpretation, but was mildly disappointed with the results.  The movie itsellf, of course, is still a milestone in film entertainment.The best thing about this two-disc package is a lengthy explanation of the making of the movie.  I had no idea of all the pitfalls and set-backs theat were encountered.  I now have a deep feeling of gratitude for all those who struggled to complete the filming.  It's truly unfortunate that at Oscar time, &#34;The Wizard&#34; had to compete with &#34;Gone With The Wind,&#34; even if I consider GWTW the greatest movie of all time with its vast production values, story and acting.	4.0	Best thing about this two-disc package is a thorough look into the making of the film.	2014-01-04	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3IMWGXKXSPVH8	John Avenson	Fantastic! Live the story like never before in this 3D conversion. You get 3D right at the start with the studio ICON Lion roaring his head before Intro music starts. When Dorothy leans against the Hay stack and sings Over the Rainbow, in 3D you will see every straw needle which you never saw before. During the Scarecrow scene you will see an Ostrich bird walking around in the background which I have never noticed before since first seeing this movie in 1958. You can look at (almost) every brick in the Yellow Brick road. The witches nose sticks out! This 3D conversion shows how technology for 3D has really evolved since 3D hit the market back in 2011.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"What makes this quintessential fantasy musical the immortal spectacle it is has as much to do with the spirited songs (Garland's signature ""Over the Rainbow"" was nearly cut!) and heel-clicking dance numbers as it does the phenomenal storyline, lavish Technicolor sets, and punchy performances by the entire cast. For sheer entertainment, you can't beat Ray Bolger's rubbery legs, Bert Lahr's boastful bluster, and Margaret Hamilton's frightening green face, not to mention warbling Munchkins, flying monkeys, an Emerald City, and one highly coveted pair of ruby slippers. King Vidor directed the black-and-white Kansas sequences that bookend the film, but Fleming helmed the rest and took sole credit. Amazingly, the film flopped at the box office, but has since become the most beloved children's classic of all time.

I hadn't watched Oz in several years  before buying this DVD and now I feel like I'm seeing it again through  fresh eyes. The quality of the almost pristine transfer is terrific. This  60(!) year old film really comes to life, and you will not find a DVD with  more supplementary material than this. The historical information is  fascinating, from the behind the scenes documentary, to the interviews with  Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Margaret Hamilton (but wish they were  complete!), to the stills of the New York and Hollywood premieres and even  composer Harold Arlen's 16mm color home movies of the actors in costume.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	If you want the ultimate Wizard Of Oz experience, get this 3-DVD set.  You not only get the restored film, but a whole lot of other special features spread out over the three DVDs, with 5 new documentaries.  Disc One is the movie.  It has features such as commentary by historian John Fricke, The Restoration of Oz (which shows the process of how the film was restored), profiles of the supporting cast, a description of The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz Storybook read by Angela Lansbury, and an option of watching the movie with the original mono sound.  Disc Two features a documentary on the making of the movie.  Lots of other special features are included, among them a documentary on the movie's legacy, on-set home movie footage of Harold Arlen showing the actors in down time between shoots, outtakes and deleted scenes, how the tornado was filmed, and 4.5 hours worth of audio musical recordings and spoken word recordings.  Disc Three is a salute to Oz creator L. Frank Baum.  Included are full-length early silent versions of The Wizard of Oz movie from 1910, 1925, and 1933.Some of the strengths of this 3-DVD set are the audio commentary, Angela Lansbury's comments, and the clarity of the picture.  If you want the ultimate Oz experience, get this set.  It is worth the money, even in these tough times.  Just put it on your credit card and forget about it.  Highly recommended.Oh, wait...I see that this item has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  That's too bad.  Now I see there is a 70-year anniversary DVD.  If you can somehow get your hands on this 3-disc set I just reviewed, get it.  Anyway, I'm wondering why they didn't just wait another five years so they could come out with a 75-year anniversary set.  I guess time is money.  Oh well.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A31C0TLQM50OT0	Joseph D. Diaz	"I remember when this movie came out a few years ago the reviews were largely positive, but when I finally saw it I left the theater thinking it was just another rip off of the film ""Titanic,"" which I never saw. There are some superficial differences, like one takes place in ""Oz"" and the other on an ocean. But even that, take the word ""ocean"" and keep the first letter ""O"" and then add the other 4 letters together in some way so that they equal the 27th letter of the alphabet and it becomes... hold your breath for this... ""Z!"" So Oz and the ocean are the same thing. Also, there is this blooper at the beginning of the Wizard movie where the whole thing just turns from color to black and white. Literally. It just totally loses all trace of colors as you are watching it. If you look at it carefully, the part where the protagonist Doris runs away from home actually switches to black and white just as she meets the old guy having a barbecue. Another blaring rip off of Titanic is where in Titanic the boat sinks, but in the WIZARD movie the horses that are pulling her carriage keep changing color. Not very subtle, but that's how the whole film plays out. I mean Titanic had an iceberg, Wizard simply changed that to talking apple trees; Titanic had socioeconimc disparities in survival rates, Wizard had homoerotic tension between the Mayor of Munchkin Town and the Coroner that pronounces the wicked witch dead; Titanic had a bad guy, Wizard had a bad WOMAN; Titanic had foriegners coming to America, Wizard had a tornado; and the big one... ironic drumroll please (which is like a regular drumroll, but probably done very slowly to underscore the point that it isn't a genuine drum roll), NEITHER movie featured a semi-transparant leper from Montana who dispenses fatherly advice in the form of racist taunts to the imagined characters he pretends to see on the broken television that he got by giving tattoos in prison, where he was serving 11 months for performing surgery without a license on a weasel with a cleft palate.There are some redeeming elements of the Wizard movie, such as the use of the ruby slippers to symbolize the Federal government's failure to uniformly address drug policy in the 1980's, and naming Doris's dog ""Todo"" (which is spanish for ""everything"") to illustrate the emotional instability associated with continually deporting the poor dog from Kansas one day, and then making him return to the farm the next day, but just long enough to perform difficult manual labor, and then deporting him again before the farmer has to pay his wages.One is tempted to forgive the many flaws of the Wizard movie when Doris, in the final scene, looks directly into the camera and tells the viewer: ""There is no place like home. A census worker tested me once [at my home] and I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti."" But even that scene can't tip the scales back to the point where I can recommend the movie. Save yourself some time and just watch Titanic with the audio/dialog option switched to the Navajo language.Post Script- There is a scene in the Wizard movie towards the beginning where Doris's parent's home is sucked up into the tornado. There is a window in her bedroom and out the windown you can actually SEE that the SAME lady who plays the bicycle-riding transgendered Abraham Lincoln in the beginning was used again later in the film to play the Evil Witch who is mourning the murder of her twin sister.Score= On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it C+- (C plus minus)"	1.0	Terrible movie!

Although this latest ""Oz"" edition is beautiful overall, one does notice in certain scenes just how blotchy Garland's makeup is, or indeed how obviously plastic the Munchkinland flowers are. The filmmakers no doubt were unaware that one day viewers would be able to see every pore on Garland's face, so one can make allowances for the makeup techniques of the time. As for the plastic flowers, would anyone really expect Munchkinland to look all that real anyway?On to more technical details. There is some noticeable edge flicker during the Emerald City shots. In fact generally speaking, the close-up studio shots look better than the matte painting scenes. The sepia tones in the beginning and end of the film are quite lovely, and the first Technicolor shots really do reveal just how amazing this film must have been to its original audiences.Sound mix is good, with some ambient surround but in general most everything is centered at the front (it is a 70-year-old mono film after all).Well worth the upgrade, and a fitting edition of perhaps the first and best fantasy film of all time."	5.0	Oz-some, to a point.	2011-03-28	2	2	0

First, it is playable on ALL DVD players and you can exchange this DVD with friends in other countries, or, play it on DVD players and computers from other countries.Second, the black and white and color on this DVD are true to the original screen version.  (I once saw it on the big screen in Scottsdale in 1989 when an old theater had closed - the Wizard of Oz was the first movie shown at the theater when it opened in 1939).Third, the version is the true screen version first shown to audiences in 1939.  Why is that good?The first screen version was edited to be a gentle portrayal of the essence and spirit of the book the Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.As popular as the movie has been in history, few have read the book.The book is L. Frank Baum's version of Homer's ""The Odyssey"" with Dorothy as hero (heroine).  Baum was a minor scholar of the Classics (he studied Greek in military school when he was a teenager).  He took the story line, conflicts, antagonists and protagonists of the Odyssey, and, put them into a compelling context for readers at the turn of the twentieth century.Dorothea is, in ancient Greek, the name of the goddess of truth and wisdom.  ""Toto"" (meaning ""everything""), the faithful dog, is a metaphor for our ""faith"" as we journey through life in search of home (as did Odysseus).  Brains (the scarecrow), heart (the tin man) and courage (the lion) are what all of us use in our lives to find our home and our soul mate (as did Odysseus - as does Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz).When Dorothy is in peril in the Witch's castle, she relies upon ""Toto"" (her faith) to summon her brains, her heart, and her courage.Many commentators have mused about the name ""Oz.""  I've read some conjectures that border on the ridiculous.  (One biographer of Baum speculated that ""Oz"" came from the O-Z on lower drawer of Baum's two drawer file cabinet).""Oz"" is the correct ancient Greek abbreviation for the Odyssey.  In English, and in the Greek from about 400 BC to the present, the abbreviation for the Odyssey would be ""Od"".  However, in attic Greek (from about 800 BC - the time Homer wrote the Odyssey) if the ""d"" is surrounded by two vowels, it is changed, in ancient Attic Greek, to ""z"" or ""djeta"".  Hence, the first two letters of the original ancient Greek for the Odyssey are not ""Od"" but ""Oz"".And that's how L. Frank Baum came up with the name of ""Oz"".Buy this version.  You can't go wrong at this price."	5.0	The Wizard of the Odyssey	2008-12-31	10	10	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AWKOLLCRFFZAM	"J. Salzenstein ""Style Editor"""	"If there's one film that's remained truly timeless since it's debut, it's The Wizard of Oz. Released in 1939, the film about a slightly nave - some would say deranged - young girl is just as entertaining, just as colorful, and just as campy today as it was when it was first released. Now, however, much to collective gay delight, one of the classic films in the gay repertoire is available in high definition Blu-ray, in the brilliant 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition- a release that's nothing short of incredible.There's no room for indifference with The Wizard of Oz- you either love it or you hate it; for brevity's sake, let's go with the latter. This is a film that should be part of every gay man's collection- as well as the collection of everyone else. Whether or not you already own the film on DVD, if you're a true fan, you may just freak over this new special edition set. The presentation is fabulous, and for once, what's inside is just as brilliant, including books, pamphlets, pictures, even a commemorative watch, all presented in a great looking numbered box that's perfect for display.I can't think of a better holiday gift than this one- it's going to be on every good gay's wish list this year...Special FeaturesLooking for special features? Where do we start?!? With nearly four hours of all-new and never-before-available bonus features, you've got quite a few options, including a featurette, feature length documentary, two silent films by the film's creator, and fan favorite, The Wizard of Oz Sing-Along Track. You'll definitely have plenty of things to watch for at least the next couple weekends.And while the sing-along is certainly a lot of fun, so too is the Hollywood Celebrates Its Biggest Little Stars featurette (a behind-the-scenes look at seven of the original ""munchkins"") and feature length documentary on the man who, in the same year, brought both OZ and Gone with the Wind to the big screen. Also interesting - and entertaining - are two of the creator's early works, produced in 1914 and both presented here in their entirety.Also included are Reproductions of Archival Material (campaign books, ads, press sheets and a budget sheet) and Behind the Curtain, a 52-page hardcover book that includes pages and pages of previously unpublished content including photos, studio memos, and script pages for scenes and musical numbers that never saw the light of day. Finally, the made-for-TV film The Dreamer of Oz explores the back story of L. Frank Baum, the ""Royal Historian of Oz, and stars John Ritter, Annette O'Toole and Rue McClanahan.If EDGE used a 5-star rating system, The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition  would easily get an eight. This is the box set for 2009."	5.0	More fabulous than ever!	2009-10-18	2	2	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	APOOYO4TJ0XKI	J Sampson	When I heard that IMAX were turning my favorite film into 3D I was excited and apprehensive. My palms were sweaty because I couldn't bare the anticipation but on the other hand (no pun intended) I was nervous that they may make this classic and perfectly formed masterpiece into something that it was not originally intended to look like. This is a delicate movie with decades of young hearts warmed and Christmases spent watching by young and old and I didn't want to feel like that childhood memory of sitting with my Nana and watching it over and over again felt suddenly different. It didn't. The 3D version is Incredible. Amazing. Mind blowing. The depth of the picture and the clarity of each frame is beautiful. I've seen detail I've never seen before; The Scarecrow's sack textured face, The ruby slippers shimmering like never before and the backdrops between the trees seem to show me an Oz I've never seen before. I am so very grateful to Warner Brothers for bothering to painfully make this classic and iconic film in 3D, buffering it up like the Tin Man when he reaches the Emerald City for people young and old and the new generation of Oz lovers for years to come. Follow the yellow brick road to your store and pick up the new Blu Ray 3D... It will be a new experience you wont be disappointed with!	5.0	The Wizard Of Oz 3D  - Good or Wicked?	2013-10-03	6	6	0

The overall picture quality is excellent (expect a little graininess in a few areas, though, mostly in the backgrounds), and the included extras are really fun. This review specifically regards the 70th anniversary Blu-Ray box set with the book, the watch, etc... The only complaint I have is with the box itself. The box's ""hinge"" is simply a couple of plies of laminated paper, and if you open it beyond about 90*, the lamination cracks, and I could see the paper ripping in time if one isn't careful. So just be careful when opening the box itself to avoid this problem. I, for one, will keep the DVD itself in a separate sleeve so I can watch it whenever I want without having to open the box.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3VI2VETB90ZG5	J. Sullivan	"I love this ""The Wizard of Oz"" 70th Anniversary Limited Edition Set. The production budget is very cool, and the campaign book is an absolutely fantastic part of the collection - it really gives you a glimpse into the era. The 52-page full-color commemorative book, ""Behind the Curtain of Production 1060,"" is beautifully done and includes some previously unreleased photos. The watch is awesome and comes in a nice little tin with raised graphics - it's a fine quality piece worth the price of this set alone. The Exclusive Amazon 8 x 10 posters make for a really nice bonus too.As for the feature, I don't think it has been presented any clearer, but it falls a bit short of my expectations. Unless I'm mistaken, this must be a result of the quality of the focus in the original film.I do notice much more detail than I ever have before. I never noticed the turkey in front of the cage that flew past Dorothy's window as the tornado hits - I'm sure I can make it out on a standard definition transfer now, but until now I had never noticed it because it blended into the background. You can see Dorothy's freckles too. There are numerous details that you catch that you never caught before.If you expect to see each individual brick of the yellow brick road in distant shots, don't necessarily count on it. Although cleaner than ever before, many images look a bit softer than what you would see in a modern production, but again this is what I blame on the cameraman's abilities, who I would make responsible only because my standard DVD of the last ""Gone with the Wind"" is from the same era, and the sharp, incredible detail is astonishing enough to easily see the lace on articles of clothing and so much more.So either they're holding out on this release or it's as true to the original as it will possibly ever be. It does look astonishingly vibrant and wonderful, but just know going into it that this remarkable film is unfortunately shows its age. It is for this reason I deduct the one star (duly justified because the machine smooshed my exterior sleeve for the discs).The audio, as astonishing as it is, presents a similar situation. The sound is truly magnificent. The munchkin's trumpets blare triumphantly, the witch really explodes into the scene with magnitude, the tornado tears through Kansas with no mercy sending chills down my spine like never before. The higher bit rate of the audio makes such a wonderful enhancement to the film. It also reveals the age in lower ranges such as during dialog, where it sounds somewhat distant, as if listening to an old Victrola. Would it be better to consider it rustic charm?  That's what I'll do. On the plus side, there's no ambiguity when it comes to what was said - you can make out every word, as clear as a bell! With what there is to work with, I give the audio five stars, and reason to upgrade alone if you've got any sound system beyond built-in television speakers. I absolutely love how this movie sounds.I'm not too much of a bonus features guy, but I have so far viewed the MGM standard DVD feature on side one about the historical aspects of the studio, narrated by Jean Luc Picard [Patrick Stewart] in a smoking jacket with a big, poufy handkerchief. It features MGM stars of yesteryear in rare interviews revealing insider details of the studio in its heyday. It makes for a very interesting addition to the package as well, and I do plan on eventually getting around to all the bonus features.I recommend the ""The Wizard of Oz"" 70th Anniversary Limited Edition set for the magnificent feature and its wonderful presentation, and for the outstanding bonus materials that accompany it. It's well worth it in value for what you receive, and the experience is as good as it's going to get with the brilliant picture quality and the astonishingly remarkable audio."	4.0	There's No Format Like Blu-ray	2009-10-12	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AWEOR1WZSMBEZ	"""juj"""	Kansas represents our dreary lives & we, kids & adults alike, often wish for something else, thinking that it would enhance our lives, even for a bit second --- even if it was just a dream.  We hope & dream that somewhere over the rainbow there is a place like Oz.  But wait, is Oz that perfect?  Yes, it seems  better off with its yellow brick road, with munchkins roaming around in their colorful outfits, the Emerald Palace, but are the inhabitants happy & safe there as you would have thought?  No, there is evil & fear of the wicked witch, deception by the wizard himself & his taking advantage of his blind followers.  But most of all, there is still this disatisfaction as you know, by the brainless scarecrow, heartless tin man & cowardly lion, who could have represented anybody in that kingdom -- real or imagined.Despite this seemingly adult plot, the film appeals to children as well, basically because of its fairy-tale type manner of presentation -- all these splendid architecture, colorful costumes, vibrant songs, & of course, a fairy tale will not be complete without the presence of the evil villainess - the witch!Taking all these in consideration, the film is just as timeless as it relays a very special message.  You don't have to look far to seek happiness or satisfaction, for you can find it in yourself.  We might be just like the scarecrow, the tin man or the lion, continuously searching for what they already have deep inside.  & yes, most of the time, we are like Dorothy, always wishing to escape reality but only realizing at the end that true happiness is being with your loved ones, through thick or thin.	5.0	Somewhere over the rainbow...	2002-01-29	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3I8CQG6XG8DTX	Julia Bell	I am a Consultant to the International School of Paphos in Cyprus. The school caters for children aged 3 to 18 and students are mainly from English, Cypriot and Russian families with a few other nationalities. Tuition is in English. We are producing Wizard of Oz with cast of staff and students, helped by parents. The performance will be in March next year, with a voluntary collection to help children suffering from cancer. We are so delighted with the 70th Anniversary edition of two discs which we purchased from Amazon. It is of high quality and a great help in helping our students, some of whom do not have English as a first language. We have been delighted with the 'sing along' feature as it really helps our children to learn the songs and to get rhythms and timing correct. We were delighted also with the copy of the score which is very well set out and is helping our music teacher to work with groups and individuals. The quality of these products is excellent and I cannot recommend them too highly. They are making sure that we can produce a quality performance, and have great fun doing it with a cast that grows each week! We seem to have more 'Munchkins' each rehearsal as more children are eager to join. Many thanks Amazon; we could not get these items in Cyprus and you have made it possible for us to help our children proudly present 'Wizard of Oz' to their parents. You supplied us with 'Oliver' last school year and this helped us to get 'rave' reviews from parents and friends.

The video quality is amazing its unreal how a film that came out 1939 could look so fresh in 2009! The sound is great as well being a Dolby HD 5.1 track. The extras are a great addition to have for the ultimate Oz fan! Do your self and your family a favor and pick this blu ray up whether it be the single disc or the UCE, it will provide hours of entertainment for the whole family just as it has since its release in 1939.	5.0	Outstanding Blu Ray!	2009-09-29	4	3	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3ALDRFFBK8LKE	Kacey	My boyfriend bought the 5 disc set for me. He gave it to me this afternoon. I have yet to put the dvd in my dvd player, but I'm excited!I love all the little collectors items it comes with. In the picture provided online, the pins didn't look like they were great quality, but they are amazing. The mini snowglobe is perfect for my dorm room.Wizard of Oz is my favorite movie hands down. I'm 18, going to be 19 and I burnt the tape out when I was younger. My mom got me the DVD 5 or 6 years ago and it skips now because of how much I've watched it.This is a great gift item for a birthday, Christmas or just because. I wasn't expecting it to be a just because gift, but I'm so happy my boyfriend got it for me. Words can not describe how excited and happy I was that he got it. I didn't think he would. Can't wait to watch the special features. Gotta see if Jitterbug is on there!	5.0	Love it!	2013-10-12	2	1	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A10QTFGDSIRV5W	K. Adele	I first saw the Wizard of Oz at Radio City Music Hall in NYC back in the 1950s. I was wowed then. Fifty plus years later, i have been wowed again.I acquired and viewed the 3D DVD. I watched it on a large screen. It was a great viewing experience. If you have a 3D television, then be sure to buy the 3D version of the Wizard of Oz.Everything about the production is great. Judy Garland is superlatively professional as an innocent girl from Kansas. The chemistry of Dorothy, the tin man, the scare crow and the cowardly lion is phenomenal. While the movie is obviously a fantasy, their great, harmonious performance gave the story credibility. The Munchkins, of course, also do great stuff.After viewing the movie, my wife and i thought wistfully of how in the old days Hollywood could produce films that were touched by magic. I can think of no recently produced films we've seen that have the entertainment value and professional panache of The Wizard of Oz and other classics from the old days.	5.0	A great film for everyone	2013-10-25	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1XOVUP0RBM56J	"KAT ""Daisy"""	I've always loved this movie and the wonderful songs in it.  I was worried that with so much disney animation and technology in movies, the magic would be lost on my kids, but at 3 1/2 and 1 years old they loved it.  This was in their stocking for Christmas and they were instantly taken with the picture on the back of the four heros, especially the lion and the tin man.  My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves dorothy and now wants a dorothy costume to go with her myriad disney princess costumes.  Good to see some diversity finally.  :)  My son is still a baby, but loved the music and seemed fascinated with the colors.  Even after all the overstimulation with today's cartoons, it struck a chord with both of them.  Good to see some magic lasts through the generations.	5.0	Wonderful Classic to share with my kids	2012-01-12	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3LGB9KM2A85TW	"Katrina Elizabeth ""Kat"""	"In my opinion this is the best movie ever! The change from black and white into colour is amazing. The way Dorothy's face lights up for the first time when she steps into Munchkin land it's like she's seeing colour for the first time.In the restored editon you can really see everything for the first time. For example, in Munchkin land every single bit of colour jumps up at you, I could even see the dew on the flowers and Glinda's dress was blinding.They did take out a few things. If you have the old Wizard of Oz VHS you can sometimes see the strings holding the Cowardly Lion's tail, those are now removed. Also, the famed ""Munchkin hanging"" scene when Dorothy, The Scarecrow, and the Tin Man are leaving the woodcutter's house, has been erased from the background.I also loved the extras. The cast biographies were amazing, I had no clue that ""Toto"" was in other movies? What I really loved though, were the home videos.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1HY1TPRIAVFB2	"Keith D. Dillon ""Defrocked Radio Star"""	"The main thing about this ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" of The Wizard of Oz is all the juicy video extras. There are no less than five ""Oz"" related films from the silent era as well as one Pre-Code film (1933) and even one movie of the week (1990). In addition, there are tons of featurettes; featurettes on any possible subject, from the casting of the ""Munchkins"" to the career of Victor Fleming. Plus, there's the usual gallery of story boards, design sketches and continuity and publicity stills. There's a video of Angela Lansbury reading from The Wonderful Wizard of OZ and even some of Harold Arlen's home movies. The printed material inside this set is mainly flummery: a Wizard of OZ yearbook, a reprint of both the shooting budget and the ""campaign"" book. These things are fun, but not particularly useful. They even threw in a Wizard of Oz watch which, frankly, I have no intention of wearing. For me, what makes this set so useful is all the footage."	5.0	The Wizard of Oz Ultimate Collector's Edition	2011-03-25	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	THE WIZARD OF OZ was a history making film that I first saw on the big screen at the LOWES PARADISE in an early 50's re-release with my big brother in the old Bronx. As I recall my eight year older brother told me that we were going to see something very special. I still had no idea what we were in for and the film was an unexpected treat to both sets of our then young eyes. This was at a time well before the annual Wizard of Oz TV showings, since there was still much money to be earned by re-releasing the film.This was one of the very early movies which made effective use of color to signify the magic of the Land of Oz, and B&W; to represent conventional Kansas. I shouldn't have to say anything about the great performances from actors (large and small), the grand sets, costumes, makeup, music and special effects that we have all grown to love.There was plenty of movie magic to go around and sufficient elements of the macabre to satisfy the budding little horror fan that I was at even an early age. I certainly enjoyed Dorothy, Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman, the Cowardly Lion and the Good Witch and was rooting for them while squirming in my seat. But also enjoyed the Wicked Witch and her minions of demonic flying monkeys! Let's not forget the great crystal ball, huge impressive hourglass and the castle to end all castles. I guess everyone knows the story of the wicked witch almost burned beyond recognition by special effects people a little too fast on the draw with their fire.  They almost changed that scene from dematerialization to cremation. It is amazing to me that she returned to the studio to complete the film as I wouldn't have gone anywhere near the scene of that trauma.  Well then, the show must go on.	5.0	THE WIZARD OF OZ - Needs no review from me but..	2008-06-11	1	1	0

We have a wall with masks & a tapestry.When I got a 3D HDTV this was the first disc I tried. I was shocked. WoO doesn't transfer well to 3D. The original movie had a 3D effect with was in and out of focus. I'm sure there is a technical term for this. When they 3Derized it the in-focus characters looked great and the distant, therefore blurry background scenes and characters were horribly distracting. At first my heart sunk that I wasted a lot of money on the HDTV. Other, made-for-3D titles brought me back down off the ledge.	2.0	WoO doesn't transfer to 3D well	2014-06-29	0	0	0

This is the one film that since it's release in 1939 has remined the pivatal and favorite childhood fantacy. The film has such an unforgettable meaning to it and it reaches into the depth of ones deepest dreams and makes one realize that no matter what happens are where you are in the world, Home, family and friends are the most important things. Judy Garland starred as the little farmgirl who journeys to Oz to find just that the importance of Home. For it's day ""The Wizard Of Oz"" made history with it's special affects. It starts out in Black and White and then goes to the most incredable color that anyone has ever seen. If you have never seen this film then you must. There are such deep parts that it will make you cry. The music, the stars, the color and the story make this are truly magnificent masterpeice of the golden age of MGM musicals and you get to see why more than 33 years after her death Judy Garland is still one of the most beloved singers and actress's of all-time!"	5.0	The one True and forever endearing movie classic!!!	2002-12-14	5	4	1

We had gathered with family and friends to go cut our own Christmas trees to decorate.  After the trees were cut, we had a delicious meal (homemade soup or chili, hot homemade dinner rolls, and warm apple pie a'la mode), drank hot chocolate, and watched the Wizard of Oz for the first time. A new holiday tradition was born. We have worn out VCR tapes, DVDs, and who knows how many old film reels at the movie theaters and/or on TV of this movie.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	What can I say about this amazing classic that hasn't already been said? 1939's THE WIZARD OF OZ is high on many film buff lists (Including my own) because of its timeless appeal, effortless charm and magical whimsy. Derived from L Frank Baum's whimsical book and directed by veteran Victor Fleming, Oz tells the story of Dorothy, a young Kansas girl who gets whisked away in a tornado to Oz and is greeted by a Technicolor candy land filled with munchkins, prospective sing along friends and a host of helpers and dangerous enemies (Forget Darth Vader, the wicked witch of the north is the scariest villain in cinema history) In a film full of magical moments, notably the arrival in Oz, the squeaky munchkins etc, the yellow brick road is the topper. Linking arms with her ragtag band, Dorothy rouses her troops with a sparkling rendition of the bouncily hummable 'Follow the yellow brick road' as they skip along said path. Only the movies could elicit such delighted innocence and gung-ho determination in a band consisting of an effete feline, a man made of scrap metal, one of straw, and a teen who dresses like a toddler. Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley as the scarecrow, lion and tin man are fantastic, charming audiences for almost 60 years. This perennial favorite never fails to impress audiences and film fans.H.R. Bishop's instantly memorable music peppers the film and Harold Rossons' masterful cinematography is a sight to behold.  Such a pivotal part of the film's charm, its no surprise the non-musical sequel Return to Oz failed to re-capture the spirit of the original. Despite the mediocre success of the original cinema release, Oz gradually gained popularity throughout the years to become the cherished masterpiece it is today. There are several theories attributed to the film not really capturing audiences, namely that Americans were actually in a pretty good place in a pre-war '39 and so, like Frank Capra's Its A Wonderful Life, Oz was dismissed as being overly-sentimental and hokey fluff. However both movies became favorites after the war when the world needed escapism more than ever. Another theory is that the film was originally released in black and white, which basically makes the film somewhat visually uninspiring. But Hakuna Matata, OZ is regarded as one of the best examples of expertly crafted movie making in cinema history. The digital transfer for the DVD is excellent, and the comprehensive behind-the-scenes footage and retrospective making of films are excellent.	5.0	"""Follow the yellow brick road!"""	2005-07-09	2	2	0

So here is what I found.  As a first viewing, I cued up both the vhs and dvd versions in my home theater and switched back and forth.  I was blown away by the difference.  MUCH more dramatic than I ever expected.  The sound on the dvd was brilliant, and the visual image was astounding.  When it got to the part where Ms Gulch was bicycling down the road with Toto in her basket I froze both images.  The VHS version was a kind of muddy yellow ocher color. The DVD had been restored to a proper sepiatone tint.  In the VHS version, you could see a woman on a bicycle peddling down the road.  In the DVD version, the sky behind was lighter, so that she really popped away from the background. Not only that, but suddenly you could see every fold and crease in her skirt, and shadows draping across.  This was obviously an incredibly well done restoration beyond anything I had hoped for. As for the extras, they kept myself and my family completely captivated for hours on end.  What a great experience.  I whole heartedly recomend this dvd version for anyone interested in owning, watching or learning more about this wonderful piece of our culture.	5.0	Incredible experience	2002-12-27	9	9	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3NFO65EIFQRE1	Laughing Dragon	"A few days ago it occurred to me how odd it was that, even though I've always loved the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"", I don't own a copy of the movie. So I came here to Amazon to look at the various versions of the film it offered. I chose the Three-Disc Collector's Edition in order to get as many behind-the-scenes goodies I could (they're the best part of any movie on DVD in my opinion).Well, I've spent the last two days watching all of the goodies on this 3-disc set, and they're as wonderful as the Wizard himself. Terrific interviews, behind-the-scenes facts, deleted scenes and songs, special programming tributes dedicated to Oz, derivative programs of Oz (including snippets of the ""Off To See The Wizard"" TV show animated by the immortal Chuck Jones) bits of recorded outtakes (for instance, there's a recording of Judy Garland taping the ""Over The Rainbow"" song several times to get the right ""take"" - and she coughs at one point and has to start over again. And there's a recording of her and Ray Bolger singing ""We're Off To See The Wizard"" multiple times, and between takes you hear Judy giggling and chatting with Ray, and that's just priceless). And as for the film itself - it's never, ever looked better. It's been so expertly restored that, for the first time, you can see the freckles on Judy Garland's forehead, the burlap texture on the face of the Scarecrow, and the rivet between the eyes of the Tin Woodman. It's sharp and clear and the colors are true and bright without being the least bit saturated (there's a feature about the film's restoration too, and it's very interesting). All in all, this DVD set gave me many hours of fascination and delight, and is a bargain for the price. I am so glad I decided to get it. It's a must-have for anyone who loves the Oz movie and who dotes on Hollywood history. Highly recommended. I'd give it ten stars if I could."	5.0	Because of the wonderful things it has!	2012-05-17	1	1	0

I went to see ""Wizard of Oz"" last night at a special viewing for the 70th anniversary.  It was a treat to see this film in high definition.  The color was vivid and crisp.  The scenes in Munchkin Land were incredible-a perfect example of the vivid color and detail.  With this new remastered and digitally enhanced film, you see many details you probably missed before.The songs are still enjoyable and beautifully done, especially Judy Garland's ""Over the Rainbow"" (which won the Best Song Oscar in 1939).It is a fun movie for every age-something the family will watch over and over.  Even after some years since seeing it last, I still remember every word to every song and dialogue.Another aspect I forgot about was the humor.  Bert Lahr's portrayal of the Cowardly Lion was playful and great fun.This is a classic every home should own.  It is a movie that will never grow old and will become a family favorite-unless it already is.

That's more than I can say for some of the additional items that are included with the 70th Edition - these DO NOT FIT in the Box!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A29AY5H85IFS8J	"Lawrence W. Lee Jr. ""elsquared"""	Just a few thoughts on the DVD release of this classic film.  I won't summarize the story here - let's face it, everyone already knows the story.  In my opinion, this is the best film ever made, for a very simple reason; it does best what a film is supposed to do - it entertains.  Adults or children, anyone will enjoy it.  But if anyone still has any doubts about the clarity and quality of DVD, this movie will change their mind.  Even in the Kansas scenes, you'd think you're looking at a first generaton print.  And the color scenes are simply brilliant.  About the only thing missing is watching it on a large screen TV.  Lots of bonus items - a documentary on making the film, cut scenes, audio commentary, all sorts of things.  Two minor complaints, however.  On the scene selection menu, the screen may freeze.  Sometimes you can pick a specific scene, sometimes you can't.  It must be a problem with the DVD itself - I returned my original DVD purchase, and the problem repeated itself with the exchanged DVD.  Not a major problem, more an annoyance.  The only other complaint is with the deleted &quot;Jitterbug&quot; scene.  While still photos and home movies play on-screen, the audio portion on the DVD is not the actual film version (with Judy Garland singing, as it is on the soundtrack CD).  No explanation is given, even though the Garland version does appear on the VHS tape.  With these problems, I would have preferred to give 4-1/2 stars, but that wasn't one of the choices.  Overall, you will not be disappointed.  You can't go wrong if you purchase &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot; on DVD.	5.0	Best film - best format - a &quot;must buy&quot;!	2002-03-05	5	5	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1NFV45J3MCC4E	Lightning Surfer	One of the greatest films ever made.  An American treasure and a pop culture classic.  The plot?  A teenage girl and her unusual friends battle a wicked witch in a magical land.  Now then, praise must go to producer Mervyn LeRoy for overseeing the making of this cinematic triumph.  Unfortunately for him, the experience was chaotic.  For example &#8211; during its troubled production, five different directors were involved and several cast members were dealt severe injuries.  Thus, this caused shooting delays and budget overruns.  However, the final product owes much to LeRoy&#8217;s determination in realizing his vision of the popular book from author L. Frank Baum.  Also, his choice of songwriters Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg played a huge role in the fabric of this beloved movie.  Their catchy tunes punctuate Dorothy&#8217;s emotional state along her journey.  Folks, let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; &#8220;Over The Rainbow&#8221; is the greatest original song ever heard on celluloid.  So in conclusion, &#8220;The Wizard Of Oz&#8221; is an amazing musical adventure that is endlessly entertaining.  In terms of ranking the very best pictures of all time, this film is as close to a general consensus that there is.[75th Anniversary Blu-Ray Release]:  Those with the 70th Anniversary Blu-ray may want to keep that version since the deleted scenes as well as some rare archival material such as TV interviews and radio spots are only available there.  That said, most casual fans of this classic film will be just as well served to buy this latest 2013 version since it has a brand new making-of documentary as well as a more user friendly disc menu.  The same outstanding quality is there:  Video & Audio gets a A- grade.	5.0	Cinematic Triumph Is Also Pop Culture Classic	2013-11-08	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"It was a copyright mistake that got this movie launched. While its initial release in 1939 was barely registered, the company which owned the movie forgot to renew its copyright. Suddenly the movie was ""fair game"" and intrepid TV stations began showing this movie - for free, in essence, every year as a big feature. I remember being thrilled each year when it got to be time for the showing. My sister and I would curl up in our blankets, preparing to yet again be transported from our grainy black and white world into a marvelous colorful world of talking scarecrows and flying monkeys.Every year, something new would be revealed. We would relate more to the cowardly lion and his fears. We'd understand the dual pulls of Dorothy - how she longed for something more interesting, but how she also craved the comforts of home, too. The movie became embeded into our culture. In modern times, a book like ""Wicked"" - telling how the evil witch was actually just misunderstood - can become instantly popular because we all understand the story so well. We know instantly what the ""man behind the curtain"" means.The original story by L. Frank Baum is apparently a multi-layered political story about different branches of government and industry, sort of like how the Mother Goose stories are all actually political tales. Be that as it may, most people who watch the movie version of The Wizard of Oz aren't thinking about industry moguls or politics. They're thinking of a basic story. And perhaps that is what makes this story shine. It can have a powerful meaning at its most basic layers - a girl and her dog. It can also have much more meaning for literate adults who can see the many hidden meanings within each character.Highly recommended, given how many movies, tv shows and other media make reference to these characters."	5.0	A Staple in Modern Storytelling History	2007-05-12	2	2	0

But as I'm approaching early adulthood I have a new appreciation for this movie.  For it's time it seems so developed, imaginative and original.Recently I decided to see what happens when you play Pink Floyd's the Dark Side of the Moon with the volume all the way down and watching the movie at the same time- and let me tell you, it was like seeing the Wizard of Oz for the first time, but in a different way.  Not only does it say a lot for the movie itself, but for the artistry and musicianship of the members of Pink Floyd.For those of you who don't know what to do...start the c.d. at the second roar of the MGM production logo lion.  Make sure that you put for c.d. on repeat because the movie is 2 1/2 times longer than the album.what is even cooler to think about is that somehow Pink Floyd figured out the timing of the movie so that the first and second time you play the c.d., it still matches up with the rhythms and intonations in the film.  anyway, I highly recommend watching the Wizard of Oz this way, it's quite an experience!	5.0	Pink Floyd and the wizard of oz... a wonderful combination	2004-10-27	12	9	3

They found the DVD and really wanted to see it since they knew the story.  I was a little apprehensive, but decided to let them watch it.  They LOVED it, even the witch.  I think because they knew mommy had played her in high school).

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1A8GS3SLJI3E4	LMC	I first met Dorothy(Judy Garland), the Scarecrow(Ray Bolger, the Tin Man(Jack Hayley) and the Cowardly Loin(Bert Lahr) as a child, when it first appeared on TV. As many gererations before me, I was delighted by Dorothy and her friends, enchanted by the Munchkins and frightened by the flying monkeys. I still am, some 40 years later.For more than 60 years this timeless classic has been passed down from generation to generation and it's kindly message has survived the countless retellings.From the award winning music to the technicolor used to enhance the magic of Oz, no effort or talent was spared to support the actors who brought the story to life.A little girl looking for the perfect place finds that even in an enchanted land thngs are not perfect, but as lnog as you have the love of family and friends you can face any adversity and triumph.The supporting cast, Glinda, the good witch of the North(Billie Burke) and the wicked witch of the West(Margaret Hamilton) as well as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em, provided the perfect back drop to contrast the innocents of Dorothy and her companions.This is an excellent film which features great acting talents, as well as, the most modern techology of the day, all supported by award winning music. This story has crossed all the lines of the entertainment world, from the movies, to the theater, to the  television screen. It has truely stood the test of time. In 2002 as in 1939 audiences of all ages are drawn into it's magical spell.	5.0	The Wizard of Oz	2002-10-12	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A27PGCHCPUPE3T	lojav	"Having just read L. Frank Baum's book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and subsequently watching the classic 1939 MGM film, I thought I'd do a review of the movie.First of all, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed Baum's book and I can see why it is a classic and the source of so many adaptations.  That said, the 1939 film really takes this source material to a new level.  The problem with Baum's book is that it is a series of episodes that, on its own in written form weaves a magical tale.  But, if one imagines the story filmed exactly as is, I believe you'd see a rather slow and, at times, cumbersome film.  The writers and filmmakers of ""The Wizard of Oz"" take the best of Baum's original work and create a narrative that has drama and intrigue.Whereas in the book the Wicked Witch of the West really only appears in a few chapters and is really only a threat to the Wizard, the movie creates a real enemy for not only the people of Oz, but for Dorothy and Company.  She appears throughout the film constantly watching and trying to foil Dorothy's attempt to get to the Wizard.  One of the best examples of a change from the book is that it's the Wicked Witch who casts a spell on the poppies to make Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep.  Glinda, who's also monitoring the situation, gives them a little help, allowing them to escape.  In the book, Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep because that's what poppies do and they end up getting rescued by a bunch of field mice.  While its fun to read about the field mice, in a film situation, it is much more compelling to see this little bout between good versus evil.Another big change that the film makes from the book is connecting Kansas to Oz.  Several of the characters Dorothy meets are based on the people in her life.  She is protected in Oz by the same people who help protect her as farm hands on Uncle Henry's and Auntie Em's farm.  And, moreso, she is threatened by somebody who suspiciously looks like the Wicked Witch of the West.  It's a brilliant storytelling device.Finally, one cannot fail to mention all the classic music involved.  ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" is not only one of the most memorable songs of not only the film, but of all time.  The songs are very much characters in the film that also help move the story along in a way that is fun and capture the spirit of Oz.I've always loved this film, but, after having read the book, it really makes me appreciate the film in a much greater way than I have before."	5.0	The film takes Baum's original book to new levels!	2013-03-24	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A13X93M7A4HGW	"Lolita Angelique Sherman ""Mommy is a Genius"""	"Well first and foremost, I ordered the standard DVD edition. Since, I knew the technology of the time, would be limited, if not destroyed, by the upscaling and color separations employed today. The blue ray will disappoint since, in the times of GOLDEN HOLLYWOOD, film was literally painted, for special effects, and retouching. Yes, the Artisans of that time were that good. As well, as lighting was gas based for film cameras. So today's technology would simply be ""confused"" by the techniques.  Pixellation are the least of the problems. So save some money and grief, and buy the DVD STANDARD- version.I had the previous Anniversary release, and my daughter scratched it up. So this is a replacement. It was a 1 disc, with many bonus features, from the cast and behind the scenes knowledge.I think the sound could have been enhanced, considering the new technology. But it is not. So use your surround system.The Wizard of OZ, is an MGM STUDIOS Frank L. Baum adaptation,which was not really a children's book. The Irony is the Wizard of Oz, is a core element of childhood. Many generations over. This film is considered to be ONe of the best films of all time, by even the most ""purist"" of standards. There are only a handful of movies that have transcended race,culture,class, and this film does. The message is Universal, and the allure is timeless.There really has never been a film, that has enjoyed, the legacy, of The Wizard of Oz.I am 38 years old, and I am a 3rd generation viewer, and this film, is one of my kids favorite movies, in spite of all the fan fare and technology used today.Without reserve, this movie is one to have, in a bunker, or stranded on an island, it is that meaningful.I guess, the real question, is this THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE ( OF ALL TIME)?IT's hard to dispute the longevity, and influence.To all who read, please comment, what film, you think has had the same impact and legacy? ( I am sure, you will have to think far and wide)My top 5 are1. The Wizard of Oz2. The Exorcist3. Psycho4. The Matrix ( the first one)5. Scarface ( The Al Pacino version, which yes, was a remake of a 1930's movie starring Paul Muni)Based on cultural,race and class impacts. And overall, was the movie a Game-Changer.* I know the Godfather is high, but not my TOP FIVE."	5.0	Question: Is The Wizard of Oz the greatest film ever? skip the BLURAY. READ	2013-11-02	1	1	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2P9R2G8Y6CHBT	"LombaireFan ""LF"""	"This is a classic that has just recently turned up on DVD. Of course, everyone is familiar with this film from the frequent TV broadcasts, but recently, there has been renewed interest because of an unusual ritual popular with fans of Pink Floyd. Supposedly if you watch the movie while listening to the Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon album, the music actually synchs up with the action on screen. Now I don't have any Pink Floyd; they were a little bit before my time. But I did try this experiment with the The Fabulous Peggy Lee and the results were inconclusive. Oh well...my acid days are long over anyway.Even without rock background, this is still a startling piece of work. Judy Garland performs beautifully as the lonely young Dorothy who, because of a freak tornado, finds herself a very long way from her Kansas home and devoted gay following. Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley are all equally brilliant as the three adult males who find what's missing from their lives while accompanying a pubescent girl through the woods. And of course, who could overlook the Munchkins? - or as they'd no doubt be known in today's PC climate, the ""little squeaky people."" I know ""there's no place like home"" but Oz was such a wonderful place, I couldn't bear the thought of not returning. I don't have cable so I haven't seen any of episodes yet but I'm glad I also ordered copies of the HBO TV series and sent a few on to my nieces and nephews as well."	5.0	I'm off to see the Wizard!	2004-09-24	4	1	3
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3BHP4G23M6HIV	Lomonster	The movie itself is as wonderful as ever and all of the extras should've made this 4 or even 5 stars.  However,  I wasn't so impressed with the restoration and expected so much more from a blu-ray.  Perhaps I was expecting too much,  but I really thought this would explode on my screen.  The black and white sequences were really black, white and yellow.  The color scenes were beautiful, but not spectacular.  If you're buying for all the extras,  then this is an amazing edition plus you get the Amazon exclusive collectible posters with the Amazon edition.

It's the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie that we grew up with!  Even Judy Garland's name got goofed up as ""Jody Garland"" but still, the DVD is clear, crisp, beautiful and sounds wonderful.  And it's a lot cheaper than the the ""Wizard of Oz"" alternative DVD's.  You only get one DVD - just the movie, no extras or games or behind the scenes information.  But I didn't want any of that.  I just wanted the movie.When you pop this movie into your DVD player go first to ""Set-up"" and under Subtitles click on ""none"".

I have always looked forward to seeing it on tv each year and now, watching it with my daughter.  I was so excited to see a collector's edition release that we pre-ordered it.  I thought ""We can watch it when ever we like and it will be just like when I was a kid"".  I was wrong!  My husband and I watched most of the movie saying ""Did you see that?"" or ""I don't remember that!""  It was very surreal because I felt like the version I had watched on tv as a child was a distant, vague, out of focus memory, even though I knew what would happen next.  The DVD gives you a crisper, more detailed version than ever before.  There were so many new things that we don't remember from our ""tv"" version, I can't begin to list them all here.I would recommend this for anyone who loves the movie or who would like to share ""the Land over the Rainbow"" with child.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2S6T3V4GI8DBD	LuDivine	"No, but it wasn't a dream, it was a place.  And you, and you, and you were there.""  While other people love the Wizard of Oz for it's famous sets in Oz, or for it's famous song ""Somewhere over the rainbow,"" it's my favorite for the wonderful characters.  Everyone should own this movie because this movie has given faithful service to the young in heart.  Every actor in The Wizard of Oz has dual roles, in Kansas and in Oz.  The three characters that are the most interesting are Hunk, Hickory, and Zeke, they are characters from Kansas, who play the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, that Dorothy meets on her journey to the magical land of Oz.The first character the viewer meets is Hunk.  Hunk is tall, and slender, and quickly characterized as lacking brains and intelligence.  This character trait is revealed early in the movie, when Hunk is fixing the wagon.  The advice Hunk gives Dorothy is that she should use her brains and not go by Miss Gulch's place.  Hunk simply tells Dorothy ""You aren't using your head about Miss Gulch; think you didn't have any brains at all!""  Dorothy responds, ""I have so got brains.""  Later in Dorothy's dream, she begins a journey, following the yellow brick road.  On the journey she meets Scarecrow, who resembles Hunk.  Scarecrow asks if he could go to Oz with Dorothy, so he can get a brain.  In other words, Hunk has brains, and as his role as the Scarecrow in Dorothy's dream, he is out in search for intelligence and a brain. Not only does Dorothy meet Scarecrow, but also Tin Man, on her journey to Oz.The second character the viewer meets is Hickory.  Hickory plays the role as the Tin Man in Dorothy's dream.  Hickory desires respect, and a heart. To put it in other words, he wants to be considered someone important in life, and wants to love, and be loved.  Auntie Em says that they are ""three shiftless farmhands,"" but Hickory says, ""But someday, they're gonna erect a statue to me in this town.""  Erecting a statue of Hickory, shows that the town considers Hickory someone important.  That one line foreshadows the Tin Man when he is frozen from rust, in Dorothy's dream.  Auntie Em, joking says, ""Well don't start posing for it now.""  Dorothy and Scarecrow oil Tin Man, and ask him if he would like to join them on their journey to see the Great Oz.  On their journey, Dorothy, Scarecrow, and Tin Man meet Cowardly Lion.Cowardly Lion is the third character the viewer meets.  Accordingly, to Dorothy's dream, Zeke is the Cowardly Lion.  As Dorothy goes to Zeke for advice, Zeke asks Dorothy, ""Are you going to let that ol' Gulch heifer try and buffalo ya? She ain't nothing to be afraid of, have a little courage, that's all!""  Zeke tells Dorothy what he would do is go up to Miss Gulch and spit in her eye.  Earlier in Kansas, Zeke shows bravery when he hauls and saves Dorothy from the squealing pigs.  Zeke reacts to his bravery by fainting.  Stated differently, in Dorothy's dream, Zeke, being the Cowardly Lion, lacks courage and bravery.  Dorothy offers Cowardly Lion to join her, Scarecrow, and Tin Man, on their journey to see if the Great Oz can help each one with what they lack.As a result in the three cases, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion lack something: intellect, courageous strength, and a sensitive heart.  All three characters proved to have these qualities since the start.  In recognition of their qualities, they were rewarded with symbols.  Scarecrow received a diploma; a medal was rewarded to Cowardly Lion, and a clock, shaped as a heart, for Tin Man.  If you want to be young in heart, purchase this movie, and I guarantee the child in you will be present.  Like Dorothy says, ""There's no place like home,"" to watch this cherished movie, with your close ones right by your side."	5.0	Double Life in Kansas and Oz	2004-12-08	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AP9H7OSCZEULK	Luffy D. Monkey	"Hi everyone,I purchased the single blu ray disk of the Wizard of Oz, which is the same as this one, except it doesn't have the watch and all the extra disks, but it does have the exact same movie disk.So with that, let's dive right in!Now, I've been a fan of Wizard of Oz ever since I was a little kid (and that was long ago), so I was very excited to get this version and to see it all cleaned up, etc.I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed in this new cleaned up version.  Why?When Dorothy first enters Munchkin Land and the camera spans over the area, you can immediately tell you are on a movie set.  The leaves, trees and flowers are all shiny plastic.  You can tell that the water is a fake cheap pond and you clearly see where the set ends and the backdrop begins. It just looked so fake!  My heart sank at the sight of it.  The magic was gone.When Dorothy leaves on the yellow brick road out of Munchkin Land , you can see where the set ends at the wall and Dorothy is about 5 feet from the wall when they cut and faded out of the scene.  I never noticed that wall before on the old version!This new version cleaned everything up so well that you can tell each set is a movie set and not in the magical land of Oz.In the older version, it was nicely blended in so you really couldn't tell.  It gave it more magic for me and drew me in more.  This newer blu-ray version made things too clear and in the end took away that magic.  I felt like I was watching a cheap movie on a set and I was so tired of trying to be forgiving for it during the entire movie.I watched it to the end, but I felt empty.The best part for me was how good the Wicked Witch looked!  She was really green and creepy looking.  That for me was the best part, along with the fact that you can now clearly see all of the Muchkin's faces, but I didn't really need to see that.What would have been great on this blu-ray set was to include the older version that was not cleaned up!  It could definitely fit with the size that the blu-ray disks can carry!  What would have been best is to have the ability to switch between both the old and the new on the fly, like the way you can do it with the new Star Trek Blu-ray release (they have the ability to switch between the old and the new remastered version while you are watching an episode).  That would have been great to switch back to the old uncleaned up version, which to me has that magic.But for the extreme Wizard of Oz fans, I imagine that you already have the oldest version, so you will probably enjoy this.I have to admit that the ""Sing-A-Long"" feature is cool and all the documentary and interview materials was excellent.If they included the old version, I would give this 5 stars...and they have the ability to do so, so why did they leave it out?  Strange and unfair in my opinion.If you playing this for someone who is watching it for the first time, don't!  It might ruin it.  Get the old version first, if you can find it somewhere.I wish I knew which DVD out there has the old unclean version...anyone know?Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this until they include both the old and the new version together on blu-ray.  I'd pass on this and wait.Thanks everyone and please leave feedback.Take care."	2.0	The oldest version is better.  Why?	2010-01-26	14	11	3

If this was remastered, which I doubt, it should be recalled and Warner Bros. should be honorable and freely exchange the new clean Blu Rays for the ones they offered as 70th anniversary. The colors are amazing, but the movie at times appears a bit fuzzy. It is also bothersome to find that some of the special features are on 480p standard definition - the whole set should have been in 1080p high definition, specially in view of the extra cost.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2QU74ZZPA27OI	"Lunette Slarma ""Lunette Slarma"""	I named this review after two of my favorite words. Ignore anybody who says that this is a bad movie, because it genuinely is not! The costumes are colorful and bright (after the entrance into Oz, anyway) and the plot entertaining. True, when you really think about and summarize the concept it seems rather hokey (particularly the fact that one character is actually wishing for a brain and another for a heart) and the message seems quite corny (there's no place like home), but after you have watched it for yourself you learn that it is quite a fantastical adventure through a whimsical fantasy world!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A25KKXUQQ0OLWB	"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher"""	A restored version of The Wizard of Oz is included in the box along with some memorable memorabilia of the Oz era.  The film is a classic and is wonderful to behold.  This box set includes 3 earlier versions of The Wizard of Oz I had never seen before and a 1933 cartoon version of Oz.  In fact I learned from the commentary that MGM has decided to make this film to counter the runaway popularity of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which took the film industry by surprise.  The set also includes a biography of L. Frank. Baum who wrote the novel after trying several professions which he was not good at and only wrote the book after his mother in law told to write his stories down.  Apparently he was good at telling his children and their friends stories which captivated them.  Other documentaries tell the story of the making and aftermath of the film.  Television was the medium that spurred popularity for the film and made it a yearly viewing habit for millions of children and adults.  A really nice set I enjoyed over the course of several days.	5.0	Wizard's Three Disk Edition of Oz	2012-03-20	0	0	0

Ok so perhaps that individual should have their own personal/private print made, so they can view it in their own personal screening room.  My Hd tv is in the 36 inch range-and I would advise similarly situated folks that this is a good print.  My faithful dog Brady chewed up my other oz disc, that was circa 2000, and I can see the difference in quality in this disc.  The picture is sharper, the colors are more vibrant. So, I would say that if you are the average person, and you're watching this on an average sized hd tv, you will be very pleased.  This is particularly true if like myself, you used to only be able to watch it once a year, in March, on CBS, with commercials, and you had to get up to change the volume on the tv.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"The Wizard of Oz ranks as one of the perennial classics, but how it came to be made is one of the most fascinating stories in cinema.Originally Shirley Temple, an already established star, was the preferred choice for the film's protagonist. But Louis B. Mayer was adamant about putting Judy Garland, then an unknown, in the role. Asked why, he said, ""Because she's got sex appeal! The old lech. :-) But in the end he was vindicated.The film is often said to be the first true color movie, filmed in technicolor, if I remember right, a difficult process to undertake, since that process required a camera capable of filming a red and green split image which was later combined together. Because of that, it required a projector that could operate at twice normal speed. However, many other movies were made in color using more primitive processes going back to the 20s.The film was considered a commercial flop, considering it's high budget ($2,777,000) at the time, but the song ""Over the Rainbow,"" garnered first place as the top song of the year, which helped to boost the movie's popularity.One funny thing was the dwarves who played the Munchkins had never congregated with each other before in such numbers, and someone once told me that their, shall we say, romantic antics off the screen interfered with the making of the movie. :-)The Wikipedia article on the movie contains a fascinating paragraph on the casting process and Buddy Ebsen's near death experience with the aluminum powder makeup:""Casting The Wizard of Oz was problematic, with actors shifting roles repeatedly at the beginning of filming. One of the primary changes was in the role of the Tin Woodman. The Tin Man was originally slated for Ray Bolger, and Buddy Ebsen (famous for his later role as Jed Clampett in The Beverly Hillbillies) was to play the Scarecrow.[4] Bolger was unhappy with being assigned the role of the Tin Man. Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the role of the Scarecrow. Ebsen did not object to the change at first; he recorded all his songs, went through all the rehearsals and started filming with the rest of the cast.[6] But nine days after filming began, he suffered a reaction to the aluminum powder makeup, as it had coated his lungs as he breathed it in while it was applied daily. Consequently, Ebsen (at that point in critical condition) had to be hospitalized and leave the project. MGM did not publicize the reasons for Ebsen's departure and not even his replacement, Jack Haley, initially knew the reason.""But that wasn't the only mishap. Margeret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West, was severely burned during the Munchkin Land scene in which she disappeared in a cloud of smoke. When she returned from the hospital, she refused to do anymore risky scenes. So they got a stand-in to do them, and she was injured too.Many changes were made in the movie from the original book. In the book, the city of Oz is real, although quite fantastic, but in 1939 audiences were thought to be too sophisticated for that sort of story line, so the trip to Oz occurred instead in a dream. Also, the Wicked Witch of the West is far more cowardly in the book compared to the movie. The Kansas farm hands don't exist in the book, and in the book Dorothy is actually the one who engineers their escape from Oz.The novel (and the movie) is full of symbolism which today has been forgotten. For example, in the movie, the silver slippers walk on the gold yellow brick road on their way to the Emerald (green) City. At the time, there was much controversy about whether the dollar (the green) was to be backed by either silver or gold.I have to mention that 20 years ago I had the opportunity to meet L. Frank Baum's grandson at a book signing. At the time he was employed in Silicon Valley, but was writing children's books based on the original series on the side.Anyway, just a few perhaps interesting pieces of trivia on this now classic movie."	5.0	Some historical notes	2008-01-21	2	2	0

From the moment I opened the box I was extremely happy with my purchase and grinning from ear to ear. The 75th Anniverary box containing the items was, by itself, worth the cost to me. It's solid, holographic, and perfect. The first thing you see when opening the gorgeous box are 2 8 1/2 x11 pictures - one of Dorothy in Munchkinland which is gorgeous, and another of a map of Oz. Next is the journal - the front and back covers are laid with comic-strip-esque posters and things, and each page of the Journal has a &#34;twister&#34; background. After removing the journal and it's holder, next is the breathtaking Production book. Such a wonderful compilation of timeline dates and photos from Judy Garland testing out wigs, to photos from the Oscars and Judy's &#34;junior&#34; oscar. Next is the snow globe, small but pretty, which lights up differnt colors. Then the pins...oh the pins!...my personal favorite for some reason. The &#34;courage&#34; cross, &#34;heart&#34; clock, and &#34;brains&#34; diploma are perfect and pretty in their little box. The BluRay/DVD collection is last but certainly not least. 3D BluRay, BluRay, and DVD...all with their own special features disc, then a curious DVD containing &#34;When the Lion Roars&#34;. I have no idea what this is but cannot wait to find out! Great collection, great price, and great memories to be had with my little girl who has yet to see WOO.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A18JT28R8LGXHK	M.A.K.	"Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don't misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things."	1.0	This Film is an Outrageous Sacrilege!!!!!!!	2006-11-11	188	30	158

If you don't own your copy, it is a way to enjoy the movie as well as learn about the details and complications that led to its making. If you already have one of the many 1, 2 or 3-disc versions around, you may honestly not find much new in here.In any case, being able to enjoy it any day again makes this set a unique treat. Having seeing it dozens of times as a kid in Spanish, I cannot help but think that, as we get closer to its 70th anniversary, ""The Wizard of Oz"" still retains a universal and timeless quality and freshness that makes it more than a classic: it's a story that transcends space and time and is bound to entertain all generations to come."	5.0	A story that goes beyond space and time, almost 70 years later	2006-07-21	7	7	0

The opening sepia sequences were incredibly grainy for some reason. The Technicolor sequences seemed very dark, and the flesh tones very red--white folk aren't that color in real life!! Someone needed to balance and match up these elements consistently from scene to scene. I found myself constantly adjusting the picture on my tv throughout the film. I then got out the previously released Wizard dvd to compare and found to my chagrin the picture quality is MUCH BETTER!!!P.S.-that rivet in the center of the tin man's head can be seen just as clearly in the earlier Wizard dvd.	3.0	Disappointed with the new transfer	2005-12-28	13	8	5

What a waste of money it turned out to be.  The 3D is hardly noticeable and the film ratio was a small square box.  I thought it would expand to widescreen when Dorothy lands in Oz like they did with ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" but it didn't.  It was a total waste of money.  I hate to give this one star because I know how it counts toward the overall rating of the film...so please understand that this one star rating is for the 3D DVD not the film."	1.0	Movie is still great...3D is a waste.	2013-10-07	21	8	13

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A25Q9R3HA6K0P7	Mark A. Smiddy	"I give this DVD version a cautionary 5 star rating only because of the actual film itself, which stands on it's own as a wonderful classic for all ages. However for the extra money you'll shell out for the ""Deluxe"" DVD version be warned this is only for the true OZ collector. The boxed set includes some very nice suitable for framing lithographs, a large, paperback bound script and of course the DVD itself. Finally that's where my caution comes into play, the usual added tidbits on the DVD are nice but the Angela Lansbury 50th Anniversary section is obviously transferred from video and though watchable it is still slightly fuzzy. Last but not least is the film itself which is still wonderful and magical."	5.0	Cautionary 5 Stars!	2002-07-28	15	12	3

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2F8FXJ7KQ6XA4	Mark D. Serbin	If you're reading this review chances are you already know the story line. I will keep this review limited to the 3D and color.I watched the 3D blu-ray on my Amazon purchased Vizio M3D55KDE and used a  Vizio 3D blu-ray player. Both use the passive 3D polaroid glasses method.Simply put, the 3D is stunning. I don't know how they did it, but MGM managed to make the Wizard of Oz look as if it was filmed natively in 3D. I have only seen one other converted movie, Jurassic Park, and that was acceptable but can not compare to The Wizard of Oz.The color is near perfect. Good old Technicolor in all its glory.If you have a 3D TV and want to see a superb example of how a properly made 3D movie can look like, get this disc. Now if we could only get Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon given the same treatment, live would be grand.	5.0	STUNNING 3D	2014-02-11	3	3	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1XWMRORNEC0IY	Martha Moore	I was just a very little girl (I don't even remember exactly how old) when I first saw this movie, and I loved it as a child.  I've now seen this movie countless times, and I never grow tired of it.  Every time I watch it I enjoy it just as much as ever.  And every time I still cry at the end, when Dorothy talks about how there's no place like home.  The movie has a beautiful storyline, with an overall theme of love and friendship, but just as great are the outstanding songs. The music is just as enjoyable as the plot, if not more so.  This video is a great investment, as it's the type of movie you can watch over and over and never grow tired of it.	5.0	Undoubtedly the Greatest Movie of All Time!	2004-12-22	4	4	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	THE WIZARD OF OZ has been a perennial favorite of children and adults with long memories for decades.  The reasons for such a long-lived love affair with this movie are as varied as the number of Munchkins who guide Dorothy along the Yellow Brick Road.  On a surface level one remembers the songs of a thoughful Judy Garland who wonders if there is a fantasy land where all good deeds are required to pass.  There is the close knit relationship between Dorothy and the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow, all of which bring to mind the chumminess that would resonate generations later in the television series FRIENDS.  The landscape of OZ and the Emerald City are both so vivid that they become in effect part of the supporting cast as the geography suggests a subtext that Dorothy's journey is a full circle that begins in the full black and white light of day that finds her in danger of a tornado and the evil of Miss Gulch.  As Dorothy sings &quot;Over the Rainbow,&quot; she clearly is on the cusp of womanhood as she tries to reconcile the lurking dangers of nature (The tornado) and brute spinsterhood (Miss Gulch) with the more adult desire to find a place of refuge.  Oz provides that refuge.  The comedy and laughs that one remembers decades later seem based mostly on the outrageous puns and quips of the Cowardly Lion, but in sober reflection the humor is the sort that one finds when one has to whistle in the dark to prevent fear from taking over.  As Dorothy sings &quot;Follow the Yellow Brick Road,&quot; she is reenacting the eternal saga of youth setting out on the journey to maturity.  Children, more than adults, recognize that Oz is more than just a Peter Pan fantasy land.  It is frequently dark, grim, and brooding.  The evil of the Wicked Witch is only the most obvious symbol of anti-life.  Even the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and ultimately Oz itself are first presented in threatening tones.  Dorothy's companions must prove themselves as protectors before their predatory surface illusion can be discarded.  The Wizard is a potent totemic symbol of good masquerading as evil.  Which one it proves to be is a function of the faith that Dorothy brings on her journey.  The reunion at the end echoes the confusion of the beginning.  Dorothy has completed a momentous phase of her life, and through her, the child viewer can take that same journey with her, secure in the knowledge that even the dual journey of light and dark must lead back to its starting point with that journeyer feeling equally grown up.	5.0	OZ: A Place to Escape To and Escape From	2003-12-15	4	2	2

I must say that Netflix was kind enough to give me $16.00 off my next bill, so you can say they bought this for me. This is chocked full of many wonderful extras that I had never seen.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"It's a clich&eacute; to state that The Wizard of Oz is a perennial favorite; but that's what it is for so many reasons. Most importantly, the movie tells a story that more than stands the test of time; and there are characters with whom many people can identify. It's all done very artistically, too. When MGM filmed this movie they knew they had a good production; but I doubt they thought it would be in such high demand all these decades later!The story line is that of a most intriguing fairy tale: Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), who lives with her Uncle Henry (Charley Grapewin) and Auntie Em (Clara Blandick) on a farm in Kansas, isn't truly happy. People have little time for her on the busy farm; and things go from bad to worse when Ms. Elmira Gulch (Margaret Hamilton), a nasty, imperious and selfish old woman, takes away Dorothy's little dog Toto for biting her. Now Dorothy is extremely upset. When Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, she resolves to run away from home--until she meets Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan) who encourages Dorothy to return home. By the time Dorothy returns home, a violent twister has broken loose; Dorothy's family and their farmhands can't hear her pounding on the door of the underground cellar where they are riding out the storm. Indeed, the storm is so intense that it sweeps Dorothy, Toto and the farmhouse to the fairytale land of Munchkinland.There's much more to the story than that. Dorothy accidentally makes an enemy of The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton); but Dorothy also makes friends along her way to Oz where a wizard (Frank Morgan) can return her to Kansas. Look for great performances by Bert Lahr as The Cowardly Lion; Ray Bolger as The Scarecrow and Jack Haley as The Tin Man. Margaret Hamilton does a superb job of portraying the evil Wicked Witch of the West and Billie Burke plays Glinda, the good witch who helps Dorothy as much as she can.While the remastered movie never looked better, it's the movie combined with the extras that really make the 70th Anniversary DVD box set so special. If you didn't get the 2005 box set release of The Wizard of Oz, almost all if not all of these bonus features will be new for you; otherwise the extras on the first 2 DVDs will be mostly what you already have. At any rate, look for newly released extras which include ""The Dreamer of Oz"" with John Ritter from a 1990 TV special; ""Victor Fleming: Master Craftsman;"" ""Hollywood Celebrates It's Biggest Little Stars"" which is a terrific piece about the Munchkins getting their star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame; the 1914 silent film ""The Magic Cloak of Oz;"" another 1914 film entitled ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz;"" a small type of display or coffee table book with 52 pages of fascinating material about the film by John Fricke; a somewhat average but cute wristwatch with art from the film; a sing-along track and more! There's even a digital copy access/download feature for the film which works with Windows Media Player and iTunes.I highly recommend this film for classic movie buffs; and of course fans of the actors in this movie would do very well to get this for their collections. It's highly ranked by the American Film Institute as the #1 fantasy film of all time; and the AFI also ranked this as the #10 Greatest Movie of All Time. I can assure you that this motion picture richly deserves the recognition."	5.0	amazing, creative and wonderfully unforgettable	2010-01-20	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2F8R40Z2OMIJM	"Matt Howe ""outloud98"""	I just had to respond to the San Jose, CA reviewer who commented about the DVD not being in the correct screen ratio.  The reviewer was wishing they'd release OZ in &quot;widescreen&quot;.  Well, in 1939, OZ was not filmed in  widescreen.  It used a standard screen ratio that looks to us viewers today  much like our television screen: SQUARE.  In the past they have released OZ  in the movie theatres in &quot;widescreen&quot; -- it was simply cropped on  the top and bottom to make it look widescreen -- it was not filmed this  way.However, when this version of OZ was released last year in the  theatres, several of my friends were amazed that the screen was  &quot;square&quot;.  This is correct.  GONE WITH THE WIND plays the same  way: square.  They're not &quot;widescreen&quot; (i.e. rectangular)  movies.Thanks, just wanted to clear that up.	5.0	Aspect Ration Confusion ....

Considering this movie is 70 years old the restoration is phenomonal. You will certainly notice the difference when you watch the 'Making of"" extra & see the non-restored version, very muddy with colors bleeding together. You could probably spend a week on the numerous extras alone, which can be entertaining. Sound quality is very clean with no discernable noise.So, snap up this collection & you won't be disappointed."	5.0	Wow Factor	2010-03-28	2	1	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A35XMSURGM0L1N	M. Buisman	The movie starts out as an old fashioned black and white movie about a girl in Kansas. Dreading life on the farm she runs away and through a whirlwind ends up in the magical land of Oz. All of sudden the movie turns into Technicolor. The first scenes look very much like 'Willie Wonka' but this movie is a little better. The adventures lead to an interesting end and a lame conclusion.'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' may very well be the best song ever written, music and lyrics go hand in hand like never before and after. The entire musical score is great, if you have never seen this movie you might actually know some songs.It's a classic, and deservedly so, especially knowing this movie is 65 years old now.	4.0	Great Songs, Great Colors	2004-02-15	6	2	4

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A370Z6I5GBWU44	"M ""Delicious Strawberry"""	This is a cute film in itself and Judy Garland does a lovely job as Dorothy Gale. The story itself is cute, but it is very different from Frank L. Baum's original story (which I read) Many things have been changed, and I must say that I like the original story better than the film - much of the scary/dark stuff was taken out for the film.There's some nice musical numbers here, so it's an entertaining film, but I must advise you to read the book.	4.0	Classic	2011-02-03	1	1	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AEKL7CRB2S7TT	M. Dillon	This film as always deserves a 5 star rating; however the Blu-ray version only gets a 3 star rating from me. The extra features are great and very informative and the clarity of the film is remarkable, but did any one notice it was presented in (full screen) 4:3 format. I am sure the original film was not filmed in this format so why would Warner Brothers want to release the Blu-ray version in a square 4:3 format. I kept changing the video settings on my Blu=ray player thinking I had a video setting wrong, but they were not, my settings were OK. However to my surprise all the extras I have watched so far are presented in full wide screen with some of the scenes from the movie presented in full wide screen. Don't get me wrong, it was great to watch this movie once again, but very disappointing, not to watch such a great film in a theater format, but instead having to watch it in a square 4:3 format like my old TV.	3.0	Blu-ray Version is Great But...	2009-10-18	12	1	11

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1TY3KN1CYPDWZ	M. Giganti	First off, let me say I have watched this movie more times than I can count.  It was a childhood tradition to stay home every year the night it came on tv. Of course, I had to buy it when VHS became available and again on DVD. Finally, I got this Blu-ray copy. I watched it tonight and thought maybe it's not that much better than DVD... until I put the DVD copy in and watched that one. After comparing the two, the Blu-ray is markedly better. Just be prepared that it's not as crisp as the newer movies, but definitely worth getting if you're a Wizard of Oz fan. And if I may quote the scarecrow, &#34;Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking.&#34; Okay, it has nothing to do with this review, but it's a great line.	5.0	From VHS to DVD to Blu-ray	2013-12-14	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	It is highly doubtful that director Victor Fleming and the cast of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; could possibly have imagined that their film recorded in 1939 would still be watched and endearing children and adults alike 64 years later!  Film audiences in 2003 may flock to theaters to see the latest computer-generated special effects, but that has not diminished the power of this film that was created with special effects by people who never heard of computers, as well as filming in color which was still relatively new for both studios and audiences alike in 1939.&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was based upon the children's novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; written in 1900 by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919).  The story is about a young girl named Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) who is being raised by her Aunt Emily 'Auntie Em' Gale (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry Gale (Charley Grapewin) on a farm in Kansas.  After getting upset that her dog Toto (played by a dog named Terry) might be taken away because of the ramblings of their neighbor Miss Almira Gulch (Margaret Hamilton), Dorothy decides to run away.  However, Dorothy and Toto are caught in a horrific storm that whisks them away to a magical land called Oz where she meets people and characters that nothing like what she knew in Kansas: Glinda the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke), the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), and many others.  (The film's cast had approximately 200 people.)One interesting aspect to the film was that scenes in Kansas were filmed in black and white, while scenes in Oz were filmed in color.  This was the first time that many audience members had seen a film done in full color in 1939 and the transformation from black and white to color is still dramatic today.  Actor Frank Morgan plays five different roles in the film (including Professor Marvel), and several other cast members play dual roles (Margaret Hamilton, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr).  Songs used in the film include the following:* &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, sung by Judy Garland.  This became Judy Garland's signature song and is probably the most famous song from the film.* &quot;We Welcome You To Munchkinland&quot;, sung by the many cast members playing the Munchkins.* &quot;Follow the Yellow Brick Road&quot;, sun by the many cast members playing the Munchkins.* &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot;, sung by Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.* &quot;We're Off to See The Wizard&quot;, sung by Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.* &quot;If I Only Had a Heart&quot;, sung by Jack Haley (and off-screen voice of Adriana Casselotti).* &quot;If I Only Had the Nerve&quot;, sung by Bert Lahr, Judy Garland, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley.* &quot;The Merry Old Land of Oz&quot;, sung by Frank Morgan, Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr and the cast members of the Emerald City.* &quot;If I Were King of the Forrest&quot;, sung by Bert Lahr, Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, and Jack Haley.Overall, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is one of the best films of all time and deserves a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  This film will continue to entertain for many decades to come and is well worth having your collection.  If you want to try something different, play Pink Floyd's album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; while watching the film instead of listening to the film's normal soundtrack.  Also, the DVD contains many extras, including outtakes and excerpts from the 1914 and 1925 silent film versions.	5.0	&quot;I'll get you my pretty...and your little dog too!&quot;	2003-09-05	37	31	6
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2I6FKEHO0ZY4J	Mia DelRey	I bought this item, thinking I was getting a good deal. It was about $10 or so for a special edition. It didn't work on my DVD player when I got it. We have a blu-ray player, so I thought maybe that was the reason. It did work on my computer, so I resigned myself to watch it only there. I watched it maybe, three times on my computer. Today, 10 months later, I tried to watch it again on my computer. It wouldn't work. So, I checked the disc. It was clean. I restarted my computer, tried another disc, did everything I could to make sure everything worked properly. It was the DVD. I even contacted the seller. I realize that it was a bit late, since I had bought the DVD in January, but all I wanted was a little help. I really love this movie & was going to watch it with my mother today, but no. Today, I got no help from them & all I got was a broken movie. Do not purchase movies from this seller.

The innocent Dorathy, conked on the head during a tornado, is mysteriously tranported to a world that comes alive with color.She awakens in the psychodelic land of the Munchkins and immediately becomes a target for the Wicked Witch of the West.  Protected by the beautiful Glenda and charmed by the entertaining Munchkins, Dorathy sets off for the city of OZ where she hopes to find the wizard that will be able to send her home back to Kansas.  Along the way she meets three friends who become some of the most memorable characters in movie history.Interesting documentary footage added to the end showing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and scenes that never made the movie.This is a movie for both adults and kids of all ages.

Also, when you have kids waiting to watch a movie with you this tinkering around to get it to work is really not cool.The Amazon site says that it will play on computers just fine.

Now 12 years later, the new DVD release is the most spectacular DVD release I have ever seen. You could spen a whole week looking and listening to the extras on this disc. I have just finally seen everything on this DVD, and it took me a lot longer than one week to do that. The newly remastered movie is also almost as spectacular. The colors are probably as bright and vibrant as the day the movie came out in 1939. The soundtrack sounds better than ever on my Dolby Digital System. If you don't buy this DVD you are really missing out!	5.0	Best DVD Out There!	2001-04-24	2	2	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2QTWKGJKZAU2Y	Michael Thomas	OZ has to be one of my favourite films. I first saw it at my local cinema in 1973, a very bad print which broke down half way through! But despite this it's magic remained. I have subsequently watched Oz dozens of times, so I was quite excited when last year I heard this movie was getting the 3D treatment. I visited my local cinema and watched for the first time this movie in it's new 3D version and was not disappointed. The evident painted back drops and poppy field give the picture new depth and range! Quite extraordinary!! Watching Glinda's bubble fly in and out was spectacular and I almost had to brush the snow flakes from my lap when it snows in the poppy field. The Great Wizard when Dorothy and friends first have their visit with him was amazing. I never noticed the flames at the bottom of the  effect before but they spurt into the audience. So many other amazing effects and for a film that is now 74 years old  since it's first release in August 1939, I implore all you OZ fans to get a ticket and experience this classic in a cinema while you can!!! I am going again today to watch it!!! Can't wait!!!!	5.0	WIZARD OF OZ 3D SPECTACULAR!!!	2013-09-07	4	1	3
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A22R33RXY52B5D	Michael Vezza	The 1900 novel by Lyman Frank Baum is THE American Fairytale - and this movie - is the AMERICAN Movie. Others may debate; my mind is made up.Even though I am a 'purist' of this book, this movie gives us something new that the book doesn't give us, a different way of giving us the same message - and a few others.Of course the themes of growing up and going home are there, but my favorite is how the movie transitions in that fashion when Dorothy is confronted with her first 'real' adult tasking - getting the broom of the WW of the W (notice all the songs stop after that point in the movie). Of course this was not intended, it just happened that songs in that area were clipped, but it was accidental genius.This movie is for all, even if little kids get frightened (which amazes me since we live in a society where we grow up desensitized to violence).	5.0	Cinematic Treasure and THE American Fairytale	2002-11-26	2	2	0

I am really impressed at the quality of the picture for a 70 year old film.  For any of the ""grain haters"" of this new Blu-ray generation you may not be a fan of the grain that has been left in tact.  I for one believe it should be there just to keep the nostalgic of it all.  Audio is also near perfect with this transfer and overall this is a must have for anyone who owns a Blu-ray player.  I picked up the Emerald edition because it was on sale, I would suggest anyone who is not interested in the digital copy or the ""When the Lion Roars"" feature to pick up the single disc copy."	5.0	Oz never looked so good (in Blu-ray)	2010-02-24	3	3	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AH12D1GD789RD	Mike Morrison	First off, The Wizard of Oz is just plain wonderful, with a superb adaptation of a wondrous story, a stellar cast, and state of the art movie making for its day. The digital restoration delivers a sharp, modern-looking image, bringing the cartoonish, fantasy settings and scenes to life, and it also points up how incredibly well done are the details, like the props, costumes, and makeup.Even tho the movie was not shot with 3D in mind, many close ups and action scenes seem to pop right off the screen, and the 3D version gets a PG rating because some scenes are more intense and just plain scary in 3D. The 3D imaging in general seems perfect, with near and distant objects in proper perspective at all times.I was hoping for a little more pop in the upgraded 5.1 surround soundtrack, as there are many opportunities for intense effects. These would include the tornado sequence at the beginning, the witch and the flying monkeys, and the Wizard himself. It could have been pooped up and even a little heavy-handed, as the scenes are supposed to be fantasy, not reality. The soundtrack is clear and perfect as it is, and at the moment when the house from Kansas has just landed in Oz and Dorothy arises from the bed, the scene is perfectly silent, which adds a marvelous eerie effect. If your viewing room is not completely silent, you'll hear all your own home noises at that point, as the Dolby soundtrack is perfect.This is a great movie with a perfectly rendered 3D digital image. Get it for your kids and grandkids, and enjoy it yourself.	5.0	3D adds impact, enjoyment	2013-12-26	0	0	0

Every little girl derserves the chance to sing that song and skip around the playground with her friends.... and she needed to know the storyline before we headed off to see the absolutely fabuous Broadway musical, WICKED. Can't see WICKED without first understanding 'The Wizard of OZ' story! It was so much better than I remembered it. We had a fantastic time watching watching it together and I had forgotten all the great lines in the show. ""Toto I don't think we're in Kansas anymore"" has become the family motto... Too much fun!

The Tornado Tests ""Off to See the Wizard"" Clips 3 Vault Shorts Audio Jukebox Selection Leo Is on the Air Radio Promo Good News of 1939 Radio Show 12/25/1950 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast Still Galleries Six Theatrical TrailersDiscs 3 & 4 is where new content finally turns up:Disc 3's probably most-awaited feature is:- the 1990 movie ""The Dreamer of Oz,"" based on the life of Oz author and creator L. Frank Baum.-Also a new feature is ""Victor Fleming: Master Craftsman,"" a documentary about the director whose name appears on the movie. (Albeit not the only director...)-""Celebrating Hollywood's Biggest Little Stars,"" a featurette about the midgets who portrayed the Munchkins, culminating with their receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.-Ported over from the 2005 DVD for this one is ""L. Frank Baum: The Man Behind The Curtain,"" a short documentary that might get a little muddled in it's presentation, but is much more factual than ""The Dreamer of Oz.""-There is also the 1910 silent movie ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" and the 1933 cartoon ""The Wizard of Oz.""Disc 4 contains the other Oz silent movies.-It's noted that ""The Magic Cloak of Oz"" (1914) will contain footage that has not been available on home video.-The disc will also contain ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz"" from 1914, which was not on the 2005 DVD.-So, directly ported over from Disc 3 of the 2005 is ""His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz"" (1914),-and the 1925 ""Wizard of Oz"" silent movie.The press release says ""Blu-ray Hi-Def will have Discs 1 & 2 and Discs 3 & 4 combined,"" so don't expect the special features to be remastered in HD.Also, exclusive to the Blu-Ray is a documentary called ""MGM: When The Lion Roars.""And yeah, a ""Digital Copy"" will either be on one of the DVDs or on a bonus DVD-ROM.And like the 2005 edition, actual print material and other physical items will be with the Collector's Editions: Collectible and numbered 70th Anniversary Wizard of Oz watch with genuine crystals Replica of the original film budget Behind the Curtain, A 52-page, coffee-table book Reproduction of the original 1939 campaign book(This doesn't sound like it's going to contain the print materials from the 2005 DVD set. Those were reproductions of the premiere program, ticket, invitation, the issue of MGM studio news that featured ""The Wizard of Oz,"" a Photoplay Studies Guide about the movie, reproductions of publicity photographs, and postcard-sized card that showed tiny versions of publicity posters.)The release date for the sets is listed as September 29.So, yeah, there's a bit of an upgrade from the 2005 edition, though I suspect casual movie fans might skip the DVD, unless they want ""The Dreamer of Oz"" and the bonus non-DVD goodies. (Me, I'm interested in the new version of ""The Magic Cloak of Oz."") Oz collectors will probably get it and also hang on to the 2005 set. (MANY Oz fans have many copies of the movie on VHS, DVD, and laserdisc.)People who are in to Blu-Ray will be glad that the Blu-Ray didn't skip anything from the old DVDs, though I doubt the one Blu-Ray-exclusive special feature will make people want to jump over to the new format.CREDIT: jadarchives @ imdb"	3.0	BOXSET EXTRAS ANNOUNCED	2009-06-10	92	81	11

We bought this Blu-ray format collector's edition thinking that we would be blown away by the visual clarity of one of the all time best movies ever produced...didn't happen!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2QWEFSPX33C5L	Modrnknght	"This is a very attractive package. After I carefully removed the plastic wrap, I could feel the excitement pouring out of the box as I opened the lid (the inside of which is decorated with a color photo of Dorothy , the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, The Lion, and the Wizard).The first thing you see inside the box is the book, ""The Wizard of Oz: Behind the Curtain of Production 1060."" The book is slender (only 52 pages) but LAVISH in photos. This is truly a nice item to appreciate for the on-set photos, script excerpts, and more.Another item in this box set is a tin case holding the watch, which is actually quite nice looking (but I won't be wearing it any time soon). (I did check and it does work fine.)You will also find a very nice reproduction of the Campaign Book, filled with exploitation ideas and advertising from 1939. (Ah, so many great posters and standees that would be wonderful to own today.)There is also a one-page budget sheet, which strikes me as an odd item to include, and a digital copy disc.(Note: this Oz UCE does not include postcards or photos that are in exclusive packages issued by places like Amazon and Best Buy, but is otherwise the same.)Then there is the heart of the whole thing, the case containing the lovely silver foldout containing the two Blu-ray discs and a double-sided DVD.Now on to the movie itself. If you have been reading the reviews about how amazing, glorious, spectacular, etc. the restoration is...you don't know the half of it until you see it. Warner Bros. has done a MAGNIFICENT restoration of the film. The Blu-ray release is sharply detailed, the colors are so beautiful that it makes every other motion picture look pale by comparison, and you can see jus the right amount of grain in the image to show all the fine details. I can barely tell you what a joy it is to watch this on Blu-ray, as my words fail me. The audio is available in its original mono or a new Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. For the latter, the audio separations come into play mostly with the music only sequences, but it is still a sound treat. There is also a ""Sing Along"" feature available through the menu.And you'll be glad to know that it looks like all of the extras available on the 2005 DVD set have been brought over and they are on both of the 2 Blu-ray discs (but in standard definition).Disc 2 has the new documentary on ""Victor Fleming: Master Craftsman"" and it is an interesting overview of the director's career. Also new to the set is ""Hollywood Celebrates Its Biggest Little Stars!"", a featurette about the unveiling of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for the Munckins. A few of those actors who played the Munchkins attend the ceremony and offer their thoughts on the making of the movie and its afterlife.Another new addition to this set not on the 2005 set is a 1990 TV-movie starring John Ritter as L. Frank Baum. ""The Dreamer of Oz,"" is, if you have read the reviews elsewhere of this set , is quite poor in video quality. It looks like they wanted to add in everything they could that was Oz related for this 70th anniversary, and despite the picture quality it is watchable (with a screenplay by Richard Matheson). It begins and ends at the premiere of The Wizard of Oz at Graumann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood with the stars being cheered on by the fans, but the arrival of Mrs. Baum (played by the lovely Annette O'Toole) is only recognized by one reporter who proceeds to interview her about their life together, leading into the longest flashback before the start of a movie premiere that I can recall.Also on disc 2, they have carried over from the 2005 release silent versions of The Wizard of Oz stories, plus one new addition for this set...""The Patchwork Girl of Oz"" from 1914, a 51-minute movie.The double-side DVD in the set contains the wonderful 6-hour documentary, ""MGM: When the Lion Roars."" This is a must-see.You will find there are a number of versions of the 70th anniversary release in the stores, but not all contain all of the items, so my advice is to get one of the Ultimate Collectors Edition. But whatever you do, get some version where you get to see the movie in glorious high definition on Blu-ray."	5.0	A great package	2012-12-24	0	0	0

If you get scared a little things you would maybe only want to  watch the beggining of the movie. Judy Garland is the best actress ever.  She can sing a lot better then any 1 else these days.

How could we have been so negligent?  We certainly grew up with the movie being a large presence in our life.  Back in the day, our families gathered around the ONE family TV for the once a year viewing of The Wizard of Oz, always a special presentation.  Anyway, we ordered this for our teen to catch up on what she missed.  Verdict:  she doesn't like it.  It's scary.  Oh well.	5.0	We failed.	2014-02-18	0	0	0

I recently purchased my own copy through Amazon.com and have watched it twice. It was even better than what I remembered since it now has improved color, no commercials, the sound is perfect and it has tons of bonus features. So thank you Amazon for making it so simple and inexpensive to grab a little piece of my childhood any time I want.	5.0	Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition	2008-04-29	1	1	0

The detail in this movie is startling and stunning, not to mention the crazy beautiful colors and textures.  When you watch this version you'll wonder how they managed to make this movie back then, its amazing.  The 3D experience is not overdone, it is slight in comparison with going to the IMAX, but adds just enough reality to enhance it, no floating things swirling around here.  The clarity and picture detail is nothing short of breathtaking.  If you really, really, want to see what this movie must have looked like if you were there watching it being filmed, grab this 3D version before its gone.	5.0	OZ...Best Version Yet / 3D, Yikes!!	2014-01-16	2	2	0

Target is selling the two disc blu ray for $34.99, without all the other stuff and Walmart has a one disc version for 19.96 (just disc one of the two disc set [actually even says disc 1, which is kinda funny for a 1 disc package]).  Not available on-line anywhere I can see (I'm sure to confuse us into purchasing the big set advertised here).  Just thought you might want to know.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A185RNNKCBI2HW	MovieMan12	If you look at the special features of any &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; set, you will be presented with the same features: Four documentaries, home movies, the &#34;From the Vault&#34; section, the notorious, &#34;Jitterbug&#34; sequence and other neat inclusions. So when picking up a copy for myself, I expected these goodies. What I got was much different.With the two-disc 70th Anniversary edition from 2009, I got some different special features, ones that have not been featured on any other release, as far as I know. On disc two, there are two totally different docs- one on Oz author Frank L. Baum (not the documentary featured on disc 3 of the 2005 set) and one on director Victor Fleming. Okay, that's odd. Next, there is a TV movie from 1990 starring John Ritter and Annette O'Toole-What? &#34;The Dreamer of Oz,&#34; an obscure, forgotten made-for-television film was, for some reason, included on this one release of &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; How random. Lastly, there is a 2007 Hollywood Walk of Fame Salute to the Munchkins. Hold on, where's the &#34;Jitterbug&#34; sequence? Or the old home movies of Harold Arlen? Why have these long lasting extras that have popped up on every single release of this movie suddenly been replaced for new ones on this one DVD? Not that the new extras aren't neat, but I was hoping for the originals.In my opinion, buy this DVD. Just make sure you also have a copy of the 2005 3-disc set so that you can enjoy all of the other extras as well (including several silent versions of the film and a bunch of physical extras in the box). Either way, these bonuses are great to have as well, but only if you have the other set.	5.0	An Odd Release	2014-06-07	1	1	0

I will comment on this particular packaging of the movie. My initial impression was ""it's gorgeous"". The included book was interesting but not quite detailed enough in my opinion. The rest of the photos and packaging met my expectations. If you do not have W.O.O. on DVD then this will be the top of the collector's editions. If you buy just the Blu Ray of the movie it will fit in well with this DVD collector's edition.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1278WF1ZT2JUX	Mr J	'Wizard of Oz' is truly one of the artistic works that captures the panorama of human experience in a manner that reaches deeply inside the soul. Everything is here:loneliness, wonder, mysticism, faith, oppression,  violence, and redemption--all of it offered in a semaless tapestry of song,  dance,music, color and symbol. The film is a masterwork that stands  completely on its own, far removed from and superior to the wonderful book  upon which it was based. It is exquisite, yet wholly accessible. Simple,  yet deceptively complex. It can enthrall a 60 year old person as easily as  it can a six year old person. This alone is proof of its spectacular  artistry. The modern f/x abominations should be humbled by the glory of  Oz--I still haven't seen a modern film to match the genius with which the  filmakers used the simplest tools of illusion to stun the viewer.  The  film boasts some of the greatest all-cast chemistry ever known in film, or  stage for that matter. Judy Garland is incomparable, and it is humbling to  regard her unbelievable talent at age 17 to the talent of those who pass  for actresses these days. She acts with her entire range here--dance,  pathos, song--and the end result is a haunting, indelible mark upon the  history of film. In short: we simply and utterly BELIEVE that she is  Dorothy and that she really wants to get home.  All of the rest are  magnificent too--Bolger, Haley, Lahr, Burke, Morgan et al--but special  attention must go to the film's villainess. Margaret Hamilton is nothing  short of terrifying in her role as the Wicked Witch of the West. In the  same way that we believe Dorothy to be the image of pure innocence, we  believe that Hamilton's witch is pure, horrifying evil. There have been  many chilling villains in film history, but I still believe that Hamilton's  witch is the most inherently and truly frightening of them all. Without  question, Wizard of Oz is one of the five best films ever made, and  probably will only continue to rise on the list as the millennium rolls  into high gear.I would highly recommend that every child on earth be gifted  with a viewing of this film and thus able to benefit from its timeless  message.	5.0	One of the Great Pearls of Human Achievement	1999-12-31	6	6	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A29Z8M81JA7K64	MT	I had the special three DVD set of The Wizard of Oz but lent it to a friend and let her keep it because it was for her, as for so many folks, a beloved and favorite film.  I decided to treat myself and replace it with the special 5 disc 70th Anniversary set because of the added material.  I actually had no interest in keeping the wrist watch and gave it to my lady friend whom I'd given the three DVD set.  She was delighted to have it. I was much disappointed when I received the set from an Amazon vendor (for a lower price) to find all four corners of the shrink wrapped presentation box broken.  I was further disappointed and annoyed to find that the 5th disc in the set is seperate from the other 4 discs and is a mysterios disc which one must install (or try to install) on their computer in order to access the material from online.  I tried several times to install the mystery material but each time I got to install and it would not install.  What a total rip off.  Granted the 4 disc set is nice and the booklet, watch and presentation box are lovely (if not damaged) but Amazon and the advertising are very, very misleading about the 5th disc.  I was expecting a 5th DVD which I could play on my TV but instead I had to attempt to install and access, whatever additional content, using my computer.  I'm just glad I didn't buy it directly from Amazon and pay the totally ridiculous rip-off $55.99 price.  Don't waste your money on this.  The special three disc set is perfectly fine and much more reasonably priced.	3.0	Not much better than the 3 disc set I had.	2011-03-24	3	2	1

When I was a toddler, I would watch this movie 5 times a day.  I would never get tired of it.  I still like to pop it into the DVD player every once and while.  The story includes a hint of drama, a bit of adventure, and a TON of friendship between the characters.The main character, Dorothy, comes to the land of Oz due to a weather mishap in Kansas.  She meets three good friends along the way that help her get back home.  She meets problems along the way, but gets through them with the help of her friends.THE WIZARD OF OZ is a wonderful pleasure to share with friends.	5.0	A pleasure to share.	2009-12-29	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AD39QGHGWAOPQ	"mwreview ""mwreview"""	"I have been crazy about this film since I first saw it on TV when I was 5, not long before Jack Haley died in 1979.  Twenty-six years later, I still enjoy this film.  I could type on & on gushing about it but, instead, I will explain why this DVD edition is the best value for your dollar.  It is crammed with extras, some are a tease, but most are fascinating clips, stills, and information about the classic.  To the previous reviewer who was so devastated that they colorized the film on this DVD: You must have wonderful memories of that b&w; TV you had as a kid, and that's nice.  Now for what is important--Here is what the ""Follow the Road to OZ"" Special Features Menu has to offer:The ""Characters of OZ"" was a bit of a disappointment.  It does not offer hardly any information about the actors save for their ages at the time.  There is nothing about their previous work.  This section offers mostly controversial stuff like Shirley Temple's and Buddy Ebsen's relation to the film which will be discussed in the ""Making of"" documentary offered on this DVD.  This section does do an excellent job clearing up the legend around Shirley Temple's possible casting as Dorothy.The ""Emerald City"" selection offers tons of stuff.  ""The Making of"" documentary is the one hosted by Angela Lansbury that I have seen on television before.  It is very well-down and informative and is nice to have on DVD.  You also get theatrical trailers including the ""What is OZ?"" 1939 teaser.  ""Outtakes & Deleted Scenes"" include the  extended Scarecrow dance that did not make the film, Judy Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"" in the witch's chamber, ""The Jitterbug"" home movies and soundtrack and, my favorite, the soundtrack with stills featuring Buddy Ebsen singing ""If I Only Had a Heart.""  A still from the deleted second ""Ding Dong..."" number has a photo of Bert Lahr with his right arm out of his lion's suit smoking a cigarette.  ""Behind the Scenes"" offers makeup tests, sketches and storyboards, candid clips from Harold Arlen's home movies, Texas contest winners meeting Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Buddy Ebsen, Loew's Cairo Trailer featuring test makeup & costumes and an alternate ""Over the Rainbow"" clip.  What I like about this disc is the background information that is offered to explain the different stills and clips.  Some are even humorous, i.e. referring to the Scarecrow's early makeup shots as ""Boy George"" style.The ""OZ History"" section is kind of a tease.  It shows very short excerpts from the 1914 & 1925 silents and the 1933 cartoon version of the Wizard of OZ.  It would have been nice to see them in their entirety, but we can't have everything, I guess.  ""OZ Afterlife"" has 1979 interviews with Jack Haley, Ray Bolger, and Margaret Hamilton.  They are organized rather oddly with all three on the screen at once in their separate squares with the one selected the only one that is audible.  1939 Cavalcade of Academy Awards clips are offered here with Mickey Rooney presenting Judy Garland the juvenile award.  The disc also offers audio supplements with the radio show Good News of 1939, radio trailers, and a jukebox as well as more clips and stills from awards presentations.  Oh, and besides all this, you also get the film with this disc.  OZ fans, buy this disc now ""before someone drops a house on you""!"	5.0	It is hiss, it is hiss, it is history!	2005-02-01	8	8	0

I do not yet have a blue-ray DVD player and am long passed the age of video tapes. Now that readers know which format I am reviewing, they also should know I am not reviewing the movie itself. The movie that claims to be the most-watched movie in history can do without a review from me. My fraternal twin sister gave me this set for Christmas 2010. It took me until January 8, 2011 to view it. I began with disc 2 with the bonus material and watched the segment on the director Victor Fleming, a look at the author L. Frank Baum, and a piece on the ""biggest little stars"" who finally got their star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. The next segment was The Dreamer of Oz. I found myself looking at the actress playing his wife Maud thinking she looked and sounded familiar but I could not recall her name nor where I had seen her. It wasn't until after that I realized the actor playing Baum was none other than John Ritter. Oh how I enjoyed his work in movies and his series 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, and reflected on his death. I had not heard of the TV special and was mesmerized by his telling snatches of what would eventually become The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to the local children, especially to his young niece Dorothy Gage. Many think she was the insiration of Dorothy Gale in the movie, but cannot be sure. Then there was Maud's mother also familiar, who was dead set against her daughter marrying an actor. Now, I won't go through the plot, as that would take away from the joy of the surprises involved, but I did search for john ritter as l. frank baum and that led me to sites about the special where I found it was Annette O'Toole who played Maud, the same actress who did so beautifully in The Christmas Box. It was Rue McClanahan of The Golden Girls who played Maud's mother. I was totally caught up in a look into Frank's life, his proposal, his troubles with various ventures, his unsuccessful search for a publisher for his book, and his end, it amazes me that it has not been mentioned to any great extent in the reviews I read through. I wish it were available on its own, but I will have to send this back to my sister so she can experience this treasure I found as much pleasure to watch as The Wizard of Oz itself, even if it was not a musical. I will end my review by encouraging any who buy movies accompanied by bonus material to please take the time to watch them as they will enrich the experience of watching the movie itself, and certainly will let you more fully appreicate its contents."	5.0	The Dreamer of Oz	2011-01-08	1	0	1

Many details concerning the history and legends surrounding this movie are covered in several different ways.  The technical discussions on how this Blu-Ray image was recorded, aligned (there were three separate primary-color-filtered images that allowed extremely fine computer sharpening), and cleaned up are interesting (at least to me).  Some of the issues that came up during this process are fascinating, such as the fact that the software decided the Ruby Slippers were defects on the image to be removed because they only showed up in the red image was funny -- computers can be very stupid at times, which is refreshing!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3DYIGOLWS5CNS	Niel Rishoi	This is arguably one of the most perfect movies of all time, a true representative of American cinema at its best.  There is whimsy, imagination, color, gentle humor, quirky dialogue, suspense, excitement,  heart, soul, and a true, uncalculatingly guileless charm.  There isn't a  single instance of cynicism, camp or obviousness to mar this masterpiece.  The cast could not be bettered: this movie has the most glorious  combination of talents and personalities, all of them skilled, professional  and completely believable.  Judy Garland is a heroine of one's dreams,  unsacharine, blessed with a singular inner affirmative quality, as well as  being sweet and genuine. She is devastating during moments of true  heartbreak, as when Toto is being snatched away by Miss Gulch, and  especially her last moments in Oz, when bidding her tearful farewell to her  Oz-mates. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow has just the right nervously rubbery-leggy  quality; he never again found an equal role that suited his  persona so  well; Jack Haley's earnest sweetness has never been better utilized, and  Bert Lahr's overbearing manner for once has found its match in the role of  the Lion: he's often killingly funny. Billie Burke gives Glinda a  wonderfully  giddy aspect,one that keeps a potentially static character  from seeming too noble or smarmy.  Frank Morgan has a breezy, slightly  oafish charm, endearingly gentle and kind.  Perhaps the crowning portrayal  in this entire cast is Margaret Hamilton's sublimely malevolent Wicked  Witch. There never was, and perhaps there never will be, such a vivid  characterization, one that has left its mark on generations of moviegoers:  whenever one thinks of a &quot;Wicked Witch&quot; it invariably means  Margaret Hamilton's in The Wizard of Oz. Her wickedness is so organic, so  unapologetically gleeful that she gives the picture an almost unbearable  edge of tension: when the Witch is melted, we truly miss her.  Certainly  that electrifying cackle is never to be forgotten.  A final hand of  applause to the director, Victor Fleming, the producer Mervyn LeRoy, and  all the combined talents that made this picture what it is. Whether one has  seen it 10 times or 100, it remains the epitome of American cinematic  ingenuity.	5.0	Flawless perfection.	1999-07-11	4	3	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	By now, the tale of Dorothy (Judy Garland), the Kansas waif swept from her home to the mythical land over the rainbow by a cyclone in Frank L. Baum?s immortal children?s classic, ?The Wizard of Oz? has become more than a literary or cinematic classic. It is folklore. When MGM acquired the rights they sought out Shirley Temple as their Dorothy. Fortunately, Fox Studios refused to loan their biggest little child star out to anyone, leaving L.B. Mayer no choice but to cast teenager, Judy Garland instead. The choice in casting was, of course, fortuitous. Upon its premiere, lines began forming at five in the morning for advanced tickets. The film galvanized Garland?s reputation and gave her one of the great signature songs in film history (Over the Rainbow). Time has been powerless to erode the book or the film?s poignant simplicity.THE TRANSFER: Warner Home Video has outdone themselves on their Special Edition of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The disc features a newly mastered Technicolor print that positively glows. On rare occasions a bit of digital tiling is detected as well as pixelization. There is no edge enhancement. A new 5.1 digital soundtrack sounds decades younger than the original source material ? but for the purist, the original mono tracks are also included.EXTRAS: There is enough on this disc to fill two special editions, including trailers, interviews, test footage, deleted scenes, outtakes and the feature length documentary ? ?The Wonderful Wizard of Oz? hosted by Angela Lansbury. Unfortunately, Warner has compressed all of their features onto one side of one disc. The result is a lot of compression related artifacts and problems, including tiling, slight aliasing and a harsh digital look to the documentary in particular and some of the other extra features as well. I'm surprised that the feature film doesn't suffer more heavily from the reduced bit rate.BOTTOM LINE: Warner will eventually revisit Oz with another transfer and probably a 2-disc set. They will also probably do the same with &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, another early transfer that doesn't quite hold up under close scrutiny.	4.0	A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THIS AMERICAN MUSICAL CLASSIC!	2003-03-11	6	4	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A31QEAZMJWBF28	NMdesapio	"MGM's 1939 classic THE WIZARD OF OZ is pure enchantment for children, but there is plenty in the movie for adults to enjoy, too.  The story, based on books by L. Frank Baum, is an archetypal journey to self-discovery for young Dorothy and her three friends.  The score, by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, is beautiful (""Over the Rainbow""), catchy (""If I Only Had a Brain""), and witty (""Ding, Dong! The Witch Is Dead"" and ""If I Were King of the Forest"").  Teenage Judy Garland is a plangent-voiced singer and a vital actress, bringing depth to her role.  The individual vaudevillian talents of Ray Bolger (the eccentric dancer), Jack Haley (the straight man), and Bert Lahr (the burlesque comedian) are ideally suited to the parts of the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, while the supporting actors (especially Margaret Hamilton as Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch of the West, Billie Burke as the Good Witch Glinda, and the delightfully muddled Frank Morgan as the Wizard himself) are just as perfect.  And then there is MGM's inspired use of color in the Oz scenes, which contrasts beautifully with the drab black-and-white of the scenes at the Kansas farmhouse, where Dorothy faces sorrows that make her long to ""fly over the rainbow.""  THE WIZARD OF OZ is a must-have for children, as well as for adults, who will surely appreciate its artistry and be enchanted all over again."	5.0	Pure Enchantment	2004-08-16	0	0	0

Since Amazon mixes these together this review is solely for the 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition(Blu-Ray) with Digital Copy and Amazon Exclusive Set of 4 Collectible 8x10 Character Posters.The Blu-Ray & ExtrasYou truely have to commend the digital artists who haver spent years remastering this classic one of a kind movie.  However, while the colors are very vivid and pop off the screen on the blu-ray I'm not entirey sure it is blu-ray worthy.  You can clearly tell that there is a level of definition that is completely missing from a film this old, the details never existed in the original recording.  If you are on the fence between blu-ray and DVD and want to save yourself $10 you can certainly go with the DVD version and you probably wouldn't be missing anything. Beyond the blu-ray the extras in this edition are very comprehensive and outstanding, though I found the menu system they put in a little bit difficult to navigate.The 8x10 Pictures were my biggest disappointment, I was looking for reasonably displayable pictures that could even be framed and put up on a wall.  Unfortunately they ruined perfectly good pictures by superimposing their popular phrases over the pictures, ""IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN"" or ""THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME"" is plastered right accross the middle of each picture in a terrible looking font.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3JXR831XZILGJ	OC Phil	If you haven't seen this film by now, you have to get out more.I won't go into the plot. I will say the transfer is sparklingly good. You can spot the make up lines on the wicked witch, the rivets on the tin man's forehead, and even the freckles on Judy Garland's face. You can also see various other imperfections, such as the witch disappearing beneath her trapdoor into the MGM soundstage.The sound I did not notice that much of an improvement, because after all this is fabulous 1939 technology and you can only do so much with it.The extras are definitely worth the extra money for fans. You get to see how they made the tornado ( and how you you think they did it without computers back then?), plus various behind the scenes gems plus a previously broadcast special with Angela Lansbury. Wonder why she is the host? Well, guess who costarred with Judy Garland in a film called the Harvey Girls in her debut? And you  also get a brand new documentary on the legacy of Oz.The real gems are the audio tracks. You get to hear the 1939 radio premiere of Oz, including the first ever time Judy sings Over the Rainbow in public ( she makes a mistake in the lyrics!) as well as the only time she plays the role of Dorothy again, in a 1950 radio broadcast, when she was 28. In the audio section you also get a glimpse of something even rarer..a scene cut from the final movie. When Dorothy is trapped in the witch's castle, she cries and sings Over the Rainbow one more time. This is the audio of the cut scene, deleted because too many people were crying in the previews. Hard to believe this was acting, and sort of glimpse into the talent of Judy Garland.Anyway, you should buy this, what can you lose, a used DVD is the price of two cappucinnos and a muffin.	5.0	Wizard of Oz-Two thumbs up!	2007-01-11	2	2	0

All the extras can again add to the film or not, I generally prefer them, on the greats, Casablanca, the African Queen and so on. Now what makes a great film is again down to you.I got the collectors set for not much more than the price of the standard set so it was a no brainer for me. One thing that could have been so much better was the watch which showed a complete lack of imagination, cheap looking, it should have been designed to look contemporarywith the film, slightly aged and with a gold ( not real of course) case it would have been wearable. I thought I saw a customer photo somewhere of the watch looking like it had a gold case, must have dreamt it.

In my opinion, they're both good, but the one on this page (The Wizard of Oz: The Original, Classic Full Length Presentation by KorC studio) is a better product all around, from  picture and sound, to case and cover.In fact, ""better""  means perfect in this case. From the moment the DVD is inserted in the player, the clear, lovely music fills the room-Sky Cinema's does not have music in the initial menu.The superiority of the picture clarity in this KorC edition is evident in the scene with all the glass flowers, that Judy Garland faces coming out of her room's door.There is one unusual thing that put me off the Sky Cinema's edition: the black plastic case has a strong and quite unpleasant ""plastic"" smell, that persists even though it's been out of its plastic wrap for many days. CineKorea's (KorC) case is clean, strong, white plastic, with no smell whatsoever.All in all, I'm grateful KorC studio did such a loving job with remastering this gem of a movie.I imagine the many people who are surprised at the Korean words added onto the cover, probably are not aware that S.Korea is the world's capital of re-mastering and bringing back to life old movies!"	5.0	This version by KorC is better than Sky Cinema's, and here is why:	2009-03-17	2	1	1

Some of the bonus materials overlap with that release, but here there are many, many more, the best of which is the documentary hosted by Lansbury. It does give a solid overview of the history of the making of the movie, which is quite fascinating and improved my understanding of the studio system of the day. Also, it shows some brief snippets of the movie, as dubbed for other countries (think the Wicked Witch is terrifying?  Try hearing her snap out her lines in German!)The only thing lacking from this release is a commentary track. The makers could have gotten Roger Ebert or a panel of people who've been inspired by the film to give a really interesting audio supplement.Anyway, it's a classic, and the studio did a great job with this dvd. You will want to replace your vhs tapes with dvds for the classics, eventually, the same as you did for your audio cassettes when cd players became popular, so why fight the inevitable?	5.0	Worth buying even if you have it on tape	2002-05-17	6	4	2

I talk & sing along with it, for which I've been reprimanded. I've been performing the witch's death scene since I was 18 (I'm 64). I had all my nails done in prep for the viewing - toes in emerald green, left hand nails in Ruby red with a touch of silvery sparkles, and right hand nails done up like the Yellow Brick Road (I have an awesome nail tech). I found a shirt with the witch's death scene fully written out with a picture of her hat & cape after being melted. I'm prepared for the re-re-re-release of this movie. I've been waiting for a 3D version since 3Ds became popular. I bought my first 3D TV almost 2 years ago in hopes of finally seeing it in 3D at home. Of course I do watch it in 3D now, but there's a noticeable difference (most of the time) between 2D-to-3D conversion and an actual 3D Blu-ray.Anyone who has ever seen this before will love it. It will immerse you! My anticipation is, and has been, getting the best of me. I can't wait!	5.0	And Now In 3D!	2013-09-22	6	5	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AY9U0IJ4YIERN	Pachico	They spent all that time making it 3D. The screen format ruins the whole thing. The 3D doesn't seem that great to much of the screen is cut off. With all this new technology seems they would have made it full screen 16.9 to fit the screen size. When 10 inches is cut off each side to small.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1QRCLZTKHCLE	Paris Capulet	First off, I don't believe a word of it. I think its all made up. Farm girl sings song about rainbows, then winds up in some foreign land. She meets new friends, and together they go to some place called &quot;Emerald City&quot; (sure). There their wishes are granted. Soon she's back in Kansas (or is it Arkansas?). Everything is normal again.Probably the greatest American film ever made. It has everything. Baum's plot IS what dreams are made of. The 1939 special effects are delightful and seemingly current. The songs are wonderful, the dancers are great, and that little dog is pretty cool too! There are so many nice touches to this film, it would be impossible to enumerate them.As a child, I looked forward to the CBS presentation of Wizard of Oz. It was broadcasted but once a year, and was a family event. For us boomers, we all remember it as one of the few things that bond us closely with our parents. Sort of a miracle.The DVD offering gives us a glimpse into the casting problems, the production, etc. And that's coo. But the film itself is the real star. Follow the yellow brick road...and ll will be fine.paris c.	5.0	DREAMY	2001-06-05	9	7	2

A mean old lady complains of Toto's recent activities and steals him away. Meanwhile, a dandy of a tornado whips up and many of the principals are drawn into the huge twister.When Dorothy wakes up, she finds herself in The Land of Oz where there are Munchkins, good and bad witches, and many other STRANGE characters. Dorothy meets new friends including, the lion, the scarecrow, and the tin man, all of whom need desperately to see The Wizard, just as Dorothy does in order to get home to Kansas, to deal with their individual difficulties.They follow the Yellow Brick Road to see The Wizard but the Wicked Witch has other ideas for Dorothy and her spore.The movie begins in black and white but pops to magnificent color as Dorothy shows up in The Land of Oz, a shrewd film technique.This is simply great family entertainment, as brilliant today as it was when it was first released.	5.0	Old, yes, but still superb family entertainment!	2007-10-18	1	1	0

TV Special - The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic11. 8 trailers for the filmAnd so much more!Also, don't buy the 2-Disc version. It only has half the stuff I mentioned above, and besides, the collector's set has everything you could ever ask for about Oz. Besides a great film transfer, you get many cool extras, like reproductions from the original 1939 release, including the invitation and ticket to Grauman's Chinese theater. Small program books and other booklets are included also. The discs themselves are great, the ruby slippers have never sparkled like they do in this release!Awards:Believe it or not, this 3-Disc collector's edition set was actually nominated for 4 satellite awards, winning one:1.

It is jam packed with special features that offer lots of trivia about the making of the film.

They eventually  gave up after lots of unsucessfull attempts and many experts believe that  at least the first 1+ hour of this music or more are in perfect sinc with  this movie. ...

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A37B3O457INKEA	Peter Kenney	Much of the greatness of THE WIZARD OF OZ is due to its simplicity. It has a simple plot with a powerful message delivered by a superb cast led by a young, unspoiled Judy Garland. Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton represent some of the very best talent available in Hollywood before World War II. There are also two unforgettable songs in &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; and &quot;We're Off To See The Wizard.&quot;THE WIZARD OF OZ won Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Song (&quot;over The Rainbow&quot;). It was also nominated for Best Picture, Art Direction and Special Effects. The main competition for Oscars in 1939 came from GONE WITH THE WIND and GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS.Director Victor Fleming had a good year in 1939. He directed both GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ.	5.0	Simple But Powerful	2003-07-06	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2TYAL88IXRSEV	Peter Prainito	"FIRST (directed to the Educated): ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a timeless classic that belongs in everyone's DVD collection. In October 2005 there will be both a 2 and 3 DVD Special Edition, boasting enhanced video and audio, along with many extras. I hope the new edition will also correct some of the technical flaws contained in the bonus features of the currently available DVD; the Margaret Hamilton interview, for example, had a glitch. It would be pointless for me to add another review of this film gem that everyone on the planet knows so well. Still want to read a review? There are over 390 to choose from. Read on.SECOND (directed to the Uneducated): For the last time, Widescreen (CinemaScope) and Stereophonic Sound were technologies unavailable, thus not used, in films until the early 1950's. In 1953 ""The Robe"" became the first CinemaScope (Widescreen) film made. It also contained Stereophonic Sound, although I am not certain if it was the first film that was produced in Stereophonic Sound. But this I can tell you, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (released in 1939) and all other films that were produced prior to 1953 were NOT filmed in Widescreen or Stereophonic Sound. Okay? Got that? Hopefully, this information will put to rest the endless remarks criticizing the DVD producers for not releasing ""The Wizard of Oz"" and other pre-1953 films in Widescreen and/or Stereophonic Sound, formats that were non-existent at the time that these films were made. To really blow your minds: After 1953 there were certain films that were made in Widescreen but not in color, and other films that were made in color but not in Widescreen. Do some research folks, because we are all sick and tired of the subject. Case in point: You can expect ""Beauty and the Beast"" to be available in Widescreen and Stereophonic Sound, but don't expect the same of ""Pinocchio"". Happy viewing, and enjoy the new edition of ""The Wizard of Oz"" coming in October 2005."	5.0	Uneducated of the World, Listen Up....	2005-08-21	16	13	3

The movie is a magical ride from the twister that lifts Dorothy and Toto from Kansas into Munchkinland to her journey to Oz along the Yellow Brick Road to get back home.  The movie is  a visual marvel.  The grainy black and white that marks the dust bowl era Kansas scenes to the shift to the brilliant Technicolor of Oz set a sharp contrast that is brilliant concept.  The songs, especially the unforgettable ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", have become standards and the film has become a part of the American lexicon.

Further reading of the box description states the movie is in &#34;1080p High Definition 16x9 1.37:1&#34;; a paradox.  The &#34;widescreen&#34; statement is opposite the 1.37:1 statement.  The Warner and Oz start splash screens are 16x9 widescreen, but the entire movie is in 4:3.  I thought that I might have chosen a wrong setting.  However, no screen format options exist in the movie's menu.  The image quality is grainy, being worse in the B&W; part of the movie and getting a bit better in the color part.The box states audio is &#34;DTS HD MA, English 5.1, Dolby Digital&#34; which is also a lie.  The audio is terrible and barely qualifies for simulated stereo.  That pales in comparison to my recently purchased &#34;Billy Joel at Shea Stadium&#34; disc which is fantastic in 16x9 widescreen and HD audio (not a hardware problem with my home theater system!).I'm very surprised at all the high ratings for this disc.  Apparently, most reviewers are just so in love with Oz that the false claims of widescreen picture and HD sound just don't matter.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2TVCW4WSFD8Z2	"Prof E. Loftus ""Lizzy"""	The central premise of this movie is that Dorothy falls victim to some sort of trauma, be it a tornado sweeping across the prairie and damaging her house or something more sinister, this is left uncertain as is often the case in real life, most unfortunately.In any case the victim (Dorothy) then regresses in the form of classic ptsd with psychotic episodes...to the land of Oz. There she assembles her false memories with metaphores for swarms of bombers filling the skies, good and bad witches (possibly representing a schizoid mother figure), and 3 male entities who each must overcome their inate stupidity, anxiety and lack of emotion. These concepts probably originated with comments made by the mother and therefore appear impossible for the real person they refer to to overcome...probably an ineffective and emotionally devoid father. The intense hope that Dorothy has for this coupled with the rational impossibility for the figures to overcome the defects is due to her anguish in competing with her mother and the fact that her father is unable to save her from the mothers' tantrums.The FMS relates to the desire for the 3 components of the father figure to be erased and become complete in their respective sense. The hope has distorted her thinking and there is absolutely no evidence to procede with the prosecution of this line of storytelling.However, in the end her mother does believe her and she returns safe and sound to Kansas. So ther is indeed hope. Therefore I gave the film a 1.	1.0	False Memory Syndrome and Toto, reviewing the Wizard of Oz	2004-10-20	119	5	114

This year, The Wizard of Oz is 70 years old, and it's still going strong! In case you have no idea what it's about, I'll give a brief synopsis; Dorothy Gale lives with her aunt and uncle. She has a pet named Toto. When Miss Gulch takes Toto away, Toto escapes and runs back to Dorothy. Soon, she runs away from home, and runs into Professor Marvel. He's a fake psychic that tells her that her Auntie Em is sick, so Dorothy and Toto run back home, then a storm comes and takes Dorothy and Toto to Oz, a place over the rainbow. She lands in Munchkinland, and the house accidentally lands on Wicked Witch of the West's sister, which pisses her off and Dorothy magically have the ruby slippers on her feet. Glinda, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy to see the Wizard so she can get back home. On her way, she befriends Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion, who also seek help from the Wizard. Will Dorothy get back home and stop the Wicked Witch of the West? I highly recommend THE WIZARD OF OZ!!!	5.0	One of the Greatest Movies EVER Made!!!	2009-06-11	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A23VBURIWZPRR2	purplehaloz	"The Wizard of Oz is probably the most underrated work of art in film history. The visual aspect aside, the screenplay adaptation and script are fresh even for today's discerning audience with its tongue-in-cheek, (oft-times cheeky, even bordering on saucy at times!) dialogue, its witty humor and warmth of its characters, this film carries itself like a true wizard of entertainment. ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain,"" indeed.This film, like most works of entertainment art, works on the principle of ""the willing suspension of disbelief,"" and carries off this task perfectly. A fairy tale that works for generations to come, The Wizard of Oz also promotes the positive values of family, love, friendship and fun. The casting and acting are brilliant, the characters are positive, warm and endearing. The colorful splash of color is the longed-for surprise that welcomes Dorothy and is the same sense of wonder that welcomed audiences who witnessed in ""Oz"" as the first color in movies, a dramatic change that delights young audiences to this day when Dorothy first opens the door.The musical numbers are delightful and largely unsurpassed in quality to this very day as far as musicals are concerned. The song and dance routines have the feeling of spontaneity, warmth and fun. There is nothing that looks contrived or out-of-place, and the numbers move the story along at a pleasant clip. The characters (Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley) develop and grow during the course of the story and their rewards are richly deserved.  The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful and amazing film, and ought to be viewed and enjoyed to eternity."	5.0	Pure Wizardry	2005-07-17	2	2	0

If you have a DVD, you'll be delighted with the clarity of the picture, and the added goodies that come with it.But even if you're an old-fashioned VHS player, like we are, you will find this movie, filmed originally in the 30's, is as good today as it was in the beginning!We've watched this movie as a Thanksgiving introduction for years, and as soon as we had the technology, we bought it for our library.  It doesn't seem to grow old, and my kids (ages young to all grown up) still watch it, their understanding growing along with the movie.At first just an entertaining adventure (the rescue of poor Toto from that nasty Miss Almira Gulch), with good witches, bad witches, talking trees, lions and tigers and bears (not to mention tornados), as the movie is viewed again and again, a deeper message begins to sink in.If only we had the courage, the brains, the heart -- why, think of the things we could do!  The great and powerful wizard is the only one who can give those to us -- I've seen the young ones move from believing that, to realizing (on many levels) that the power to have all those wonderful traits comes from within.It took several years before little ones (at ages 3 to 7, they were too terrified to watch the horrid flying monkeys scene)  realized that many of the characters from Dorothy's farm were also in the Land of Oz -- and what a thrill for them when they 'got it.'The music is (of course) outstanding, with Judy Garland's &quot;Over the Rainbow.&quot;  The adventure is one viewers love to return to, again and again.The movie is so good, it spoiled the books for us.  We've never been able to accept anything but ruby slippers, and the book is just too boring in comparison!Definitely belongs on the shelves, for those family movie nights!	5.0	A movie for the family bookshelf!!	2000-11-13	4	4	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	Everybody has a favorite movie and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is mine (and I'm sure I'm not alone in that sentiment).  This is a timeless masterpiece as witness its' continuing popularity with successive generations.  Younger fans might not be aware of this but the movie used to be shown exclusively once a year on TV and countless households made a family event of watching it together. It has everything; good acting, great cinematography, fantastic music, creative innovations, great props and scenery, and a terrific storyline.  Some dismiss this as a children's movie but it appeals to all ages because of its' timeless message.I mentioned that the acting is good.  I didn't feel comfortable with a stronger superlative but it's hard to fault any of the characters.  Certainly Bert Lahr, as the Cowardly Lion, steals many a scene with his fantastic performance.  Margaret Hamilton is a fantastic Wicked Witch of the West.  The others play their roles as they were meant to be played.  Let's face it, the title role was not meant for the likes of Spencer Tracy or Marlon Brando.  Although I can somewhat envision it, the Scarecrow was not a role for the likes of Jimmie Stewart.  The casting was, perhaps, better than the acting itself.  The only real debate is whether Judy Garland or Shirley Temple would be the better Dorothy Gale.  A case could be made for Miss Temple but then &quot;Somewhere over the Rainbow&quot; would be synonymous with &quot;On the Good Ship Loli-Pop&quot; and &quot;Animal Crackers in My Soup&quot;.  I prefer the way Miss Garland belted it out.The cinematography was certainly innovative.  I can only recall one other movie in which the contrast of black and white was used to any effect (&quot;Schindler's List&quot; with the young girl in the red coat).  I may be forgetting an obvious example but it seems that movies were either black and white or color and never a mix.  The scenery and the props are a part of cinematic history.  We all know about the ruby slippers and the yellow brick road.  The music is beautiful from the opening credits to the closing ones.  &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Ding Dong the Witch is Dead&quot; are know to all.  Personally, I love the Munchkin's welcoming song to Dorothy as much as any of the music.  And speaking of the munchkins, they are just another of the many creative touches in this movie.  It was no small feat to amass so many adult dwarfs and midgets.However, it is the story that makes the movie such a timeless masterpiece.  This is a story about persons in search of what they don't have only to discover that they had it all along but didn't realize it.  The Scarecrow thought that, because there were things that he didn't know, he must not have a brain.  He learns that knowledge is a journey rather than an end.  The Tin Man thinks that his loneliness is because he doesn't have a heart.  He discovers that love exists in our relationships and loneliness exists in being alone.  The Cowardly Lion confuses fear with cowardice only to discover that courage is action despite fear, not instead of it.  Dorothy felt the need to wander off to find a better place.  She soon discovers that there's no place like home.  How many of us spent years trying to find ourselves before we, too, discovered the same message.  These are all important lessons in life and we all share the joy of Dorothy as she wakes up in her own bed happy to be home at last.  The fact that this makes us wish, secretly, that were children again does not make this a &quot;children's movie&quot;.  Watch it with the whole family (and a box of Kleenex).	5.0	There's No Place Like Home	2002-12-01	14	11	3

The wonderful world of oz is something alot of us remember as a child.I can still remember when we would get excited about The Wizard of Oz, being a upcoming event on television. The Wizard of Oz was first part of American Literature,written by Lyman Frank Baum. The fairytale was altered on the big screen nearly forty years later by Metro Goldwyn Meyer for a release in 1939,starring Judy Garland as Dorothy. Dorothy had been hit on the head during a tornado in Kansas where she lived,which sent her in to the wonderful world of Oz. There she meet Ray Bolger the Scarecrow,Jack Haley as the Tin man, and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. During her journey down the yellow brick road. She encountered each one of these characters, who joined her to find courage,a heart,a brain and most of all Dorothy's way home to Kansas. Their adventure mean't finding The Wizard of OZ who could make their dreams come true. As their journey went on they had many encounters with the wicked witch who was trying to stop them from reaching their destiney.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ABBBP0HLLXJZ9	"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom"""	We just received this as a gift, and with Christmas coming up, I wanted to add my thoughts to the hundreds of other reviewers who have written about this movie and this specific set...if you have an Oz fan in the house, then there is, simply enough, no other edition of this film to put under the tree this year. Firstly, before we even get into the movie, the product itself is like opening a treasure chest of goodies: A luxurious oblong green emerald  - shade container that top-flips up is the first thing you'll see, with Dorothy and the gang on the front. Then, once you open the box, you're rewarded with a reproduction promotional campaign book; it truly is fascinating to peruse this offering to see the dozens of 1939 ads reprinted in glorious black and white touting that the film is from a book that 80 million people have read!, and that will be seen on over 900 screens! Imagine, now something Youtubes millions of times in one week's time, but 70 years ago, Oz was considered to be saturating the market with pre-publicity glitz and chatter. Separate from the pub book is a reprint of the original budget sheet for the film; to see that MGM put this entire movie together for less than a week's budget on one of today's crank-'em-out-and-forget-'em offerings is another astonishing fact. Next - nope, not done with the goodies, yet - is a limited editon collector's watch with the again, Dorothy and the gang on its' face, and it is absolutely adorable, sturdy, well made, and bearing a back engraving noting it to be an official release. The watch is inside its' own little tin, which is also adorned with Oz illustrations. Lastly, a book with biographies of each of the major players is included, and it, too, is well made, sturdy, and impressive in its' own right. Okay...still with me? The movie, and its' extras: The movie comes in both DVD and digital form; I have not watched the digital one, yet, but the DVDs are nice and crisp, and very, very good to excellent transfers. I'm sure BluRay is even better; my friend knows that either is fine for us, and so we do have the DVD set. The extras are endless, thus the multiple discs - documentaries on the film itself, Victor Fleming, L. Frank Baum, even odds and ends such as looks at the Munchkins, and their obvious importance to the magic of the movie.There are deleted scenes, costume testing stills...on and on. Also included are the original takes on Oz from 1914 (3 films) and 1925 (1 offering); These are a bit trying to get through because of print quality, etc., but interesting, nonetheless. I enjoyed seeing all three of Judy Garland's kids interviewed for one of the documentaries, by the way, as her son Joe very seldom seems to take part in matters having to do with Oz or his mother. Finally...what does one say about a movie that is actually almost a language of its' own, now? We all know it, and it is one of those few films which stands for something to just about every individual who has watched it. I have memories of making a complete ritual out of having to be in front of the tv once a year to watch this film, and my siblings gathered, too, as we watched it together, and had little or no comprehension that people grow up, and move away and movies become less important. Well, most movies become less important. For parents who are wondering about the cost of this set in a day and time when you can get cheaper sets, maybe burn your own copies, whatever...this is the way to go, if you can swing it. Put this in a child's hands, let them open that treasure-chest shaped box, and watch his or her face light up. I know it's probably being a little too poetic, but I really mean it about this wonderful, wonderful offering - my friend didn't give us a simple present with this. He gave us a very, very special gift.	5.0	It's So Much More Than The Movie, In More Ways Than One	2010-11-01	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1BLKTGJ67WQO6	Ricardo Socio	Everyone knows the movie, so all I am going to say about it is that the transfer is splendid.The digital alignment process created by Warner to ensure that the three Technicolor strips were perfectly aligned results in a sharpness never seen before. Probably not even when the film was first released. Color is vibrant and sound is as good as it could be.As for the gift set, it is a collector's must have, just like the similar edition of Gone With the Wind.Here we have a beautiful box with lots of collectible items.The discs come in a beautiful digipack, with a silver finishing and a slipcover with embossed details.A hardcover book and a reprint of the original press book also come along. Among other things the edition brings a real watch in a tin case, both decorated with images related to the film.This edition is a fine example of what gift sets should all be like.Go for it.	5.0	Magnificent edition	2011-10-19	2	2	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3N0JYM2X5KUQB	Riccardo	"While the visual quality is superb, the great achievement of this (2005) restoration is the audio track.  As the ""making of the restoration"" feature points out, the original music track was recorded from 4 microphones, making it possible to restore the music to a true Dolby 5.1 track.  There are sound effects I had never heard before, such as the leaves being stripped from the trees during the ""twister"", and the bass accompaniment to the singing opens up the dynamic range of the music.As for the visuals, we encounter that bane of digital formats--too much perfection.  The opening scenes in sepia tone Kansas are so perfectly restored that small amounts of projector ""flicker"" from print imperfections appear in some backgrounds that were not apparent in the first dvd restoration.  Make no mistake about it, though, the sharpness and accurate color are a feast for the eyes.If you're wondering whether to go with the 2- or 3-disc version, you'll want to know that the third disc contains the 5 silent ""oz"" movies made before WWI.  They are not necessarily fun to sit through, but instructive to see how much of the costuming concept for the main characters seems to have been inspired by that very first effort.  If you're not a film student, the 2-disc set will give you all the bang for your buck."	5.0	Audio track is the great achievement of the 2005 restoration	2005-12-12	30	28	2

The movie was great and much better than my memory of it on TV back in the 60's and 70's.  The color and sound are better and the equipment we view it on today is better as well.  I had never seen it in a movie theater before this year-I was born in 1946-so that experince for me was almost as meaningful as it was for my 3 year old grand daughter.  The quality of the DVDs is very good and the price was right- $17 +/- each set.  I have already gotten more than $17 worth of enjoyment out of seeing my granddaughter's reaction when I presented her with her ""very own copy"" of the Wizard of OZ."	5.0	Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Special Edition (DVD)	2009-11-03	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2OLM3EXS7JHZ8	"Richard Posner ""wordspinner"""	"My most cherished memory regarding The Wizard of Oz is having lunch with the Wicked Witch of the West. It was, I think, 1968, and I went to the Shakespeare Festival in Stratord Connecticut. Margaret Hamilton was appearing in a play by Shaw, and I was friends with one of the bit players. He asked if I wanted to have lunch with some people and one of those people was Margaret Hamilton. I remember her as a sweet and intelligent woman.Anyway, I saw The Wizard of Oz about three or four times on black and white TV sets during the late 1950's before I ever saw it in color. So I fell in love with the movie even when Dorothy's world changed from black and white to black and white! Not with this new 3-DVD set. Oz drenches you in saturated Technicolor (and annoying sepia for the monotone sequences). You can even tell that it's a weird bird in the forest background, not a munchkin hanging himself (and old urban legend)!If you love the movie, you'll love this restored version, and the documentaries that come with it. The main naking-of doc suffers from the treacly narration of Angela Lansbury, but there are some new docs about how they restored the color and sound, and those are very interesting. For Oz fanatics, there's a third disk of bizarre silent movie versions.As they used to say in publicity materials for movies, I laughed, I cried, I fell in love all over again. The economy and simplicity and wit of the movie shows just how bloated and pretentious the Broadway show ""Wicked"" is (and Stephen Schwartz wishes he could write songs like Harburg and Arlen). So buy it, and wait for Dorothy to open that magical door into Oz (even though you learn from this set that it was a Judy Garland stand-in wearing a sepia dress!)"	4.0	The Wizard Flies Again	2006-03-25	10	8	2

They didn't enhance it with computer work they just properly restored it by matching up the original elements to perfection..and explain  how they did it on disc one...and it is  STUNNING!The bonus features are plentiful and seem to be done with the same level of love and attention the original filmakers put into the feature. The current features with interviews with contemporary film artists is particularly fascinating as is the Legacy feature on the various people whose lives have been forever changed by the movie.....and the feature on Baum is another winner.  The three disc set also contains some  delightful facsimile programs from  the movies original world premier etc..and some gorgeous color photos....a true collectable package!The WB Gone with the Wind set was the standard by which these studios treatment of classic films should be judged and WB has topped itself with this sensational set!!!  Kudos again to  Warner Brothers for continueing to lead the way on  classic re-issues with insightful and entertaining bonus features...I noticed the company SPARK HILL..on the credits and have been seeing  that name on some of the better bonus features...not sure if its a division of WB but if not KUDOS to them as wellfrom the fresh print to  the fresh extras... this set , like  the movie,  is a treasure!	5.0	#1 Movie of all time....#1 DVD set ever produced!	2005-10-26	5	5	0

I was so impressed that i invited everyone i knew to come see this film.  Most of my friends thought i was &quot;nuts&quot;, but after seeing this they were just as impressed.Everything that can be said about this movie has been said countless number of times already but if you want to see brilliant color restoration, take a look at this restored version. This is the best!  I don't know if the sound was rechanneled for 5.1 or if this film was originally filmed in 4 track magnetic, either way the sound is also very impressive for what these people had to work with.  This is well worth every penny plus the extras on this DVD are more than great.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A19HDQR569CG8A	R. Kevin Hill	The restoration and remastering here is unlike anything ever before attempted, because instead of digitizing a print, they digitized each separate monochrome negative of the three-color-process negatives, and then merged them digitally. The result is not just greater clarity than has ever been seen on TV before, but probably greater clarity than has ever been seen before in a movie theater. Even if you do not adore the film (and I do) this is a simply astonishing technical achievement. If you don't adore the film, read Salman Rushdie's writing on it and have a rethink.	5.0	Amazing clarity	2014-02-08	3	3	0

Okay, all those gazillion times I saw the show every single year, I literally did know just when I could schedule a bathroom break.This DVD is a whole new Oz. They've up-scaled the picture, richened the color, and even the initial B&W; portion in Kansas has so much more texture, you'll feel like you're seeing Oz for the first time. The men (and women) behind the curtain restoring this film did an amazing job.Let me add, at the risk of sounding like an Infomercial--But wait, there's more!""The Making of the Wizard of Oz"" which is included with Angela Lansbury narrating. It's a fascinating peek into a generational favorite film.Plus you get posters, cast interviews and a lot of little extras that make the price special Amazon's running right now one of the best deals around.Rebecca Kyle, November 2011"	5.0	Do look at the man behind the curtain	2011-11-30	1	1	0

I was engrossed in looking at the details of everything I saw. i.e. the patterns on Dorothy's dress, The costumes of all the caricatures, the details in all of the sets. It was like seeing the movie as it was originally meant to be seen at the theatre. They have a 3d version of this movie as well.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3I72LRTFV2SSN	Robert Ashton	"I was in two minds about getting this classic movie adapted to 3D.  Tinkering with old masterpieces usually results in an inferior product.  However, I'm pleased to report that the 3D version is a delight.  It brings out features I'd never noticed before but most importantly enhances the experience of the movie without being intrusive in the way that a lot of 3D can be.It does, of course, start with an excellent version of the original film.  Although I've so far only watched parts of the included 2D version, the quality of the image in the two versions is stunning, both the sepia Kansa and the Technicolor Oz.  The quality of the image does make it more obvious, particularly in Oz,  when it is a matte painting but surprisingly this is no distraction and in some ways enhances the idea of this magical world.  What is more surprising is that the special effects, the tornado and flying monkeys in particular, although ""low-tech"" still put a lot of CGI to shame and the 3D only enhances them.In addition, to the 2D version there is a really interesting new documentary on the making of the movie and the actual and near disasters that occurred, including a last minute plan to cut ""Over the Rainbow"" from the movie.  It's a little disappointing that there is nothing on how they made the 3D version.I'm not going to comment much on the film itself.  In this, it's 75th anniversary, it still resonates with its simple message about home and love. The performances, songs and music hold up well against anything produced in the 75 years since it was made.  (I must confess I've always cringed at Billy Burke's performance as Glinda but that's the only weak acting spot for me).So, if you've got a 3D TV this disc is well worth buying.  If you haven't but have Blu-ray, get the 2D version and see this classic at its very best."	5.0	3D review	2014-05-29	3	2	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"I give the new Blu-ray five stars despite being a little irritated with the lack of an option to buy a nice, single disc version of hte Blu-ray.  I got all of the set through Netflix and saw it that way.  I would very much like to won THE WIZARD OF OZ  on Blu-ray, but I'm going to hold out for a less expensive single or two-disc edition.  Mind you, I like the film; but that is what I like, the film not disc after disc of extras that for the most part are repackagings of earlier editions.OK, that is my beef, and having made it, let me move on.The Blu-ray is a definite improvement in the overall quality of the film, though not as much as one might have hoped for if you have watched the DVD on a up-conversion DVD player.  This is not a problem restricted merely to this.  Most of the older classics seem to have reached the point of diminishing returns on DVD.  Even epic films like John Ford's THE SEARCHERS shows minimal improvement on Blu-ray.  Still, even if the improvement isn't as marked as on more recent films, it is still definite.But frankly, I think I loved the movie just as much when I was a kid watching it on my parents' old black and white tube TV.  We all know the story about the film these days, that it was a critical and box office failure when it first was released.  And we know all the stories about it.  Buddy Ebsen being forced to drop out of the project when the make up that was sprayed on him caused a serious lung reaction.  How Judy Garland took over the role when a deal to trade Jean Harlow and Clark Gable to Warner Brothers for a film so that MGM could get Shirley Temple, a deal that fell through when Jean Harlow died.  We know all the songs, all the skits, and a host of the lines.  And most importantly we have experienced firsthand how the film became a hit years after its first release because of its annual showings on television, hosted by Olivia DeHavilland (which never made a great deal of sense to me, since he had no connection to the film and had spend her studio career with Warner Brothers rather than MGM).  Television was responsible for THE WIZARD OF OZ being the hit it became.  But despite its success in the television era, it is almost impossible to understand how it failed to become an instant classic.  The songs are irresistible, the performances classic, and the art design unmatched at the time.  Scene after scene is filled with one perfect touch after another, like a peacock that strolls around in the background when Dorthy and the Scarecrow meet the Tin Man for the first time.  Or the way the Cowardly Lion's tail twitches all the time (it is a subtle effect, but imagine how static he would be if he tail always drooped).  It is a beautifully structured film, marvelously photographed, and beautifully scripted.  The entire production is magical.And this is a film that generations share.  I remember vividly the terror I felt as a child watching Dorothy's friends come after her in the witch's fortress.  Nothing in my childhood scared me more than Later it was the first movie that I watched with my daughter on TV (barely verbal at the time, she for several weeks referred to the film as ""Scary Apples,"" for obvious reasons).  My daughter probably watched the movie on VHS a hundred times minimum, largely because Dorothy was at the time one of the few female heroes around (this was before the Era of Buffy), and when she and I were stranded on a ski lift that was stopped during a sudden lightening storm immediately outside Flagstaff, Arizona, I kept her calm by retelling the entire movie, no mean feat given the lightening flashing all around us (though thankfully there was little rain).This truly is one of those classics that it is impossible to imagine going away.  The film is, if anything, as popular today as it has ever been.  And conversions of it into new media like this new Blu-ray will guarantee that each generation will continue to rediscover it."	5.0	A splendid updating on Blu-ray of one of the all-time classics	2009-11-24	2	1	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"What a joy to see this classic film in the DVD format, accompanied by so much interesting background material which includes the documentary ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic,"" hosted by Angela Lansbury; various out takes, including the rarely seen ""Jitterbug"" dance; interviews of Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Margaret Hamilton; and excerpts from previous versions of ""Oz,"" including the 1914 and 1925 silent films and the 1933 cartoon version. Great stuff! How ironic that this film was considered a failure at the box office after its release in 1939 despite several Academy Award nominations, was ""rediscovered"" on prime time television in 1956, and continues to appear on television screens, either when broadcast or played in VHS or DVD format. As Lew Wasserman constantly insisted, television was the best thing that ever happened to the film industry. How right he was.Each time I see and hear this third film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's book, I am still enchanted by it while also marveling at the technical achievements in a film produced more than 60 years ago. It was a stroke of genius to begin the film in sepia tone black and white, then transition to color after Dorothy and Toto arrive in Munchkin Land, then return to black and white after Dorothy awakens in her home. How clever also to have characters such as Miss Gulch, Professor Marvel, and the three hired hands (Hickory, Hunk, and Zeke) reappear as the Wicked Witch of the West, Gatekeeper and Wizard, Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Cowardly Lion, respectively.Each of us has her or his favorite scenes. Mine include the tornado's approach and then later what Dorothy sees through the window as her farmhouse is hurled through the air; the series of welcomes by various Munchkins (especially the Lolly Pop Guild members); and the Wizard's desperate response after Toto pulls back the curtain. (We now know that Margaret Hamilton was severely burned during the scene which concludes when a bucket of water is thrown on her and she evaporates.) Make-up, special effects, musical score, and cinematography are integrated seamlessly.Probably because this film was generally neglected until shown on network television in 1956, it did not have as much of an impact on those in my generation as it has had on our daughters and sons....and on their own children. However, for me at least, the film supports several important life lessons while brilliantly presenting the adventures of Dorothy and her companions. First, that there really is ""no place like home"" wherever that home may be. For many of us, it is a state-of-mind and/or a condition of the heart rather than a physical location. (Recall the line ""I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams."") It is human nature, I guess, to take so much for granted until we encounter problems with health, money, an important relationship, etc. Only after a loss do we fully appreciate what we once had.The film also reminds us that we may already possess almost all of what we need to achieve our goals. Henry Ford once observed, ""Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right."" (Yogi Berra agrees with Ford, noting that ""half of success is 90% mental."") If birds fly over the rainbow, why can't we? Although we may yearn to be somewhere else as Dorothy does, or to become something else as her three companions do, the ""rainbow"" may be within us -- not out there somewhere -- if we but recognize and then follow it like a yellow brick road.These are not so much critical observations, I realize, as they are personal musings about a film which has lost none of its charm after more than 60 years. At the first opportunity, I will be off to see The Wizard of Oz in a theatre...curious to know if those around me (regardless of age) enjoy it and appreciate it as much as I will. And then at its conclusion, perhaps agreeing with me when paraphrasing Pogo, ""We have met the Wizard...and he is us."""	5.0	After More Than 60 Years....	2003-07-10	1	1	0

But rationality disappears the moment Judy Garland strikes at the heart with her trembling singing of ""Over the Rainbow."" And when Frank Morgan appears as Professor Marvel, we are captivated by his familiar bumbling charm...Dorothy's entrance into the land of Oz remains one of the screen's most memorable moments, as the black-and-white scene give way to glowing color photography... ""I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore!"" is her understated response as she enters Munchkinland... The sequence in Munchkinland, though beautifully designed, is actually, a mixed blessing... Billie Burke is exactly right as the Good Witch of the North, and Margaret Hamilton is wonderfully shrill and repulsive as the Wicked Witch of the West... But the Munchkins themselves, midgets gathered from all over the world for the occasion, are all wonderful with their prematurely old faces and chipmunk voices...The talents of Dorothy's friends--Jack Haley as the Tin Man, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion--have been frequently celebrated, but their good humor and their shining humanity behind the grotesque makeup remain fresh eternally...""The Wizard of Oz"" is a joy forever... Why does it still glow, while other films of the period grow dimmer every year? It is unquestionably due to more than the sum of its sterling cast, winning songs, and lovely special effects, although the absence of these virtues has turned more than one ""musical fantasy"" into failures... It may be that Dorothy steps from black-and-white Kansas into the bright colors of Munchkinland, she is taking everyone's first voyage of discovery... With the universality of the best fables, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has her learning about evil (the Wicked Witch), friendship (her companions on the road to Oz), and fallibility (the Wizard). And somehow children--and the child in all of us--like to see this voyage made repeatedly...Children as adults, today as in 1939, ""The Wizard of Oz"" will remain for us the beloved movie ever made!"	5.0	An enchanting film with flaws that cannot seriously mar its durable delights...	2007-01-16	3	3	0

Everyone knows the story of this classic movie, I won't bore you with that - though this was the first time I'd seen it after watching the stage production Wicked and that was interesting.Anyway, the quality of the blu-ray is wonderful. The sharpness is amazing - and reveals the artistry which went into building the sets and the makeup. Look closely at the Scarecrow's neck and you see how they continued the burlap motif up from the costume seamlessly into the makeup. Look closely at Dorothy's dress and the fine pattern is seen where in longer shots it looked like one color. The Tin Man, it turns out, has a rivet between his eyes and this is visible now, in the extra features one of the production people noted this and realized she had never seen it on any prior viewing - the full 4K scan process revealed many before unseen details. The Emerald City has never looked better!The extra features are extensive for a film this age - I especially enjoyed the summary of the process they used to restore the film. They clearly spent a huge amount of effort at this and I feel have likely produced the definitive version of the film at this point. I bought just the one-disc version; the other version I believe has more extras (I was really just interested in the film).In summary, I feel this is a top-knotch treatment of a great film.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	"Not a huge hit when it was first released, this ultimate road movie takes a young American girl from her heartland American home and plunges her into a decidedly unAmerican night-mare.Layered with meaning that morphs upon repeated viewings and from person to person, this is a favorite of several generations of movie buffs.  Someone recently said to me, ""You don't have to be gay to love it.""As a kid, I always thought Dorothy dancing along the yellow brick road toward the Emerald City was a not so disguised out-of-body trip to the golden streets of heaven itself.  And the benign Wizard as revealed behind the curtain was a much more benevolent God than the fearful one depicted in the Old Testament.Renewed interest in this classic has been justified and rewarded with an eye-popping, crisp new Blu-ray transfer.  The hi-def version of a young Judy Garland are lovelier than ever.  And Jack Haley's Tin Man, Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion, and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow are part of our collective dream imagery.  And of course take on new incarnations in ""Star Wars.""James Cameron, on speaking recently of his highly anticipated 3-D movie ""Avatar"" said ""The Wizard of OZ"" is his favorite moves. You really can't go wrong with flying monkeys, a witch, a wizard, Munchkins, a tornado, a tin-man robot guy, a talking lion and a really cute girl lost on the road to heaven. Hey, aren't we all?My favorite way to watch ""Oz,"" is to turn down the sound and instead play Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon.""  Be sure to begin the CD exactly with the third roar of the MGM lion logo.  You will be amazed at how the music matches the movie.  Very weird.  Warning: don't do this if you are in an altered state.

Yes, I remember the first HQ VCRs and what a ""leap"" they were from prior versions.  For this 70th anniversary/Blu Ray version, I was expecting something special, and it delivered, and how.  Like most restored Technicolor movies from the mid to late 30's, colors are deeply saturated.  Detail is rich.  It was a different Oz experience than any of the others.  I suspect they did something to keep colors stabilized, as other films (e.g., my GWTW restoration from a few years back--non Blu Ray) are gorgeous, but the colors shift within scenes.  It's subtle, but clearly evident.  For this Oz, colors are stable, I didn't observe flickering or shifting color at all.  This is total eye-candy, as well as being a great film.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A23CN2QNJBEL8H	"Roger Strutton ""A Young Oldy but GOING STRONG"""	"The DVD copy, the latest version, remastered and with Dolby sound is well worth a revisit. I can't remember seeing this film before although my mother knows the exact cinema in Dalston Junction London where I was first  exposed to The Wizard of Oz. This is a beautiful film looking at it from a  visual art perspective.In 1939 the Dust Bowl period was drawing to  an end, and Kansas being one of the States effected by this catastrophe is  the anchor point of Wizard. I was surprised by the opening, not black and  white, but in sepia, even the MGM logo. Now I realize I was looking at the  remastered version, but there is hardly any sign of scratches or dust, in  fact just take a clip, have it framed and the scenes would make a beautiful  print. AVCC, Universal City, did the computer work, and really produced a  work of art from a work of art.It is obvious that the farm scenes  are on a stage but because of this with the desolate background reflecting  the flattened earth caused by the Dust Bowl, and the stagey voices, the  whole atmosphere of that period with the sepia photography does capture a  period of hopelessness. It's obvious that Harold Rosson the cinematographer  knew the technical stuff, and Cedric Gibbons the art director  was skilled  in capturing the moment. The trees for example are bent due to the wind,  and of course have no leaves on them. Toto the dog, when he runs, kicks up  the dust on the track, the whole effect creating the dry, dusty situation  in Kansas that the tenant farmers were experiencing.At this time in  the thirties the Farm Security Administration employed photographers to  travel around the States to record the plight of the American people trying  to build a new life for themselves. Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were  just two of the photographers and their images are very famous. Looking at  the farm houses in their prints, they appear very similar to the sepia  scenes in The Wizard of OZ. Also looking at the farmers and the laborers,  their clothes and attitudes, all are captured in this movie.Off  course the sepia effect isn't used just to show this depressive time, the  other reason is to create a startling contrast that jump starts us into the  technicolor scenes. Technicolor a three-color process was developed in  1932, and even today with so much progress in film and chemicals,  technicolor takes a lot of beating when it comes to vivid saturated colors.  The moment Dorothy opens her door outwards in her gloomy house still  photographed in sepia, the technicolor shot of the garden, with the  sunflowers, the daisies, the green fertile hills, blue sky and pond with  the white bridge, completely takes the audience by surprise, a most  pleasing experience.Without technicolor we would have no yellow  brick road, Elton John would still be hunting for words for a catchy tune,  and Michael Jackson would have moonwalked in another scene for his  Billie  Jean MTV video. Yes, we have to say thanks to The Wizard of Oz, where would  we be without you.Judy Garland was only sixteen when she made this  film, but by then she was a already a veteran, The Wizard of OZ being her  fifteenth film. Unfortunately due to anorexia and the usual ""uppers and  downers,"" most of her life existed in a sepia cloud."	5.0	Sepia period technicolor atmosphere	2000-03-23	10	8	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A14124RL7NBRW3	Rosemary E. Lloyd	"I'm nearly 50 years old and yet ""The Wizard of Oz"" still enchants me. This particular video also was extremely well done - the colors are vivid, the images are crystal clear and the sound is sheer perfection.The story of Dorothy Gale, a lonely little girl who gets hit on the head during a tornado and finds herself (via a dream) no longer in her home in Kansas but in a make-believe land is someone with whom many of us can identify. The nightmares and joys children experience are much more intense than those of grown-ups partially because children haven't yet developed the means of filtering the intensity out of those experiences. This is perfectly illustrated when Dorothy's drab, hum-drum farm life, shown in black and white, is changed magically into the vivid colors of Oz. When Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, tells her she must go to Oz to see the ""Great and Powerful"" wizard, she goes on the ""Yellow Brick Road"" where she meets 3 friends. In her real life on the farm, those friends were her aunt's and uncle's farmhands, Zeke, Hickory and Hunk. In her dreamworld, they became the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. And like her, these 3 were looking for something they thought they were missing. Dorothy also meets with someone she detests in real life who appears in her dream - the evil Miss Gulch/Wicked Witch of the West, played with such delicious villainy by Margaret Hamilton. Just as Miss Gulch threatens to destroy Toto in real life, the Wicked Witch threatens her ""and her little dog, too"" as she ventures to Oz.The songs alone would make this movie a classic - ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow,"" while admittedly NOT one of my personal favorites, remains a perennial favorite. I much prefer ""Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead,"" ""Follow the Yellow Brick Road"" and the""Munchkin Land Welcome"" mini songs done by the Lullaby League and the Lollipop Guild.Another unique thing about ""TWOO"" is the Munchkins. In real life, these were dwarfs and midgets and yet their roles in the movie are important and necessary without being degradingly cute or patronizing. Long before it was ""politically correct"" to treat different people with equality and respect, ""TWOO"" did just that by treating the Munchkins just like anyone else.This movie, made in that golden year 1939, is a timeless classic and whether you are 5 or 500, it's a movie to enjoy for all time. I love this movie and I'm so glad I own the video because I can go to Oz whenever I like and not be distracted by COMMERCIALS."	5.0	THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ	2002-08-15	3	3	0

While she hasn't watched much of the extras (still busy being ""mom"" lol), she LOVED the inserts and gifts that came with this collection.  The watch it comes with is beautiful...dazzling really.  The posters are fantastic too.  And she loved the little book that came with it, which has lots of movie screen-shots inside it.  She loved reading the little facts about the movie!  The book rested on the dresser by her bed for ages.Only criticism: I personally couldn't notice much of a difference between what a regular DVD would potentially look like compared to this Blu-ray DVD.  Didn't ""pop"" like some of the Blu-ray alterations I've seen in the past (i.e. ""Beauty and the Beast"" by Disney).  Nonetheless, the novelty of this set and all the additional items included in this DVD package are fantastic, and well worth the money spent.As a side note, my mom loved it so much, she made a section of our DVD cabinet devoted to this collection, and added a few little ornaments/trinkets to spruce up the ""Wizard of Oz"" dedicated-space, hehe ;)  Your Wizard of Oz fan will LOVE it :)"	5.0	Great Purchase for my Mom, a die-hard WOZ Fan :)	2012-09-01	0	0	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Whatever tension and disaster befell the making of this film (read the enormously informative MAKING OF THE WIZARD OF OZ), you will not find anything here but a creative and perfectly-realized fantasy-come-to-vivid  life.  That the Wizard of Oz has infiltrated our collective conscience in  every way is no accident -- the sheer exhuberance and underlying sadness of  this film and its rich tapestry of classic fairy-tale imagery and morales  make it a classic of the ages.  While all of the supporting players are  gargantuan talents -- from the sweetness of Ray Bolger to the perfect  rendering of a witch by Margaret Hamilton -- it is Judy Garland's plaintive  beauty and melancholy/joyful presence that gives this movie its everlasting  quality.  Each moment is embarrassingly rich with creativity and artistic  vision; the tornado sequence alone still out-does any tornado movie before  or since.  And the musical score, delightfully evocative and sing-able, is  underscored at every turn with brilliant musical comedy choreography and  staging -- from Garland's subtle moves during the classic Over The Rainbow  to the often-emulated three-step jig to We're Off To See The Wizard.  This  movie has justifiably taken on a life of its own, and I somehow think  surpassed even the great visionaries behind it.  It is one of those  experiences that just came together in all the right ways, and was blessed  with source material (Baum's scary-wondrous book) that provided a wealth of  cinematic possibilities, all captured with imagination and heart.  The DVD  brings out the eye-popping color and the exquisitely sad sepia-toned  overture in never-before-seen clarity.  This is one to own and share  forever.	5.0	WONDER-FULL	1999-12-21	4	4	0

People might complain that the picture is not as clear as some of the new movies, but what has to be understood is that technology was not the greatest in the 30's. The only downfall I think to watching this movie in HD is that a lot of the movies production flaws are seen and kinda hinder the movie abit. From seeing the makeup and the props used in the film and the quality of them takes away from the experience a little. None the less a fantastic movie in a fantastic package.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3D28SE0H060MU	Ryan	This is one of the most memorable films of all time, and it would be difficult for anyone to claim that they made it through their childhood without seeing it on television at least once. Not only has The Wizard of Oz claimed a home in the hearts of many for generation after generation, but it has also been given a place in film history. Growing up, it was an event if we turned the television on and discovered that The Wizard of Oz was playing. Even though it was available on VHS, there was something special about knowing this film was a constant. Because of the high number of times it appears on television, studies have shown that this is the highest watched film in history.Because of this, I imagine most everyone is familiar with the story and all of the wonders it has to offer. This is another film with a great deal of drama within the production, and that can be fascinating as well. Personally, I just love this film for purely nostalgic reasons. It is far from a favorite film of mine, but watching it brings me back to childhood on some small level. I never saw the new Oz film. Walt Disney was furious when MGM had the rights to the beloved book series, and the Disney studio has made several sequels and sub-par rip-offs ever since. I'm sure there is some merit to the new Oz film, but nothing will ever compare to the classic.THE WIZARD OF OZ IS #3 IN THE REAL MOVIE NEWS LIST OF THE TOP CLASSIC MUSICALS.

You laugh, you sing, you feel for the characters, and some parts put you on the edge of your seat.  Judy Garland truely gave her best performance of her lifetime, she definately deserved her Oscar.  The film itself is a colorful piece of art.  The places it takes you and the characters you meet.  L. Frank Baum's awesome novel was wonderfully adapted by one of the greatest directors in film history, Victor Flemming.  The acting in this film was wonderful.  Every character is alive and believable.  The DVD is really beautiful.  You have plenty of bonus features and the picture and sound quality is awesome.  No DVD is complete without The Wiard of Oz.

I should deduct stars for that.I bought it by mistake thru Amazon Prime.  Pretty much a waste of money because I doubt I'll really watch it again.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1IUH51WI1TTSP	Sam A. Milazzo	"This is my 3rd DVD of MGM'S 1939 ""Wizard"" Musical, yet this disk is the Only Release actually done by the original studio: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (all later releases were by the new owner Warner Bros). I had already gotten the EARLIER video (simpler design, no Emerald City or Toto and cornfield background on cover) and so I missed out on getting the video with this nicely altered cover (despite EC looking stretched and reversed around).This DVD plays the ""MGM/UA"" logo at the opening of the disk, before playing the movie. The quality of this movie is unrestored, so obvious make-up on Judy's face (upon entering the colourful domain of Oz) is clearly seen and there are the little scratches and dirt etc on the film, while the audio still sounds good even without 2005's surround sound release; but no matter how clean or dirty the film is, whether how clear the sound is or not, watching and hearing the movie is always fun!Once finished, we then see the Main Menu - Dorothy and her friends seeing the Emerald City across the Poppy Field. Like the 1999 WB DVD, menus are without music.There is only one Special Feature, and that includes the 'Original' Trailer - which is slightly confusing looking like later releases seen on the double/triple-disk release in 2005 - which wasn't included in the most recent re-release. In case there were rumours spreading about of its content, this disk does NOT have the Laser-Disk Audio Commentary. JUST the TRAILER.The Scene Selection/Chapter Search is slightly different from the later releases, having 49 chapters instead of 55. The DVD case is also different from the traditional case: it has a click-open-over-flap on the right-opening (like a wallet) instead of the simple disconnection.I ordered this old DVD with 2 other new Oz disks: the 30th Anniversary DVD of ""the Wiz"" and the NEW DVD of ""Tin Man"", and I seriously enjoyed watching all 3 DVDs!Hope the Blu-Ray and ""Dreamer"" Compilation come in FULL PLEASURE of Special Features and Cover Art next year!"	5.0	Classic Movie on an Old DVD	2004-05-02	0	0	0

INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU YET ANOTHER REVIEW OF THE EXCELLENT 1939 &#34;THE WIZARD OF OZ&#34;  I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU WISDOM ON WHAT TO DO WHEN A POWERFUL MISS GULCH STARTS TO TREAT YOU UNFAIRLY.  FIRST, TRY TO DISCERN WHAT THEIR REAL PROBLEM IS.  IN MISS GULCH'S CASE SHE WAS APPARENTLY LONELY AND SIMPLY NEEDED ATTENTION.  I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE BE CRUEL BECAUSE THAT IS ALL THEY HAVE EVER RECEIVED.  EVEN AN ANGRY RESPONSE IS BETTER TO THEM THAN NO ATTENTION AT ALL.  IF MISS GULCH WERE &#34;ALL BUT LAME FROM THE BITE&#34; ON HER LEG, THEN SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RIDE HER BIKE SO VIGOROUSLY TO HURT THE GALE FAMILY.  WHEN SOMEONE IS ANGRY, DON'T DO ANYTHING HURTFUL LIKE DELIBERATELY MISUNDERSTANDING OR BELITTLING OR LETTING THE GATE SLAM ON THEIR BOTTOM, BUT RATHER STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND SHOW THEM EXTRAORDINARY LOVE AND HOSPITALITY AND ENGAGE IN GENTLE RESPECTFUL COMMUNICATION.  FIND A COMPROMISE OR MAKE IT KNOWN THAT YOU WILL TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT SUCH AN OFFENSE FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.  IF AFTER FOLLOWING THAT ADVICE, THEY STILL WON'T BACK DOWN, THEN OFFER TO HELP THEM TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE.  IN THE GALE CASE, GO WITH HER TO THE SHERIFF AND REPEAT TO HIM THE ACTIONS THAT YOU WILL TAKE TO PREVENT A REPEAT OFFENSE.  IF NECESSARY, POINT OUT THAT THE DOG IS TOO SMALL TO HURT ANYBODY AND ASK MISS GULCH TO PRODUCE THE WOUND FOR THE SHERIFF.  AFTER ALL, SOME PEOPLE EXAGGERATE THEIR DIFFICULTIES OR EVEN LIE ABOUT THEM.  IF SOMEONE REPEATS AN OFFENSE AGAINST YOU AFTER YOU HAVE TRIED TO WORK IT OUT AS ABOVE, THEN CONFRONT THEM GENTLY EACH TIME ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  I SUGGEST AFTER 3 OR MORE STRIKES AGAINST YOU TO SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THEM ENTIRELY UNTIL THEY CEASE THE OFFENSE.  THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO HELP A MISS GULCH,  EVEN IF SHE NEVER CHANGES. THE APPLICATION OF THIS KIND OF LOVING COMPASSION MAY EVEN SAVE MISS GULCH'S LIFE!  STUDIES SHOW THAT THOSE THAT FEEL LOVED HAVE MUCH BETTER HEALTH AND LIVES!  SAME WITH THOSE SUCH AS THE GALES THAT ARE CHRISTIAN!  WHEN YOU STRIKE BACK, YOU BECOME AS OFFENSIVE AS LIFE'S &#34;WITCHES&#34; ARE AND A TRAGIC HATFIELD/MCCOY SITUATION COULD DEVELOP AND NOBODY WINS. REMEMBER, 2 WRONGS NEVER MAKE A RIGHT!

Great classic flick, WAIT, possibly the most classic movie ever to grazzzzze the screen in movie history. If you havent seen this movie you shouldn't be allowed to watch movies. Huge movie full of wonderful imagination, but I hear the book is a bit different and scarier with witch fights, now that would be cool, darn Hollywood for changing what could have been an even better film then already is. The flying monkey guys are kinda scary.So everyone get your basket a little doggy catch the next tornado to the land of Oz where everything is in color, oh my!! Let us all follow the yellow brick road to the wonderful wizard of OZ. One of the very best fantasys of all time, the flower field before the green castle is beautiful. Although the tornado is kinda fake, for some reason it is still quite creepy, has sort of a dreamlike quality to it and its in always creepy black and white.Lots and lots of fun to be had and many memorable moments as well and when you're done click your heals together and say theres no place like home. At home watching this masterpiece of a film.

The movie made immense improvements to a cute story, making it  great.  Just look at the entire book online at ipl.org -- For instance,  when Dorothy was at the witch's castle, the only time she took off her  shoes was for baths and to sleep -- but the witch couldn't steal them when  she was asleep -- she was afraid of the dark! Oh, brother! And the wizard  actually opened up the scarecrow's head and sewed in brains, instead of (in  the movie) giving him a diploma to make him &quot;think&quot; he was smart.

When Dorothy and Toto landed in Munchkinland and I saw the COLORS I  was mesmerized. Legend has it L. Frank Baum was gazing at his filing  cabinet, the top  drawer containing A-N; the bottom drawer O-Z and that  (fortunately for all of us!) set him wondering about OZ. Glinda appearing  via a bubble, the brilliant greens of Oz and my absolute favorite of  all...the truculent apple trees! Originally the studio wanted Shirley  Temple...she wasn't available. Then Buddy Ebsen was cast as the Tin Man but  he had an allergic reaction to the lead-based makeup. Ed Wynn was selected  to play the multi-parts of Professor Marvel, the Wizard, and  the Guard at  the gate of Oz but that fell through. I'm thankful Judy Garland is Dorothy  but I can't help wondering what the movie would have been like with Ed Wynn  as the Wizard, et al.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3BSS2M2DPPV4T	"""scotsladdie"""	"Reviewing this film is like reviewing the Statue of Liberty! What can I say about this American institution? People I know from the States tell me that their hearts would pound for a week when it was to be shown on television. If that is a slight exaggeration, it is fair to say that it is the most beloved film of the English speaking masses. Judy Garland was, of course rather old (16) to play Dorothy Gale (in the book she was about 11, I believe), but once she comes into view nobody cares: Garland is the only Dorothy in the minds of millions. When the picture was originally released in that sterling year of 1939, the most generously praised performer was Bert Lahr for his hilarious playing of the Cowardly Lion with a Brooklyneese accent. During the filming, the scene in which Dorothy smacks the Lion for picking on Toto had to be re-shot umpteen times because Garland kept cracking up at Lahr's sobbing! Finally director Fleming slapped Judy across the face saying ""Honey, this is a picture wer'e making and this is serious"". There are, of course legendary stories connected with the making of the film. In 1939, technicolor processing was ""slower"" and thusly required very bright and hot lights; therefore the Lion, Scarecrow and especially the Lion were all absolutely MISERABLE in their costumes; Lahr was a hypocondriac which didn't help matters. Margaret Hamilton's costume caught fire (during the very take we see on film) when she vanished from Munchkin Land via a stage elevator. Some of Munchkins were trouble on and off the set as they liked to participate in drunken ""parties"". The sepia book-ends really make OZ seem like a really magical place; who can blame Dorothy for wanting to escape drab Kansas? Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West gets my vote for the most unforgettable character in the film. Firstly, she REALLY looked like a witch....a classic Halloween witch miraculously personified. Her evil glare, her laugh, her mannerisms, etc. were the likes of which have really never been duplicated though widely imitated. Margaret Hamilton herself believed children under seven shouldn't see the film, especially if they were impressionible (as I was; at four or five I would turn my head or go into the next room because she REALLY frightened me!) Hamilton was originally a kindergarten teacher in her native Cleveland and loved children! Edna May Oliver and Gale Sondergaard were being considered for the role of the witch-thank goodness they decided on Hamilton! Billie Burke was a great beauty in her day and of course the widow of legendary showman Florenz Ziegfeld. Burke was 53(!) when she played Glinda (in the OZ books Glinda was illustated as being matronly) and with her unique voice and femininity, she constrasted nicely with the wicked Hamilton.(Margaret Hamilton never liked the character of Almira Gulch (she described her as being ""too jerky""!) and never thought her playing of the witch was in any way a great feat of acting). We all know Dorothy's hair changes in length during her Oz adventures,but does everyone catch the  unravelling of the rope during the hot air balloon sequence near the end? For some reason, I always thought the part where Dorothy meets the Scarecrow is beautifully done. The color is bold and clear and there is something timeless and modern (for a 1939 film) about it. Because this movie is such an institution, I will refrain from saying negative picky things about it (few films -are there any?-are flawless). I was a bit disappointed at seeing the new re-mastered version in the theatre as there were ""patchwork"" spots in the sepia sequences in the beginning of the film, which, I would think in these days of advanced technology could have been remedied SOMEHOW. There are so many messages and allegories in the movie and I believe these have been a secret to it's longevity - THE WIZARD OF OZ is an evergreen perennial for the young and the perpetually young-at-heart!!"	5.0	THE MOST BELOVED FILM EVER!!!	1999-11-29	1	0	1
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3NNENFGZRGRRM	Scott Barkley	In his otherwise excellent review,Mr.McEwan mistakenly claims it was the Scarecrow who unravels the rope,whereas the guilty culprit is indeed the Tin Man! There is another trivial visual in the film:see if you can catch  the exotic birds roaming around in the background in the scene where the  Wicked Witch throws a ball of fire at the Scarecrow from the roof of the  deserted cabin. The most famous of musical fantasies,&quot;The Wizard of  Oz&quot; is undoubtedly the best of the genre;it's been enjoyed by  succeeding generations of adults and children alike. The universal appeal  of the film owes much to the fact that it represents an almost perfect  integration of music and action, with every song either advancing the  suspenseful plot or explaining the motivations of one of the intriguing  characters. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was first published in 1900 and  author Lyman Frank Baum wrote thirteen succeeding volumes ;he even formed  his own movie company in 1914 which produced three five reel Oz films! The  cherished 1939 film begins in drab sepia tones as the orphan Dorothy  decides to run away(she expresses her feelings of longing in the plaintive,  haunting song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;) Her modest farmhouse is tossed  into the air via a &quot;twister&quot; as friends and neighbors go floating  by her window (these scenes are both dated and timeless!) After the house  lands with a pronounced crash; Dorothy opens the front (with little Toto in  her arms)and she's mesmorized by the sight of a strange land vibrant with  brilliant,garish and exhilarting Technicolour! The rest is cinema history!  &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is an amalgam of many fine talents and is an  example of the teamwork that was representative of the Hollywood studio  system at its best. Director Victor Fleming carries the action forward at a  never-flagging pace, which is no minor accomplichment in a musical movie  with forty of its 100 minutes of running time devoted to songs. The tender  kinship between Dorothy and her three friends is admirable in that it never  becomes romantic or maudlin. The cast and the music are the most memorable  features of the film; each character is so well portrayed that it is  difficult to believe that many members of the cast were not first  choices!(I agree with a former reviewer in that Ed Wynn would have made an  interesting Wizard, but Shirley Temple (though she closely resembled the  W.W. Denslow drawings in the original Baum editions of the book) would have  been a totally different Dorothy from the one we all know as Garland's  star-making role) When &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; opened in 1939, critics  were almost unanimous in it's praise, although there were a few  dissenters(a New Yorker critic thought Bert Lahr out of place in Oz) The  film garnered eight awards and audiences generally enjoyed the film;it must  be remembered that &quot;Oz&quot; was released in that incredible year of  1939, and there was very heavy competition and only with it's theatrical  revival in 1948, did &quot;Oz&quot; reap financial rewards. My kids were  most frightened by the flying monkeys (which seems to be very common among  children I've witnessed watching the film);others are terrified by the  Witch of the West. The DVD print is a big improvement, the color is clear  and crisp and highly recommended for family viewing.	5.0	A STERLING PRODUCTION	1999-12-07	0	0	0

""The Wizard Of Oz"" is possibly the most beloved American film of all time! And every time you view it, you are reminded of just why that is! The color is fantastic and somehow this film never seems to show it's age, other than the fact that filmmakers don't use color the way it was used in this film. What a pity!I don't think there is anyone over the age of 5 or 6 that's not familiar with the story and it's interesting to read about how much this film is loved around the world. I recently saw a piece on the news where a group of orphaned children in Africa, (who had never seen a movie before), were shown this film, and the wide-eyed wonder and ear to ear smiles on their faces were so moving and touching.The extra's include a documentary of the making of ""The Wizard Of Oz"", interviews with the Wicked Witch herself, Margaret Hamilton, the Scarecrow, Ray Bolger, and the Tin Man, Jack Haley.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AGGNRYXM19DDF	Scott E. Sanders	"I am a big fan of the classics, back before sex, drugs and profanity took center stage at the movies. Those movies were about the content not the shock factor. Don't get me wrong, I like newer movies too. I just think that the classics were done much better. So, when I saw that ""The Wizard of Oz"", quite arguably the best movie ever made, had been reworked for a Limited Edition, 75th Anniversary Blu-Ray, I did not hesitate to order not one, but two - I am giving the second one to my parents as a Christmas gift.My package arrived in the mail and I immediately opened it up and took inventory of the contents - I did not even look at what was in the gift-set before shelling out the $70 per copy, since I knew deep down that it would be worth it regardless of what extras it came with, if any (and I would have gladly paid more actually). So, imagine my surprise when I was greeted with a hard-cover production-photo book, a full-color map of the Land of Oz, a 7"" x 9"" full-color photo-card detailing a companion book, a set of Rub Slippers sparkling glitter-globe, a set of Ruby Slippers 4 GB Flash Drive, and a set of 3 pins representing the Scarecrow's brain, the Tin-Man's Heart, and the Cowardly Lion's Courage. The detail to the extras is amazing.But it did not stop there. I watched the movie in 3D, not sure quite what to expect, as I have seen some attempts to up-convert old movies to 3D-Full HD that did not go over so well. But, this was nothing short of astounding. The pictures clarity was was breath-taking, looking like it could have been filmed just yesterday and not over 75 years ago. The sound was also rich and full, utilizing all 7 channels of the system I played it on. And, as for the 3D aspect, well, the things they can do with film today - it was like watching the characters walk right off the screen.In closing, I want to say that any fan of The Wizard of Oz, or just classic movies in general, will not be disappointed by this gem of a find. In fact, when you watch this version of the movie, you almost feel as if it could be 1939 still. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the franchise."	5.0	A True Masterpiece As It Should Be.	2013-10-07	9	8	1

The clarity of picture was truly extraordinary.  At some certain points, the picture quality looked as crisp and on par with films produced nowadays with 4k cameras.  The amount of detail (coupled with the large screen) also allowed me to take notice of things I never had before, despite having watched this film countless times since I was a kid.  Things like makeup, seems on the bald caps on the munchkins, and other details are noticeable.The 3D was impressive as well.  While the original set backdrops were obviously just painted, flat surfaces, the depth mapping done on this film provided a genuine sense of distance and depth when looking at even these backdrops, fostering a greater sense of Oz as a real, physical location beyond the sets in the foreground.  I'm not sure how hardcore purists will feel about this, but I thought it was a nice, very subtle touch.Overall, they did a wonderful job of presenting this film.	5.0	Simply Stunning	2013-09-24	5	3	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1BS8Y076W0PL6	"S. Elliott ""Techie"""	"I purchased the Blu-Ray single disc 70th anniversary edition and I'm absolutely disappointed. The picture quality is very grainy.  And the color just seems off.This Blu-Ray version may be true to original, but I prefer the DVD with a more ""soft"", less grainy look to it.  For the purest, I imagine this would be a great transfer, but as an everyday ""end-user"" I'm not happy with the results.Read on for a more technical explanation thanks to Freeline:""The Wizard of Oz"" was filmed in 1938-39, in a time when film stocks were very grainy (see the Warner Bros. Blu-Ray release of 1933's ""King Kong"" to see what I mean). Film grain is essentially the building blocks of an image, much like pixels are the building blocks of a digital image. You are seeing the grain clearly for the first time because the original 3-strip Technicolor camera negatives were scanned in at an unprecedented 8k resolution, far sharper than any other prior video transfer. The 2005 DVD edition was scanned at half that resolution: 4k, and presented in down-converted NTSC video on DVD. This is 1080p Hi-Definition we're talking about here.Warner Bros. simply did not apply a lot of noise reduction to this Blu-Ray (if any at all); doing so would have blurred away the finest details, which take the form of facial and clothing textures, among other things. The high resolution has also revealed a new sense of dimensionality and spatial depth to the picture, something that had also been previously softened by older home video formats and the limitations of past printing techniques.What you are now seeing is the sharpest, highest possible resolution transfer of the original camera negatives. Previous video editions smoothed and glossed over the grain (and the depth) due to their lower resolution, as did past printing techniques for theatrical exhibition.As for the different color balance, that is the result of a color correction based on an actual preserved Technicolor dye-transfer answer print from 1939 (dye-transfer prints do not fade, as they are not photochemical, but dye-based), which was likely sanctioned by the filmmakers and accurately reflected the original 1939 release prints. The picture now looks more natural and earthy; previous editions included color washes that affected the overall balance of each scene. Now, there is better contrast between the filmed colors, which are left to speak for themselves, and they are more vibrant than ever before."	1.0	True Transfer Results in Grainy Picture Quality & Off Color	2011-09-21	34	17	17

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3UI9IRG5SLUI7	Sera Elisabeth	102 years ago, The Wizard of Oz was first part of American Literature, written by the talented Lyman Frank Baum. Nearly 40 years later this timely fairytale was altered onto the big screen under Metro Goldwyn Meyer for a 1939 release, Starring Judy Garland as Dorothy who skips down the yellow road paved of brick that will lead Dorothy to her destiny, Frank Morgan, the founding father of the Screen Actor's Guild,as Oz, Ray Bolger the Scarecrow, Jack Haley as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion.The Wizard of Oz, by 1939's standard was first considered a B rated success, mostly because of Gone With The Wind's strong push of Hollywood style.  Nevertheless, In 1956, along came television with the very FIRST movie picked up for a national televised premiere was ultimately, The Wizard of Oz.  Little by little, year by year, this became a story not only for the small child but, the child in all of us; as the beginning of the 1939 movie does quote.Generations after the 1956 premiere, fell in love with its ingenuity. Now in the year of 2002  The Wizard of OZ has become the most watched and beloved film ever made.  You know, it's amazing how you can a watch a bad movie, and one tine is enough ! But, in the case of the Wizard of Oz, One hundred times may NOT be enough !	5.0	THE SUCCESS OF OZ	2002-05-14	0	0	0

While I understand the expression of feelings about the movie in general (VHS and DVD) as well as the nostalgia  associated with the movie, how can this be considered a legitimate review of the product since no one appears to have actually seen this version?

So, I'll be talking about this particular edition and how it relates to other previous releases.First off, I have to say that for the low prices Amazon is offering, this two-DVD set is a steal.  It includes a gorgeous-looking remastered version of the film; the colors pop and I was able to notice new details on objects that weren't visible with the picture quality of previous releases.  Also included on the discs are hours of bonus features, ranging from cast biographies to star-studded celebrations of the film to salutes to the movie's smallest (and often unrecognized) cast members.If you don't have The Wizard of Oz in your movie collection, or are looking to upgrade to a better version, you can't go wrong with this item.	5.0	Great movie, great extras.	2010-12-01	1	1	0

This DVD version of The Wizard of Oz offers a generous helping of  information about the movie and its characters -- about 1 and a half hours  of pure ear-catching inquiries, or so I've heard.  I have yet to watch all  of its special features, having only watched half of its many bonus tracks.  The movie itself I have seen many times growing up, but I have never seen  it so digitally mastered as I have seen it in this DVD.  Seventeen dollars  for this DVD is absurd, for having very informative special features,  including great sound and picture, deserves to be at least sold at a much  higher price.

I am so tired if this imbecilic clich&eacute;, used by professional critics as well as some of Amazon's monosyllabic semi-literates. The phrase isn't meant to be taken literally, ever? Then why keep saying it?  What kind of hoity-toity arrogance is behind the gall even to suggest that a movie or TV show or book ought to be on a ""required"" list?  In the same Amazon review, the erstwhile ""critic"" allows as how ""The Wizard of Oz"" may not be to everyone's taste. NO, REALLY?!?!? Well that's really valuable information. So the reviewer is going out on a limb and venturing to state that there may be someone on this planet of billions for whom ""Oz"" isn't the be-all, end-all and all-all of filmmaking?!?!?  WOW.  How about a list of those titles about which one could never find even the tiniest particle of disagreement?! A pretty short damn list.  I know this may all sound picayunish, but the fact is, even though everyone may be entitled to their opinion, not everyone is entitled to publication.

For that I give the film itself 5 stars.If only films today could send as many great messages as this one does. I just wish Hollywood would not touch the classics for the purpose of re-releasing them in 3D. I know it's another way to make money and to introduce oz to a whole new generation, but seriously, why can't they just release this film in the way it was supposed to be viewed. In 2D. Besides that fact, I hope to enjoy this box set and all that is has to offer in terms of extra goodies. I would suggest oz fans pick this up as soon as it goes on sale b/c it is a limited and numbered set. Anyway for children, teenagers, grown ups, and the elderly alike, this is a must view film because it lifts your spirits with the vibrant color and picturesque scenery that must have wowed audiences when they first saw it in 1939. This is a film that can withstand the ages and the test of time.And for that, I hope it always will.	5.0	CAN'T WAIT TO PRE-ORDER FOR EARLY B-DAY PRESENT	2013-07-29	0	0	0

Anyone who bought this (not inexpensive) collectors set is entirely justified in returning it for FULL REFUND. All others, be warned: No prior info or disclaimer warned anyone that THE DREAMER OF OZ was largely unwatchable. Its inclusion was a major selling point in a set with few additional new features. How does bluray expect to win friends with muck ups like this!?!?!AT THE VERY LEAST, WARNERS SHOULD BE MAILING OUT NEW ""DREAMER OF OZ"" DISCS FREE TO EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS SET.The blu-ray WIZARD OF OZ itself is consistently grainy throughout, with a slight skewing away from the blue spectrum. Check out the gorgeous grainless 2005 restoration and look at the longshot of the witch's castle at night if you have any doubts about this. In fact, you might want to buy a marketplace copy of the wonderful standard def 2005 set, which some will certainly prefer to this blu-ray misfire.I'm sure, in a couple of years, when the next ""Definitive"" blu-ray restoration is released--which may improve some of these deficits--you'll be invited to upgrade.Again."	1.0	Pay no attention to that DREAMER behind the curtain!	2009-10-02	54	18	36

It was filmed in the Academy aspect ratio, prior to the introduction of the widescreen ratio. Televisions were, in fact, designed to fit the Academy aspect ratio. You won't be getting a pan and scan even though this film is listed as having a fullscreen aspect ratio. The Letterbox and Widescreen Advocacy Page specifically mentions this film in its description of the Academy aspect ratio and how such films cannot, by definition, have a widescreen version.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A11FH9K1G4J6DJ	"Stephanie Monaghan ""Lee Kaiwen"""	"I introduced my 2-year old to Wizard of Oz a month ago, and she can't get enough of it. She demands it when she wakes up, at nap-time, bed-time and after lunch. We dance together in Munchkinland, she knows most of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" by heart -- though she doesn't understand the words -- and ""Tin Man"", ""Scarecrow"", ""Witch"" and ""Courage"" have become part of her vocabulary.So I decided to pick up this edition for her. Being so accustomed to the over-saturated edition we're all so familiar with, I must say my initial reaction as Dorothy stepped into Oz was rather negative. Where did all the color go? But then all the incredible DETAIL started leaping off the screen and I was enthralled. I didn't know the Wicked Witch had hair!I loaded up the remastered version on my 12"" laptop, while my daughter watched the old DVD on our 42"" plasma display, and watched the two side-by-side, and even with all the limitations of the laptop's LCD the difference was amazing! The desaturation alone has brought out so much detail that had been washed out of the pre-restoration version. Some of the highlights: the Witch's hair emerges from the shadows under her hat; the annoying moire patterns are gone from Dorothy's dress; the kingly robe the Lion dons during ""If I were King of the Forest"" turns out to be an elegant green, not black; and oh! the soft suppleness of Bert Lahr's lion's mane! What a delicious relief from the hideous over-saturated, burnt orange shading we've had to endure all these years.One other detail I noticed that I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews: the pre-restoration version (or at least mine), had suffered some cropping in the past both horizontally and vertically. The remastered edition restores those lost edges -- about 15 percent by my estimation in all directions.Of the extras discs, I was most pleased to see Harold Arlen's home movies, and learn how they created that incredible tornado. Even seventy years on the deleted footage of the tornado engulfing the farm house was terrifying. No wonder it was cut from the film!On a personal note, I was happy to see new footage of family friend Meinhardt Raabe (the Munchkind coroner), who had been a college classmate and friend of my grandfather's in Wisconsin. It's been twenty years since I've seen Raabe, and I was delighted to discover he's still alive.I was apprehensive spending this much money on a movie I already owned. But I must add my voice to those who say it was absolutely worth the price. If you care about Wizard of Oz, you need to get this. If you've never seen the remastered edition, this will delight and enrapture you."	5.0	Bought it for my 2-year old, kept it for myself	2007-12-06	3	3	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2AB4H9JQJGJEE	Stephen	Some movies that were filmed in 3D during paper blue and red glasses were probably not meant to be modernized by the modern 3D glass glasses! Either that movies that were not filmed in 3D but were converted into one anyway is probably the worst! Lets just say the only 3D I had best experience is mostly the autostereoscopic signature of the Nintendo 3DS (XL version at best) and of course a few movies like Avatar (#1), Hugo and Toy Story 3 and games like Resistance 3 amd Halo Anniversary were good in 3D but  3D like The Wizard of OZ, Top Gun and I, Robot were not meant to be in 3D! Of course it depends on the AV Receiver and 3D TV and in my experience I prefer Sony! The only problem with 3D is you have to distance and angle yourself! Distance part is easy but the angle part is the worst! Technically 3D should be reaching out farther after you like Disney theater thrill rides like lets say Iron Man's laser in The Avengers but alas! Maybe 3D theaters and televisions should acquire and study the 3D tech from Disney theater thrill rides! Hint, Hint!	5.0	Excellent Classic but 3D effects are questionable	2013-10-31	5	1	4
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	In a beautiful green and black box, the new three disk THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939)DVD gift set is a feast and ideal holiday present for Judy Garland and L. Frank Baum fans and children of all ages the world over.  It has taken me the better part of a week to get through all of its myriad delights, starting on disk three with a lovely biography of Mr. Baum, his life, and his Oz books.  Three hours or so long, disk three also includes a generous sampling of Oz silent films, including a restored version of Larry Semon's 1925 version.  The silent Oz films are, truthfully, not very good.  But maybe you need to see mediocre Oz movies to fully appreciate the miracles that MGM created in the late 1930s.Disk two is at least SIX HOURS long, ranging from brand-new documentaries on the creation and and restoration and legacy of the 1939 masterpiece, to outtakes and deleted scenes, to how they did the tornado sequence, to literally hours of song rehearsal audio tests, to several theatrical trailers, to a very nostalgic hour-long (including the Maxwell House coffee commercials) 1939 radio program devoted entirely to the movie.  This disk goes on and on forever; you are going to have to do it in two nights, even skipping over repetitious song rehearsals.  Try doing the 2000 filmmaking documentary and the AUDIO VAULT material on a second night along with the movie.Then do the rest of disk two after you have seen the film.The 1939 movie is on disk one and has been magnificently restored, frame by frame, from a mint-condition nitrate camera negative.  I have never seen THE WIZARD OF OZ with color this beautiful, images so clear, and sound so crisp and new-sounding.  This restoration is a true thing of beauty.  Even if you only want to see the movie and not all of the bonuses, this restored print is worth the $35 it costs from Amazon.com.  The entire three box set is almost a bargain at $40 retail for Christmas or Hanukkah or birthdays.Last, but not least, the three disk OZ set has two vanilla-colored folders: (1) Ten 1939 Kodachrome color on-set publicity photos and portraits of the cast; and (2) A wonderful promotional kit that includes MGM Studio Publicity News, education guides, and world premiere 1939 souvenir booklet and Grauman's Chinese Theatre ticket replicas.Aside from the exquisite four disk GONE WITH THE WIND, I can't think of a more beautiful, labor of love home video edition of a movie than the three disk THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Every family should have a copy to watch whenever they like and not when Ted Turner wants us to see it on cable TV.	5.0	An exquisite restoration of an immortal screen classic	2005-12-08	15	15	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1C9GCHR99WX3F	Stephen Verhaeren	If you have not seen the Wizard of Oz yet, I reccomedn you to watch the Wizard of Oz. Even though this movie stars Judy Garland as Dorthy, and not Shirley Timple. But remember Temple is still alive (as of this writing) and Judy Garland has been dead since 1969.As the movie opens, Dorothy (Judy Garland) is troubled about Miss Gulch (Margret Hamilton), becuase Miss Gulch is complaining about Dorothy's dog Toto (Terry the Dog) has been going into her garden and chacing her cat. So Miss Gulch arrives with an order to take Toto. After both Uncle Henry (Charley Grapewin) and Auntie Em (Clara Blandick) see the order, they decide not to go against the law. But Toto manges to escape and head back to Dorothy. And they both run away from home. And pays a visit to Professior Marble (Frank Morgan). Most of the actors/actress in this movie are playing more than one part, expect of Judy Garland, Charley Grapewin, Clara Blandick, etc. This is also a rare live action that don't have a PG for stuff like language and violence. And you get to hear songs like Somewhere Over the Rainbow, If I had a heart, and the song the lion sings if he was king of the forest. Plus if you buy it on dvd (and it has outakes) you can see scenes that never made it in the final movie like the jitter bug dance. That is the only outake I know of on the dvd, of course there is another dvd looks diffrent from this one that has nothing to watch like delted scenes/ottakes or the making of the movie.	5.0	One of the best movies ever!	2002-11-03	1	1	0

This is still a great family movie and it will always be one of my favorites.  And the box it came it (from Korea) is somewhat of a treasure because the kids love that it is in a different language.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3BOAJED44GPUO	Steven S Steele	If you're like me, you sometimes enjoy reading these little comments made by the consumer... Well, I can honestly say that this one right here left me speechless. It's really jarring to see this movie I've had have watched dozens of times, seem like something new and exciting all over again. Those first scenes on the farm just had me sitting there gazing at the screen with the biggest smile on my face. They really did a wonderful job on this conversion to 3D. I can't express that enough. I've seen lots of 3D movies too and this one stands out as one of my favs, to be sure. Can't wait to blow people's minds with this fantastic showpiece. I don't why I was expecting this to be in widescreen format but that was, at first, a tiny bit off-putting but I quickly got over it. The movie is 75 years old now and looks better than ever. What an accomplishment indeed! If your a Wizard of Oz lover or a 3D buff, or like me -both-, GET THIS NOW!	5.0	WOW. Breathtaking...	2014-01-22	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2B3Z2QHW3V35S	Sugga40827	Along with the movie, Wizard Of Oz, I enjoyed the special features. When I watch a movie I usually think it is just another movie. I never think of where it came from. It is always nice to hear where the story comes from. In the special features of Wizard Of Oz they talk about the director of Wizard Of Oz, Victor Fleming. But that's not all. They also talk about Frank Baum. Who wrote the Wizard Of Oz books.There is a short movie about Frank and his family's life in the special features. The movie tells you how he started the book and how supportive his family were. There is also a short black and white play that was made in 1910. Along with a color cartoon made in 1933 in the special features. I think if you are going to buy a Wizard Of Oz DVD this is the case to buy. It has a great movies in each disc.	5.0	Great Movie	2012-07-31	0	0	0

How do they make such a change.  It felt like the flowers entered our living-room.  Our adult daughter, 2 grandsons 8 and 11, my husband and I sat down together and enjoyed a evening of watching.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1K3NQAO49LXL2	"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R."""	"The movie comes with some pretty good bonuses. On Disc one there are several: there's a highly-truncated tour of an illustrated version of the book, which doesn't serve to do much other than to show how different the book and the movie are. It's nicely animated to spice things up. We are reminded that the Wicked Witch of the East wore silver (not ruby) slippers.There's an 11-minute documentary on the restoration of the film, from the original camera negative, but also with lots of preserved and archival materials, at 300 megabytes per second.A feature called ""We haven't really met properly"" gives bios of all the actors. Frank Morgan (Francis Wupperman) as The Wizard/Professor/Cabbie/Guardsman/someone else, nearly lost the role to WC Fields (that would have been interesting...). Hollywood was a small town then, and he appeared in a film with Margaret Hamilton/Miss Gulch in ""Saratoga"", and in other films, such as Tortilla Flat (oddly enough, Frank Morgan and WC Fields rented the same home, later owned by Lily Tomlin). He got several Oscar nominations. Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, almost turned the film down when they wanted him for the role of Tin Man. Great dancer with long skinny legs, ""The Hardy Girls"" in 1946 dancing with Judy Garland. Burt Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, a regular stage guy but who later did film and television. Jack Haley as the Tin Man, had been in Vaudeville and Broadway, also with Margaret Hamilton (Miss Gulch), his son later married Judy's daughter Liza Minelli. Billie Burke, as Glinda the Good Witch Of The South, was 54 years old when she acted in The Wizard Of Oz - born in 1885, she's had an interesting life, and later married a zillionaire. She'd acted with a young Judy Garland in ""Everybody Sing."" Ironically, ""Margaret Hamilton was adored by anyone who met her, especially children and little animals."" Charlie Grapewin, Uncle Henry from Kansas, made more than 100 pictures between age 60-82, including The Grapes Of Wrath and They Died With Their Boots On, and The Good Earth. Also a playwright and novelist - his first film was in 1900. Clara Blandick as Auntie Em, she had been born on an American ship in Hong Kong harbor!! Was in a 1921 comedy, Wise Girls. Toto was a terrier bitch named Terry, probably the most recognisable animal performer of all time. Was painfully shy, famed animal trainer Carl Spits drew him out. He was Spencer Tracy's pet Rainbow in the thriller Rainbow in 1936. He was also in The Women, worked with Frank Morgan in Tortilla Flat in 1942. Passed away in 1944.There's also a ""Music and effects track"", which cuts out the dialogue, and the ""Original mono track"". This is all that's on Disc One.On Disc Two, the Special Features Disc, we get ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic"" (50 minutes), ""Memories of Oz"" (27 minutes), ""The Art of Imagination: A Tribute to Oz"" (30 minutes), ""Because of the Wonderful Things It Does: The Legacy of Oz"" (25 minutes), ""Harold Arlen's Home Movies"" (five minutes), ""Outtakes and Deleted Scenes"" (14 minutes).""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic"" is a cool documentary about the movie. ""More people have seen it than any other movie - over a billion of them. It's probably the most beloved movie made in any language."" You get a glimpse of the macho Spanish version (the lion roaring), the French version (""lions and tigers and bears""), the German one (showing the witch - of course, it's German), Angela Lansbury narrates. ""Those who created this work came as close to perfection as anyone could ask"" (barf!!). ""Backstage there was confusion, chaos, and often danger."" Producer Mervyn LeRoy talked about how the budget of $2,600,000 was a lot for the time, he was nearly fired for spending so much. The three guys were sick of being full of make-up. Jack Haley hated it - hard work, not fun at all, nothing funny about it. No residuals, but immortality, the guys say on the Mike Douglas show. Directed by Jack Haley Jr, this documentary was created in the summer of 1989, the 50th birthday of the film, when Macy's ""Tap-Oz-Mania"" was the record-breaking biggest tap-dancing sensation.In 1939, Walt Disney's success with Snow White inspired Louis B Mayer to create an MGM version of such a film, hence buying the rights to Oz. LeRoy was under pressure to cast Shirley Temple for the film, thought it would be too much for her (here the filmmakers get an ironic shot of Temple saying ""there's no place like home."" Judy Garland's big voice and greater age helped her get cast over Shirley Temple. LeRoy and Mayer were convinced that this movie could make her a star. The documentary includes the voice of Judy Garland briefly talking about the film, as well as the voices of her daughters Liza Minelli and Lorna Loft talking about how their mother loved making the film.The casting of the wicked witch was controversial - they didn't want a slinky and seductive witch like what was in Snow White; because Fields had haggled endlessly over his salary as Oz, he lost it to Fank Morgan who got to play the Wizard, Professor Marvell, the Doorman, the Cabbie, and the Guard. Scenes of Bert Lahr's Vaudeville films show what a nut he was - totally off the wall. Ray Bolger angry to be cast as the Tin Man, wanted desperately to be the Scarecrow; fought with Louis B Mayer and got it. ""Recently discovered in the MGM vaults, it raises the question: how long is too long?"" Judy danced with Buddy Ebson in ""Broadway Melody"" in 1938 (there's a clip), still under contract to MGM; he was happy to be the tin man, but he had a living nightmare from the aluminum dust that coated his lungs and nearly killed him - the result was the worst personal and professional disaster he ever endured, replaced by Jack Haley, on loan from 20th Century Fox, his make-up now changed from aluminum powder to aluminum paste.The documentary tells tale of L Frank Baum, and how by 1938 over 10 million Oz books had been sold. The screenplay had 14 writers and five directors, although the screenplay was attributed to three writers. Noel Langley changed Dorothy's shoes from silver to ruby, made the hired hands the three companions of Oz, and gave Dorothy the line ""there's no place like home."" Luft and Minelli talk about Judy Garland's version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"". The Song was cut after the premiere, because it seems to slow down the film, but it is restored later (good thing too). Directors are changed; one came in, told Judy Garland to lose the curly wig and make-up, and look more like a little pig-tailed girl from Kansas (good call).Victor Fleming did most of the work on Wizard of Oz, before being called into Gone With The Wind to finish that off (!!!), so King Vidor was called in to finish The Wizard Of Oz (!!!).Over 100 little people came into MGM, ""the singer midgets"", freelancers from Vaudeville and circuses all over the land. A lady midget was given the role of the bearded coroner dude. Five weeks while costumes were made for all of the midgets, while rehearsals were done, make-up done, and all sorts of crazy make-up continuity.A whole section on the special effects of the films. The tornado was the toughest one, but it was built out of muslin that was moved around. Harold Arlan composed backstage home movies. Burt Lahr's costume was 90 pounds, but a nervous guy who was always moving, he couldn't eat anything or he'd get gas... Margaret Hamilton got burned badly by the flames when she got dropped down into the ""disappearing pit"", she had burns on her face and hands from the copper in her make-up. The munchkins were all over the place, hiding under benches, in bushes, coming down stairs... Drinkers! Working six days a week, 5:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney are at the opening of the film in New York (it's not explained why Mickey Rooney is involved). The film lost money in its first week, against stiff competition from Gone With The Wind. Bob Hope was the MC for the Oscars, a ramshackle affair compared to today's choreography.""Memories of Oz"" is yet another TV special that includes quotes by John Waters, as a cult member, talking about ""the most mainstream cult of all."" Good job synthesizing the movie into a three act structure. Daughter of Bert Lahr, Jane Lahr, giving the zeitgeist of 1939 - a cyclone approaching, a fascistic witch with her awful soldiers. Hitler at that time had been cast as the wicked witch, England was the (cowardly) lion.At that time there was state-of-the-art matte backgrounds. The sepia-coloured world changing to Technicolor was original. Many of the munchkins are interviewed, each of them in costume, lots of discussion of the Munchkin scene.""I'm the only child in the audience who always wondered why Dorothy ever wanted to go back to Kansas,"" says John Waters. `Why would she want to go back to Kansas and that dreary black-and-white farm, with an aunt who dressed badly and seemed mean to me, when she could live with winged monkeys, magic shoes, and gay lions. I never understood it."" Munchkin voices were recorded at a certain speed, perhaps unusually slow, were sped up to gain that strange texture. Nice moments interviewing choreographer Donna Massin. Great vaudeville in ""Flying High."" Cowardly Lion was a leo!! He was shy, serious, had a great sense of humour that he didn't show all the time.The ""I'll miss you most of all [Scarecrow]"" line refers to a possible sub-plot that Hunk and Dorothy were having an innocent romance, that was later jettisoned.Buddy Ebsen interviewed - ""why not give Judy a chance?"" They gave Judy a chance and she became a superstar.The munchkin actors were fascinated with Judy Garland, she was interested in them too. A great view of the Judy Garland Dorothy doll, they made hers the same as the Shirley Temple movie. There's an archivist's view of the recycling of the Wizard Of Oz movie props - the Witch's hourglass, Munchkin costumes, Mrs Gretsch's basket, Munchkin houses, the tornado. The movie didn't turn a profit until 1949.""The movies you should re-make are the bad ones, not the good ones,"" says John Waters. ""It's actually blasphemy to re-make that movie, and I would root for the failure of any production that would do so in any form!""""The Art of Imagination: A Tribute to Oz"" (30 minutes), is another documentary; it starts off talking about how in those days Louis B Mayer ruled over 180 acres of MGM city, eventually providing a bit of zeitgeist). Randy Newman, Peter Jackson, Sean Astin, Howard Shore (a different movie linked to his name each time he appears), John Dykstra.It was a fantastic gamble for MGM at the time. It was a gut-level decision. ""If I Only Had A Brain"" had been written two years earlier. ""If I only had the noive,"" a very Brooklyn accent. A lot of classical music would have been heard at the time, they used Mussorgsky in the castle, and people would have been familiar with it at that time. They had a complex system of lip synching to pre-recorded music. The cornfield backdrop was 25 ft high, and 400 ft long, painted over three weeks by 13 artists. Discussion of the ""Surrender Dorothy"" effect. Commentators often wear green to their interviews (Peter Jackson, etc). Narrated by Sydney Pollock.""Because of the Wonderful Things It Does: The Legacy of Oz"" (25 minutes) - Television catapulted it over the top in 1956, with Judy Garland's daughter and a collector, they scheduled it before Thanksgiving. They waited three years to show it again, because more than once a year was too often, after that they'd play it once a year - that was part of the magic.Celebrities like Carole Henson, of the Jim Henson company. Influences on Star Wars, with the awards ceremony, the hairy fighter, the girl and the man, the mission. Significant in ET - it's Oz in reverse, the fantastic creature comes to normalcy and dealing with normal people and finding a place home. The ruby slippers were the highest-paid item on auction when MGM emptied the archives, and they ended up in the Smithsonian institute, where they regularly have to replace the carpet in front of it because it's so heavily-viewed.""Harold Arlen's Home Movies"" is ""16mm footage [made] during the portrait sittings of the film and visits to the set"" by the film's composer. The pieces are incredibly funky - there's the cowardly lion mugging for the camera, the wicked witch of the west cackling gloriously, the scarecrow posing with his favorite crow, which at one point feeds him a piece of straw and then sits on his head, Judy Garland, the resplendent 16-year-old, the Scarecrow without his straw hat mugging with Judy, scenes in the Emerald City. Make-up people helping out on the yellow brick road, stage hands - crazy stuff!! I watched it several times, just stunning stuff!In the ""Outtakes and Deleted Scenes"" section, we get ""If I Only Had A Brain"", ""If I Only Had A Heart"", ""Triumphal Return to Emerald City"", ""Over The Rainbow"", and ""The Jitterbug"". There was a deleted dance to ""If I Only Had A Brain"", where there's a wonderful extended bit that was cut because the studio thought the film was getting too long, where the scarecrow finds a piece of his straw stuffing that a crow flew off with, he flies through the air, does the splits, Toto rolls over a pumpkin that rolls through his legs and knocks him in the air, he bounces off of the rubberized fences, runs off in reverse - it's nutty (and the best thing on either disc!!!!!). Buddy Ebson fell ill to aluminum poisoning, but they run a track of how Buddy Ebsen pre-recorded the song, and there are stills of him doing the scenes, as well as dressed up as Winky guards. The ""Triumphal Return to Emerald City"" had different sounds, and a huge choral sequence that has been lost, but from which stills remain. A reprise of ""Over The Rainbow"" was to appear when a tearful and scared Judy Garland was locked in the witch's castle, sobbing and now clearly regretting ever wishing she had once wanted to be far from Kansas (over the rainbow is now, ironically, meant to be Kansas). Recorded live on the set with piano accompaniment (orchestra was to be added later). Covered by stills and test frames only. ""I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!!"" ""The Jitterbug"" number was a huge production that was cut from the movie after the first preview, despite taking five weeks to prepare and ""tens of thousands of dollars to prepare, rehearse and film""; the jitterbug was a creature that had been under orders from the wicked witch to sting actors and ""sends them into a jivey swing dance in the haunted forest."" We only see movies Harold Arland made during a camera rehearsal, with also stills of the stars. Basically, it's a musical number never heard in the original film!! Arland's shots of the rehearsals look like they were taken clandestinely, who knows why, and we only see the stars from between the rubbery horror-trees, manipulated as they were by stage hands. Nice.There are some great shots of the Wicked Witch of the West mugging for the camera from those silent home movies. A real treasure."	5.0	It doesn't get better than this...	2013-06-08	3	2	1

The annual showing of THE WIZARD OF OZ in those pre video days was an eagerly anticipated event for kids that was discussed for days before and after even by jaded fifth and sixth graders.  I recently watched the film again with my own  child and was amazed by how well the story and the whole production holds up.  The film has much to offer still in terms of memorable songs and characters and it is so fun to find the humdrum citizens of Dust Bowl Kansas having fantasy counterparts in surreal OZ.  No wonder this movie is and will remain a film legend.	5.0	There's no place like Oz, There's no place like Oz...........	2007-06-11	1	1	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6	Suzanne	"ON THE DVD:The film itself doesn't really need reviewing, and yet the bulk of this monstrous review is dedicated to it. I'll admit my own personal selfishness and a desire for catharsis that lead me to write so much; but hopefully those who love Oz will find it a worthy tribute. The real question is about the new discs themselves; available in no less than 3 editions (6 if you count the blu-ray / standard as separate) in 2 and 3 disc sets as well as a 70th Anniversary Box set; which is the one I bought. All I really need to say is that this is the kind of treatment the film deserves. Others have already provided a thorough account of the box's contents and the extras; I especially commend William Sommerwerck for his detailed review on the quality of the image transfer, the blu-ray/standard disc comparison and his review of the extras. Really, the box is a seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove that's as gorgeous to look at as it is fun to dig through and use. The 3 discs themselves have hours and hours of extras; none of which I've experienced yet besides the excellent commentary for the film. The bottom line is that if you're a huge fan of the film, buy the box set now before supplies run out; I got set #242,200 of 243,000. If you don't want to invest in the whole shebang, the 3-disc Emerald set has the same DVD features without all of the extras like the huge, beautiful booklet, the watch, the production packet and notes, etc.ON THE FILM:Ultimately, this review will have to be less of a review and more of a celebratory ode to one of my absolute favorite films; currently #7 on my Top 200 list. How does one review a work of art that has been an integral part of their life since their earliest memories of childhood? I vividly remember my early viewings of the film which I shared with my cousin. First on TV, then on VHS recorded from TV. Over and over again. We memorized every song, every line, every background musical queue. When I got older and my mom took me to school we would walk part of the way singing ""We're Off to See the Wizard"". My cousin and I would put on plays of it for our family. My mom could entertain us for ages with her ""If I Were King of the Forest"" impersonation. And I get the sense that I am far from alone in my experiences of the film being one of those indelible parts of my life. Indeed, it seems that The Wizard of Oz is less a film that belongs to cinema and more a work of art that belongs to American mythology. Like all great mythology it works on the simplest of levels; with age-old archetypes and themes. If one were to distill them from the film itself it would appear little more than a cliche. But the beauty of The Wizard of Oz, like all mythologies, isn't the simplistic truths expressed through it, but the unforgettable way in which they're expressed. In truth, The Wizard of Oz almost perfectly follows what Joseph Campbell termed the monomyth; starting with the familiar, lead by some call to adventure, advancing to the realm of the unknown by a supernatural force, there encountering mentors and helpers, facing the evil the world has, vanquishing it, and returning home with the gift one achieved there. It's even complete with the magical item MacGuffin in the form of the Ruby Slippers.But Oz is infinitely more than some archetypal structure. Ultimately, form is only as effective as what an artist chooses to fill it with, and I would argue it has rarely ever been filled as brilliantly as in Oz. Oz's production is so magnificent, so grand, so majestic, so startlingly beautiful that I can only feel humbled and grateful that we now have the chance to see it in such a pristine print on high-definition blu-ray. For my money, no film has ever topped the art direction and production of Oz; not from the first frame to the last. To call it perfect would almost belie what a visual feast it is. There are fewer films, if any, that show off the kind of overwhelming magic the Hollywood studio system once possessed. How does one possibly pick a favorite set-piece? The sepia hues of the opening Kansas section seems to perfectly evoke the dusty earth and wood feelings of rural Kansas; turning it - if not supplanting itself completely - into one's imaginations of such a place. But it's truly the emergence into Oz and the Munchkin city itself that provides one of the most magical, mythical moments in all of cinema, as Dorothy opens the door and steps into not just a world of color, but a world of glorious Technicolor. It's transcendental cinema if not for the least of reasons because it's done entirely through visuals with only the slightest of musical queues; though, of course, perfectly punctuated by the ""I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore"" line. Munchkin city is the kind of design that one could stare at for hours analyzing every edge of the frame and never exhaust the innumerous visual detail and complexity. It's the kind of set that modern screenwriters have forgotten how to conceive, or film-makers forgotten how to create. It's one of those eternal art creations that I don't suspect will ever lose its power and charm.But the brilliance is hardly limited to the Munchkin City. The somewhat sparseness of the first Scarecrow scene allows for ample room for the characters to play freely in. From there we begin advancing into the edge of the forest where the Tin Man resides. I always loved this set if only because I always wondered who lived in the house that the Wicked Witch appears on. The set is punctuated by a cornucopia of various exotic birds inhabiting the trees; many of which really stick out now thanks to the clarity of blu-ray. In fact, that clarity helps to debunk one of the famous myths that a blurry shape in the background was a disgruntled munchkin actor who hung himself, but one can clearly see now it's just another bird. Those talking trees were a wonderful, if even minor addition to the section. I love the subtle change as we move into the realm of the Cowardly Lion; now in the deep, dark part of the forest. In both section the range and richness of the greens and blues are a supreme treat for the eye. Then there's the Emerald City. Unlike the rainbow-themed Munchkin City, Emerald City is, of course, based around the color green. It was actually built on the studio's largest soundstage and the film appropriately utilizes the enormous space of the set; filling it to the brim with extras and design nuances. The foreboding hall that leads to the Wizard and the Wizard's throne room itself were two of the sets that really frightened me as a child; and, indeed, the efficacy of the special effect floating head still hasn't lost its potency. The Witch's castle is appropriately dark, grey, gothic, and creepy. But even there one can admire the attention to detail such as the shimmering river far below the parapets, and the ominous textures of the stone walls.Beyond the physical sets it's easy to miss or ignore the stunning works of art that are those matte paintings. They're brilliant because Warren Newcombe treated them as legitimate works of art done on a grand scale. Even if one can look at them now and spot where the set stops and the painting begins, they are so magnificent that it's nearly impossible to criticize it for any artificiality. The level of detail is astounding as they seem to stretch the set out into the infinity of the Land of Oz. One wonders if Welles' innovative use of mattes in Kane would've been possible without this film. But if Oz is a masterpiece it is so because that kind of attention to detail, artistry, and craftsmanship was applied to every possible level. The special effects by Buddy Gillespie were revolutionary; with the pinnacle being ""the twister"" that had to be shot separately, but was so effective it scared children and was even reused years later in Minnelli's Cabin in the Sky. The costumes and makeup were equally accomplished, especially considering that there were almost no elaborate makeup specialists back then like there are today. It certainly had to be one of the first films that begun the trend of actors sitting for hours upon actors just to get their costumes and makeup applied. The costumes were even more elaborate; the Lion's being made of real lion fur, weighing around 90lbs. and the Tin Man not being much lighter and even stiffer. One also has to consider that the film was shot on ASA 5 speed film, which is EXTREMELY slow (it's not uncommon to shoot in ASA 400 today) but was used because it could capture the detail and beauty of the production in deep focus. But in order to make low speed work they had to use extremely high output lights that heated up the set considerably and the actors had to suffer (and still act and perform!) under those costumes and heat. Top it all off with a camera that weighed a fourth of a ton and one gets an appreciation for what a technical marvel the film is.Capturing the production genius was one of Hollywood's master craftsman directors in Victor Fleming. It's amazing that when one considers how many films he made that he's primarily only remembered for two; The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Both were made the same year, and both were two of the earliest uses of Technicolor in a grand, big-budgeted production. Fleming was known as a master at saving troubled films and, indeed, both Oz and Wind were two infamously troubled productions which he (arguably) saved. Richard Thorpe was originally assigned to direct, but when Buddy Epson quit and shooting halted, Mervyn LeRoy (the producer; and a fine director himself) reviewed the shot footage and thought Thorpe was rushing the production with negative results. So George Cukor was called into direct. But Cukor was never able to shoot anything because of his prior commitment to do Gone With the Wind. Although we can thank Cukor for the eminently improved look of Garland's Dorothy (anyone who's seen production stills from before Cukor's arrival will undoubtedly agree). Fleming did the bulk of the shooting, though when he left to take over Gone With the Wind from Cukor, King Vidor was called in to finish shooting the sepia-toned Kansas scenes. Despite the turbulent history of directors, the film seems uniformly and superbly directed. There's nary a wayward shot (much less scene) in the entire film. It thoroughly showcases Classic Hollywood's mastery of economy in which there are no superfluous scenes, shots, or cuts. If one were to find any criticism with the film it would only be that it was too judiciously edited to conform to typical 1939 film lengths.Missing the cut were two musical sequences; A jitterbug that was to take place when Dorothy and her companions reach the forest before the Wicked Witch's Castle, which doesn't seem like much of a loss given how it would've conflicted with the dramatic tone. The other was a reprise of ""The Witch is Dead"" done by her Winkie Guards as ""Hail, Hail! the Witch is Dead"". But there are two scenes particularly missed. One was an early scene in which Hickory shows Dorothy a machine he's built that's supposed to ward off storms, but it only needs ""a heart"" to work. This was meant to be his Tin Man character foreshadowing, the same way in which Bolger's Hunk had his (""Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all."") and Lahr's Zeke had his (""She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage, that's all.""). It's an effect that I, for one, really miss. The other was an extended take of ""If I Only Had a Brain"" featuring a marvelously choreographed dance by Bolger that has him bouncing off the wooden fences near the cornfields like ropes in a wrestling ring. Not to mention a wayward pumpkin that tosses him sky high. It was cut for pacing and length, but it's really these two scenes that prompts one to ask: ""How long is too long?""The writing was as fraught with problems (or, at least, complexities) as the direction; primarily adapted by Noel Langley but with contributions from a long list of names. But much like the direction, the writing doesn't seem to suffer any holes or gaps that often plague screenplays that has so many helping hands. It's a film full of sparkling dialogue that is never ostentatious. Of course, it's right up there with the most quoted films of all times, though through the years I've come to admire the smallest moments that are rarely mentioned, such as Uncle Henry's short exchange with Elmira Gulch:UNCLE HENRY: ""Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?""MISS GULCH: ""What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!""UNCLE HENRY: ""You mean she bit you?""MISS GULCH: ""No, her dog!""UNCLE HENRY: ""Oh, she bit her dog, eh?""The touches of comedy like this are always superbly executed. But perhaps the aspect that should be most highly praised is the attention to character detail. Unlike modern films, there aren't any words that were put to page only because they were cool. One of the brilliant touches of the screenplay was to utilize the same three actors for Scarecrow, Lion, and Tin Man for Hunk, Zeke, and Hickory; the farmhands at the beginning of the film, giving their appearances later in Oz a deeper relevance. In fact, Oz must be one of the first films in which a characters real life experiences manifests itself in a different form inside their dream; one of the film's many innovations. It's also that structure that manages to deepen the impact of the themes of finding the courage, wisdom, and heart to face life and all its hardships and trials; because if Dorothy, in fact, never actually left home and visited Oz, then it's very true that all of those things were in her to begin with.Oz is also one of the extremely rare musicals that somehow makes me forget that it actually IS a musical. Musicals are not a genre I'm naturally drawn to, but the best like Singin' in the Rain and those by Robert Wise, George Cukor, and Vincente Minnelli work because of their cinematic quality. Indeed, no musical has the pervasive cinematic quality of Oz, but even without it the music could stand alone. Freed actually took a gamble in hiring the team who produced the songs (Harold Arlen and EY Harburg) and music (Herbeert Stolhart). Arlen and Harburg's style of mixing spoken dialogue in music and sophisticated, complex uses of linguistics (""If ever, oh, ever a Wiz there was the Wizard of Oz is one because.""), counterpoint and variations was thought to be box office poison, but we can all be thankful that Freed's risk paid off. I doubt I could say a thing of fresh relevance about their greatest achievement, ""(Somewhere) Over the Rainbow"", that hasn't already been said. The miracle is that it made it into the film at all and only did because Arthur Freed fought for it to stay when others felt it slowed the film down. Now, after being named the #1 Song of the Century by RIAA, The #1 film song of all time by the AFI, and has become one of the most recorded and covered songs in history Freed's fight to keep it in seems like one of the greatest battles ever won. The song and scene is one of the few that King Vidor filmed, and instead of using a static camera - as was traditional in early movie musicals - he gently swayed the camera to Garland's movement; perhaps prefiguring the rapturous, gliding, movement and dance of Singin' in the Rain. But it provides just the right amount of dynamicism without imposing itself onto the scene. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the song is that no matter how familiar it becomes, no matter how eternal and immortal it is, no matter how many times it appears #1 on various song lists, it is ultimately a personal and poignant piece of work that captures something so timeless and ephemeral that's ineffable.  Shakespeare once wrote that ""We are such stuff as dreams are made on"", but he could just as easily have been talking about Over the Rainbow. It's a song that seems to capture man's eternal and wistful dreaming of a better life in far off dreamlands through a combination of the most simple melodies and lyrics.In contrast, the songs in Oz are full of a joyous, jovial, bursting spirit and vitality that seem to fulfill the plaintive longing of Rainbow. From the gentleness of ""Come Out, Come Out"" sung by the angelic Glinda to awaken and alert the munchkins onward. The medley of ""It Really Was No Miracle"" and ""We Thank You Very Sweetly"" leads to one of the unforgettable numbers in ""Ding Dong the Witch is Dead"". It's one of those roaring chorus pieces that's still fun to howl along with; aided tremendously by it showcasing the production of The Munchkin City. It's interrupted by the cute ""As Mayor of the Munchkin City"" and ""As Coroner, I must Aver"", and then reprised and followed by the short and memorable ""Lullaby League"" and ""Lollipop Guild"" sections which seem to echo a kind of balletic interlude in opera. ""Follow the Yellow Brick Road"" was inserted as a transition piece to ""You're Off to See the Wizard"", which, of course, gets 3 reprises when Dorothy meets The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion (all choreographed slightly differently). ""If I Only Had a Brain / a Heart / the Nerve"" is the superb echoing trio delivered by the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion; with Brain arguably being the best of them. Optimistic Voices is the short, ethereal piece we hear at the end of the Poppy Fields right before we reach the Emerald City. ""The Merry Old Land of Oz"" is The Emerald City's answer to the Munchkin City Medley and it's just as effective. Like its predecessor it's superbly aided by the outstanding production which gets to really show itself off. ""If I Were King of the Forest"" is the last musical number (two others were cut) and is delivered with masterful comic timing and affectation by Bert Lahr.But for all the musical, writing, design and directorial genius, the film would've failed without its supreme cast, and one has to dedicate the appropriate time and space to them. Ray Bolger famously fought for the role of the Scarecrow, eventually winning it from the original choice which was Buddy Epson. Epson was then scheduled to play The Tin Man but contracted poisoning from the makeup and was forced to resign the part. Bolger himself said that the reason he wanted Scarecrow so badly is because he felt only he could perform the actions and routines mimicking the brainlessness of Scarecrow that fit the character so well. Indeed, it's hard to imagine another performer playing the role and playing it as if he was in full control. Jack Haley was eventually given the role of the Tin Man; perhaps the most overlooked and underappreciated of the trio. It's a tough role because by design the character's mobility is limited so he lacks the kinetic quality of Bolger's Scarecrow or Lahr's Lion. Yet I remember him being my favorite as a child if only because he had an axe. These many years later I find a deeper appreciation for his performances, because he is constantly doing more with less. Bert Lahr often gets the most acclaim for his role as The Cowardly Lion, and not undeservedly so. Lahr said that he brought everything from his background training in theater and vaudeville to the part, and from his entrance until the end his performance is a tour-de-force, but a rather nuanced one. With Lahr there's a constant play between his physical and vocal acting that's phenomenal; only he could've pulled off the If I Were King song and made it so hilarious a parody. We can be thankful the film broke the rule of ""never work with children or animals"" as Toto may be the most famous mascot ever. But equally so because there are few animals that are as amazing an actor as Terry the Dog as Toto. It's amusing to just sit and watch the film totally paying attention to her (yes, Toto is a girl) actions and reactions on screen. Frank Morgan was inspired casting in a quintuple role as Professor Marvel, the Doorman, The Cabbie, the Wizard's Guard, and, finally, the Wizard himself. He offers the kind of witty, wise, and warm personality that fits right into the tone of the film and he manages to shine in every scene he's in despite being surrounded by a cast that seems to cast an incandescent glow across the screen.I imagine most every child can testify to the effectiveness of Margaret Hamilton as Elmira Gulch and The Wicked Witch of the West. Truly one of the most terrifying performances ever captured on film in what was, essentially, a children's film. In fact, she was so scary that during editing her part suffered the most because the producers were worried about frightening children TOO much. If the Wicked Witch didn't do the trick then there was the nightmare inducing flying monkeys. Though for me, The Witch's Winkie Guards were even scarrier; perhaps because of that unidentifiable but threatening chant of ""Oh-ee-oh"". Billie Burke is an enchanting Glinda. Even though the character was originally intended to be much younger, Burke brings the kind of intelligence to the part that only an older actor could, and yet she appears ageless more so than aged. Charles Grapewin as Uncle Henry and Clara Blandick as Auntie Em bring an earthy rightness to both parts. Both are utterly believable as such rural, farm owners and guardians to Dorothy. Speaking of Dorothy Gale, with her we have the perfect representation of a Midwestern, Kansas farmgirl who dreams of that magical place over the rainbow that so many people can't even think of without tearing up (myself included). Judy Garland was always Mervyn LeRoy's first choice for Dorothy, and perhaps it's only from the perspective of familiarity that one can say such a thing, but it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Many members of the cast have testified as to her brilliance and humanity, some going as far as to say that without her, the film - for all its other greatnesses - would've failed. There's an innocence and plainness to Garland that I think is eternally relatable; especially from those who find themselves in a very similar situation. I may not have grown up on a farm, but the suburbs of Oklahoma sometimes don't seem that far removed from the farmlands of Kansas. One marvelous anecdote was the day in which she brought a huge box of chocolates and shared it with the entire munchkin cast that numbered into the hundreds. It's that true-to-life element that Garland brought to the film that shines through in her performance from beginning to end. Despite the film's pervasive magic, it's truly Garland's Dorothy that holds it all together and whisks us believably into the most unbelievable of adventures.Oz is less of a film and more of a fully realized other world we step into; one that's both startling because of its warmly inviting familiarity and inexhaustibly, rich alien fantasy. It's beauty, poignancy, and profundity isn't something that can't be reviewed or analyzed or deconstructed or expressed logically; and that's a statement that I reserve for the rarest works of art, as I'm a believer in that if it can be felt or experienced it CAN be expressed in words. It is something that remains eternally pure and innocent, and perhaps it's those qualities that continue to touch audiences. It's a work like fine wine that only gets richer with age. It's a work that means much more to me now than it ever did as a child or teenager. It's a work that bursting at the seams with imagination, magic, vitality, and this effervescent and omni-illuminating light that I suspect emanates from the brilliance of every aspect of the production; from the design to the characters and cast to the music. There are very few works of art, much less films, that I would say this about, but I genuinely feel that those who don't like it or (unthinkably) never get to experience Oz are missing one of the greatest gifts life has to offer; and it really joins Shakespeare, War & Peace, the music of The Beatles, Mozart and Beethoven and a handful of others on the tremendously short lists of artists and works I've ever thought or said that about. It's had an incalculable influence on American culture; finding its way into the most diverse of arenas. But it's really its penetration into the hearts and minds of countless people that makes it such a treasure. To borrow a line from the commentary, which itself borrowed a line from the film, ""If a heart is measured not by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others, then surely The Wizard of Oz is the most beloved film ever""."	5.0	My Ode to the Immortal Magic of Oz	2010-03-01	11	9	2

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A37NL9EDUT23IV	"takemehome ""Joey"""	"Over the last few years, Warner Bros. has raised the bar for DVD treatments of classic films from their studio as well as MGM and RKO films owned by Turner Entertainment. In 2004, Warner Bros. released a 4-Disc Collector's Edition of Gone With The Wind, raising the bar even for themselves, as well as other studios. While some studios have failed to meet the high standards, Warner Bros. outdid themselves in 2005 with their two DVD reissues of The Wizard of Oz. When they announced the release of the 3-disc DVD, I became so excited for this DVD release. This movie makes me SO happy, and I thought it was time that it got a set like this.If you don't want to spend all this money for this deluxe box set, the 2-Disc Special Edition is also a wonderful option. Although you lose the third disc, which we'll discuss in just a minute, and the wonderful print extras, if those don't matter much to you, it won't matter. All of the other wonderful bonuses from discs 1 and 2 are still there as well as the new pristine restoration.However, I would now like to discuss the content of this beautiful 3-disc set.Packaged in a gorgeous digipack with a slipcase holding the digipack and the two folders of print extras, you already know just by looking at the package that this will be a wonderful set.Disc 1 contains the set's centerpiece - the movie, newly restored to pristine clear perfection in Warner Bros. revolutionary Ultra Resolution process. First, all color records are scanned at a high resolution and perfectly aligned for the clearest image ever. Then, one frame at a time, dirt, scratches, film tears, etc. are removed. Finally, color correction is done to make sure the colors pop out at you, but aren't overly saturated. The result is the best video edition EVER of Oz. Details are brought out like never before. Also included are featurettes on the cast, restoration, as well as a wonderful audio commentary. Unlike the boring commentary on GWTW, Oz's commentary is exciting and informative.Disc 2 contains the main bonus features, most of which are ported over from Warner's 1999 single-disc DVD, and this is the disc that delves into the making of the movie. The main bonus feature is the 1990 making-of documentary ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" which really goes in depth into the making of the movie. Most Oz fans have seen this already, so I need not talk about it in detail. Also from the 1999 DVD are the trailers, stills galleries, audio vault, (Although a new addition is in the audio vault - the Christmas Day 1950 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast, with Judy Garland as Dorothy.) short films from the vault, special effects tests, Harold Arlen's home movies, and outtakes. Three new featurettes are included - a TCM documentary featuring filmmakers, surviving cast members, and many others, titled ""Memories Of Oz,"" where these people reminisce about making the movie, their feelings about the movie, etc. The second featurette is called ""The Art Of Imagination."" More filmmakers talk about the technical aspects of the making of the film and how it influenced the way they make movies. Finally, ""Because Of The Wonderful Things It Does,"" narrated by Brittany Murphy and featuring interviews with authors, filmmakers, and others, discusses how The Wizard of Oz has made an impact on our culture. These new featurettes are a WONDERFUL new way to delve into the world of Oz.Exclusive to this set, the third disc salutes L. Frank Baum, the man who penned the original 14 Oz books. A new documentary, ""The Man Behind The Curtain,"" discusses his life. Then, we are treated to 4 full-length silent film versions and one 1933 musical color cartoon version of Oz. The silent films are in fairly good condition, with the 1925 version featuring Oliver Hardy given a good cleanup, color tinting, and a new score. It is also possible that this was the inspiration for the farm hands becoming Dorothy's Oz friends in thr 1939 movie. The cartoon has seen better days, but it shows where the inspiration for filming Kansas in black-and-white and Oz in color may have come from, and all in all, it's a cute cartoon.The bonus material doesn't stop with the DVDs. Also inclued are two folders of print extras. One contains ten beautiful glossy reproduction of Kodachrome publicity portraits and on-set photos. And the other contains a glossy page with posters, premiere invitation and ticket reproductions, the premiere program, MGM Studio News, and Photoplay Studies. These gorgeous reproductions truly make this box set a real treat for big Oz fans.In conclusion, if you are a fan of The Wizard Of Oz, the 2-Disc Special Edition is a wonderful DVD. If you're hardcore enough to buy this 3-Disc set, go for it! In my opinion, this is the best DVD ever made, and Warner Bros. has set a new high standard for themselves and other studios for DVD releases. Now, if the studios can meet these standards is another story."	5.0	Quite possibly the best DVD ever released.	2006-01-30	23	23	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3EX36SNRYD5VL	"TammyJo Eckhart ""TammyJo Eckhart"""	When I was a little girl, I used to scream when the witch shows up in a cloud of green spoke.  I got over that as the television networks played the film over and over again for about the first 15 years of my life.  Now you very very rarely see it on tv so if you want to introduce your child to Oz or watch it yourself, you'll have to buy it or rent it to do so.  I'm sure you've heard that the cast we see in the film is not the intended cast and yet it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing these roles.  Most of the music you know but if you watch it again you'll note some clever theme work throughout the film.  Let's hope they never colorize this -- that is part of the artistry of  the film itself.	5.0	Set aside modern expectations and just enjoy a classic	2002-09-05	0	0	0

Each new medium has been used to its own full potential. The Blu-ray includes ALL the bonus Features ever made for this version. Thanks to the restoration ""The Hanging Munchkin"" story will be around for at least another decade. I could see why people thought the BIRD was a hanging Munchkin.

Most agree this film is one of the best and its legacy will last forever. ""The Wizard of Oz"" has never aged in terms of movie making, and the fact that it is now over 70 years old and still appeals to a whole new generation speaks volumes as to the kind of movie it is.The film, as most know, is about a Kansas City farm girl named Dorothy who dreams of being swept away during a hurricane to a magical kingdom filled with creatures like the Munchkins, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow, and two witches, one being good, the other being evil. She is told by the good witch to follow the yellow brick road and to contact the Wizard of this magical kingdom in her quest of returning homeThe film, thanks in large part, to numerous television airings, has a remarkable following that has lead to huge sales in the home video and DVD market. Bonuses on most ""Wizard of Oz"" releases include trailers, commentary, still galleries, collectible cards, documentaries, and beautiful restored audio and video quality. No ones DVD or Blueray collection is complete without this masterpiece.The song ""Over the Rainbow"" became identified with Judy Garland and won the Academy Award as Best Song of 1939."	5.0	"""OUTSTANDING"""	2010-04-13	0	0	0

This is a movie that I would place among my top 5 favorite movies as it brings L.Frank Baum's story to life. The entire movie from beginning to end is a real masterpiece, and it is one that, when you see it for the first time you will want to see it again. The song, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is one of the highlights of the movie. This movie made Judy Garland a favorite star of MGM. The special effects, such as the fire and the red cloud of smoke when the wicked witch enters the scene and when she exits, and the Gale farmhouse that is caught up in the cyclone, and most of all, the face of the Wizard with fire shooting up from both sides and the sound of his voice, these were done very well. One very special scene in the movie is the dance of the Tin Man. The whispering between Dorothy and the Scarecrow and the reactions they make and the music of the orchestra playing in the background is well done and memorable.

The sepia-toned parts have a crisp, well defined picture. The soundtrack is clear, easy to understand. The extras are extraordinary! If I had to make one complaint, it would be that the picture is too clear and the film starts to lose some of that &#34;Movie Magic&#34;, meaning that you can tell the foliage on the set is plastic, make up running, etc. But overall a fantastic presentation of this classic film.

I'm not going to review the movie cuz it's very well known and universally loved.  But the Blu-Ray edition is well worth getting if you love the film.  The image quality is superb; rich darks, increased tonal range, techni-color opulence and wonderful crisp details.  This is especially apparent when you compare the Blu-Ray to the DVD.  I noticed all these little details that I never had noticed before:  the ornate sculpted stand for the witch's crystal ball, the multiple shades of tan in the Lion's face make-up, the warm-colored lights on the real Wizard's control panel for the fake wizard, and even - unfortunately - the witch's seemingly green-paper fingernails and the Wizard's wig line!I've seen this film many many times, and even after that, I heartily enjoyed seeing it on Blu-Ray.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ADB8XCKNSDY5Z	theboombody	You won't find anything more classic than this.  A fairytale musical that everyone knows every line of.  Every single character is embedded into our culture, and for good reason.  This is a high quality work.  Top-notch.  Can't do a better job than this.What makes it so high quality is that instead of focusing on being as realistic as possible, like with today's films, it focues on looking as good as possible.  So what if the cowardly lion's costume is obviously a costume?  It looks great.  The same can be said about the scarecrow and tin man.  This is a fantasy world.  It doesn't have to look realistic.  But it DOES have to look good, and fortunately the people who were responsible for this movie knew it.Stories as unique as this are just so rare.  It's no wonder this was made into a movie.  Thank goodness it was made into a good movie.  Everything about it is fantastic, from the songs, to the sets.  For 1939, this was pretty dog gone amazing.  The color is beautiful today, so I can't imagine how good it must have looked back then.Only the Bible could outlast something like this.

"As a celebration of the fact The Curmudgeon reached 50 reviews slating the worst of the worst, the baddest of the bad, I thought I would do something a little different and review 5 things that The Curmudgeon actually LIKES. Well, it's either that or I review King Kong Lives - you choose.Anyway, ""likes"" is a vast, vast understatement when you're talking about THIS movie. Quite simply one of the greatest movies of all time, a timeless, magical, eternally charming masterpiece that hasn't aged one bit. I haven't bought this new version yet (I have the original SE release) but from what I've read the picture quality has been fully restored so that it looks brand new (so clear and crisp you can see a previously un-noticable chip in the Tin Man's nose - THAT good quality).The original SE was good enough, but this three disc(!) gem looks to have everything you could ever want to know about the movie (as well as some shorts and other old movies about Oz - all of them MUST sees for The Curmudgeon).But let's talk about the film. There probably isn't anything to say that hasn't been said about The Wizard Of Oz, but it really can melt the hardest heart (well, look at me, for one). It's still funny, the effects are still great, the songs are still brilliant, the acting is just absolutley spot-on.. they really DON'T make them like this anymore.The Curmudgeon has yet to father an heir, but when he/she is old enough to, like, remember stuff, you can bet I'll be plonking them down in front of the TV and showing them this.A brilliant movie, a brilliant DVD release.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A31ACI0E88ORDE	The Great White Father	"That is really the theme of the movie, ""There's no place like home"": I would only sully it by being more verbose than that.I'm not even going to bother with a proper review this time, as this movie practically is its own review.  All I will really say is how I would have improved upon it--but even though I think these should have been the case with the movie, not just that they would be improvements but that the movie needed these, what they left in is just so right that I feel it would be an injustice to knock off even a single whole star for this.  But if I were to improve upon this film, here is how I would do it:1) Put back the deleted scene of Dorothy talking to the farm hand Hickory, played by ""Tin Man"" Jack Haley (didn't you wonder why she only spoke to Hunk (""Scarecrow"") and Zeke (""Cowardly Lion"")?2) Cut down the ""Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead"" segment in Munchkinland--don't cut it out entirely but it's too long.  Aside from the fact that some deleted scenes could more easily have been kept in if this had been cut short, and the fact that we meet several Munchkin characters we're never going to see again (the mayor, the coroner, the Lullaby League, the Lollipop Guild)--aside from that, we never saw the Munchkins under the tyranny of the Wicked Witch of the East, we're only told about it, so we cannot share in their joy at their newfound freedom.  (This gets into a later change I would make.)3) Cut out ""If I Were King of the Forest"".  That is the only real ""showstopping number"" in the whole movie, and any sentiment in it should have been in ""If I Only Had the Nerve"", if anywhere--besides, the Scarecrow and Tin Man don't get similar songs, why should the Cowardly Lion?  Its only purpose is to give the characters something to do while the guard is announcing their presence to the Wizard.4) Put back the deleted reprise of ""Over the Rainbow"" sung by Dorothy as she's trapped in the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West.  This performance made the crew cry, and they cut it out!  Besides, it's harder to appreciate Dorothy's learning the lesson she sums up at the end of the film without this mirroring of the original rendition which she sang in Kansas at the beginning.5) Put back the deleted reprise of ""Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead"".  Originally this would have been in Winkie Country after the melting of the Wicked Witch of the West, and it was going to move on into a triumphant procession back to Emerald City.  Here, we have seen the Winkies under the tyranny of the Wicked Witch of the West, and so we can share in their joy at their newfound freedom--combined with the victory of Dorothy and her friends in acquiring the broomstick.  An important emotional tone of triumph and joy is lost with the mere fade we get in the finished film.6) Finally, put back the deleted line about Miss Gulch dying in the twister.  Without that there is no closure to the whole Kansas plot, and the sadistic choice Miss Gulch gave to Dorothy's family: give up Toto to be destroyed or lose their whole farm.  Without that one line, for all anyone knows to the contrary, that sadistic choice is still up in the air and so it's harder to truly appreciate the happy ending.  Besides, Miss Gulch is played by the same actress as the Wicked Witch of the West and we know she's dead--well?That's it: other than that, the only real concern is one line that (in the finished film) nothing comes of: the Wicked Witch of the West tells her flying monkeys that Dorothy and friends won't give them any trouble, as ""I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.""  While that line is pointless without context (and the only real way to fix it would be to redo the whole scene without that line, impossible now), it's a good thing they didn't leave the context in: it was the song ""The Jitterbug"".  That was cut out because they reasoned (rightly) that it would date the film (who dances the Jitterbug nowadays?)--and in any case it was another showstopping number, and one that is completely wrong for the tone that scene required.  But especially given this, I'm willing to take what we have.Otherwise, though, the movie is practically perfect in every way (whoops, wrong movie).  If I could give it 4 3/4 stars or higher (while still short of the full five), I would, in order to take into account the above problems--but because that would be all I dare take off, and because what we're left with is so right, I feel no shame in rounding up instead of down, to a full five star review.God bless!"	5.0	There's No Place Like Home	2013-11-25	8	3	5
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A37KG5HXY9VWPW	"THE KING OF PANGAEA ""THE KING"""	Upon viewing a second time this played just fine.  Something glitchy with my Oppo 95 on the original viewing,  Replayed a couple of days ago 12-4-13 on both Sony and Oppo players and this looked fine.  I must retract the original review originally posted below over a year ago.I don't know about the other reviewer's copies, but my single disc blu ray from Amazon is poor indeed.  There is a flickering/jerking  quality to the whole movie which is quite distracting, trashing the whole viewing experience.  I don't know what happened here, but this is not good.  Average detailed resolution, jerky, distracting picture.  I haven't seen anything else like it.  The effect is what you'd get shooting film at 20 fps, or thereabouts, slightly jerky, but not quite as much as old silent films.  Be warned on this disc.  For the single disc version only.	4.0	REVISED OPINION	2012-04-03	10	3	7

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3AUECYM0M0YSX	The Man in the Hathaway Shirt	"(Note: the following is a review of the single-disc Warner DVD in the cardboard case. There are several other DVD editions of this movie, and this review is not meant to cover any of them.)In a way, a movie review almost seems unncessary: it's a perennial classic, made during the golden days of Hollywood, blah-blah-blah.  Yet I've never connected with this film very strongly, although I'm amazed by it more every time I watch it.  The main problem for me is the heroine is too whiny.  Yes, I know females, especially young farm girls from Kansas, did not behave like Jennifer Garner back in the 1930s.  Still, after a while the whimpering gets to be too much, and I feel there could have been a *little* more assertiveness, spunk, and initiative in Dorothy.  Perhaps she could have begun the journey timid but discovered a stronger inner self while in Oz, so that she became more proactive at the end.  Even the witch she kills accidentally, and is apologetic for it.  Today in movies the main star does everything, has all the moves.  In this film everything mainly happens to her, as she cowers and cries she wants to go home.Much more interesting are the secondary characters--Bolger, Lahr and Haley are perfectly cast, and win hearts instantly.  I really cared a lot more about them than Dorothy.  (Bolger was once asked how he felt about being remembered basically for one role in his career.  His very mature response was that most people never get famous for even one thing, so he was flattered.)  Also marvelous was Frank Morgan as The Wiz, and yes, that story about his thift-store coat once belonging to L. Frank Baum himself is true, it turns out.Then there's the spectacle of Oz itself.  This film was very much the Star Wars or 2001 of its day, with effects that taxed the actors and technicians, and stretched the technologies of the time.  Such simple moments as the horse in Oz changing color in each shot are impressive and hard to figure out even today.  The tricks played on the voices of the Oz characters to distort them up or down are very impressive when one considers the primitive sound processes back then.  And the tornado is *very* effective and terrifying--hats off to that great special effects pioneer of MGM, Arnold Gillespie.  The man was the John Dykstra of his day, and I'll take his effects over the digital elements in Twister, frankly.  Even more impressive is the fact that this tremendously difficult film was actually the ""second-banana"" production to the movie that was being made by much of the same staff next door--Gone With The Wind.  Imagine trying to make Star Wars and 2001 simultaneously and you get some idea of the achievement here.The DVD interface for this edition of TWOO is a mess.  The menus are confusing and poorly planned.  The way different features are nested is totally non-intuitive, and it takes a long time to find everything.  And there's a lot to find.  You get a making-of documentary hosted by Angela Lansbury.  There are theatrical trailers, including a tease trailer that plays very ahead of its time.  You get the full clip of the deleted scarecrow dance (choreographed by Busby Berkeley!), the soundtrack to the excised ""Jitterbug"" number over home movies by Harold Arlen, and the soundtrack to a few other deleted scenes where the film unfortuantely no longer exists.  There's supposed to be a shooting script, but because of the crappy menus I've never found it, and I'm sure I could download that on the internet anyway.  There are galleries of stills for costume and makeup tests that are interesting. (Dorothy was a tennaged sexpot at one point; I wonder how that would have played with the whiny character.)  Probably the best supplements are the home movies made by Arlen, both for the jitterbug and in another, separate section, and the outtakes of special effects done by Gillespie.There are lots of other small supplements--Academy Award newsreels and radio promos.  Most interesting is a brief newsreel about the winners of a Texas newspaper contest who got to go to Hollywood and take the MGM tour while TWOO was filming and meet Bolger, Lahr and Haley.  How something like that got saved for 60+ years is a mystery, but I'm glad it was.Unfortunately for me, right after I bought this Wizard of Oz edition, an even better three-disc edition was issued, one that hopefully has better menu navigation.  I haven't seen this, but it includes the complete earlier silent films based on the book, something I am dying to have.  (The present DVD only features brief excerpts from these films.)  So while this is a good DVD, I'd advice you to splurge and get the deluxe set.  Especially if you're a completist nutcase like me.  --Hey, maybe I really do love this movie after all."	5.0	A movie I tend to respect more than love	2006-03-27	11	4	7
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1KMG1AIUS00DC	"The Movie Man ""tenebre89"""	"""The Wizard of Oz"" opened in movie theatres on August 25, 1939.  It was M-G-M's response to the enormous success of Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" the first full-length animated film.  Metro decided to make L. Frank Baum's classic children's tale as a live-action picture with up-and-coming starlet Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy.The film was reasonably successful, but it was the frequent television airings beginning in 1956 that really endeared it to generations of people, young and old.  Warner Home Video is celebrating the film's seventieth anniversary with a spectacular restored Blu-ray release including a wealth of bells and whistles.""The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is a pleasure to behold.  Like most people, I've seen ""Wizard"" many times over the years, on TV, in theatres, on VHS, then DVD, and now Blu-ray, but never like this.  The Technicolor has never looked more brilliant and high definition has made it all the more dazzling.  Individual hair strands, details of the Munchkins' costumes, corn stalks in the Scarecrow's cornfield, the expansive backdrops and, of course, the ruby slippers stand out in sharp definition.  A remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack provides added listening pleasure as the famous songs and great score accompany Dorothy's journey through Oz.Happily, the Ultimate Blu-ray Edition collects all the bonus material from earlier DVD releases and offers over four hours' worth of new material in the four-disc set.  Among the new offerings is a sing-along track; featurettes on director Victor Fleming and the midgets who portrayed the Munchkins; two 1914 L. Frank Baum-produced silent films, ""The Magic Cloak of Oz"" and ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz;"" the made-for-TV movie ""The Dreamer of Oz,"" starring John Ritter and Annettte O'Toole, which provides the backstory of author Baum; and the original, extended version of ""If I Only Had a Brain,"" performed by Ray Bolger.The package contains a reproduction of the original 1939 Oz campaign book sent to theaters as a guide to marketing the movie.  It contains full-color ad reproductions and press sheets.  Also included are a replica of the original movie budget (talent cost: $213,518, set design: $40,212, special effects: $18,832, total production cost: $2,769,230.30) as well as a commemorative ""Wizard of Oz"" watch featuring Dorothy, Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion.  Finally, there is a 52-page, hard-cover book, ""Behind The Curtain,"" containing reprints of script pages, cast bios and portraits (in and out of make-up), photos of sets, behind-the-scenes shots of cast and crew at work, and reprints of sheet music covers and special-effects cost sheets. The container housing all these treasures opens in cigar-box fashion and features, on the cover, the four principal characters at the gates of the Emerald City."	5.0	Absolutely Glorious!	2009-11-05	2	2	0

The disparity between the rich and poor had never been greater. This movie took that despair and turned it around with a messege of hope, a much treasured, colorful entertainment in a drab land.

I hate when I open the video file to view and I only have 24 hours to see the movie. But I have 30 days if I don't open the video file at all. This can become a problem If I wish to see he movie and for some reason Comcast my internet provider goes down for a few hours or for some reason I loose connection which has happened. I work, I have a job and so after the next day I have only three hours  left to see the movie.  I may be wrong but to me this is bad business, I should be able to watch this video within a fair amount of time, say one week.  Things do happen and things do come up.Back when people rented from the video store (VHS movies) for 1, 2  or three days. This should be different, its a file and so I can't get over why customers can't be thought of first. All turned out ok this time, but I been renting videos this past week and it is my concern. I'm not going to be to happy If I lose money and can't see future videos.  Other than that I think its a great service for those who enjoy that sort of thing.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1XF3T6WDAJIAQ	Tober Mike	"I've read a few negative reviews here complaining about this release because it's not in the widescreen format and wanted to explain why. This movie was originally released in 1939. Movies weren't shot in the widescreen format until the 1950s. Widescreen was a format used by Hollywood to combat a new form of entertainment that they feared would put them out of business...television. This is why television originally had the aspect ratio of 4:3, because it matched the aspect ratio of movies at the time. There was a ""fake"" widescreen version of the Wizard of Oz released in 1955, but it wasn't true widescreen, how could it be since the master prints are in the 4:3 aspect ratio? MGM simply cut the top and bottom of the picture to fit a widescreen format. Fortunately, this version hasn't seen the light of day since it's release in 1955.Just wanted to clear that up for people wondering why there's no widescreen format."	5.0	Why it's not in Widescreen...	2005-11-02	141	125	16

Oh so dissapointing. I thought for sure that I had a bad transfer, until I read some of the other 1-star reviews which clarified the situation. The entire film--except for some brief moments after they get to the Emerald City--looks grainy. It's especially noticable during the sepia bookends and whenever there's a closeup of Dorothy (you'd think she had smallpox as a child). My wife never noticed it until I pointed it out during the closeups, but it was obvious to me the entire time. I haven't seen many BD films, but I was impressed with the color and quality of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and was hoping for something at least equivalent with the Wizard of Oz.If you're a videophile and have a large TV, you'll probably be disappointed."	1.0	Wish I had read S.

Having grown up reading the Oz books I have been waiting for an acceptable film version of my favorite book series.  Wizard of Oz is garbage in my opinion.  The worst part is how  the film makes you think Dorothy dreamt of her trip to Oz!!!  If you have  read the books you know this isn't true. Also her shoes are supposed to be  silver, not ruby.  Read the books and trust me, the movie will seem like  trash.  Or buy Return to Oz, which is a MUCH better book to film  translation than the VERY unforgettable Wizard of Oz.  L. Frank Baum would  not allow this sloppy translation of a movie to be released if he were  alive.  It's a good thing he can't see what Hollywood did to his beloved  Oz.

When we watched this feature, we turned on the English subtitles first and enjoyed watching the movie with the soundtrack as the only audible feature.  It accentuated many of the movie's excellent sound effects that one otherwise would barely notice.  Another favorite special feature gives a biographical sketch of the actors/actresses.

Why would anyone put out a 4:3 Blu-Ray is beyond me since Blu-Ray is an HD format and all recent HDTV's are 16:9. No one still watching a standard definition TV will get any benefit from Blu-Ray!

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A397M5PQDLG8N2	T. Osten	Blu-ray brings great 3-dimensional feel to this movie.  The ruby slippers look spectacular.On the down side...there is some grainy quality to the picture still.  I imagine that if you are watching this on a 30 inch screen you won't notice the grain, but on a home theatre system you can't help but notice the picture quality on closeups.  Also, one of the goals of the reproduction was to give colors a more earthy/less cartoony feel, but I feel as though this took some of the wonderment away from Munchkinland.  FYI.. this is not a widescreen format, so be prepared for black bars on the sides of your screen.Overall, blu-ray provides an enhanced viewing experience with crisper details.  If you keep in mind the age of the movie, you will not be disappointed.	4.0	Blu Ray, Not too bad for a 70 year old movie	2009-10-05	6	4	2

Dorothy yearns to travel ""over the rainbow"" to a different world, and she gets her wish when a tornado whisks her and her little dog, Toto, to the Technicolorful land of Oz. Having offended the Wicked Witch of the West, Dorothy is protected from the old crone's wrath by the ruby slippers that she wears. At the suggestion of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, Dorothy heads down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City, where dwells the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, who might be able to help the girl return to Kansas. En route, she befriends a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow would like to have some brains, the Tin Man craves a heart, and the Lion wants to attain courage and hoping that the Wizard will help them too, they join Dorothy on her odyssey to the Emerald City. But The Wizard of Oz remains by far the most wonderful versions of the classic tale.

While it has the grain i also saw on WB reissues like ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Casablanca"", note that grain is NOT a defect, but rather a trait of old films (and, in my opinion, adds character).  The sepia tones on the Kansas segments look great (nice tone and sharper than i remember, and really gives a ""grapes of wrath"" feel to the segments) and the Technicolor here is really good.  I viewed it on a 100"" screen and the movie blew up well.  There are very generous extras on the single-disc blu-ray (more than enough for me) though i understand the multi-disc versions of this have even more.  I'd also recommend (transfer-wise) ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (starring Errol Flynn) - ""Wizard"" and ""Robin Hood"" make for some great vintage-Technicolor viewing and are suitable for the whole family.The Adventures of Robin Hood [Blu-ray]"	5.0	nice Blu-Ray transfer (Single-disc Blu-Ray)	2010-04-11	1	1	0

The friends travel the yellow brick road only to encounter tricks that have been put into action from the ""Wicked Witch of the West"".  Through the strength of their friendship, they reach the Land of Oz only to learn that before the Wizard can grant their wishes, ""Dorothy"" and her friends must bring to him the broom of the ""Wicked Witch of the West"". In order to do so, the friends come up with a plan.This classic film is based off of L. Frank Baum's children's novel. The film draws the attention of audiences both young and old with the transformation of black and white film to color.  Directed by King Vidor and Victor Fleming this classic remains to stand the test of time to offer both children and adults the lesson that there is truly ""no place like home""."	5.0	I Don't Think We're in Kansas Anymore	2003-11-13	0	0	0

For the reviewer, BenjaminKidman, it's very unfair that you give this dvd edition a bad review because you say they didn't put it in widescreen format. Let me inform you that the film isn't in widescreen format, simply because it was never filmed in widescreen. It was filmed in scope, therefore, impossible for the studio to release it in that version. Before you give something a totally BAD review, read up on your materials and information first. I think this a totally awesome re-release on dvd and i'm sorry you won't be buying it because of your mis-information.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AYQF4Z1EQDACU	Tyler Reece	"One of the Greatest and most legendary films in cinema history, one of the greatest fantasy and musical films ever and the first color movie. The Wizard of Oz, the masterpiece that gave us one of  one of cinema's greatest leading ladies Judy Garland, who won our hearts with the immortal song ""Over the Rainbow"" that made AFI's # 1 greatest movie songs of the 20th century. The unforgetable and magical story of Dorothy Gale, a young girl from Kansas who gets whisked by a tornado along with her dog Toto and her farmhouse to the magical land of Oz, where shelands in Muchkinland, home of little singing people, where she also meets Glinda the Good Witch of the North and where she meets her nemisis the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy is desperate to get back to Kansas and the only person who can help her  is the great and powerful Wizard of Oz in Emerald City, Dorothy and Toto set off for Emerald City, but on the way they run into a talking Scarcrow who is in need of a brain, she takes scarecrow with her and toto, then they run into a Tin Man who is in need of a heart and finally they run into a Cowardly Lion who is in need of courage, the famous foursome is complete and Toto of course is with them. They soon get to Emerald City, but before the Wizard would grant their requests they would have to get the broom of the Wicked Witch. They get the broom after Dorothy accidentally pours water on the witch, she was really puting out the fire on scarecrow. They get their requests and Dorothy and her new found friends say farewell, they had love for Dorothy and Dorothy had love for them. Her and Toto get back to Kansas. after 65 years this masterpiece's magic and triumph is still timeless. The Film is still one of the most magical films of the 20th century, this broke grounds in special effects,makeup,casting and of course it's biggest trick is going from black & white Kansas to technicolor Oz. This is a movie spells Hollywood. It's sensational. Judy Garland's beauty and sensational voice and performace is resurrected when you watch this classic. Wether it's 1st time or your 65th it's time to experience the most beloved fantasy film of all time, time to walk down the yellow brick road. Time to Go Somewhere Over the Rainbow, because this film will bring enchantment to audiences for generations to Come. It Embodys Hollywood with a brain, a heart and some nerve."	5.0	65 Years Over the Rainbow and down the Yellow Brick Road	2004-08-26	4	4	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	It's remarkable to think this movie was made in 1939, having just watched the new Blu Ray release, because the 1080p restored transfer is simply stunning and looks as bright and as clear as if it were made only in the last decade.As I'm sure all you fans are aware, color plays an important aspect in this film.  The moment Dorothy emerges from her wind-blown sepia Kansas home into the rainbow Land of Oz takes your breath away and we've been seeing color for over 70 years.  Imagine how the 1939 audience felt!  If you truly want to experience this film like it was meant to be, you need to get it on Blu Ray.  There's simply nothing like it.  I'm in love with Blu Ray for all my movies now, but when I watch these classics digitally restored it really makes the technology shine.How many times had I seen the Wizard of Oz before the release?  It would be impossible to count, and yet, having just seen it in such clarity the entire experience was fresh and exciting.  Directors and film makers go into a lot of work to make classics like this, and when color plays such a huge role, you want to see it exactly as it was intended.  I am certain director Victor Fleming would have wanted us to see this version.  It was how it was meant to be seen.In conclusion of my review, I am sorry if you were interested in a plot summary or even my review of the extras.  I haven't got around to the bonus features yet, but I figured most of you are more interested in the quality of the Blu Ray transfer.  I have been burned by some poor Blu Rays that were not much better than the DVD, but this release of Oz was not one of them.  I'd even go so far as to say it was one of the better if not best I've seen.  I understand there are a couple different Blu Ray releases of this, so for the hardcore fan I'm sure the extras are worth the price.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend the budget version because this is one of the most classic films in our history and it would be a shame not to experience it like no generation has ever been able to do.	5.0	We're not in 480p anymore, Toto	2010-02-11	28	27	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2WSAYCIGY05RV	Vanessa	I must begin my saying this is my all time favorite movie.  I know, being 15 years old I should like all the dumb senseless movies out there but I do not.  The Wizard of Oz has continued to be my favorite since I was a little girl.  Its a story we all know and hopefully love.  At the time of making the movie, The Wizard of Oz was a very spectacular thing.  From changing black and white to color to the witch appearing and reappearing.  It is also a very funny movie since it is so outdated.  Like using slang such as &quot;Jimminy Cricket&quot; and &quot;Jolly 'ol town&quot;.  A song  called &quot;The Jitterbug&quot; was cut out of the movie since they thought it date the movie too much.  (The Jitterbug sounded like the swing and music of the 30s)  But that old charm helps make it a fabulous movie.  I think everyone should own this extrodinary movie.  And every kid should see it.  The Wizard of Oz is now part of Americana.  Also, whatever age you are, read the book.  It is really alot different than the movie.  (Dorothy's slippers in the book are silver and were going to be in the movie.  But they were changed to red because it would be more outstanding to show the new Technicolor of the time.) (PS- Don't believe what you hear about a Munchkin hanging himself in the back of one of the scenes.  It is in fact a long bird.)	5.0	A Favorite For All Generations	2001-08-11	1	0	1

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2RET0MEZYSF2A	"V. Chilton ""Russ'Lynn Acres"""	I remember my dad putting this on for me on that one special night each year when it played on broadcast television.  It's almost not as fun when you can access it whenever you want, but it was still important to me to ensure my children knew the story.  It's such a classic that this is the third generation in my family to become enraptured by it.  We had fun looking for some of the quirks of the film, too, like watching Dorothy's hair drastically change lengths from scene to scene and even within scenes and other little prop anomalies throughout.  Hopefully this will take root so heavily in my children's childhood memories that they'll pass along the experience to their own little ones someday!	5.0	Classic	2013-04-02	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A1RHVEZJA30HGW	"Veronica Lake ""Missy"""	"Like most baby boomers, I've watched this film dozens of times in the past on broadcast TV, then VHS tape, then LaserDisc ... but I had never actually SEEN ""The Wizard of Oz"" until this newly restored DVD came out. It's an amazing transfer. The sepia-tone Kansas sequences are startlingly sharp and clear, and the Technicolored world ""Over the Rainbow"" is truly dazzling. I found myself fascinated by details I had never noticed before: the glittering corn stalks in the Scarecrow's field; the mirror-like floors of the Emerald City; the polished buttons on the guardsmen's uniforms. Incredibly, even the individual grains of red sand in the Witch's hourglass stood out and glistened! All these minor-but-sumptuous visual details served to heighten the magical spell that the film has always woven, enhancing the performances, the story, and the music.The DVD extras are a mind-boggling embarrassment of riches. The ""Making Of"" documentary hosted by the incomparable Angela Lansbury is worth the price of the DVD alone, but there's so much more: an international poster gallery, interviews with cast members, deleted scenes, production stills, radio clips, etc, etc. There's enough material to keep even the most casual viewer fascinated for hours, and a true Oz buff will be occupied for days!If you only bought a DVD player to watch this one disc, it would well be worth the expense.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A3SMT15X2QVUR8	"Victoria Tarrani ""writer, editor, artist, des..."	"See it again for the first time -- introduce it to a child.  Oz is as magical today as when L. Frank Baum first told the tale.  Who does not want to go ""Over the Rainbow?""The thrill of watching Dorothy fight to keep Toto, then running away just as a storm is brewing is drama that children can feel.  Discovering a magician who is able to ""see"" Dorothy's past, and remind her of Aunt Em's love for her is a message for all generations.Although we know much more about the effects of tornadoes now than when we were  children through the child's eyes we can still find that we are caught up in the storm.  The swirling images that pass Dorothy's window as the house whirls and finally lands was filled with special effects were magical in 1939; they still are.The magic of sharing that moment when Dorothy opens the door into a world of color still makes children shiver with enchantment.  I remember one night when my parents were out, and I sneaked into the living room.  I kept the volume on the black and white TV low so that no one would come for me.  It was nearly midnight when that door to OZ opened. I was keenly disappointed that Oz was not in color, I was sure that this moment would fill my world with color.  That is the wonder of childhood.A child will tremble at the Wicked Witch of the West, and be enthralled as Glinda, the good witch of the North, floats to the ground in an iridescent bubble.  Children are frequently called ""Munchkin"" and they are surprised to discover Munchkinland.It is so easy to forget that Judy Garland is acting because her big eyes, wide smile, innocence, and voice are Dorothy.  Jack Haley as the Tin Man, Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion, and Ray Bolger, who is the scarecrow, has given a legacy to film and heritage that is a genuine treasure.  Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch of the East, has terrified children for more than six decades, and continues to do so.There is no place like home.  5 stars.Victoria Tarrani"	5.0	Wizards, Witches and Oz, oh my!	2001-09-04	180	152	28

I feel that the most remastered version has been remastered so much it has lost some of its charm. For instance the black and white is now sepia.The reason for the 1 star is not regarding the movie but the view online option. I purchased the movie as a gift along with an opportunity to view it online.  This did not work. Throughout the viewing it played the soundtrack twice. One time was about 0 seconds before the soundtrack that went with the picture. Also the video tended to skip and repeat 5 seconds of the video2-3 times.If I were to purchase this movie I would purchase an older addition and skip the remastered version.	1.0	view online/ and new remastered version	2010-12-21	18	2	16

Rice Jr.	The Wizard of Oz (70th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]  There isn't anything I can add to what has been said about this movie classic as it stands.  It's been quite a lifetime thus far of 61 years seeing this classic as good as I'll ever see it.It had to be a must for the technicians working on the Blu-ray transfer of the film to exceed all possible expectations that its large legion of fans would expect, and they certainly succeeded.  The picture is consistently clear throughout; no faults were observed in the pictorial transfer.  Saturation and color rendition is virtually perfect for a film of this age.  What has to be a major concern is how the transfer technicians would deal with the soundtrack.  Being as stereo didn't exist at the time the film was made, the viewer has the choice of going with the programmed reprocessed soundtrack for 5.1 stereo sound, or choosing the original mono soundtrack (which is my preference, as I don't care for electronically-reprocessed soundtracks of very old films with non-stereo soundtracks).  However, the only complaint I have about trying to program the original mono soundtrack for this film is that you can't get to the movie's menu to do this until you have gone through all 56 chapters of the movie, plus the exceedingly numerous anti-piracy notices in numerous languages.  Otherwise, the extras for the film are entertaining and valuable sources of behind-the-scenes information and history.An essential part of any film fan's library, regardless of their current age or status in life.  It's films like this that make all adult humans become children once again.  Need I say more?	5.0	Excellent Transfer of an All-Time Classic	2011-02-21	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2J9QBVH149J29	Wayne Minge	Warner Bros. released The Wizard Of Oz - Three Disc Collector's Edition on October 25th, 2005. For many Oz fans, this was a long time coming. The long awaited Special Edition to one of cinema's most cherished films. The DVD presents the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen. Keep in mind that this movie was filmed in 1939 so no widescreen version exists. In 1955 MGM re-released the film to theaters but in a cropped 1.85:1 widescreen. Basically all that was done for this release is placing black bars on the top and bottom to make it fill the theaters movie screen. So in reality, a authentic widescreen version doesn't exist. The audio & video for this release is stunning as Warner took the time to clean up the picture and make the sound crisp. As for special features, Warner has included over 10 hours of impressive features. If you're a fan of Oz then I would say this is a definite buy for you.	5.0	The Wizard Of Oz - Three Disc Collector's Edition	2007-11-21	2	2	0
0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	A2AU8L51PSHQW9	W. Chappell	Maybe I got a lemon, but this is easily the grainiest and poorest quality blu-ray picture I have ever seen.  At first I thought it might be my player, which was getting pretty dated.  So I upgraded to a brand new player, and viewed the movie again.  And it looks exactly the same.  My old VHS version of the 1939 classic looked a lot better than this blu-ray version.  Very disappointing.	2.0	Very grainy blu-ray picture	2010-03-30	7	3	4

We went thru so many VHS copies it was insane. She also had to wear her ruby slippers everywhere as well and we went thru plenty of those shoes. 5 years after her, i had my second daughter who is now 7. She loves this movie just as much. She was Dorothy 2 yrs in a row and wore out plenty of ruby slippers and movies as well. Bbeing able to buy this digital copy was a surprise. The price was fair, however I feel like if Im buying a digital copy it shouldn't be as much as the DVD I could have.

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"I was just critized for foisting off the following review of the 3-disk DVD set as a review of the new Blu-ray. I didn't; Amazon did. As anyone who's been here for a while will notice, Amazon throws all DVD reviews into the same bucket, regardless of the edition. So don't blame me.I just got the Blu-ray, and will have some comments on it at the end.There's no need to discuss ""The Wizard of Oz"" itself, a classic among classics (though I'll have something to say about its ""philosophy"" later on). You probably want to know whether the UltraResolution transfer justifies the purchase.It does. Oh, yes it does.""The Wizard of Oz"" has always looked good, one of the better Technicolor films. Unlike ""Gone With the Wind"", which was generally dark and desaturated, and which UltraResolution greatly improved, I didn't expect much enhancement for ""Oz"".Was I ever wrong. I stared with my jaw hanging open. ""Oz"" is the best UltraResolution transfer by far -- and the others were not exactly chopped liver.The improvement in detail and sharpness is startling, especially as the original prints did not seem obviously lacking in either. Even more amazing is the expansion of the tonal scale. Dark scenes (particularly those in the forest and outside the ""witches"" castle) are now filled with rich detail. Have you ever noticed how beautiful the Winkies' red, white, and gray uniforms are? I hadn't -- until now.These enhancements combine produce the biggest improvement of all -- a major revelation of _texture_. The ""feltiness"" of many costumes is obvious. The burlap of the Scarecrow's face is now plainly visible, particularly in the close-up where he misstates the Pythagorean Theorem. And the Lion's costume is a thick pile of fur you want to reach out and stroke. You can see every last strand of hair.I'm exaggerating only slightly when I say the improvements of this UltraResolution transfer are not much less than those from cleaning the Sistine Chapel's frescos. It's as if layers of murk and grime -- that you never even knew were there! -- have been stripped away. Until you view it, you cannot imagine what this film (that is, the original camera negatives) _really_ looks like. It's a shame the people who created ""Oz"" never got to see it this way.The image quality is so high that I often felt as if I were looking through a window at live performers. (Well, almost.) No matter what versions you already have, you won't be disappointed with this one. I watched it twice in two days, and I might even view it a third time tonight.My only quibble is that several matte paintings do not blend properly, because the hues at the join lines do not match those of the scene. This could have been fixed; I suspect it seemed too much work for a small improvement. (A friend suggested that these sorts of things are left in because videophiles enjoy finding them.)As to the differences between the two- and three-disk sets... The latter includes a packet of original programs and promotional material of the sort we haven't seen in 40 years ago. (Remember the 50-cent deluxe programs for road-show films?) There's also a set of 10 reproductions of Kodachrome publicity photographs. For this viewer, these extras alone justify the higher price.The third disk will be of most interest to lovers of all things Oz. It includes a handsomely produced biography of L. Frank Baum (interesting enough that you might want to watch it more than once), plus all the silent Oz films and a Technicolor Oz cartoon. The existence of these is well-known to anyone familiar with the history of Oz productions, but they've never appeared (as far as I know) in any home-video format.The films are problematic. The two from Baum's production company are the best -- they have style, charm, and imagination. The others are cheesy ripoffs that bear little relation to the original book. The Larry Semon -- a once wildly-popular but now virtually forgotten cartoonist and comic * -- version is especially obnoxious, as it is little more than a vehicle for Semon's brand of physical comedy. The Baum estate is at least partly to blame -- _any_ movie version must have seemed more attractive than none, especially as the technology to make a convincing version of ""Oz"" would not exist for another 15 years.The film's opening titles praise the book's ""kindly philosophy"", which seems to be either ""You already have everything you need to be happy"", or ""The answer to your problems lies within yourself"". These are not so much ""kindly"" as reflections of the hard-nosed ""All your problems are your own fault"" and ""If you're not a success, it's because you're lazy"" homilies that grew out of the great opportunity for personal development and material success this country offered.I believe L. Frank Baum had something a bit different in mind. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a fairy tale in which magic has no bearing on the issues at the center of the story. I believe Baum wanted to discourage children from fantasizing that magic could be a solution to one's problems.So... he has the four principals make a grueling journey to the Emerald City, then find the wizard is a humbug. (What a shame the blander ""fake"", ""fraud"", or ""phony"" have replaced that delightful word.) He posesses no magic to supply wit, love, or grit, which the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion have demonstrated they already have.Baum's ""moral"" is simple -- Love, wisdom, and courage are what we need to get through life. No one can _give_ them to us, because we _already_ possess them, and all we need to do is express them.""Is that right?""""That's all it is.""Now... the question you've been waiting for the answer to... Is the Blu-ray set worth the price?I viewed the Blu-ray on a Pioneer 60"" Pro Kuro, fed from a Sony BDP-S550. I also watched the DVD on the Pioneer (fed from the same Blu-ray player), and on a 36"" Sony 400-series WEGA ""improved definition"" TV (fed from a Sony DVP-S7000).The DVD remains a terrific DVD, and looks terrific on a high-quality 480i monitor. (See the preceding review.) It was, and still is, a demo-quality DVD.When played on the BD player, and upconverted to 1080p, the DVD's image on the Kuro is pretty darn good -- the sharpness and detail are at least ""acceptable"". But when you play the Blu-ray disk, the image goes from ""acceptable"" to almost-startling. Two examples... Note the enhanced detail and texture in the weather-beaten wood above the WWE's lifeless legs. And in the crowd scenes, you can see (just about) every Munchkin face. There is virtually no smearing of detail.So... should you rush right out in a buying frenzy and get the BD edition? It depends.The DVD is good enough for an excellent picture on a high-quality SD monitor. But even upconverted, it isn't good enough for a _large_ HD display. If you have, say, a 40"" display; your BD player has a good upconverter (not all do); and you don't sit ""on top of"" the screen (as I do); you might see little difference between the DVD and the Blu-ray.But if you're a video fuss-budget (as I am) and sit closer than the ""experts"" recommend (why _shouldn't_ you?), you will almost certainly prefer the Blu-ray. It's your call.A few remarks on the extras... The wristwatch, as the kid in the Ally bank commercial says, is a piece of junk. The design shows no particular style, wit, or imagination. And as others have said, ""The Dreamer of OZ"" is a wretched transfer, very badly unpconverted to 1080. It is not of acceptable quality, and should have been put on the DVD disk.I will come back later (I hope) with some more comments on the sound and the other extras. Forcing yourself to repeatedly watch large chunks of a movie, regardless of its quality, is an ennervating experience."	5.0	(Blu-ray update) Not a restoration, but an entirely different view of the film.	2005-10-30	907	832	75

While it has its flaws, you have to look past those slight imperfections, suspend reality and just allow yourself to enjoy this simple story and its glorious transition to the big screen. Screenplay quibbles aside, this 1939 classic has endured for a reason, it serves as a wonderful escape from the troubled world we live in. I first saw it when I was a lad of 6, and it has stayed with me since then. I admit to a slight crush on The Wicked Witch (on the ""Making Of..."" documentary, isn't Margaret Hamilton kinda sexy in the green makeup and hat, especially smiling?) and the Flying Monkey Scene in the Dark Forest is just as creepy now as it was when I was a kid! The best scene for my money (other than the field of poppies)has got to be when Dorothy opens the house door and steps out of the sepia-hued doldrums of Kansas, into the brilliant, full color, psychedelic world of Munchkin Land, simply astounding!

So I do have a frame of reference as far as how this compares to the DVD.  Let me tell you that it is as good if not better!  The picture quality is excellent!  The restorative processes have done justice to this movie and it is crisp and true to the original as best I remember.I love all the extras because this is the stuff we the audience never saw, at least the majority of us, and it is very good! You get a lot of background information about the movie and see things that were not in it that really add to the ambiance and inner-workings that really do help you understand how it was made and the trials and tribulations encountered.This is a true classic and despite Judy's later life problems I love her in this movie and always think of her in the context and personality of Dorothy Gale.  Your children will love it and it is a good, clean movie albeit somewhat scary with the Wicked Witch of the West!This DVD set is worth every penny and is priceless if you are a fan of the Great and Terrible OZ!  L. Frank Baum will never be forgotten because of this movie and the stories he and Denslow wrote so many years ago.Enjoy!	5.0	The Great and Powerful Oz lives again!	2007-08-09	3	2	1

All three are absolutely real and believable as a brainless Scarecrow, a Tin man and the greatest Cowardly Lion ever!!!!  It will make you laugh, hope and wonder and it might teach you some lessons while it's at it.	5.0	..we're off to see the wizard..	2013-01-14	0	0	0

0792833171	The Wizard of Oz	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"After reading the novel ""Wicked"" (which I was thoroughly bored/disappointed with) and then picking up the book ""The Making of Oz"" (which I enjoyed immensely), the natural progression led me to sit down and watch the original ""Wizard of Oz"" film for the first time in 10 years or so.  As people have likely been saying for 70 years now, I was transformed into a small child once again, inwardly dreading the exact second the Wicked Witch first comes on the screen in a big puff of smoke and singing along to each and every song/dance number.Everyone knows the story...Dorothy Gale from Kansas ""travels"" to the magical city of Oz, where she meets such characters as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, while trying all the while just to get home.  During her travels, she is tormented by the Wicked Witch of the East, as well as entering into a love/hate relationship with the Wizard himself.What really strikes me, though, is how well this film has held up over time.  With the possible exceptions of Casablanca and Gone With the Wind (and I believe an even stronger case for ""Oz"" can be made than either of those two), this film has charmed the hearts and minds of both children and adults alike for an incredibly long time.  Just think of all the children's movies (e.g. Disney, Pixar, High School Musical) and television programs (e.g. Cartoons, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel) that have came and went over the years, yet children (like the younger sister I recently watched the film with) still watch with wonder as Dorothy opens that door into the wonderful world of Oz.Thus, there really isn't anything bad that can be said about The Wizard of Oz.  It is the consummate children's film, filled with incredible color, silly acting, and plenty of singing and dancing, while it still holds its appeal to all but the most crotchety of older folks, as the filmmaking was so well-constructed that it stands the test of time.It is a long-held tradition that the film is shown once a year on network television, and I would recommend adhering to that ""regime"", even if you go the DVD route.  Trust me, it will never get old."	5.0	"A ""Wonderful Wiz"", Indeed"	2009-07-10	1	1	0
