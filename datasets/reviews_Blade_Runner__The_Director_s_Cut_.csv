0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A35DGWN9ATWJ1U	007	If you liked Bladerunner the first time, watching it on DVD will blow you away.  The sound and picture are so much clearer and the director's cut adds a few more insights into the characters.  My wife, who usually doesn't enjoy sci-fi, really liked the movie as well.I highly recommend it.Happy holidays.Darin	5.0	Wonderful upgrade from VHS	2000-12-29	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3OHN17217J2EI	"""0xshadowfax"""	I had the rare treat of seeing the director's cut of this movie on the big screen a couple years ago, having chanced upon a limited time release. From then on, I was hooked!I wasn't old enough to have seen the original theatrical release in theatres, but after watching it on video, I must say that the director's cut is the better of the two, even if the ending is less &quot;happy&quot;. The happy ending didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the movie's tone, which to be honest, had very little that was positive to say about the future of the human race. I find this approach to be more honest, serving perhaps as a veiled warning about the potential consequences of recklessly pursuing ever-greater knowledge and technology.Personally, I found that Ford's narratives took away from the atmosphere that Ridley had so carefully created - dark, rainy, and very subtle, with lots of detail that is not immediately present (look carefully for the ad signs of non-existent companies - Pan Am and Atari, to name a couple) on first viewing.I was disappointed that the technological capabilities of the DVD format were largely ignored, particularly where sound was concerned - with 5.1 channels of Dolby Digital to work with, they made little use of it. It would've definitely enhanced the film to become fully immersed in Ridley's dark, busy and at times jarring depiction of Los Angeles in 2019. There are also no &quot;extras&quot; - they could've included the European release or the original US theatrical release, along with perhaps some interviews or other items that are suited to such a long-standing cult classic. For these reasons, it gets 4 stars from me.	4.0	A must-have for the sci-fi fan's DVD collection	2000-11-21	7	5	2

I expected nothing from ''Blade runner''. But I was overwhelmed by how good the movie was. In the first minutes I already liked it and as I was going further into the depths I found it so catchy I couldn't put it down. Even when I had to pause the movie I kept thinking about what could possibly happen next. For me this movie is a must have. Great classic science fiction.	5.0	I adore it	2011-07-05	0	0	0

Dick,  Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples (who also wrote UNFORGIVEN) did a very good jobe with the screenplay.Ridley Scott directed and gives us some exciting, albeit brutal, pursuits.  Scott seems to be very good at this kind of genre film, or action films.Harrison Ford is perfect in the lead role.Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, M.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2HTD3UEX8XZ61	Aaron M. Knowlton	I have noticed that many of the reviews on this site pertaining to Blade Runner pine for the original theatrical release, in which the film ended in a cop-out, and had Ford drowsily trudging along in a half-hearted narration. I don't mean to insult anyone, but the &quot;happy ending&quot; went against the movie's intentions. You spend two hours in a dark, damp dystopian world and then all of a sudden you're in the sunny, pristine mountains? Please. Mr. Scott threw in that ending at the last moment to make the studio happy, a studio that was totally blind to his genius in the first place. A lot of people have also stated that the Director's Cut ending doesn't sufficiently conclude the movie, that is just &quot;drops off&quot;, and has left some with an uneasy feeling. The point of this ending is to be ambiguous, to leave it up to you what happens. And don't even get me started on the narration. Yes, I'm sure a lot of people think it helped to explain the movie, but it also guided the viewer by the hand and &quot;talked down&quot; to the viewer like you're a moron. All the narration did was basically show Deckard (being a detective) discovered something and then said to the audience, &quot;Look, I discovered something!&quot; The lack of narration in the Director's Cut allows the audience to notice some of the visual keys they missed while following along with Harrison's groggy storytelling, and also illuminates some of the nuances that makes Harrison Ford a great actor.  Aside from the bare-bones dvd (Warner Bros has a boatload of stuff lying around that could be on this disc as extras...two discs worth, in fact), this is an excellent film about humanity in a dark, corporate-corrupted world, and the director's cut eliminates the narraton and sappy ending which guide our hands like we're 6 year olds, and allows us to fully enjoy this film as a future noir. And if another, more comprehensive DVD ever appears with a Ridley commentary, allowing Mr. Scott to  explain what he was thinking, then you people won't need a terrible narration and sappy ending to do so.	3.0	Excellent movie, poor DVD	2001-06-11	16	10	6

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A361G9F4B8QPE5	A. Bettik	"Blade Runner is my second favorite movie, and there's always been a certain amount of dissatisfaction among Blade Runner fans regarding details that should or should not have found their way into the original release of the film.  Owners of this 5-disk collector's edition have no reason to complain, as EVERY VERSION OF THE FILM THAT HAS EVER EXISTED (barring any that were edited for television) is included here in the packege.  Personally, I debated whether or not to shell out the dough for this edition for a little while, and I think that the deal-maker for me was the inclusion of the work-print in this release.  I'm satisfied, more satisfied than I feel I would've been with just the 2-disc edition, but I also feel like I'd have been just as happy buying one fewer disc, and a lot fewer plastic doo-dads.Disc one is Ridley Scott's Final Cut, currently the definative version of this film and hopefully the last ""improved"" version that will ever be released.  The content is just about the same as that of the 1992 director's cut, with a scene here and there from the workprint spliced in, and some special effects wizardry to correct gripes such as a stunt-double's wig not looking proper, or Harrison Ford's lips not matching the audio track.  There are three commentaries, and although I've only listened to two of them so far, I'd say that they're worthwhile (although it's tough to tell if Hampton Fancher and David Peoples were really just about fed up with each other during the recording of their commentary, or were just putting on a show for the microphone.)Disc two is a making-of documentry.  If you've ever read Paul M. Sammon's ""Future Noir:  The Making of Blade Runner,"" know that this disc contains most of the information that was included in that book, plus a whole lot more.  Most of the original cast is interviewed here (Ford included, although Will Sanderson is strangely absent, and a disclaimer at the end of the credits claims that absent cast members politely declined to be interviewed...,) both screenwriters give their input, and even PKD gets a little screen time with recordings made around the time of the filming.  In my mind, discs one and two absolutely make this edition.  (It should also be noted that discs one and two ARE the two-disc edition.)Disc three is just an ""archive"" of the previous three versions of the film; the theatrical release, the home video cut, and the 1992 director's cut.  To me, there is so little difference between these three versions that this disc was probably just a waste of my money.  It's expendableDisc four contains more featurettes, and it's as appriciated as disc two was.  There's some repetition of information, but they go a lot more in-depth with the specific aspects of the filming - wardrobe, effects, and so on.  If you're an info junkie like me, you'll like discs two and four equally.Disc five is the workprint. I wanted a copy, and now I've got a copy, but it's not so much different from the film that a casual fan needs to see it.  Its lukewarm.The rest of the space inside of the plastic briefcase that these DVDs come in is taken up with packing foam, artwork, and toys, for lack of a better word.  We're graced with a plastic model spinner, a plastic origami unicorn (which isn't even that good of a ringer for the one that Gaff leaves in the film, if you compare the two), and a plastic block with an animated second or two of footage from the movie - one of those graphics that appears to move if you rock it back and forth.  As an adult, I really didn't feel that I needed to pay for any of this, and all it did was jack up the purchase price unneccesarily.  I wish that I could sell them all back to Warner Home Video, but I can't.The briefcase itself, also plastic, is really just as much a toy, and a cumbersome one to store.  The only reason they needed this large of a packege in the first place was to include all of the playthings, and as I've already said, I could have done without those.The five discs are stored in a folding cardboard-and-plastic slipcase, decorated with conceptual artwork and photos or scenes from the production.  I wish that they had kept it one disc to a divider side, rather than overlapping the discs one on top of another, two to a side.  I'm always worried that I'll scratch a disc when I have to pry it off from on top of another just to get it out of the liner.So, all in all, I'm satisfied, but they could have cut out one of five discs and all of the extra toys, and made me just as happy."	4.0	Gratifying, but perhaps a little overdone.	2008-02-28	4	2	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A22AD8M2SSOFHJ	"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh"""	Seldom does a movie come around that is as popular or more popular than it was decades ago.  Blade Runner was a Box Office flop when it originally debuted in 1982.  Although the film quickly gained a cultish following of hardcore fans that enjoyed it as an epic Sci-fi classic.  Now in 2007 the movie can once again be enjoyed by it's masses.  A newly remastered collection of five discs has made it's way to hi-def world.  So how does it look and play all these years later.  Extremely well.I am probably one of the few to buy this movie who has actually only watched it once before.  I was a child when this movie first came out and it was hard to understand how good of a movie this is until now as an adult.  The story takes place in a futuristic world set in 2017.  From the first moment on you can realize the epic scale this movie was put on.  A corporation has created these cyber humans called replicants.  Nearly identical to real people they were created to do slave labor.  Although the replicants are very human like and that causes problems.  Thus brings in Blade Runners.  These bounty hunters go searching for rogue replicants.  The replicants have been banned from Earth which means the Blade Runner must find any that find there way here.Harrison Ford plays one of the Blade Runner by the name of Rick Deckard.  Fresh from his first Indiana Jones movie he shows why he is a action/sci-fi star.  Four replicants free themselves from a planet and have come to Earth to search for their maker.  From the first moment on this movie begins to raise philosophical questions.  Right or wrong and should all replicants be retired(killed) for just being a replicant.  Especially when these replicants become so human like.  This becomes evident in the character played by Sean Young named Rachael.  So human like and yet created by science.Most of the movie appears dark in many scenes, night seems to be when people live in this futuristic world.  Despite the darkness much of the color is illuminated in a light blue color which is fascinating to the eyes.  The music sets the tone thru the movie in which it can be rather pleasant to sometimes eery.The Blu-ray version of this film is quite a feat.  The sheer beauty of it in high definition is the clear vision that Ridley Scott intended.  From the first scene to the last you can tell this movie went thru more than a once over.  The sound is excellent and really brings out the film.Blade Runner is without a doubt another classic.  Although a sci-fi movie the story delves much deeper than that.  This is a movie that should be seen by everyone.  Any fan of sci-fi or just a good plot will love this movie.  Age has only made it better.  Without a doubt this is one collection that should be in any Blu-ray movie owners collection.	5.0	A Cult Classic Redone to Near Perfection	2008-01-01	5	1	4

When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is, if nothing else. This would have to be the  exception to the rule. Boring, slow, cheesey effects, almost no plot, and  the ending was unfulfilling at best. I've only seen the directors cut so I  guess I can't appreciate the 'improvement', but whats so good about a  polished version of a fundementally bad movie?

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1LZUJF8AQ796R	ACRA	Bladerunner is a classic Sci-fi film! I remember when I first borrowed a friends VHS copy of it years ago and was in love (never gave back the VHS!) everything about this film is well done, Ridley Scott created a masterpiece in every way. The story is based on  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  a  novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. First published in 1968, human like robots serving humankind.It is a story way before it's time, and which we see in film after film;Terminator, I-Robot, AI, The Machine, Aliens and more.It is plausible that some day in the future we will have robots serving society, and the idea of Artificial Intelligence  is not long off, and the concept that AI will get out of control is a real concern to many.It has love, drama, adventure, mystery, and imagination. An all star cast even back then;Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Rick Deckard, Rutger Hauer is also so believable asRoy Batty, Sean Young is  a gorgeous Rachael and Daryl Hannah asPris is just plain amazing.The lighting effects won an academy award, and for good reason, they are spectacular. The music by Vangelis fits the movie perfectly, I dream about it.OK, I'm obsessed with the movie, yes, but it really is one of the top ten best Science Fiction films of all time, sits with The day the stood still (1), War of the worlds(1), Forbidden Planet, Star Man, ET, Star Wars, Alien and more.If you are into Sci-Fi and you haven't seen the movie you are not into Science Fiction!	5.0	My Favorite Movie of All Time!	2014-06-24	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AAKGTWGAFT1LQ	A C SHIELDS	I had been waiting for this Ultimate version of the movie and in this sort of packaging for years, but the main question as a buyer is 'was a real effort was made to deserve our money'. After seeing some previous Special Editions/Director's Cuts of Ridley Scott's films, I had an idea of what we might expect . It is hard to believe that some would still be unhappy with this incredible presentation of Blade Runner, but that is the way fans are.The set (preordering through Amazon) cost me less than a third of the Australian price, so I cannot complain.For those who have never seen it, the film is amazing and haunting , in some ways sad. I feel it means more as one becomes older. My only reservation about the film is the way it tries to be many things at once, but maybe that is its charm.It is definitely a classic and perhaps those who don't like it don't like the underlying message which may be - think about yourself and what you have accomplished. Are you happy with that ?If not, the film may be difficult to sit through.A great film, beautfully presented in a package to hand down to the Nexus, sorry , NEXT generation.	5.0	May be an over the top package , but worth the wait	2008-01-16	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1KH645PJ7X2N3	A Customer	One of the best all time scifi thrillers, from one of the best directors ever, Ridley Scott.  Plus an awesome cast, portraying the android replicants...after watching, you'll be wondering who isn't a  replicant.  The story is set in futuristic Los Angeles, not too far off 2019...visually stunning, atomoshperic lighting done to perfection by the master of mood Ridley Scott.  Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a cop assigned to a special unit to exterminate the Nexus 6 model of Replicants, that are deemed illegal on earth after a rather disasterous event that led to the slaughter of several people.  This director's cut version basically removes Deckard's voice over, which is good, but it would be nice to have both versions, or at least two audio tracks, for those that want to keep the original style.  This is a letterbox version, you either hate it or love it.  Definately a classic that every sci-fi fan should have!	5.0	&quot;Six seven, goto hell or goto heaven&quot;	2003-04-18	3	3	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1RVY7CQW01D41	Adam Chen	This film resonates with dark aura, with clever shafts of light peeking through--if you look closely enough. The light you will look for in the film represents both insight and the truth. You can watch scenes over and over again and it's remarkably fascinating. It can still compel you in the same way it did when you first watched it.You can't put this film into a genre or perspective. And you can't call it futuristic. This is a very simple film that is clear in its message but haunting in its presentation, and ultimately it is a very lonely journey. It's not meant to be watched with anyone else, just alone, in my opinion. I would recommend turning on closed captioning too, as the voices are generally fairly soft and you could miss key dialogue. It's in widescreen format so the captioned words shouldn't get in the way.I think everyone can relate to this film in one way or another. But no one can say what it's about. Loneliness, fear, hatred--these are all things we can relate to. But never has it been done in such an artistic way. I think this is one of those forms of art that has the ability to distract you from reality, maybe just long enough to learn something or at least be mesmerized for a short while.	5.0	Vivid, pure, and picturesque	2002-08-08	1	0	1

It is never boring (unlike dune).  It ages well (unlike Logan's Run). It has just about everything you could want going for it: Interesting idea, cast, charachters, plot, action, etc.  If you havent seen it you owe it to yourself.  Only one word of caution, it is violent and probably should not be watched by young viewers.	5.0	best movie... ever	2001-07-27	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A18BD98SU49UB7	"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H."""	"Although Blade Runner is a visual buffet, and has had some tweaks with the director's rendition, it still has some issues.I have heard through the years about the incredible places this film takes you. A dark, crowded metropolis full of fumes and sick rejects. Let me say, visually it exceeded my expectations. Although I am fully aware how they created the environments I was looking at, I still caught myself with my jaw creeping open. It's pretty incredible. Tall skyscrapers riddle every street and no matter which direction you look, there are always thousands of bystanders to keep you from moving any faster then a hobble. Its always been funny to me how films of any decade, not just the 80's, envision the future. In the 40's, tv shows depicted us living on distant planets by the year 2000. (Conan echoes in my head.) Also, in the majority of 80's flicks (aka: Total Recall etc...) they have everyone in goofy garb with bad haircuts and freaks lurking on every corner. Fortunately, Blade Runner skipped that idealism pretty smoothly. There is a fraction, but the murkiness and dank environments wash these visuals away. It all meshes nicely.I especially liked Vangelis' score. It has a ""washing"" effect over the visuals, and it works on a unique level. Its obvious they wanted this to sound otherworldly. Success.I can sum up the quality of this dvd's composition with one word: Bitter. The film itself is better than vhs, so I'm not going to complain. Thats all most care about anyway. The Menu is horrible, and jeez, a flipper? This year marked the 20'th anniversary. Find any material you can WB, smash it on a lone disk then put the film with a new transfer, with repairs, and anamorphic widescreen format. And with the audio... ouch. 2.0 dolby digital. Imagine a new DTS track to make your sub rattle and the ships whiz over your head. As far as the person who made the technical decisions for this disc. They failed...I wonder if they still drag people behind horses in some states...?Usually, I either love or hate a film. I don't like being gray, it can be too confusing and is usually a waste of time. But, Blade Runner is a paced epic in its own right. I recommend that anyone who watches a film to escape from reality for a couple of hours should see it. It is by no means perfect, but atleast it takes time to breath. That's a hard quality to find now a days."	3.0	The Good and the other...	2004-12-20	8	3	5
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AIR4YWDDONXUX	Adam M. Miles	I fail to see how so many people enjoy this movie so much.  Yes, the visuals are stunning (especially for early 80s fx) and the concept is interesting, but the plot is paper-thin and utterly predictable, there is no suspense to be found anywhere, and the Vangelis soundtrack is intrusive, inappropriate, and tacky.  The wonderfully talented Harrison Ford gives as good a performance as the &quot;look exhausted, now look scared, now look exhausted again&quot; direction allows, but are we really supposed to believe that he'd fall for an utterly unattractive Sean Young?  A lot of people here have mentioned that the original cut is superior to this version, and perhaps it is, but unless the plot is dramatically different and the score is not present, I won't be watching it.	2.0	Interesting, but a classic?	2000-11-26	11	1	10
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A21TP65G1SCGBT	Adam Scoville	Blade Runner is a classic, a mythological look at how deeply the presumably human protagonist, and the rest of us take life so profoundly for granted. While the film is incredible, there are some flaws in this DVD  version. The Director's Cut was made for the film's 10th anniversary, so it  predated digital transfers. As a result, the film still has a blotchy  analog look. Also, while the Director's cut presents more relentlessly the  harsh vision of the post-apocalyptic future, it is definitely less  accessible. Moreover, there are clearly some places where dubbed dialog was  added in, or dialog was cut in the remake, so it's not as polished. The DVD  edition should have, rather than offering wide-screen and pan-and-scan  versions, offered the original release on one side of the disc, and the  Director's Cut on the other. Nonetheless, the film is still an inspired  cinematic vision, with visible allusions to Percy Shelley's  &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's  &quot;Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus.&quot;	3.0	A Modern Prometheus as a film, but Icarus as a DVD.	1999-11-30	24	20	4

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3R2ZVULC0KHHJ	adonesc	When visionary writer Phillip K. Dick wrote his perhaps now most famous novel, &#34;Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep&#34;, few if any ever dreamed that it could be brought to the screen, even Dick himself, who was not that enamoured with Hollywood to begin with.  Cue equally visionary, and one of the best directors ever, Ridley Scott. After working with and getting the blessing from Dick himself, Ridley Scott proceeded to create one of the most unique cinematic masterpieces in the history of film, &#34;Blade Runner&#34;.  The movie's enduring importance, impact and power is undeniable, it is pure, non-distilled sci-fi noir at its best.  I am sure people have used much more inventive and aptly descriptive superlatives to describe the movie.  Sadly Dick died a few months before the movie's release.For me, I had seen &#34;Blade Runner&#34; in the 80's as a child, but at that time I could not grasp what I had seen, besides my head swam with &#34;The Empire Strikes Back&#34; (another masterpiece) at the time. Then I saw the Director's Cut in 1992 at the beginning of my teenage years...and was captivated.  It wasn't until high-school, when per chance I stumbled upon a copy of Phillip K. Dick's novel in my high-school library, it had the now iconic &#34;Blade Runner&#34; poster on it, picturing Deckard (Harrison Ford) and Rachel (Sean Young) and the unforgetable 2019 LA landscape...I was hooked, line and sinker, to the book, I didn't know what sci-fi literature could be until I read Phillip K. Dick's works and short stories.  Of course afterwards I ran out and got the movie on VHS, yep it was still the 90's, and sat breathlessly to watch the movie.To say that &#34;Blade Runner&#34; changed the way I look at movies, would be an understatement...it changed even me in some way or other, how I look at the world, connecting that with my own life experience and many things I had seen and lived through.  If ever moviemaking meant anything for me as an individual, &#34;Blade Runner&#34; was responsible for that.  Every frame, word, action and character is etched in my mind. I could feel and taste the world that both Scott and Dick created soo vividly and with such creativity and imagination. I don't think that I would go to far in saying that both the movie and novel are a work of genius. To this day, besides &#34;The Lord Of The Rings&#34; movie trilogy (and books), no other movie has come close to having as special a meaning to me personally as &#34;Blade Runner&#34;.But Scott had been thinkering with the movie's final cut for years, and an ultimate, final, version (with some added footage) was rumoured to be in the works. When sure enough &#34;Blade Runner The Final Cut&#34; was announced, I was in heaven.  I was there when it had its limited release in theatres.  I managed to find an old-movietheatre that was playing a night time screening of the movie, sometime in the fall of 2007, it was raining and the movietheatre's retro-noir like architecture fit perfectly with the whole &#34;Blade Runner&#34; atmosphere and its look.  I so enjoyed that evenning and then I proceeded to purchase this ultimate collection which is the definitive and proper tribute to &#34;Blade Runner&#34; and all those involved in its making.  I also got the special edition soundtrack, Vangelis's simple but beautifully monumental ode to the unforgetable world of &#34;Blade Runner&#34;I cannot recomend this movie highly enough, nor do I have the words to properly encapsulate what it means to me. But if you are a sci-fi fan, a Phillip K. Dick reader, or a &#34;Blade Runner&#34; aficionado, do yourself a favour and get either this collection or or others, be it DVD or Blu-ray, or digital download, whatever.  In our world of tigger-quick, schizoid moviemaking and watching, &#34;Blade Runner&#34; sticks out as a shinning example of what the power of story telling married with stunning visuals and really one of a kind special effects (yes even in this era of CGI effects, the ones on &#34;Blade Runner&#34; still rule), a great cast and extraordinary source material (by the way get the novel also) can be!	5.0	Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?	2013-06-13	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AHL35XZ3OND2Z	Adron Gardner	"***This review covers the Blu-Ray set***THE FILMA somewhat loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a half detective story, half sci-fi film.Blade Runner was probably one of the most expensive experimental films of all time.  It is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful, coming from a photographer, those words cary a good deal of meaning.  While as a story or even some of the performances,  dont always fire on all cylinders, there is a certain mystery and  powerful visual majesty to fill any lapses in dramatic pitch.Ridley Scott cut his teeth as a filmmaker on commercials and watching Jordan Cornenweth's powerful cinematography, one definitely feels Blade Runner is a sort of commercial.  For what, we just don't know.  Sure there are meditations on humanity, inevitability and choice, but there isn't a real cohesive exploration or dialogue on any of these subjects.  I think this ambiguity is probably the main reason Blade Runner has been such an  enduring journey.  For sure, there are genuinely tender, magical and powerful moments to the film.  In short, Blade Runner is what it is. It is a film that the viewer takes home what they bring to it.THE QUALITYI have owned several DVD and VHS releases of the movie through the years as many others and much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this Blu-Ray release provs how lucky we are to have High Def.  On my 42"" plasma, the film is rapturous.  The shafts of light and the blue hues really make you feel as if your peering into the world before you.  The blues are deep and the contrast is strong.There is grain and some missed focus, but the challenges the crew must have had shooting Panavision anamorphic in those days with such little light at times must have been a real challenge for the focus pullers.  If anything, on the grain, it only enhances the film's gritty feel.  Neither of these small observations have any real impact on the picture's quality or overall sharpness.Having upgraded to High-Def relatively recently, I have the same set for DVD and going back and fourth, there are some scenes that show a real hike in quality and detail.  This is one of those films where you watch it and aren't always conscious of the difference between HD and SD UNTIL you go back and watch the SD.  You really find it is impossible to go back. I'm glad I made the purchase.CONCLUSIONLike most great films, Blade Runner is not for everybody.  It is a supreme exercise in production and photography over drama, but that hasn't made the film any less powerful.  It was worth every penny to pick this up and it is easily one of the best releases you can get on HD right now."	5.0	Slick, luminous and worth every penny	2009-01-14	1	1	0

Geller	"My wife bought this for me for Christmas (I had to sign into her account because she was the one who purchased it) and this collectors edition is one of the best gifts I have ever received!  I have been a fan of this film for, well, 25 years and I my appreciation has just grown over the years.  After viewing the collectors edition though, I have a whole new outlook on this very influential movie.For those other ""Blade-philes"" out there - I read Paul Sammon's book cover to cover and was only able to imagine all that he wrote about.  Now I was able to experience it first hand.  Not only do you get all these versions  of the movie (Theatrical, Director's cut, International cut, work-print , and Final Cut) but you also get hours of interviews from the actors, director, crew... you get screen tests, art work, behind the scenes footage, extra scenes - I mean it just goes on and on.  It is extremely thorough and the attention to detail is apparent in every respect - packaging, design, content etc... I'm sure Mr. Sammon must have had a hand in this release.  I still haven't finished watching every disc - it truly is the gift that keeps on giving !  Sorry to gush so much, I have never seen anything on the market that goes this in-depth with the making of a film before - and the fact that this much care went into a Blade Runner collector's edition is a dream come true!The only thing that I don't see in this collection (maybe I just haven't gotten to it yet - but it doesn't appear in the booklet that describes the contents) is, surprisingly, any insight to the sound track.  I am not a big Vangelis fan, however, his work on the sound track was great and extremely appropriate (except for the awful end credits theme - really the only thing that dates this movie).One last word - the Final Cut itself looks amazing - the restoration / enhancement was very noticeable.It seems to me that the only low scores for this collection had to do will packaging deformities (i.e. missing discs etc...) and not the content it self.  In short, can't recommend it highly enough - a must have for any Blade Runner fan!"	5.0	Way exceeded my expectations!	2008-01-06	1	1	0

If you want the ""working"" cut, you either have to go to the ""ultimate"" collection and pay $30 more, or buy one of the HD releases, which offer the five disc collection in a non ""ultimate"" edition for just $3 more than the four disc version.Looks like they're starting to push HD by offering extra features in teh HD releases.  This may be a repeat of earlier campaigns where the studios try to push people to go out and buy many of the same movies they already have again, only in the new format."	3.0	Movie's great, but why no 5 disc version in SD?	2007-10-12	31	21	10
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1DTCJV6KOMJOA	A*	I could never make it through this cold, special effects driven film and I know why. It's is just plain uneven! The effects left such a major impact that the film never allows the script-if there was one to develop. Ridley Scott is known for this kind of style but he seems to have allowd a little bit of growth over the years, but this is an earlier work and it's so cold that you need a parka to watch it!! The first few times I fell asleep watching this &quot;film&quot; and going in I was wide awake. All the elments in this film just don't mold. There are some directors who meet the mediums of both style and substance such as Proyas and Burton. The film does have it's shinning moments but alas all that glitters isn't gold. I do give Scott credit the final scenes make the movie a must buy and it desrves to be an underground classic. But what truly makes this film a purchase is the atmosphere. The pitch black shadows only being lit by the neon lights of a long abandoned earth. The planet is now being used for criminals and the rejects. Harrison tracks down the robotic made criminals and kills them with an eagle eye vengance! But is harrison a robot himself? The film does have the romance and emotional depth  but it is played in a sorta pseudo color film noir style! You HAVE to pay attention and even think ahead at times to keep up! Daunting? Yes! But mesmerizing, non the less!	4.0	The Blade in Blade Runner is a little dull!	2001-06-08	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2RS1QURRZ2HK3	Aj	BRDC is, in my opinion, one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. But what troubles me is that this movie could have been more if its makers were given a few million dollars more. Even though there are a very noticable amount of errors (script inconsistancies, dubbing, visual problems), this movie still shines from a VERY solid performance by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, who plays Roy Batty, the lead of his replicant clan. Another solid performance is given by Joe Turkle, who plays God with his character, Eldon Tyrell.  If you live for visuals in movies, this movie will have you spellbounded. From the opening scene, you are treated to 2 hours of pure bliss. CG scenes and miniatures are eye candy, and enhances the movie's feel.  Ridley Scott's futuristic epic is a must for anyone who even remotly enjoys a good sci-fi flick. I think the film should be redone, and retrofitted with better F/X, have the scenes and characters who were deleted due to budget cuts, and have the parallel story that is in WESTWOOD STUDIOS' adaption of the movie. Both are astounding and will forever hold a place on my shelf, and in my heart.  END	5.0	&quot;BLADE RUNNER: DC&quot; IS EYE CANDY AND  MAKES YOU THINK	1998-06-15	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1M9UVOATFLAT9	Alexis Perrin	Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's famous novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?&quot;, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to retire five genetically engineered syborgues, known as &quot;Replicants&quot;. In 1982, the director, Ridley Scott, found himself at the center of a storm around his production of Blade Runner. After clashes with studio executives over the film's complex content and downbeat finale, Scott added a voiceover narration and a more positive ending. But &quot;Blade Runner&quot; fell victim to negative reviews and a poor box office. It wasn't until the early 1990s that the director's cut, the final version, was finally released on videocassette, and the film was recognized as a science-fiction masterpiece...Born in England in 1937, Ridley Scott were one of the most promising directors of the late 1970s with films like &quot;The Duellists&quot; (1977) that won the Jury Prize for Best First Feature at the Cannes Film Festival and, above all, &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), the first episode of the famous tetralogy. Directing &quot;Blade Runner&quot; in 1982, he certainly realised his career masterpiece. About twenty years later, we can affirm he is a great and an eclectic director who has tackled many kinds of film as the historical epic (&quot;Gladiator&quot; / 2000 / five Academy Awards, one of whom was the best director award for Scott), the historic film (&quot;1492 : Conquest of Paradise&quot; / 1992), the road movie (&quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; / 1991) or also the science-fiction film (&quot;Blade Runner&quot; / &quot;Alien&quot;).  Blade Runner's actors and actresses are also pretty good ones especially Harrison Ford. This one acted in about 50 movies : among them, the most famous are &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; (1981, 1984 and 1989), &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), &quot;Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986) or also &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993). Though they are not pretty famous, the actor Rutger Hauer who acted the leader of the five replicants and the actresses Sean Young who acted an android and Daryl Hannah, a replicant, are also exceptionnal in this movie.I suggest you a short summary of Blade Runner : in a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants, human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth but with fixed lifespans. In Los Angeles, 2019, Deckard is a &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, a cop who specialises in terminating replicants. Originally in retirement, he is forced to re-enter the force when five replicants escape from an offworld colony to Earth. Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired.In order to conclude, I will try to make a review of this marvellous masterpiece named &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.  On top of being well-directed and well-adapted from this great book of Dick, this movie can enjoy a splendid original soundtrack by the famous composer Vangelis, who also arranged the soundtracks of &quot;the Chariots of Fire&quot; (he won an Oscar) and &quot;1492&quot;, that consists mainly in jazz and blues illustrating perfectly the dark atmosphere of Scott's movie. Concerning the dialogues, the lasts lines of the replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) are engraved on my memory forever :&quot;Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. I've seen things... you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams... glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate. All those moments will be lost... in time... like tears... in the rain.&quot;Moreover, the special effects are exceptionnal especially in the opening credits : the best sci-fi scene I have ever seen (tied with the ending of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;) ! The texts, the apocalyptic pan of Los Angeles then the interrogation ... I think that I was very clear about this film. Watch it ! Everybody can watch it because it questions what it is to be human and why life is so precious.	5.0	A masterpiece !	2001-04-20	6	4	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AOSVLOCWK1PT5	Alex Meyer Lock	My advice to anyone wanting to experience this film is to watch both versions.  The origional gives more of the noir experience, (despite what some say about the voice over it does lend to understanding parts of the  story for the uninitiated) and is a classic in it's own right.  Scott's cut  on the other hand offers a more plausible and suitable ending to the film,  and adds enough extra to more strongly hint at the possibility of Deckard  being a replicant.  The director's cut also has a bit more  &quot;depth&quot; to it than the origional... you do need to think more to  get it, but that's the main reason I suggest you see both versions.  The  unicorn dream sequence was an excellent edition in my opinion.  I  honestly wish WB would release the origional widescreen and the director's  cut on a single disc so people could experience both.  I loved the  director's cut, the only glaring omission from the DVD is Dolby Digital 5.1  sound.  This movie was MADE to be remasterd in DD.  I'm quite disappointed  at the stereo only (not even prologic I think) soundtrack.  This is the  only thing that keeps me (and I should hope others) from giving the DVD a 5  star rating.	4.0	See both the origional AND director's cut!	2000-01-01	73	67	6

It is has the brilliant visuals which you'd normally expect from director Ridley Scott combined with an excellent soundtrack by Vangelis. Good script, acting and special effects.This 'Cut' of the film is more in the way of what the director intended it to be as opposed to what the executives/studios wanted. The narration and 'happy ending' that spoilt the original release have thankfully been removed. This makes for a more intelligent and thought provoking film.This DVD release is good. Picture quality is fine, but could be better. Audio - Dolby Digital 2.0 - does the job. It does lack the extras that you'd expect from many new releases these days, but with a film this good extras aren't that important.	4.0	A great sci-fi film!!!	2001-04-20	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A22TOWDE3XR79X	almora	"The collections it's really great, the extras are spectacular, don't miss this item, it's a most if you are a fan.The beauty about the good science fiction it's that craft a poetic view of our self, a world were we can achieve the edge of our potential.Here we are talking about one of the most influential pictures in all the movie history.  ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""The Matrix"", ""Akira"", ""The Fifth Element"", and many others, don't exist whit out this Sci-fi epic, that's put the cyberpunk literary genera on movies (please don't William Gibson forget ""Neuromancer"" as indispensable contribution of the genera) , and established its self as a cannon.More than 25 years after its release this movie looks all brand new. like Citizen Kane, Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, because like any other truly master peace it's a reflection of his own time, also it is a critic, to all the previous and subsequent art, at the same time it is a critic to itself, that's why the real classics are above of time and space and always feels alive.Ridley Scot creates an indispensable cult reference. understand perfectly Phillip K. Dick short story (besides he refuse to ever read the original story), and all the Sci-fi of the 60's and 70's, we present a perfect distopia, like any boroughs character, Dekard is tiered of the decadence sounded him, besides that, but in a small way the big corporations made some small rolls, you can see, trade marks like Coca-Cola, Panam, Malboro, and many others.He used technology as a stetic and artistic element also as part of the narrative structure. The incredible and retro productions design, set decoration, the avant garde special effects, the cloths, the vehicles, the voight kamp treatment device, in resume, any visual idea, any object in film transport you to a dream reality, to a nostalgic space in side your brain.Harrison Ford and Rutter Hauer crafted awesome performances. Also, the rest of the cast are perfect, I can not imagine any other actor to play the role of some of which they appear in the film.The groundbreaking soundtrack of the Vangelis, put the right atmosphere. When you hear the music its make you feel like if you're  looking to a Rene Magritte canvas. Its the world that you see whit your eyes every day, but something it is not correct in some subconscience level, and annoying you in a very subtle way, also developed in side you the sensation of expansion whit out not boundaries.This its truly science fiction, no fantasy like Star Wars (I am saying this not as an insult, its only editorial comparation), because Blade Runner talks about human condition, if you read the screen play and tray to made a resume of the plot, you only would see the history of a police officer who tray to kill some replicants (androids), but if you made a reflection, you will see that this picture represents the internal and eternal fight to try to define the essence of the human condition, using a futurist scene and characters in parts of robots with human actions and emotions to make patent the point in comment, all time  you know that robots don't exist, as they appear in the movie, but at the same time you can't avoid to identify your self whit the characters, and to see with greater clarity your own complexity in the process.You can't understand any Sci-fi movie and any movie, whit out this poetic and beautiful masterpiece."	5.0	Blade Runner 25 th aniversary edition (five disc collection edition)	2008-01-19	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AH4SL0YL5AQVU	Alric the Red	By the time Roy Batty dies, he has made peace with his engineered fate, that his manufactured four-year lifespan was ending.  Upon relinguishing his life, Batty releases the dove he had been clutching, his soulful metaphor, which escapes into the gray sky.  The implication is that Batty's compassion for Deckard manifested his humanity, and thus earned him an afterlife.  It was a poetically masterful conclusion to a cinematic masterpiece of science fiction.  Most fans of science fiction will agree that this is one fine film, proof of what can be done with the genre when it's taken seriously, as something that can appeal to grownups.  About that, we can pretty much concur.  The contention begins when we discuss which version is better: The original theatrical release, or this Director's Cut.  Look at some of these other reviews and you'll see what I mean.The theatrical version is now out of print (it was on VHS).  I have it and I've seen it countless times.  I also have this Director's Cut DVD, and I've seen it countless times, too.  What some of the other reviewers have failed to mention, or have glossed over without explanation, is HOW the two versions differ.  First, the noir-like voice-over is omitted in the Director's Cut, as was Deckard's fly-away escape with Rachel, the final scene in the original.  Second, there is an added scene in which Deckard falls asleep at his piano and dreams of a unicorn running through a verdant wilderness.  Though they seem minor changes, these omissions and additions change the movie to the degree that the two versions are entirely different films.  In the original, Deckard's and Rachel's escape implies their living happily ever after.  In the Director's Cut, Deckard himself is a replicant, he and Rachel both doomed by the four-year lifespan.  To fans of the original film, the conclusion of the Director's Cut is hard to swallow.  I know: I was one of them, and when I first viewed the Director's Cut, I didn't even see what is now glaringly obvious.  Viewing the original edition so often had biased my perceptions; I simply couldn't see it in any way other than how I initially interpreted it.  But via discussions in the Blade Runner newsgroup I came to think and accept otherwise.  Deckard was a replicant.  The proof is distilled from three points: Deckard's dream of the unicorn; the memories implanted by the replicants' manufacturers into the minds of the replicants to give them a sense of an extended lifespan; and the final origami -- a unicorn -- discovered by Deckard as he and Rachel escape.  There are other clues, for sure, but these cinch it: Deckard's dream was known to someone besides himself, just as he had known Rachel's private memories in detail, because they orginally belonged to Tyrell's niece.  After a period of adjustment, I've come to prefer the Director's Cut.  It's a more nuanced film.  Also, this is truer to the director's vision, and that's a good thing in this case, like a mistake corrected.  It's less happy-ending Hollywood.  I haven't watched the original version since I bought this DVD.As for the DVD itself, it's a two-sided disc, with a widescreen presentation on one side and fullscreen on the other.  The image quality is superior to that of the VHS edition, of course.  The yearning soundtrack by Vangelis, so integrated into the whole experience, is enhanced by the digital rendering.  For DVD extras, there's not much here in the form of special features -- &quot;production notes&quot; the only real extra, stuff you read; not really that special -- but for now, this is the only available edition of this great film.  And it's more than enough, if you love films by directors with visionary ambition.On a hopeful note for those of you favoring the original theatrical release, I understand there's a special edition DVD package planned that'll include both versions of the film, both digitally corrected in a couple of spots -- those of us cult-like aficionados are painfully aware of some glaring continuity errors -- along with a few other goodies as extras (REAL extras, such as a director's commentary).  But there's no official release date as of yet.  For now, if you don't have the original release on VHS you're tough out of luck.  But having to settle for this Director's Cut isn't a bad deal: It's as close to the director's original vision as you'll get for now.	5.0	Like Tears in the Rain	2004-06-15	18	16	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AEQMXKCI6NTOQ	"Amazon Customer ""bjorn-toby-wilde"""	The BLADE RUNNER Director's Cut on DVD has a strange feature. On one side is a widescreen version and on the other side is the pan-and-scan version. Why?  The two sides would have been better utilized with one side as a  widescreen version of the director's cut and the other side as a widescreen  version of the original cut with Decker's voiceover narrative. That would  have allowed us BLADE RUNNER enthusiasts to compare the two versions and  fan the argument on which is the better version.I also agree with the  reviewer that would've liked more of the extras that a lot of the better  DVDs have nowadays. I have no idea what the Special Edition will be like. I  just wish I knew about it before I got this one.As for whether the film  itself is worth owning, of course it is. BLADE RUNNER is now a classic.  There's a reason why it's still a bestseller 18 years after its initial  release in the theaters. I highly doubt THE MATRIX will be discussed at the  same length 18 years from now.	3.0	Not as good as it could have been	2000-02-08	4	3	1

Can't get enough of those...

The movie is, of course, a masterpiece that looks beautiful in the DVD format. If that's all you want, the DVD is perfect. However, if you're a Blade Runner fan or simply love the extras on DVDs, you'll feel like I do; that there is so much more that could have been added to this DVD: like deleted scenes or a &quot;making of&quot; feature or even a couple of original movie trailers... but no, just some &quot;interactive menus&quot;... disappointing...	2.0	Bad DVD, Great Movie	2000-09-23	13	11	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3NO2RWF1X7F62	Amazon Customer	All the top reviews are of various editions of the film, so I thought I'd drop a review of the film itself.This, singlehandedly, is the greatest scifi film of all time.its genius is in its presentation of an unforgettable, frighteningly realizeable future world. it isn't just scifi, existential, noir, etc. it's all those things, like the real world. and like the real world, it doesn't exist to serve you the viewer, it exists independently of you, and meaning exists beneath the daily routines. Bladerunner, at its heart, is a simple enough detective story, but told with a master scifi artist's eye. bleakness, of light and hope, is its theme. paucity, of wealth and words, is its truth. monolithic corporations is its great adversary, not roy batty. overpopulation is the fatal flaw and, ultimately, humanity is the protagonist that may or may not survive, not just rick deckard. the romance wasn't sizzling - just an unsteady desperation that was just the right tempo for the world they lived in. and have you ever felt so heartbroken over the final defeat of the antagonist/victory of the hero? truly roy batty was one of the great complex characters in cinema.Bladerunner is the alpha and omega of future noir - its better has not been seen since, and certainly not before. but it isn't for everyone. if you like your movies combustion heavy with much sprinting and mouth breathing, steer clear. This is a comparatively slow burn that subtly warps your worldview if you care even a bit about the fate of the world in which you live.	5.0	and infiltration of the mind	2014-07-02	0	0	0

We made them to do our dirty work, and to avoid their rebeliom we give them a short lifespan. We play god and toy with their lifes, we love them, we kill them.

I first saw the movie when I was around ten and afterwards had an irrational fear of albinos for many years. The reason I added another star for this version is because they finally removed the ridiculous narration. I don't know why it was there in the first place. Almost like sitting through a power point slide show where the instructor simply reads off the slides. The audience does not need everything handed to them. Much better to imagine what's going through the characters mind than to have it spelled out for you.Visually stunning even after all this time. I remember watching an old bootleg and wishing for a clean version. Dark and brilliant story about humanity and what separates us from other intelligence.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1V89BW8JORC7P	Amazon Customer	Blade Runner is one of those films that seems to transcend movie making. A blend of science fiction and mystery, mixed with such a moody atmosphere that the viewer is both mystified and nearly overwhelmed at every turn, the film is definitely one that should be seen if you haven't yet. Mix that with fantastic attention to detail in every scene and outstanding acting (has Rutger ever done a better job?), the film is one to be viewed over and over. Top 10.The 4-version package is a wonderful plus. While the changes in the final cut to the director's are few, there are a couple nice touches that help define the characters just that much more. And yes, the final cut is still without the film noir voice-over, for those who can't quite find that info on the studio descriptions.Must buy, particularly at the price.	5.0	Classic film in a great package	2011-06-23	1	0	1

And the price can't be beat.Sure, the story line of the movie could have been a little cleaner and tighter - even some of the people closely involved in the making of the movie admit that, but, while the movie is running, it's hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Just think, not even the people who saw the original theatrical screening of this movie were treated to such clarity - such visual and audio depth.My recommendation - make some popcorn, fire up the big scren, dim the lights, and curl up with someone you love.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2OP3595X4ZX6	Amazon Customer	With the release of the Director's Cut for this film, it has now attained classic status.  I would argue that those who prefer the original didn't understand the point of the movie in the first place.  Ford's voice over in  the original was directly contradictory to the &quot;who's the hero?&quot;  theme of the movie (by the way, it ain't Ford).  The cheesy ending in the  original also buried this theme.Some have argued that the removal of  Ford's voice over makes the film hard to follow, but the voice over makes  the film *impossible* to follow on the thematic level by burying the main  theme and making Ford look like your typical action movie hero.  So however  &quot;hard to follow&quot; the Director's Cut is, it's vastly preferable to  the incongruent original version.Of course, the original version was  notable for its imagery and cinematography, but if you want to understand  this film, the director's cut is essential.	5.0	Now a Classic...forget the original version.	1999-11-15	8	7	1

The elements that really buy this film to such epic proportions is it's Brilliant dark murky yet dense execution of a future los Angeles  also compained by a powerful complex intricate  and fascinating script with lots of fascinating sub-themes and connations and symbolism which although i didn't always quite spot when i heard of them it made me look back and see just how inspired these writers were  not only that the way the elements are mixed together film noir ,romance action-adventure and philosphy and existenal themes of life how long  we have to live it and the moral boundaries we posess as humans and how our prejudices and advances can in a way dehumanize or desentize us to common murder and the subtle way the film builds suspense is great.  Performance-wise no one really does a bad job Harrison Ford is perfect as Deckard he starts off the right amount of dry wit and reserved moody attitude but he turns more emotional and vigourous and commandering as the film goes by . Sean Young although not one of hollywood's most famous actresses brings the right amount of feisty and tender vunerability to the role and overall does excellent work and Ruget Hauer is phenomal as Roy Batty bringing the emotions of curiousity, intensity ruthlessness, wonder , sophistacation , desperation and fear and anguish and vegance together wonderfully and Daryl hannah holds her own well as Pris and johanna Cassiday is very tough fesity ,edgy and exotic as Zhora and Edward james Olmos as Gaff who is mostly slient still manages to be effective due to his unique way of communicating with Deckard with his orgamis and delivers one of the film's final lines very well and the guy who played Taffey Lewis was great too .  Fianlly the action sequences were very intense and realistic and were coordinated very well and not felt akward or out of place and the music by Vangelis was very good setting the tone very well as it communicates our emotions in a sense it has that mystical feel of awe when the film 1st opens and the sultry tone it has when Deckard starts to fall for Deckard and it has operatic crescendo feel when Batty attacks Tyrell and the fast-paced techhno-feel at the end was nice and the technology created for the film was very creative and well-used within the context of the film. Overall Blade runner is a perfectly excellent film with beautiful visuals fantastic rich writing great acting great score and very imagnative and exotic feel to it definitely worth checking out can't wait to see that blu-ray! 10 out of 10  "" All those moments will be lost like tears in the rain."""	5.0	powerful smart observant cerebal sci-fi decetive film	2010-11-19	1	1	0

I love a good sci-fi flick even if it is not a huge budget blockbuster like I Robot, etc. And even though I am no sci-fi book buff, I did read Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and loved it, own the Mark Waid graphic novel adaptation of it. Having never seen this movie that was loosely based on it, I thought I was sure to enjoy this.Wrong. First of all, the dialogue failed in so many ways that the book succeeds - in making you sympathize with Androids wishing for autonomy and struggling to pass themselves off as human, for bounty hunter Deckard and his internal conflicts of ""retiring"" these rogue androids, and even the devastating effects of radiation on Earth and its cities that are marching forward into an essentially hopeless future, etc etc. It just falls flat without good dialogue or narraration.I can forgive the 1982 special effects of course, it was not bad for the time. I can also forgive how the trajactory of the story is different without certain elements they decided to omit altogether, like the religious of Mercerism that many adhere to and was significant in the book's storyline, the practice highlighted in the book of owning animals to preserve some humanity or avoid social stigma, etc. Overall though, for me the movie was a depressing, bleak (but without much context), and creepy attempt at honoring a fantastic sci-fi novel."	3.0	Borderline boring and depressing	2013-08-15	14	5	9

Harrison Ford plays a futuristic Philip Marlowe type character, hired to track down some runaway and villainous human cyborgs. A moody and dark picture, it captures a pretty bleak image of the future, but carries some touching sentiments about the endearing qualities and failures of human beings, and the films climax is both touching and memorable. Initially a little disjointed at the beginning of the picture, and at times surreal in directorial quality it is nonetheless an exceptional movie, with an excellent script, and cast - Sean Young plays the very beautiful romantic interest, and there are also some early outings for Daryl Hannah, and Rutgar Hauer. Although the Sfx are somewhat behind today's computer aided wonders, the fact remains that this is a very well made and believable movie. As if this weren't recommendation enough the film also contains a stunning soundtrack by Vangelis, which was not actually released until recently. There are several versions available including wide screen and DVD but be warned however this more recent ""Directors Cut"" release was actually a bad idea, cutting Fords talkovers, and leaving more questions than it set out to answer from the original movie.

Could also be a good thing, because the filmmakers made it their own thing and came up with something original.*It is a slower movie, based more on style and mood than on action.Film-noir joins forces with futuristic sci-fi to bring us a bleak but fantastic vision of the future.

All I can say is that this movie continues to amaze me the more I watch it.  Special effects done over 20 years ago were optics and models, and they appear just as crisp and clean as anything computer generated would appear now.  I can't believe how the images constantly jump off the screen at me, and the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is just as amazing as the visuals.My only complaint is that the movie starts playing with a default Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack when I pop it in my player, and I have to manually use a pop-up menu to choose the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It seems that with lossless soundtracks being the default standard for 99.99% of Blu-ray releases that the TrueHD soundtrack would be the first one to start playing on any machine (as all Blu-ray machines can down-mix that soundtrack to standard Dolby Digital for receivers that don't support TrueHD).	5.0	Stands up to any modern Sci-Fi movie yet made	2011-10-06	2	2	0

Then I watched each version, and now I absolutely love it.  I've seen all the features save for disc 2's bonus thing.But here's my complaint... I spent 50 dollars, to get this, and I get two original versions (US and International), a Director's Cut, a Final Cut, and a SUPER DUPER RARE ULTRA AWESOME Workprint Release... and it's all the same.The cuts have no differences in scenes.  The only major differences are sorted into two camps: crappy happy ending and Ford's voiceover narration (US and International), and noirish ending without voiceover narration (everything else).The other differences are so miniscule you'd barely notice.  Aside from digital enhancing and such, they've done little more than tweak and move things around, change some things here, fix other things, ""restore"" things that you would barely even notice if they didn't boldly proclaim it, fix some dialogue that leaves the fate of the fifth and sixth replicants unknown, as well spending who knows how much money on SUPER DUPER AWESOME TECHNOLOGY just to get Harrison Ford's son to come in, mouth some dialogue, and digitally place his mouth over Deckard's during the scene where he questions the snake dealer, because apparently his mouth didn't originally sync up with the dialogue.As great a movie as this is, and whichever version you prefer (sadly for me, I hate the happy ending, love the Director's Cut ending, and yet I hate the lack of narration, preferring the feel it gives to the film), it's simply not a very good deal to spend 50 dollars for a fifth version of the same thing you get in four other versions of the movie."	5.0	Five versions of the same movie?!	2008-05-02	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Remember that scene at the end of `The Silence of the Lambs' where Clarice is in the creepy old house and you just know that Wild Bill is lurking around every dusty corner?  Remember how your heart all but stopped while the scene was running, how you gripped the arm rests in fear as you told yourself over and over again that it was all going to end well; that Clarice was going to get the bad guy and save the girl and whatever else you had to tell yourself in order to make it through?Gather those feelings and relish in them, because that is precisely what every moment of `Blade Runner' feels like.The film takes place in the near future (eleven years to be exact) in the year 2019.  Man has created an equal to themselves, human clones known as replicants, who, equipped with fixed life-spans, can work in the colonies outside of Earth.  When a bloody mutiny breaks out these replicants are labeled illegal.  When a few of these clones escape their Off-World Colony by stealing a ship and make their way to Earth, an ex-Blade Runner (police officers dispatched to hunt down and terminate replicants) named Deckard is asked to come back into the game in order to get rid of them.The kicker with the film, and really what makes it so much more than just a science fiction/action film is the fact that the replicants don't know that they are not human.  They are practically human (except they are not programmed to express human emotion, although they have the capability to learn how to) and so they fear death just as much as you or I.If one looks at `Blade Runner' simply as an action film or a science fiction masterpiece they are bound to be satisfied.  As far as run of the mill blockbusters are concerned, Scott's visionary epic is at the top of the pack; by a long shot.  It is beautifully shot, it is fast paced and thrilling.  The acting is actually very good considering the genre and the usual messy performances that come with.  But, if you take a minute to look at `Blade Runner' as something deeper than all that you come to experience an entirely different and ultimately more rewarding film.  Yes, if you dissect the humanity captures within the films core you will find a very thought provoking film that gropes at our very feelings towards life and death.I remember recalling Sean Penn's devastating words at the end of `Dean Man Walking', where he said that killing is never okay.Instant chills.`Blade Runner' has a style that is probably the films greatest focal point.  To say that Ridley Scott (totally snubbed of an Oscar) is the star of the show is an understatement.  The film is like a really gritty `Fifth Element' with enough horror and even a little noir thrown in for good measure.  Scott effortlessly pans across a universe that seems strangely distant yet almost too real.  We can see ourselves there even if we don't want to.  My best friend told me that `Blade Runner' is his favorite film because it seems too probable.Harrison Ford is brilliantly cast, lending the film his masculine charm.  Rutger Haur is terrifying yet overtly sympathetic at the films end, and Sean Young is devastatingly powerful as Rachael, the `special' replicant who is coming to terms with her own reality.  Daryl Hannah also turns in a great performance as Pris, a beautiful replicant who is as dangerous as she is intoxicating.Everything about `Blade Runner' is stunning, from the set pieces to the actors who inhabit them, and to judge a film on pure surface value alone would place this picture towering above many; but when you add the satisfying substance that marks this films core you can see why `Blade Runner' is considered one of the greatest films of all time.  It has everything, and it delivers everywhere.	5.0	A look at life, eleven years into the future...	2008-10-14	2	2	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A326TH21VE2NPY	Andrew Kotwicki	I personally like the director's cut better.  It is missingHarrison Ford's narration which, quite frankly, stated the obvious,and it removes the corny happy ending that distorts the overall tone of the film, which was supposed to be dark and dismal.  It might also help you to know that a shot of Deckard dreaming of a unicorn was also included in the director's cut, hinting Deckard's existence as a replicant at the conclusion of the film.  People say that editors have power over all, but &quot;Blade Runner: The Director's Cut&quot; is Ridley Scott's version.  I'll have you know that Ridley Scott strongly objected to the version of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; released in 1982. The narration and ending was added in by Warner Bros. executives, hoping to get a better reception from audiences.  Both the narration and the ending ruined the film's artistic qualities, and it ruined &quot;Blade Runner&quot; by preventing it from being the film it was supposed to be, which is a thinking man's sci-fi film.  Better still, it is missing the bits of violence included on the original videotape release(a shot of Roy Batty pushing Tyrell's eyes back into his head), which I felt, ruined the overall enjoyment of the film.  I was annoyed at the lack of extras on this DVD, as well as the sound, which is a standard Dolby Surround track.  But the picture quality makes up for everything.  Thanks to anamorphic enhancement, which allows an incredible amount of detail into the picture, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; now looks better than ever!  I'm suprised people were dissapointed in it.  I would give this DVD 5 stars, had they included extras of any kind.  That annoyed me, yes, but the picture quality is stunning.  I heard that they are preparing a special edition of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; for DVD.  That would be great, although I am quite content with the existing version.  I also heard they are preparing a special edition of Ridley Scott's &quot;Legend&quot;.  It was torture watching the American version, and would be more than happy to see Scott's vision of what the film should be!	4.0	An excellent film given good treatment on DVD.	2000-02-12	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ADENUJJYKNHPO	Andrew Salmon	"Just finished watching the final cut of the film and want to give this set my highest recommendation. I opted for this 4-disc version because of price and because it had everything the 5-disc version has except the rough version and the toys, which are both nice, but I can live without.The first thing that jumps out is how stunningly clear the picture is! I don't have blu-ray of HD, just standard DVD and the picture on the final cut really was cleaned up frame by frame. No scratches, no dirt. I won't say bright color because it's not that kind of movie, but clearly defined color and a sharp image. For the night scenes and interiors, the sharpness really helps as you can clearly see what's going on and the neon highlights frame every outside shot. When Zhora goes through the window, the neon framing is spellbinding. And, yes, they did fix the shot. It looks great if you haven't seen the movie, but if you're familiar with the scene your brain gets into a tug of war because the new insertion looks real but you've got the mental image in your mind of the stunt woman with the bad wig. Messes with your head a little. Also they claim they did the same restoration on ALL the versions available but I watched the 1982 US Theatrical version first and, although it looked great, it looked nowhere near as good as the Final Cut version.One of the things I noticed for the first time on this super clean version is the jerk of a camera cut I never noticed before. I really wish they could have fixed this because it jars the viewer out of the scene. When Deckard pulls his gun on Leon and gets it slapped out of his hand, the image jerks for a fraction of a second. I had to go frame by frame to solve this little mystery and found the cut: When Deckard pulls the gun, his tie comes up with it. When Leon slaps it out of his hand, his tie is down. As the tie, in the up position is right in the middle of the frame and can be clearly viewed now, when it snaps down it affects the scene. They clearly combined two takes of the scene and did it very well -- just not seamlessly. I mean they got rid of the spinner cables, fixed Zhora, but left this little camera jerk during a great scene. It sounds minor, I know, but when you watch the movie, it'll get you. I don't know if this has been something Blade Runner fans have been talking about for years or not, but it was the first time I noticed it.The narration is gone. This was my first time watching it without the narration and it played fine. I DO like the narration as well because I'm a sucker for old film noir and love the elements from The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep and countless other classics that are woven into the film. I didn't think I'd like the movie without the narration but I did though I'm also glad to have both versions on the set. And Scott went with ""I want more life... father."" Which I think works better but they were not able to synch Hauer's mouth to the word.The sound is also incredible! And that's, again, on a standard TV. No home theater of surround sound. If you've got these things, the movie will rock!What's added only enhances the movie. There are no big additions. Just fixing of effects, changing Zhora, giving the bird something a whole lot better to fly up to at the end. All of the effect additions are subtle. They make everything look real, which is the whole point, right?If you're thinking of picking up one of the several hundred version that just came out, I think you'll come away with a new appreciation for the film. The clarity of image and sound reveal things you've never seen before no matter how many times you've seen the movie. They did a stellar job on the restoration. Plus the 3 and a half hour making of, 45 minutes of deleted scenes never shown in ANY version of the film, and featurettes on just about anything you can imagine related to the film. And you find out, once and for all, how Scott wanted us to view Deckard -- human or replicant.If you've been waiting to see Blade Runner done right, the wait is over. It's not perfect (see above), but it's the best it's ever been. This is a great set, well worth the price!"	5.0	Blade Runner Done Right!	2007-12-27	11	9	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A38PC1H0VW52V4	Andy Meneses	Before seeing this movie i had a lot of different assumptions about it. I knew that it was somewhat of a classic now and i knew i really liked Ridley Scott so i expected to really like it. I also thought it was going to be somewhat of an epic sci-fi action film. It turned out to be a lot different than i expected. The film was on a smaller scale than i expected. The setting of the film was less important than the story unfolding in it. Admittedly i didn't like it as much as i was expecting but it was still really good. Even though the style or genre of the film was different than i was expecting i liked it for that very reason. The way i look at it there are the films that have extraordinary settings and the plot sort of shows it off. Star Wars is a good example of this. The plot involved many aspects of the setting like light speed travel and large space wars. Blade Runner on the other hand was simply a detective story that just happened to take place in the future. Most of the events in the story could very easily happen now. Again, i didnt like it as much as i thought i would but i liked it a lot, just in a different way i was expecting. I definitely want to watch this film again to see i how like it, knowing what to expect.	4.0	Blade Runner	2008-11-27	2	1	1

Ridley Scott originally shot it to not have any narration and doesn't need it in my opinion. The streaming quality looked fine to me, which is important. The movie is shot with so many dark tones, that you need a good picture to enjoy the beauty of the lighting. I think I may have seen more of this movie this time around than any other viewing.Thanks to the viewing quality it helped me to realize how beautiful it is to look at (even if it doesn't quite follow the Phillip K. Dick story closely). It remains a strong influence in the way sci fi movies are made today.	4.0	Nice to find a film of this quality on Amazon Prime	2014-06-19	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2K2801WP4XUJA	"Andy ""The Lonegunmen"""	I'm blown away. I didn't know this would be a numbered limited edition - like so many rip off items these days. My nephew picked my up this Zone 4 PAL item in Australia a few days back. Now in my hot hands!I'll be honest, Blade Runner is my most favourite film (Followed by Once Upon A Time In The West). I loved the voice over version, couldn't figure the unicorn scene and now am able to enjoy 5 slightly different versions at my leisure. I was disappointed when rumours started in the late 90's/early 2000's that Sir Ridley Scott wanted to tell a more complete story in his own way(The man is a Movie making genius.), but the films owners etc could not agree on the project.Now it's here and done and is what I call a modern day masterpeice. Whilst containing special effects, it's not ruined by them or overtaken by them like certain other Sci Fi films. The crisp film quality, awesome 5.1 sound, this film has matured into an awesome product. Ridley's final Cut version is indeed satisfying and I am glad they sorted out those loveable errors which we can still see in some of the versions but not in the final.Thank God Joanna Cassidy agreed to come back and reshoot the Zora dying scene. Thank God the cables on the spinners have gone and that Batty death scene has become night and not daylight.I just wish Harrison Ford would sort out any issues with Sir Ridley Scott and allow the film stand up proudly as a high quality work it is. It would have been really cool to have had the Core cast and Ridley sitting around a table discussing the merits and opinions of the film and their anidotes.Whilst some might not be happy or think this edition offers nothing new, for me it does. It looks tidy, sounds tidy and lives up to what I saw way back in 1982. All the extras in the case are really quite cool. I guess a replica of his gun would've been a nice touch or a big poster that I could've had lamenated and on my wall but I am really happy with what I received.I'd like to thank Sir Ridley Scott, the Film's entire cast, The film's 2007 restoration team & the various BR fan sites that never gave up hope for making this fan so very happy. And thank you to Phillip K. Dick for creating such an interesting story. Despite the film being slightly different from the book, it was a masterful inspiration. I wonder what might have happened to Deckard & Rachel after they left? Nah, I don't want a sequel.A quality product to which IMHO delivers! Only 4,400 & I got one!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A4VH04TA14CPE	"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo"""	"Fans of Philip K. Dick are often very critical of Blade Runner. I can understand why: the movie greatly simplifies Dick'sstory. It removes the entire subplot with radiation victim J.R. Isidore, as well as all of Dick's peculiar cultural details, such as the near-worship of animals, the Mercerist religion, and the sinister TV host. It even removes Rick Deckard's wife. Of course the story is poorer without these sources of characterization.But in my opinion, that's not necessarily bad, and might even have been necessary for any successful film adaptation. At its core, Dick's novel greatly resembled classic Americancrime fiction. Rick Deckard is a lot likePhilip Marlowe, with a strong moral core and sense of obligation that rises to the surface at key moments in the story, like the conflict with Phil Resch or the final showdown with Roy Baty. Deckard's profound disgust for Baty in that last scene (""Androids do that,"" he says upon learning that the androids have senselessly killed a spider) is a perfect match for Marlowe's contempt ofLash Caninoand other thugs. The best way to portray Deckard in a film would probably be to play him exactly like Marlowe, impassive and cold, wrapped up in a hat and trench coat, but with some occasional suggestion of sorrow.That, at least, is something that Ridley Scott can understand. He removes all of Deckard's background and characterization, but Harrison Ford can play a calm tough guy who also looks like he might be thinking something, and that's really all that's needed. The rest is atmosphere. Dick's book described a desolate post-nuclear Earth where vast tracts of land, and large parts of major cities, lay completely abandoned. Scott throws that out as well. Instead, the film looks more likeNeuromancer: garish neon advertisements, crowded streets and ragged ne'er-do-wells. But if you keep in mind the Chandler analogy, the tone is still appropriate for Dick's story. The important thing is that the bounty hunter (or detective) is himself lonely and reserved.There is a much bigger discrepancy between the book and the film, though, having to do with the portrayal of the androids. The film chooses to make the androids sympathetic. In some sense its biggest payoff is Rutger Hauer's famous mournful monologue, which does not appear in the book, and was in fact completely improvised on the set. It is suggested that the androids are, in fact, superior to humans, and capable of noble suffering. Their anger against humans is high tragedy, and the humans hunt them out of fear of the unknown. Even Vangelis' brillianttheme musicunderscores the tragic romanticism of Hauer's image. Audiences have long debated whether Deckard himself might be an android; in this film, that would be a way of elevating him and giving him additional moral superiority.But Dick's book is brutal. It unequivocally holds, with no room for ambiguity, that the androids are savage, irredeemable psychopaths. This is true not only of Roy Baty, who is supposed to be the most violent one, but also of his android wife Irmgard (absent from the film), who can imitate politeness and refinement, but who nonetheless takes an active role in dissecting the spider (a huge moral offense in the book's world). This judgment is final; androids are forever doomed to be incapable of empathy even for each other, to say nothing of any other form of life. They are united only by fear and anger. Dick treats this fact as horrifying and disturbing, but he never questions it. Of course Deckard is not an android in the book.Which view would be better for a film version? I prefer Dick's unsentimental, unforgiving approach. But I suspect it may be unbearably oppressive in a film. It works in a more cerebral and philosophical way, as a moral meditation, whereas Hauer's tragic outlaw has more in common with glamorous Hollywood stylization. But the latter is also an integral part of film noir, which needs charismatic antagonists, worthy of testing the protagonist's limits. The logic of Blade Runner pretty much forces the androids to be the emotional lynchpins. And, after all, even in the book, one would think that humans ought to be morally culpable for creating the androids.Ultimately both approaches are compelling. The book and the film comfortably exist side by side, exploring completely different angles of the story. In a way, Scott's choices allow the film to be experienced on its own merits: the dark cinematography and paranoid tone, the theme music, the dying monologue. The flip side of Dick's story, it would seem, can leave one just as shaken."	4.0	Parallel PKD: sympathy for the androids	2012-03-21	7	4	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A7EDEXJP2TD44	anonymous	I realize some people like the Harrison Ford voice-over, but I'm not one of them since I found it distracting, to say the least. To each his own, I guess.In fact, I actually found the 1992 version to be an improvement without it. It was Scott's (and Ford's) original intent not to have it in the movie in the first place, and Warner Bros insisted they put it in because they were afraid people wouldn't get it. They felt they needed the story spelled out for them.That being said, I hope they make it optional on the new 2007 director's cut (Disc-1). For those who want it, they can hit the soundtrack button on their DVD remotes. For those who don't, leave it off.I'd be the best of both worlds, imo.	5.0	Make narration optional	2007-07-31	0	0	0

Disc 1, the restored/remastered ""Final Cut"" is just the start of the goodness! The extras discs have all kinds of goodies for those who dig deep enough. The screen tests for the roles of Pris and Rachel are great, showing several different actors that tried for the roles, as well as Sean Young and Daryl Hannah's tests. Also of interest are the many outtakes and deleted scenes. There is almost enough footage to make a completely different version of the movie! One particularly good scene is Harrison Ford and Sean Young's lovemaking  session toward the end of the movie -- much ""hotter"" than the one that made it to the final cut. All I can say is ... WOW.Current-day interviews with cast members were great, as well as the ""Making of Bladerunner"" mini-documentary that really gives you a taste of the Hollywood insanity that is involved in movie making. It's amazing this movie was ever made considering all the crap the director had to go through in dealing with producers and other meddlers.Anyway -- if you're a fantatic, you won't be disappointed."	5.0	Fantastic collection!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	Harrison Ford has created an amazing number of memorable roles in his career but one of the most understated of these was in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. He plays a cop called Deckard who is responsible for &quot;retiring&quot; rogue replicants, genetically engineered beings who are used by humanity in all those tasks which are dull, distasteful or dangerous. These futuristic slaves have abilities that are beyond the mere human but pay for it with very limited life-spans.Ridley Scott adapted the film from the Philip K Dick novel, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot; Scott is famous for cinematic visuals and whilst he doesn't stick very closely to the book, the overall design and special effects make this a ground breaking science fiction film. Released in 1982 it took the &quot;gritty Sci-Fi&quot; crown from &quot;Alien,&quot; Scott's film from three years earlier.  The world in 2019 is over populated, crime is rampant, the Japanese own the economy and most animal species are extinct. This is not an unnatural projection from an early eighties perspective.Before I get too heavily into the narrative, I'd like to touch on the sensitive issue of version envy. The history of Blade Runner takes at least two turns. The initial theatrical release had less than brilliant exit polling. Apparently cinema goers thought it was confusing and too dark. The studio forced Scott to make changes, including Deckard's voice-over and a more upbeat ending. More recently, the directors cut transformed the film back into it's original format with a few extra minutes to flesh out some of the important relationships. In my opinion, both versions are worth watching.The film focuses on Deckard for the most part. He is the character the audience most identifies with,  since he is apathetic and cynical by turns, as he goes through the motions of his meaningless existence. That is, until he meets his first Nexus 6 replicant, Rachael, who is posing as the niece of Eldon Tyrell, the genius (owner of the Tyrell Corporation, manufacturer of the Nexus 6 line). Rachael Tyrell(?) is played to perfection by Sean Young. She is not aware of her inhumanity and, thanks to implanted memories, plays her part so well she almost passes Deckard's replicant test. The poignancy of her enlightenment is not lost on the audience, nor is it lost on Deckard. Their reluctant attraction forms one of the stronger sub-plots in the film.The first half of the story made me wonder if there was going to be any plot at all. Mind you, the setting was sumptuous and therefore enjoyable enough to mask the lack. We had glimpses of the group of Replicants Deckard was hunting but it is not until Roy Batty enters the picture in full, that we start to wonder if Deckard can pull it off. Roy, intensely played by Rutger Hauer, is a military model; strong, fast, smart  and persistent. He is the leader of the escaped replicants and has come to earth on a mission of his own. Like many of us, he does not want to die and is intent on infiltrating the Tyrell Corporation in the hope that some way can be found to side-step the untimely fate of all replicants.The film is rich in symbolism and flooded with small but detailed characters like the origami artist Gaff. But the true heart of the story is the moral grey area. Can a good man condone what amounts to slavery? Is there no moral limit to genetic engineering? Is love possible between a man and a construct? Must we condemn a man for wanting to live, at any cost?In the end, when Roy has Deckard dead-to-rights on a crumbling and rain-swept roof, he says, &quot;All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.&quot; Roy allows Deckard to live, even as he dies, leaving us with the conclusion that Roy's only way to live past his use-by date, is through the memory of the man who set out to kill him.	4.0	Do androids dream of immortality?	2001-01-17	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3RJLCLN48KSIW	ANTHONY H. YOUNG	I have owned and enjoyed the VHS tape of the movie for years.  After seeing the Director's Cut on DVD, I would say the changes made were almost not worth the effort.  The unicorn scene is ambiguous, but it was interesting to watch the film without listening to the voiceover.  I feel Ridley Scott could have done much more, by adding edited scenes.  Negatives: it was shocking to find this DVD was not shown in widescreen, or letterbox.  Also, one can see dirt and other debris in a couple of scenes that was not removed from the original celluloid copy for this DVD.  Positives:  it is a joy to watch this film in DVD and see everything in much better sharpness.  Hopefully, the 20th Anniversary Edition due out later this year will correct the deficiencies.	4.0	An opportunity missed, but still enjoyable.	2002-01-24	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2YZ4UEDOCFIN1	Anubyss	There has been much discussion over which version of Blade Runner is the best. I have to say that, although I like the director's cut, it is the original version that really captured my heart and imagination. First of all, the narration made Blade Runner into a futuristic version of the old black and white private eye films. This gave the movie a GREAT retro feeling and in my opinion revealed more about Deckard's character than the director's cut was able to. Secondly, the director's cut really seems to go out of its way to drive home the point that Deckard is a replicant as well. I don't think that made the movie any stronger or better, it just made it &quot;different&quot;. Rather than a human who finds love in a replicant and learns that you don't have to be a real person to be human in the original, you have a replicant who doesn't know he's one killing replicants and the numerous issues that go along with that. Anyway, if the franchise wants to really make some money, they should release an ULTIMATE EDITION BLADE RUNNER DISC SET with BOTH versions on DVD. They would satisfy everyone, and give people a chance to see both versions and judge for themselves which is best.	3.0	The ORIGINAL is indeed better	2003-05-14	21	19	2

The wide city shots from above are breathtaking. The score has been sweetened using the most up to date equipment and made to engulf you in the atmospher. The movie flows so well, makes so much more sense.SPOILER ALERT:  It is so clear that Deckard is conceived a replicant from the get-go, just like the book its based on. This fact puts every scene in context and clearly shows that Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the real hero of the film.I saw the movie two times this month (Oct. 2007) digitally projected at the LA Landmark Theater and it was stunning and flowed beautifully. And the ending is so right on now. With Deckard realizing at the end he is a replicant, they really capture a great deal of what Philip K.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3LGJA0J6A61I5	arca20@yahoo.com	This is a film which requires its audience to think. If you like your films with simple plots, gung ho action, witty repartee, loads of one-liners then forget this one. This film requires an understanding of  human nature, an understanding of the world around you and the imagination  and intellect to fully appreciate the nuances of the film. From Harrison  Ford's 2body language&quot; character through to probably Rutger Hauer's  most stunning performance this film outclasses and outstrips anything  before it. It has yet to be equaled in intelligence and its ability to be  thought provoking.The film portrays both the decaying Earth and the  decay of its inhabitants. The irony of &quot;machines&quot; seeking  humanity while humans lose their humanity is only one of the many subtle  ideas throughout the film.My only complaint is the number of people who  talk about the ending but miss the point. This is one to sit in a bar and  discuss for hours on end. So take my advice and think your way through this  film.On the negative side the DVD is disappointing because of the lack  of features. I would have thought this would have been the perfect  opportunity to place both versions side by side. In spite of all the  publicity the original is no less valid.	5.0	Grey Matter	1999-04-16	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1YC9XEDFKXPLK	Armando M. Mesa	This was a film about awesome and stunning ambiance, mood setting, music and an array of special effects with a stellar cast ( not bad for '82); That's as far as it goes. On the flipside the plot is thin, the acting is  flat, and the action very subdued. This explains why half of filmgoers  liked it and half hated it; There is no happy medium. I personally enjoyed  all of the highlights mentioned above ! I remember first seeing this film  on video release a few years back during cold and rainy winter weather.  If you want to feel the moodiness of the film for all its atmospheric glory,  then watch it on a fall or winter day/night. Just don't watch it if you're  already in a foul or depressed mood. This movie is an excellent example if  someone wants to know or experience cinematic atmosphere or setting.	5.0	Bladerunner for Cold Days	1999-10-11	0	0	0

Still it is really unpeered in my opine. The extras are great too. The documentary Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner is an approximately three and a half hour long documentary and included interviews with Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Jerry Perenchio, Bud Yorkin and Ridley Scott, and also contains several alternate and deleted shots within the context of the documentary itself.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJRZ98VIOES0U	Arsenic & Old Lace	It was sometime in 1996 that I first saw a s***ty cut of Blade Runner on one of those cheapo Walmart TV's with a VHS player built into it. I didn't like it so much. Then again, I was only 12 and more absorbed in my Spawn and Lobo comic books than this Ridley Scott masterpiece.Fast forward to my early college years. I somehow happened to watch it again after many shots of vodka, and damn, it wasn't so bad. The Final Cut was released in 2007. I'm a dork, so I picked it up and watched it yet again.First things first... You HAVE to watch Blade Runner: The Final Cut on Blu-Ray. The imagery, intricate set pieces, and costumes is where this movie really shows itself to be a classic. Ridley Scott used a short story of Phillip K. Dick to craft an intelligent neo-noir film. Harrison Ford was perfectly cast as hard-boiled cop, Rick Deckard. He drinks his ass off and hunts replicants. Then he manages to bang one.Blade Runner is a slow moving and often confusing flick. This is why it took me multiple viewings to grasp what Ridley Scott was trying to convey, coupled with the studio's cryptic editing style, finally made whole by this edition. Blade Runner, more than any other movie you will ever watch, is visually awesome. The neo-noir elements provide an even greater draw. This is simply the best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen.	5.0	The Greatest Sci-Fi Movie Ever Made	2014-03-23	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AGO5LRUVQLH0Q	A. Schneider	"[VHS Release Review]Slow movie but beautifully done (the lighting is absolutely amazing), the film noir-scif-fi classic Blade Runner is an awesome tale from a philosophical stand point as well as an action-drama movie point of view. While the movie can be slow at times, one must take into consideration the year it was made and the book which preceded it.Blade Runner is of course based on (quite loosely) Philip K. Dick's masterpiece, ""Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and while in no way does the movie compare to the book, at least in aesthetics (painted by words that is rather than fancy lighting), the story is largely the same if not a bit twisted in it's overall ""message."" Regardless while the movie isn't entirely faithful to the book, it sure presents the moviegoer with some excellent visuals, cool story, and all around excellent balance of fun and serious subject matter.Blade Runner can be extremely slow at times and while Ridley Scott was trying - at the time the film was made - to dazzle the audience with special effects, such effects might come off as overly pretentious. At least the slow gaps in the story sure as hell do, but with a classic, things like this are often overlooked and so to does my review overlook them.Again, great movie - decent enough acting and all around great experience![DVD Version]The touch ups and scene additions are beautiful - as for what the numbers of other complaints are, I have no clue - I saw the Director's cut on television and so perhaps they omitted sections of that. Either way I saw little wrong with it... perhaps it is or isn't worth the buy, but certainly the VHS is (I'd try to rent the DVD yourself to see what all the fuss is about).Recently I was able to tape record the Director's Cut that was shown on television... no problems that I could see there, perhaps buying the DVD is different though.Either way, a great piece of work!"	5.0	An amazing story and candy for the eyes!	2005-11-14	3	2	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2HEI9T4074GIT	"""asestrin"""	It is very unfortunate that they deleted the film noire dialogue. It was very important to the story and was important to give a philosophic view to the story. The unicorn scene seemed unimportant to me, apparently it hinted that Decker was a replicant, but i do not get how. And I am lucky I still have the original so i can watch it, because in my opinion it is far better, and the simple implementation of the unicorn scene did little for me, since i do not understand how it proves his true identity as a replicant. This is still a great movie. But i also suggest you get the original and watch it first.	4.0	Unfortunate deletion of important dialogue.	2001-08-10	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"""Blade Runner"" is a very strange movie. I practically grew up with it. Everyone in Sweden seems to have seen it, and it used to be very popular, especially among women. Disjointed images of the movie have stayed with me ever since I first saw it: the dark alleys filled with Chinese, the owl, the marching dwarfs at J.F. Sebastian's home, the dying replicant who talks about Orion, Vangelis' music... When I saw ""The Final Cut"", I realized that I remembered all of the movie and most of the lines - and yet, I didn't remember the plot! Is this how an animal sees the world? A long succession of disconnected images, some weird, some pleasant, some threatening...but nothing to tie them together. Have I finally answered that old philosophical question: How does it feel to be a bat?When I was younger, both my father and myself were *seriously* confused by another thing concerning ""Blade Runner"". Somehow, it seemed different every time we saw it! That was before I realized that there are several versions of the movie (seven versions, actually). My favourite version is still the original one, with Deckard's voice overs (""at that moment he loved life...all life...my life""), and where Deckard and Rachael get away at the end. Apparently, most people involved in making ""Blade Runner"" hated the original, which explains the long series of alternative versions.According to Wikipedia, ""Blade Runner"" wasn't much of a success in the United States. Perhaps the movie contains too little action for an American audience? Frankly, it hasn't much of a plot either. The point of ""Blade Runner"", I think, is artistic. It's not really a movie. It's a work of art, a piece of poetry on the widescreen. The strange but beautiful music by Vangelis underlines this. Perhaps that's why Ridley Scott insisted on constantly remaking ""Blade Runner"". He saw it as more than a commercial movie. It's his private little painting or symphony. Indeed, this might be why ""Blade Runner"" affected me the way it did: I never remembered the storyline, since it's not really important, but I did remember the images, the atmosphere, the strange characters...For those who never seen ""Blade Runner"", here's a short summary of the plot (with spoilers). The main character, Deckard, is a police officer specialized in killing robots known as replicants. The robots look exactly like humans, and are used as slave labour or involuntary soldiers on distant planets. Some of the replicants escape from captivity and turn up in California. During Deckard's mission to intercept and kill them, he realizes that Rachael, the woman he loves, is also a replicant, but unaware of the fact. The police want Deckard to kill Rachael as well. Deckard refuses. In some versions of the movie, he and Rachael gets away, while in other versions, their ultimate fate remains uncertain. In ""The Final Cut"", it's even implied that Deckard himself might be a replicant!But, as I said, the plot is really the least interesting part of this production. Deckard is actually a quite incompetent cop! What makes ""Blade Runner"" so fascinating are the strange people, the ambivalence of the robots (are they evil? or just misunderstood?), the dark alleys, the music...Incidentally, this is a review of the ""5 disc complete collectors' edition"". I don't have it, but judging by the editorial review, it contains all seven versions of this intriguing film..."	5.0	Time to die	2009-07-18	5	4	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3THW5CB9B2BR7	"ASP ""Andrew P"""	I actually had to watch this film for a class on Science Fiction Films of the 20th Century, and I had also just read the source stroy &#34;Do Androids Dream if Electric Sheep?&#34; I truly ejoyed the film and the story, but the two are vastly different. People who are looking for a faithful retelling of the novel, look elsewhere. The film uses some of the basic concepts of the novel, but overall it seems to be much more of a &#34;inspired by...&#34; rather than a &#34;based on.&#34; The film is dark, both in tone and in look. I found the acting great, especially Ford, Hauer, and Sean Young. One of the reasons I had to view this film for class was to examine it as an example of Tech Noir, (a term coined by James Cameron in the Terminator film a few years later, but which can easily be retroactivly applied to this film,) and it truly is an exemplar of the genre. In this version, the voice-over narration has been removed, as has the &#34;happy ending&#34; shot of Decker and Rachel driving through the countryside, and Decker's unicorn dream sequence has been left in. All in all, I agree with these choices, as I believe they are closer to what Scott intended. Some have said that the film is slow and tough to understand. Perhaps it was because I was familiar with the novel, but I did not find it to be too dense of difficult to follow, and the acting is so good and each shot is so interesting visually, that I never thought that the film lagged at all. I steamed this on my computer, but I am really considering picking this up on Blu-Ray, (if available.)	4.0	Blade Runner	2013-04-17	0	0	0

I contend that it's one of the best movies ever made.The support for this contention could go on for pages, but one of the main points is the extent of the vision that Ridley Scott and his colleagues had for this movie. To say that their vision was ahead of its time is truly an understatement.Let's not also forget the IMMENSE contribution that Vangelis gave this movie with his genius soundtrack.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3ERGLQ4OJIJGI	"A. Tomkins ""Risktaker"""	There is a ton of reviews for this blu-ray disc but I shall leave one anyway. The first time I saw this film was mid 80's on VHS and from the moment I saw this film I was smitten by the pure unadulterated style of the production and the enchanting electronic score. The score now sounds only slighty dated possibly only due to me remembering 80's, the style however seems all the more potent now, with the visions of decrepit vistas and deviant weather paterns giving visions of the future 25 years after the original release.There are probably a few people looking for a true adaptation of P. K. Dick's book (Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?) and if you do you will be sorely dissapointed as there is virtually no resemblance to the original text. I would recommend the film however to even those who have read the book (detach yourself from the text) and to those who are not science fiction enthusiasts as there is plenty in this film for all who watch. with unmatched art direction, cinematography, and direction  to name but three, this is however let down by slightly patchy acting and some stilted dialogue.The weaknesses are however out weighed by the strengths, with a superb score and a must see final scene that is amongst the best on celuloid. This Blu-ray version is superb value for the cost and is an immaculate transfer with the 'final cut' of the film being an extremely clean version of a very slightly tweaked version of the 1992 directors cut. This coupled with just about every other version of the film and a healthy dose of extras makes for good value.

While  I know I am mostly alone in this opinion,  I married the person who agreed  with  me.The cinema and sound experience surpassed our very high  expectations.  If you want to be amazed what DVD's component video and a 5  channel audio system can do in your home, this is the movie to  showcase.But it was *NOT* the Blade Runner experience!

The biggest thing that bothers me about the directors cut is it veers from the novel by a lot. The suggestive stupid ending with deccard may be a replicant. That would just ruin the movie for me. Then everyone should be a replicant. It would ruin it for me because in the novel that is not suggested, plus they have a similar ending in the novel as well as the original version. I prefer it because for one it was meant to have the voiceover and the happy ending from the directors cut and with a directors cut it should be restored and not hacked....strangely enough not with the director in charge of it either. At least they make up for that version with the final cut which has ridley scott in charge so we can see what he had in mind for the film.	4.0	Great all but one version	2009-02-08	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3KHL3O4K6WMXN	AvonCT	A great movie with early appearances of later stars (Harrison Ford, Darryl Hannah).  Phillip K Dick is a science fiction master and no film presents his skill better.  A little frightening that it is set in 2019, but probably the date could be stretched to, let's say 2319, and be a little closer to our current reality.  Considering that the author wrote this as a short story in 1968, you have to be amazed at his prescience - who could conceive then of a business turning out human clones for commercial purposes?  The plot is inscrutable (even as you watch it a second and third time) and the ambiguity of Harrison Ford's character is masterly presented.  Does he have any relationships (aside from polishing off &#34;skin jobs&#34;).  What's with the collections of family pictures in his apartment - are they keepsakes or, like Rachel, does he keep them to reassure himself he's human?  Is he human?  He's awfully good with his gun and physical prowess (like the replicants).  The pathos of animate beings seeking survival with the sympathy of their creators also plays well against the sinister plot background.  This is a movie to be enjoyed, savored and reconsidered at intervals.  It is also a good starting place to begin reading Phillip K Dick's imaginative stories.	5.0	The Question .. was Deckard a Replicant?	2014-01-25	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A6JJ7CD3RN1W5	a writer	&quot;Blade Runner&quot; had a very odd theatrical release: the first audiences saw different versions of the film (the studio recut it depending on what they heard from moviegoers). Just goes to show you - never rely on what the average viewer says. &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is much, much better without the hokey, noirish voice-over and uplifting finale. Harrison Ford, by his own admission, said he hated the narration and deliberately botched it (so the producers kept it, natch). And isn't it common coin in Hollywood to jam in a happy ending?Fortunately, the trend of &quot;director's cuts&quot; came along at the right time. The real &quot;Blade Runner&quot; could have easily languished in Warner Bros. vaults while fans put up with the Embassy VHS (which I own) and subsequent DVD transfer. As of this review, most people hate the DVD handling, but the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; VHS is worth keeping your VCR around.The film is the superior vision of life on a downward spiral, and its dizzying, tantalizing glimpses of a not-so-futuristic megalopolis are arresting. After reading Philp K. Dick's novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; and seeing the movie, it is obvious that the original message about replicated humans is far more ominous than the original theatrical version can convey. The burning question is obvious: is Ford's character a replicant himself? Does his brutal dispatch of the dangerous androids represent murder, or just disposal?In the end, the fantastic, impossible world created by Dick, and made flesh by Ridley Scott, is the real draw of &quot;Blade Runner.&quot; To rely on a voice-over for plot clarity is to miss the point.Vangelis' score and myriad aural touches add to the oppressive atmosphere. Subsequent sci-fi films have copied the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; look; all of them pale in comparison. Even if the studio were to somehow cobble up a sequel, it'd never recapture the look or feel of the real thing.	4.0	Often imitated, never replicated	2001-10-30	26	18	8
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A36RRLVEBABY5Z	"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid"""	Ridley Scott is a director among the highest caliber and I have been a fan of his for quite some time.  I love the original &quot;Alien&quot; and his fantasy film &quot;Legend.&quot;  &quot;Gladiator&quot; was another good film with a strong visual sense with rich performances (especially by Oliver Reed, in his final role) and grand production design.  For some strange reason, I hadn't seen &quot;Blade Runner&quot; until this year.  It's a film that didn't do particularly well upon its release in 1982 (especially since the director's cut is ten times better), but has had a cult following since then.  Hell, I'm a fan of cult films, too.  As you might have come across my &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; review, I love a film because the film is good, not because it won so many academy awards.Anyways, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is set in the 21st century in a bleak Los Angeles.  By this time, there are several Earth colonies and mankind has ventured forth with only the poor and the helpless staying behind on Earth.  Mankind also invented &quot;replicants,&quot; machines made to look human and only have a four-year lifespan.  Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a &quot;blade runner&quot; (assigned to terminate replicants) who must battle with four replicants (played by Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, and Joanna Cassidy) who have killed an entire ship and escaped to Earth.  Rutger Hauer plays their leader and the so-called &quot;prodigal son&quot; that was meant to be the toughest replicant.  Deckard discovers another one named Rachael (Sean Young) that is VERY close to being human (in other words, she can't be detected easily.  She required 100+ tests to figure out if she was a replicant.).  Deckard does as he is ordered, but finds himself falling for Rachael, and the other replicants simply went back to Earth to increase their longevity.The film has an OUTSTANDING visual style, but that is to be expected of Ridley Scott.  I loved his fantasy look for &quot;Legend&quot; and here he brings out not your every day-sunny day California.  This is bleak, dark, and very much in the film-noir fashion.  Plus, the music score by the great Vangelis (&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;) is excellent, with melodic saxophone moments and at other times in a hyperdrive electronic fashion like the end titles.  The only thing I could 'probably' degrade the film for is that you find yourself not connecting with the characters.  The best way to describe them is that they're vague.  Then again, the film's focus is not entirely on the characters.At first, I found myself with a lot of people (including Leonard Maltin, who I think misses the point...) who didn't like the film because it was hard to follow.  After watching it a second time, I caught on more of what it was about.  It's a movie that'll take some growing used to (it has a brooding pace that might not be appealing to today's viewers who are used to &quot;cut, cut, cut&quot; action).Do I recommend this?  While I found myself loving the film in the end, it's not one to instantly get into.  The deep philosophical notion here is that life is precious, and we humans tend to see humanity in ONLY humanity.  Here, we have a lot of people, not just replicants, who are poor, hungry, handicapped, and what the like.  Humanity's disservice to humanity, and even the replicants have humanity in them (near the end, Rutger Hauer gives a very compelling speech about his own death.).  Once I figured out the message of the film, I loved it all the more.  To the sci-fi enthusiast, I definitely recommend it.  Others might not have any desire to see it.  On the other hand, I highly recommend that a second viewing be applied, for it took me two viewings to analyze it.PROS: Grand visual style, Compelling story and message, Excellent music score, Astonishing production design, Dark ending.CONS: Characters are somewhat undefined, Film requires two or more viewings which might turn off the casual viewer.To sum it all up, this is a great art film that must be seen to believed.  Watch with care; you might dislike it at first, but it'll grow on you the second time around.	5.0	Futuristic Art	2004-04-23	3	3	0

On all three versions, the movie freezes for a moment at the scene where Pris is spraying makeup over her eyes.  It does so on both of my DVD players.  A minor glitch, I suppose, but for me very distracting from the movie.  If you don't think it will bother you, then I guess it's worth the low price of the set.  But if I had known about this, I would have looked for a different version.  The rest of the movie is fine, btw, although I found the menus annoying and hard to navigate.	3.0	Buggy video transfer	2013-09-06	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2D5BW299KNUEG	"Barney CL ""barneycl"""	The great thing about this DVD set is that it contains the original theatrical release!  This one disk is the earliest and best version of the story about the future detective tasked with running down a band of renegade replicants.  The replicants are purpose-built beings, almost human and in some respects super-human, and tracking them down raises questions about the nature of humanity and the self.  The bad thing about the product is that in order to get the real Blade Runner one must also get the disks for the re-edits, which all have unsatisfying endings that go against the grain of the basic story.  The reason for the peculiar history of Blade Runner DVD's is that the director and producer grossly overextended their budget and went bankrupt.  The completion company took over the mess, completed the film, and released it theatrically.  The film became a classic, but the original creators were miffed because the released film did not quite match their original vision (it was actually better, but they did not see that).  What ensued was a protracted fight about ownership rights.  The original director later produced and released significantly re-edited versions on DVD.  Because of long-lasting fights about ownership rights, the original theatrical release has been previously unavailable on DVD.	4.0	The Real Blade Runner and the Re-do's	2008-01-03	3	0	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A18I7DW50VCTT	"Battison ""Matt Battison"""	"Like most Philip K. Dick novels, this was a good story that was heavily revised, and turned into a great movie...with some strings attached.When Blade Runner was originally released, it featured a film noir style narrative by Deckard (Harrison Ford). This was added supposedly at the behest of the producers, who sensed the movie was going to go over most people's heads. They were right, and Blade Runner still went over most people's heads, despite the narrative.That spelled initial box office failure, or at least less than the expected science fiction movie success. On a gut level, the public thought they had this movie figured out, and it had to be Han Solo kills some naughty robots. Yet, instead of thrilling slam-bang action every minute, the public got a pensive examination of one of the greatest ethical issues raised in science fiction: How will we treat artificial intelligent life?Fortunately, a large segment of the public has since warmed to Blade Runner's core theme, as well as to Blade Runner's rich, palpable cityscapes, which became the template for nearly every cinematic future-world wanna-be: Fifth Element, Judge Dredd, even the later Batman movies. Like most things copied, none of those movies could match the atmosphere of Blade Runner.These key successes in Blade Runner are still present on the DVD, but......the re-release of Blade Runner in the early 1990s brought a few significant changes. Blade Runner had aged like a vintage wine, and audiences who had acquired the taste had no need for the narrative. Even to the uninitiated, an open and thinking mind was all that was ever necessary to keep up with the most important parts of the storyline. However, Ridley Scott also tempered his ending with a considerably less optimistic tone. Furthermore, and perhaps most controversial, was the scene in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn.Director's Cuts are a controversy in themselves. But Ridley Scott wasn't just adding simple clarifications, or restoring footage cut to fit an optimal theatrical duration. Scott made a blatant change in the reality the movie projected.Suddenly, Deckard's unicorn dream now played against the already-standing footage, later in the movie, of Deckard's sidekick, Gav, leaving an origami unicorn as a calling card. The implication is a strong one that Deckard, like Rachel, has implanted memories that the authorities know about -- that Deckard is an android, like those he is paid to destroy.Unfortunately, like a hip Rick Berman idea for Star Trek, it's chic for a moment, but wreaks havoc with the established universe. The Director's Cut transformed Deckard into the android the cops picked to stop other androids. Unfortunately, he must have needed his annual tune-up. Deckard gets tired, he can't run as fast or jump as far as his quarry, and he responds to pain quite realistically through near strangulation, beatings of the face and head, neck wrenching, nose mangling, and having a couple of fingers broken backwards -- all of this from single combat with the androids he's supposed to retire. Maybe the authorities should have invested in a Nexus 6...preferably the combat model.Well, like the idea or not, there was the Director's Cut. Which would be fine if the DVD let us watch both versions. Unfortunately, the original version of the movie is not on the disk. Most other movies with differing theatrical and director's cuts feature both versions on the same disk, inserting or bypassing scenes to present the appropriate version. The absence of this option is the greatest dissapointment in the DVD issue of Blade Runner.Like Captain Bryant says, ""No choice, pal."""	4.0	Great movie, so-so DVD	2002-09-12	16	15	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2WDSO1DQZ7J03	behet@stud.uni-frankfurt.de	Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is one of the most influential motion pictures of all time. Its highly stylized version of a 2019 Los Angeles, which is fantastically conceived and realized, became the source  of inspiration for countless other, mostly lesser, sci-fi movies.What  makes &quot;Blade Runner&quot; so remarkable is that its spectacular  production design is not the only outstanding achievement. The film has an  exciting, multi-layered story and a terrific cast. Also worth noting is the  highly supportive music by the Greek composer Vangelis.&quot;Blade  Runner&quot; is one of those rare films that actually improve with each  viewing, because there is always something new to discover. The film shows  no sign of aging, which is also extremely unusual for a film with many  special-effects.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"After buying three different 'definitive' versions of ""Blade Runner"", I was gun-shy about purchasing yet another...but this is an excellent investment, as you'll never find a more comprehensive look at the creation of a groundbreaking SF classic, with insights from virtually all of the major creative people involved.Be warned; if you aren't already a ""Blade Runner"" fan, this new collection will probably not change your opinion of the film. The ""Blade Runner"" vision of the future is not happy, or upbeat, but of a dying world choking in it's own overpopulation and pollution, where a multitude of cultures compete for space, and life is grim, at best. The sheer power of the visual elements, alone (done, amazingly, without CGI) would forever change how filmmakers would visualize cities...but Scott's relentlessly grim vision, and the noir drama of tenacious lawman Harrison Ford hunting down four androids desperately trying to survive, is not one that appeals to everyone!Wisely, this collection offers four versions of the film; the voice-over narration 'happy ending' 1982 theatrical release, the longer, more graphic 1982 'international' release, Ridley Scott's initial 'Director's Cut' (eliminating the 'voice-overs', and adding the famous 'unicorn' sequence), and a new, 'final' edition, cleaning up and tweaking several scenes that time and money constraints prevented, at the time of release. Each version has it's own admirers, and even Scott himself acknowledges all have merit.The real 'bonus' of this collection is, certainly, the feature-length documentary, ""DANGEROUS DAYS: MAKING BLADE RUNNER"", one of the most comprehensive histories of a film, from inception to re-birth as a cult masterpiece, that I've ever seen. Pulling no punches, the cast and crew candidly discuss the troubled production, on-and-off-set misadventures, and the constant war between vision and budget.Finally, the fourth disc offers a wide variety of features delving deeper into the creative forces that produced what would ultimately become ""Blade Runner"", and how an 'art house' science fiction film was marketed at a time of more upbeat, audience-friendly productions.I'm very pleased with ""Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)""...but I DO hope this WILL be the last version released!"	5.0	Four Versions, A Great Documentary, and More!	2008-03-31	1	0	1

The movie is truly a classic of titanic proportions. Rutger Hauer's final lines in the movie are rivalled only by Sheen's closing remarks in Platoon, pointing to the tragic transience and fragility, as well as the wonder, of life. They are an ode to or a celebration of human experience and to the beauty of nature and reveal the hidden truth of Tyrell Corporations motto, `more human than human'. He feels and cherishes life more desperately in his 4 years than humans seem to in their lifetime, lost and drifting in the spiritual ennui which defines them.

So I was disappointed with the latest final cut.  While the picture quality is outstanding, I missed the voiceover narrative that makes Deckard the central character and lets us see the story though his mind and emotions. This time there's hardly any distinction between him and the replicants which I suspect is what the director wanted -- to blur distinctions between humans and replicants as much as possible.I miss Deckard's musing about why Roy let him live and I liked the getaway on the train and the notion expressed by Harrison Ford rather than Olmos, that we don't know when Rachel or anyone else's number will be up. And I agree that for some odd reason we have less sympathy for the replicants in this version.Too bad they have to keep tinkering with a masterpiece.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJ9QINQ2IRD21	Billie	"Roy Batty: ""All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain.""""Blade Runner"" is my favorite science fiction movie. It is so rich and powerful that it lends itself to repeated watching and analysis. It asks the big questions. What is a human being? What is not? Where do we draw the line?As likeable as Harrison Ford is in every other movie he's ever made, I never liked him in this one. But I don't think we're supposed to like Deckard. Deckard's job is to kill replicants, after all. What sort of job is this for a human being? Is Deckard less human than the replicants he kills? Well, of course, he is. Replicants look and act almost exactly like human beings, after all. Is Deckard himself a replicant? If he were, how could we tell?Rutger Hauer, as replicant Roy Batty, stole this movie from Harrison Ford. Batty is scary and inhuman. At first. As his options run out and he loses his companions, Batty becomes more... well, human. His big scene near the end of the movie is just stunning, filled with pathos and meaning. I've had a soft spot for Rutger Hauer for years, despite his less than stellar employment choices, simply because of the power of his performance in this movie.Eyes are the windows of the soul, and there is constant, and I do mean constant, eye imagery throughout the movie: disembodied eyes, glowing eyes, eye patches, weird glasses, and so on. The test to determine if someone is a replicant is even based on eye movements. Also in the symbolism department, there are genetically created animals as well as human-looking living toys. Edward James Olmos' character creates tiny origami figures of a bird, a man, and a unicorn. The unicorn, in particular, has special meaning.One more thing. I don't like the original theatrical version of this movie. I read somewhere that, what with U.S. versions and European versions and all of the different cuts, there are actually five different versions of ""Blade Runner"". I prefer, and recommend, the U.S. director's cut.Bits and pieces:-- Deckard has an exceptionally odd and strained relationship with Rachel, who is also a replicant. He orders her to love him, and she does. She is utterly dependent on him for her life; he could kill her at any time. What is she really feeling? We never do find out.-- There is a strong mix of Asian and American cultures in this future world. I believe Joss Whedon borrowed a flavor of this mix as the setting for ""Firefly.""-- Speaking of my favorite shows, the Cylons on Battlestar Galactica are much like replicants. They even borrowed the term ""skin job,"" which is slang for replicant. And of course, the star of ""Battlestar Galactica"", Edward James Olmos, was also in ""Blade Runner.""-- The movie features two famous buildings in LA., often used for filming: Deckard's apartment set was in the Ennis Brown House, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. And the building where much of the action takes place -- the one with the skylight and the incredible staircases -- is the Bradbury Building. I visited both of these sites when I first came to L.A. because of my love for this movie.-- Past memories for replicants are associated with photographs. I think the photographs are also a clue as to whether or not Deckard is a replicant himself.-- Batty: ""If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.""-- Leon: ""Wake up.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2TBAVMA4Y2SGQ	"""billlester"""	I fully agree with reviewer Dan Wiley. Regardless of the pompous nature typical of &quot;director's cuts,&quot; the theater release version of Blade Runner is the better movie. Substantially better in my opinion. Harrison Ford's narration is delivered with the no B.S. approach of Mikey Spillane. It only adds to the film. I like it and so does everyone else with whom I've discussed this sci fi classic. If Mr. Wiley is correct and there will be a DVD re-release including the original version, that's the one I'll buy. Until then my aged VHS copy will soldier on...	3.0	Ditto!	2003-08-19	5	4	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1EKTLUL24HDG8	Bill R. Moore	Blade Runner is, overall, one of science fiction's finest films. The production and directory work is all top-notch, and the film's true standout feature is it's cinematography. With it's excellent, futuristic landscapes and prevading dark and gloomy atmosphere, Blade Runner was one of the first SF &quot;film noirs.&quot; It has had an incalculable influence on subsequent SF movies (and been lovingly parodied in mass media, such as Sierra's Space Quest 6 PC game.) On the surface, it appears to be simply an action/adventure flick with SF elements. However, a deeper inspection reveals unexpected depth. The movie, in it's way, is actually quite profound, and begs of you (like the book it is based on) the allmighty question: what is reality? Speaking of the book, I have heard a lot of people complain that this is a bad adaptation of it, Philip K. Dick's masterpiece Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And, true enough, it leaves out some things from the book and changes others, but this is to be expected for any adaptation. One shouldn't expect a book's purely literary qualities to come across on the silver screen; rather, it is nice instead to see the particular qualities that movies can deliver better-i.e., visuals, cinematography, atmospherics, etc.-focused on instead. And Blade Runner does that to the utmost. It highlights the points of the book that could be made better by movie treatment, and still retains much of it's heft. This is not a bad movie adaptation, this, my friends, is a masterpiece. Watch it today.	5.0	Essential SF Title	2001-07-03	5	4	1

BLADE RUNNER set new standards, not only in bleakness, but in storytelling as well. Harrison Ford proved that he was more than just a space cadet by fleshing out the role of Deckard, a man sent to ""retire"" (aka:terminate) a renegade group of replicants (genetically engineered humanoids w/ 4 year life spans). -WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!- Rutger Hauer is Roy Batty, leader of the renegades. Hauer portrays him with menace and exceptional depth. He is an android in search of a longer life. He fears death and the loss of his life's experiences. He dreads non-existence. Wait, isn't that a human trait? The other replicants seem like ordinary folks. There's Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) the exotic dancer. She gives Deckard a good fight before he guns her down. She doesn't want to die either. Pris (Daryl Hannah) the ""pleasure model"", is beautiful, sweet, and a bit insane. She is the ""love"" of Roy's ""life"". Sean Young plays Racheal, a replicant who finds out late that she's not human, that she has no real past, that all of her ""memories"" belong to someone else. Racheal is crushed by this information. Why? Isn't she just an android? Deckard himself is troubled. He has fallen in love with Racheal. Is he a man in love with a machine, or is he with his own kind? This is left unclear. Scott has put out HIS version of this classic. No clumsy voice-overs. No ""fly away to a sunny day"" ending. This is BLADE RUNNER as it was intended to be.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1U2KLNT1TJEUF	biped	The director's cut of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is definitely an improvement over the already-fine version that was originally released to theaters.  When one finally sees it without the tacked-on voice-overs, which were added by the studio to make it easier to understand and supposedly to give it more of a film noir quality, it becomes clear that the film's visuals are totally capable of conveying the story on their own -- and watching the film is much more enjoyable when we are allowed to interpret the action ourselves.  In addition, there is now more evidence that Deckard may be a replicant himself, a notion I scoffed at before but now see as an element that makes the film much richer thematically.  A new sequence which shows Deckard dreaming of a unicorn gives the ending (Deckard finds a small origami unicorn in the hallway outside his apartment as he and Rachel begin their escape) added resonance that is lacking in the original version, in which the voice-over narration actually detracts from the film's meaning.  Missing from the director's cut is the tacked-on happy ending showing Deckard and Rachel happily cruising north in his flying car as he explains that Rachel's lifespan is unlimited, unlike that of the other replicants.  The film now ends as it should, with the two entering the elevator and the door closing abruptly to leave the screen black for the credits to roll, allowing us to wonder what will become of the fugitive lovers as we ponder the mystery of whether or not Deckard himself is a replicant.  Something to look for in both versions -- Gaff's (Edward James Olmos) origami creations (chicken, person, unicorn) always convey his feelings at the time, and as the film progresses we see him develop a grudging respect for Deckard, until at last he says to him &quot;You've done a man's job, sir&quot; -- the ultimate compliment to bestow upon a replicant.	5.0	&quot;Blade Runner&quot; better than ever	2001-12-04	3	2	1

Or, if that's too much to ask, why not stick two DVD's in the package?Some people like the voice over better, and others prefer the newer version of this movie. For me, the answer lies somewhere in between. There are lines of the narrative that I really enjoy, in particular when Ford *SPOILER ALERT* philosophizes at the end about why Hauer saves him.I can't remember much more about the first version of this film. Sometimes the producers are right and their ideas make a better movie. That's not to say anything bad against R. Scott. The other movie is good too, just not AS good, in my memory.It's nowhere near as bad as say...the sequal to Conan the Barbarian. Conan the Destroyer is a movie to be avoided at all costs...as is the second Highlander movie.Come on you big shots at the top.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1P7O2PAA8H1DD	Blade329	I like Blade Runner, but I don't love it like others do.  It does have a lot going for it.  The sets, scenery, special effects, style and flair are all legendary.  However, it has some glaring flaws.  The first is the main character.  I can't stand Deckard.  There's nothing special about him.  He doesn't seem particularly smart, athletic or menacing.  Every single Replicant gets the drop on him and he only survives by their stupidity, lack of desire to kill him, or being bailed out by someone else.  Everyone else in the movie pushes him around as well.  So, how did a wimp like this guy every develop a reputation as THE most feared Replicant hunter?  Sure, he's portrayed as a burnout who's lost his edge, but still the movie should give me something here.  At least make him cunning.  The next thing I didn't like is the story.  It's filled with holes.  ** SPOILERS **  The whole thing with Voight-Kampf is nonsense.  So, the Replicant makers can create perfect/superior human clones, but have no way differentiating them from normal humans except for an eye test?  Seriously?  What, they don't have bar codes in the future?  How about the beginning scene with Leon?  I guess metal detectors are a lost science in the future as well.  Holden figures out he's a Replicant, but doesn't draw a weapon and still goes on questioning him.  Brilliant.  Zhora has the complete drop on Deckard (big shock) yet doesn't finish him because she is surprised by some employees.  She could have snapped his neck in seconds, but opts to take the slower route with strangulation.  Okay. The Replicants themselves are quite sloppy as they leave a trail that a 6 year old kid could follow, which of course is a bit challenging for Deckard.  Their goal is reasonable.  They want more life and are seeking out Tyrell, their creator.  You see, they only have a 4 year lifespan.  Why you would want to create accurate human clones and give them only a 4 year life span is beyond me.  I'm no scientist, but I could easily figure out that these super humans could rebel and cause havoc.  However, we can't expect such advanced thinking for characters in this movie.  Rachel is an interesting character, yet has almost zero purpose in this movie other than to provide a romantic interest for Deckard.  Of course, she is instrumental in bailing him out of danger when Leon is going to rearrange his face.  Pris also has a golden opportunity to waste Deckard, yet opts for a screaming gymnastics demonstration instead.  She does however give Deck his third vicious beating of the film, which is becoming a hobby for this boy among men.  Then comes the finale and the best Replicant goes into action.  Roy Batty. A bit smarter than the others, but a bit weird too.  He decides to play a little with Deck before killing him.  Breaks a couple of his fingers then pretends he is a wolf with Pris' blood smeared all over him.  With the howling of course.  Uh-yea.  He spends a few minutes hunting him until predictably catching the mighty Replicant hunter.  Then, he decides to spare his life.  Wow.  Sorry, but to say this story is over rated would be an understatement.Still, if you love Blade Runner, this is THE set to own.  Nearly every version of the film is in this set.	4.0	Great collection for good movie	2014-04-17	0	0	0

While Harrison Ford's voiceover may have been poorly executed and a bit cheesy, this version, which edits it out, seems slower, poorly paced, and was harder for people who hadn't been familiar with the movie to follow.I don't think there was enough background written into Bladerunner, and the lack of narration both obviates and aggrivates this flaw.  This cut would have been much better if the additional dream material and the less &quot;happy ending&quot; resolution were added in, and the cheeseball narration remained in as well.

Lynch ""the_onewhoknows"""	In this highly stylized vision of Los Angeles some tie in teh early 21st century, Harrison Ford plays a 'cop' hired to track down androids who have  returned to earth, seeking some way to make themselves immortal.The  movie pace is angonizingly slow, and the characters (human &amp; android)  are cold, almost dehumanized.  LA is too sunny, too dry, and too laid back  to ever be convincing as a rain-drenched, dark, brooding city run by  brilliant, super-educated, highly focused, corporate/academic  types.Still, there is a lot for the Sci-Fi fan to like here.  First, in  The Director's Cut, the art direction is just astounding; the mood, feel,  and look of future LA (more like future Singapore, or possibly New York, I  suspect) meshes with the mood of the story perfectly.  And the techie in me  loved the gadgets and technologies portraryed in the film.  As the 21st  Centruy approaches, the fantastic technologies shown are becomeing more  plausible and in some cases, actually look like they'll be realized in a  few decades.The visual effects here were done by Douglas Trumbull, who  collaborated with Stanley Kubrick for the visual effects that wowed  audiences in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  While the story is more  straightforward than that in 2001, the visual effects still make for a  convincing and realistic portrayal of a likely future age.This is not a  film that will ever have broad appeal; it's too dark, too much atmosphere,  too cerebral. However, it is one of those films that the hard core Sci-Fi  lovers (the ones who liked &lt;I&gt;2001&lt;/I&gt;,  &lt;I&gt;Alien&lt;/I&gt;, and other 'brainy flicks') will not be able to  keep out of their collections, or off their DVD players. There is some  disagreement about which is the better version of this movie, but  personally, I preferred the Director's Cut; it sustains mood and ambiance  better, and the ending is more intriguing--leaving open the possibility  that the [presumably human] detective played by Harrison Ford is also a  replicant.  In a sense, that amibguity enhances and adds to the tension in  this film--since there is a lot else that remains ambiguous to a viewer  (probably one reason why fans enjoy watching this many times).What keeps  this from getting a 5-star rating is the crude technical job done in  remastering (particularly the audio).  It needs to be re-done in  Dolby-Digital 5.1 &quot;Surround Sound&quot;.	4.0	LA will Never look Like This	2000-08-30	19	10	9
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`Blade Runner', directed by Ridley Scott and starring, in one of his most important roles, Harrison Ford, is quite probably one of the best science fiction movies ever. I would easily put it in the top five with Fritz Lang's `Metropolis', Forbidden Planet', `2001 A Space Odyssey', and another Phillip K. Dick inspired story, `Minority Report'.I was originally disappointed with this movie when I saw it in the theatre, as it was based on one of Dick's most famous stories, `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and the screenwriters took significant liberties with the story. But one of the surest ways of identifying a high quality movie is when it `grows' on you after repeated viewings. I have probably seen the original theatrical release on VCR and DVD and on broadcast TV at least five times, and I look forward to every viewing. The things which grow in my appreciation of the film as time goes by are Ford's performance and Ridley Scott's great invention of a very dark Los Angles some fifty years (from the time of the filming) in the future. The dark settings are a Ridley Scott trademark and they show up most dramaticly in `Alien', `G.I.Jane', and `Black Sun'. While the effect is great in the Sci-fi and Horror flicks, it really doesn't work in `G.I.Jane', but that's another movie.`Blade Runner' seems to have embedded itself into our collective unconsciousness. I happened to see an Alton Brown / Food Network special on TV yesterday where our golden boy, AB quoted a line from Sebastian's geneticly engineered minatures in `Blade Runner'.This movie seems to be the sort of work where everything just seems to hang together very, very well, from the set design to the music to the acting. Virtually all the roles in the movie are small compared to Ford's character, the Blade Runner, Deckard, but there are some which make one wish they had larger parts. Joe Turkel fits his part perfectly as the founder of the Tyrell Corporation. M. Emmet Walsh is also perfectly cast as Deckard's former captain of the Blade Runner unit who calls him back into service. Sean Young does well as Tyrell's closet replicant. The greatest little pleasure outside Ford's role is the performance of William Peterson, much better known as the Larry of the three brothers, Larry, Darryl, and Darryl on the `Newhart' TV show. Brion James, a lesser character actor similarly carries his part well. The two most difficult parts to assess are those by Rutger Hauer and Edward James Olmos. I suspect Olmos is given a major visibility in the credits for this movie more due to his widely recognized part in `Miami Vice' than to his role in this movie itself. Regarding Hauer, I often thought this was by far his best performance and that his whole career is based on the recognition he got from doing this movie. But, having recently seen `The Hitcher' again, I sense that while Hauer does well in these very sinister roles, his acting range is really limited and, like Whoopie Goldberg in `Ghost', the acclaim should go not to the actor but to the casting director.Oddly, I suspect one of the biggest differences between the theatrical release and the director's cut is to make just a little more of Olmos' role in the movie. The theatrical release doesn't even add any lines for Olmos, just a few more for Ford / Deckard to explain Olmos' character. In general, the theatrical release added just a little more voiceover dialogue to explain things early in the movie and to give the ending a slightly more upbeat resolution.I was really disappointed with the extras on these DVDs, as missing is my favorite feature, a voiceover commentary by director which explains the scenes in the movie. I suspect that unlike Kevin Smith's movies which make more money in DVD release than in the theatre (and who therefore puts a lot of effort into DVD extras) `Blade Runner' is so good, the DVD producers feel no need to pile on the goodies.This is a truly great movie whose value increases as time goes by and other filmmakers are unable to top it's story and great atmospheric interpretation of a classic Sci-Fi hypothesis.	5.0	The Movie, The whole movie, and nothing but the movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AV1Z67G2SHJSJ	"""bmatturner"""	I was born in 1970 and after digesting the first 2 Star Wars flicks, I was ripe for Blade Runner's appearance in 1982. This film will endure for decades to come. It has a stellar cast: You can't do any better than Harrison Ford AND Rutger Hauer. These two actors should never be paired again if only to preserve the magic that they acheived in this film under Ridley Scott's direction.Having said that, I must disagree with those critics who poo-poo the original theatrical version that contained Ford's background dialogue. I will admit that until I read one of the other reviews, I didn't know about Ford's attempt to sabotage the dialogue so that the studio wouldn't include it. However, the film's most important moment for me is Hauer's previously mentioned death scene. Without Ford's dialogue, the viewer has no idea what's going through Decker's mind. Maybe some people can be expected to imagine that Decker ended up feeling pity for the android once he revealed his human side. Unfortunately, if Ridley Scott had intended that there should be no narration/explanation of the film, then the following seconds after the android's death shouldn't have lasted as long as they did. This is a pivotal moment in the movie, and without Decker's feelings being voiced, I think something is lost.I realize that DVD technology may have been on the cutting edge in '97, and that the studio may have wanted to capitalize by releasing this 'Director's Cut' as soon as possible, but couldn't Ford's dialogue have been included as an additional sound option that could be turned on and off at the viewer's discretion? Here's to hoping that somebody will get the message.This film gets 5 stars in my book, but I've got to give this DVD 3 stars, which is being generous.	3.0	I was weaned on this!!	2002-03-25	9	6	3

There&iexcl;s nothing good to say about &iexcl;B.R. The Director&iexcl;s Cut.&iexcl;  There aren&iexcl;t any extras on a DVD that should be  filled with them, considering the richness of the movie and its cult  following.  Even the scene selections are inept.  Perhaps my DVD is  different, but the scene selections go in the order of 3, 7, 12, etc.  Not  only was this DVD put together by hacks, the hacks can&iexcl;t count.  There&iexcl;s  not even a still image from the movie on the DVD&iexcl;s main menu.  Just a  generic Warner Bros logo.  The picture and sound aren&iexcl;t up to DVD  standards either.  The picture isn&iexcl;t sharp and the sound Cwith the  exception of the music and some special effects sounds- is often flat and  has a &iexcl;1970&iexcl;s&iexcl; toneless quality to it.  It&iexcl;s almost as if it was  transferred to DVD from videotape instead of the original negative.The  &iexcl;Director&iexcl;s Cut&iexcl; is a confusing mess too.  As far as I can tell, the  only differences are the omission of Harrison&iexcl;s voice over, the &iexcl;flying  to safety&iexcl; footage during the end credits and a baffling inter-cut scene  of a unicorn running through a forest from the movie &iexcl;Legend&iexcl; while  Harrison is idly playing a piano.  Will someone tell me what a unicorn from  a bad Tom Cruise movie has to do with airing out replicants in L.A. 2019?  I miss the voiceover too.  As I understand, it was originally put in  because while testing the film, the audience couldn&iexcl;t follow the plot.  With it missing, the scenes where it used to be are awkward because the  characters are waiting for the nonexistent voiceover to end.  And speaking  of voiceovers, a Director&iexcl;s Commentary would&iexcl;ve been fascinating; but  apparently WB shoved this DVD out before one could be made or Ridley Scott  had better things to do.On the plus side, Vangelis&iexcl; rich score shines  and is perfect for this leisurely paced movie.  I have it on CD and  strongly recommend it. The special effects are still strong and awe  inspiring after all these years.  They show their age only in the fact that  there isn&iexcl;t any computer animation.This DVD stinks.  &iexcl;Blade Runner&iexcl;  has survived the years due to the devoted fans that have stood by it since  it was originally buried at the box office by &iexcl;E.T.&iexcl;  This DVD is a slap  in the face.  WB and Ridley Scott should be ashamed of themselves.  I hope  both will wise up and come out with a &iexcl;Special Edition Blade Runner.&iexcl;  This version isn&iexcl;t even worth renting, much less owning.	1.0	A terrible conversion...	2000-02-06	15	9	6

But this movie has other weaknesses. First the FX which set the mood has lost much of its power to impress, granted that can't be helped, but its still a fact. The not so subtle Japan bashing, from a time when Japan was seen as our #1 threat, seems as corny today as a Red Scare movie from the `50s. Last the endless philosophizing by beings, that don't exist, and probably never will, on the subject of ""are skin jobs human"".

I have a strange feeling that the world will one day turn out like this. Everything is rock-solid and great in this movie, but I had a lot of trouble understanding a part or two because the Hard-to-Understand Chinese/Japanese/Korean man strapped to the tubes couldn't be understood, or some things were just unexplained.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2WH4ZJ6EH9BS6	"bodhi ""fff"""	As you probably know Blade Runner was a commercial and critical bust upon release in '82, but was rediscovered on video and was even starting to be considered a classic by the early '90s.  There are reasons it was not initially successful and the original version with the voiceover certainly didn't help.  The pacing is a little slow, which really affects the middle stage of the film.  The film also lacks action which would upset many sci fi fans who were expecting to see Harrison Ford star in a film that would basically be Han Solo in a futuristic setting.  Blade Runner also improves with addtional viewings.  You stop looking for action and start noticing how intriguing the plot is.  Rutger Hauer give a somewhat over the top performance but is still good and while Ford doesn't do a great job he still helps the film by making the main character someone easy to identify with.  The effects are outstanding and hold up well to anything we see today.  The effects help create a great mood for the film and many scientists believe this is what LA will really look like in the future.  Blade Runner has a great plot, but there are a few plot holes and many flaws with the film.  The climax is where Blade Runner is really well done and is atypical of most thrillers.  I would consider Blade Runner as a great Sci Fi film but just a good overall film.	3.0	Style Becomes Substance	2010-03-20	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M	Book & Music thief, from HI	Philip K. Dick was probably the most Wildly imaginative (some might aptly say 'warped' - but in the best sense of the word of course) Science Fiction/ Speculative Fiction writer ever to grace our humble little Planet Earth!  And Ridley Scott is one of the absolute finest Cinematic Artists around (i.e. truly bringing to vital & vibrant 'Life' those elusive but fascinating pictures-words/ sights & sounds!)Put these two uniquely exemplary Artists together and you get an authentically superlative (and even mind-blowing) result like 'Blade Runner' (circa 1982 - but still more than slightly ahead of our Time!)I think Blade Runner's reputation has been significantly enhanced in the years after its initial Box office run in 1982 - initially, audiences were probably expecting (from a SciFi film with a futuristic setting) either the exhilarating sense of wonderment of Star Wars or Star Trek - or perhaps the futuristic terror of 'Alien' - but instead they got a complex/multi-faceted and 'realistic' scenario of a possible near-future full of moral ambiguities = presenting many more questions than answers, and a genuinely 'uneasy' feeling about possible things to come (i.e. perhaps not the future we were all hoping for?)But that uneasy/ tenuous atmosphere is exactly where this film generates its real power = this is based on Philip K. Dick after all, and his futures are filled with paranoid (or at least uncertain/ constantly shifting) visions in which things are almost always Not what they appear to be - and where concepts like 'good & evil' and even our individual identities become unstable, irrelevant or worse, interchangeable!Ridley Scott perfectly conceptualizes the Dystopian ambiguity inherent to P.K.Dick - and considerably broadens the visual Scope of the original source-book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' ==> by spectacularly re-imagining/ updating Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' inspired City-scapes, although in much darker shades (and even enhancing said scenery with more than a bit of Japanese-Asian flair/ aesthetics!)In any event, Blade Runner does what Speculative Fiction has always done best = force us to think about our possible futures and contemplate the true meaning of  'identity'  'empathy'  and even 'humanity'  =  not bad for a Movie classified in the humble little 'genre' of futuristic film noir.	5.0	Dystopian Future at its most Picturesque and Prescient?!	2014-06-02	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2FXWJSIBFL35E	Bort	There's nothing bad I could say about this film.  The world Ridley Scott created immersed me and should immerse anyone that watches it.  It asks big questions, and has underlying themes, much like a good book.  The best part?  It doesn't spoon feed them to you.The blu-ray version of this film's picture quality is incredibly sharp, with vivid colours and natural skin tones.  It is, I imagine, as good as you can get for a movie that's 27 years old.  The audio is uncompressed, giving you the absolute best sounding audio possible.The product.  You get 5 versions of the film.  US theatrical release, international theatrical release, director's cut, the final cut and the workprint version.  You get a documentary that is longer than the film.  You get multiple audio tracks over the final cut, and at least one over all of the other cuts.  On one disc you get deleted footage, more features (such as interviews and information about the book it's based on), trailers and more.I got it for $17.99, which is a steal.  Even at $23.49, this collection is a must buy.  If you're a die hard fan, pick it up.  If you've never heard of the film until now, pick it up anyway.  Every film goer should have this movie in their collection, and this collector's set leaves you no excuse to not get it.	5.0	Ridiculous	2009-07-26	2	2	0

This edition brings all of these (and a couple other key archival versions) together in one place. While I am a fan of the Final Cut and do think that it will become recognized as both the definitive and artistically best version of the film in the future, the others are also here in case you prefer them.I have done extensive academic research using Blade Runner and have found this version to be perfect for all of my needs - the interviews and other bonus materials supplement the archival versions nicely.

If you're less of a fan than the voracious, such as myself, the four disc set will probably do, or even the Final Cut only version.

The stunning visuals, the moody sets, the more human than human performances, and the multilayered meanings have kept my interest for 20 years!There are many versions of this film out there, and this is one cut that was released at its 10 year anniversary.  Released early on in the DVD craze, it has almost no extras.  The transfer is amazingly well done, but it got short shrift in the way of extras.  LEGEND got a dual disc release, ALIEN is chock full of extras including deleted scenes, and GLADIATOR and THELMA AND LOUISE both got special editions.  Ridley Scott is a willing director to supply commentary, and there are so many scenes and tidbits that could be included in a special edition for BLADE RUNNER.It's worth buying.  But you may want to also purchase the book by Paul M. Sammon to detail the different cuts, and supply anecdotes about the making of the film.  At least until someone rights the wrongs, and brings us a more in-depth DVD.  But in the meantime I cherish my copy of the film that changed movies forever!	5.0	Top rating for the movie, but where are the extras?	2003-03-29	3	2	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2QZ3EJK0XE5UR	Brett D	"I'm always skeptical when a studio promises an ""improved"" version of a personal favorite, since so many directors just don't know when to leave well enough alone.  To be quite honest, I wasn't too pleased with Ridley Scott's re-release of ""Legend"", so I had very guarded expectations coming into this purchase.Without a doubt, ""Blade Runner"" is a cinematic high water mark -a resplendent, existential masterpiece drenched with subtlety and visual power.  I can honestly say that this film influenced my childhood more than any other -from the grim, dystopian future it forebodes, to the haunting and utterly unique Vangelis score.  With today's directors offering nothing but disposable summer blockbusters and CGI-soaked explosion-fests, this may very well be the last film of its kind.  So you can get a sense of my apprehension when I heard Ridley was finally going to release a cleaned-up special edition DVD.Ridley, I'm sorry I doubted you.The accompanying 3.5 hour documentary is unmatched for thoroughness and detail (save, perhaps for The LOTR trilogy SE releases -which, frankly wore thin after about the sixth hour of behind-the-sccenes coverage).  The documentary ALONE is worth the price of the set.The film itself is indeed beautifully and flawlessly restored.  The promised ""extended footage"" and ""never-before-seen visual effects"" are subtly and expertly grafted into the film in a way that no other ""improved"" DVD has ever accomplished.  This time the tweaks are both respectful to fans' expectations and WELCOME.  If you've grown up hoping they'd do something about the occasional unfortunate matte painting/film color mismatch, or the handful of continuity errors in the last ""Director's Cut"", you will not be disappointed.I spotted at least one change in the ending that finally resolves what many fans consider one of the film's more egregious missteps, and a reversion to the original intent of Batty's dialogue with Tyrell that (for me, at least) works every bit as well as the one we've been watching for the last twenty years.About the only thing they didn't address in the supplemental disc (I've not yet watched the film with the commentaries, so this may be premature) is why it took so long to release this.  As any Blade Runner fan knows, the DVD release has been mired in controversy and speculation about legal battles for over a decade, yet no mention was made of ""why now?""In any case, what difference does it make?  It's finally here.  And it is every bit worth the wait."	5.0	Still A Masterpiece!	2007-12-22	7	7	0

Rubendall	Let's start off by saying that &quot;Blade Runner&quot; has more intellegence and imagination than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie ever made.  Perhaps this is because it is based on a Phillip K. Dick novel, Dick being one of the smartest people ever to write science fiction.  The movie, rather than dumbing down Dick's work as Hollywood is so often prone to do, instead celebrates it.  Harrison Ford's hero is really Phillip Marlowe transported to the space age.  The whole movie in fact has a &quot;film noir&quot; feel to it that enhances its downcast mood.  Ford gives what maybe the best ACTING performance of his career.  And Dick's scary vision of the future is perfectly portrayed.The Drector's cut has a more ambiguous ending than the original film and throws out Ford's added on narrative designed to &quot;assist&quot; audiences that the producers thought would be too dumb to follow the story otherwise.  While I never minded the narration, the more uncertain ending is far more appropriate.  Either way, sci-fi movies don't get any better than this.	5.0	Best Sci-Fi Film Ever	2000-12-09	3	3	0

It was Re-released in theatres in the 90's with a new cut.  They have since released this in a compleate DVD Collection special edition & a Special edition Blu-Ray edition.

Both controversial and mesmerizing from the start, the film has spawned five different versions of itself, this being the last.  While this version brings the film up to date technologically and cleans up various glitches in the previous versions, it also cuts out some parts that I thought were very beneficial in the original.  I am also one of the few who actually prefers the original theatrical release with Harrison Ford's voice-over, which virtually everyone else hates.  The voice-over added to the overall foreboding tone of the film.  The original version also left some parts of the plot ambiguous, leaving the viewer to decide for himself, which I greatly preferred to the later versions which focused largely on making these far more explicit.	3.0	The final cut, but not the best	2013-08-16	4	3	1

The previous ""double-wide"" was around 22-23mm, a full centimeter wider, and while that wasn't exactly hefty, it still smacked of unnecessarily making the product ""seem"" bigger than it needed to be because of the importance of the film within.Basically, the construction of this new case is the same as the old: two flip trays on hinges, with an additional disc mounted on a hub on the inside back of the case. Only now, the flip trays are thin enough to fit in a Blu case that's only a millimeter or so wider than the standard-issue single-disc case.I can only hope that ALL future Blu releases of up to five discs would consider a case like this. In an age where storage for the average DVD enthusiast -- esepcially the kind that collects titles like this one -- is at a premium, the less packaging, and ""air"", the better.No guarantees you'll actually get this package when you order, as the double-wide case appears to be out there concurrently with this new one, and you're liable to get either from Amazon, so it's at least something to keep an eye peeled for should you choose to buy this in the store."	5.0	A few words about the new case . . .	2008-08-02	2	2	0

So being a fan of the film it was not a hard choice for me to make. The collection is by far the greatest package that I have ever gotten. There are five discs, one which is just a documentary (Dangerous Days) chronicling the entire creation of the film. The other discs are different iterations of the same film, but they have their differences. Either way they all have just about the best transfers (especially ""The Final Cut"") that I have seen on Blu-Ray and I currently own fifteen discs. This buy is somewhat of a no brainer for a owner of a Blu-Ray player especially if they are a Blade Runner fan."	5.0	The first Blu-Ray disc I ever bought	2008-09-16	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1HUBEP5DJ6W51	Brooke276	At the risk of receiving hundreds of threatening e-mails, I will go on record stating that Ridley Scott's dystopian vision stands as one of the most unjustifiably praised films since the invention of sound. While  technically marvelous and full of visual invention (it does use noir  influences effectively), the story drags on endlessly and the characters,  especially Ford's, remain aloof, uninteresting, and frustrating. As an  exercise in style, it has undoubted appeal, but it must be heavily  criticized at the screenplay level. When a story is in service to the  visuals, it reflects a lack of confidence at the narrative level. I have  never found Ford to be an appealing actor (he is far too bland to be a  commanding leading man), but at no other time has his character been so  devoid of passion or insight.	2.0	One of the most overrated films of all time.....	2000-06-10	27	7	20

But, opposite to most people, I think the original version (not the Director's cut) is the best. The DVD has almost no extras, and for a film that had raised so many talking, it's a shame! All I want is a double DVD set containing both versions, with all the possible extras, something like what have been done in the Alien Box.	3.0	Poor DVD - Great film	2001-05-07	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3KA0Z3X5RB1YK	Bruce Evans	Blade Runner remains one of my top ten favorite films, no matter the variation, cut, or edit--in fact the only thing that could ruin this movie is the seemingly inevitable contemporary remake (please don't).  While loosely based on science fiction author Phillip K. Dick's masterful story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, this movie took on a life of its own with the rich styling, lavish attention to future detail, and character development.  Harrison Ford plays a Blade Runner, a futuristic cop of sorts, who is forced out of retirement to terminate &#34;replicants&#34; who have made their way to Earth &#34;illegally&#34;.  These genetically designed humanoids look like humans in every way, but are designed to be capable of dangerous tasks that humans might otherwise not wise to do.  They are not, however, permitted on Earth.  Nearly all the rest of the population has left, migrating to other planets we assume, but those who cannot pass a physical, have to remain.  In one of the incarnations of the film, Ford's character offers noir styled narration to accompany the film, and this in many ways, to my way of thinking, was the best variation.  As it has grown in popularity though, that track was removed by director Ridley Scott and scenes of unicorns included--hmmm, cool narration by Ford, slo mo unicorns?  Cool narration by Ford, slo mo unicorns?  I will take the narration please...In a final debate to keep the dream alive, Scott and others have thrown out their belief that Ford's character was himself a replicant, activated to hunt the other replicants.  I disagree, and have my &#34;evidence&#34; but will not discuss it here for fear of dealing out a spoiler in a review--which is just plain mean.  The music, design, and superb acting by a gifted cast come together for a film, that no matter its incarnation, is well worth watching more than once.  A truly big &#34;thumbs up&#34; from me.	5.0	To noir or not noir is the question...	2014-06-18	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1GB0HW46Y2EB	Bruce G. Taylor	"""Blade Runner"" is the type of film that people seem to either love or hate.  There are those who, like myself, initially did not care for it but later came to like it very much.  Categorically this is a sort of a film-noir detective story set in the near future (2019).  When the film was first released in 1982 it would have been considered fairly far in the future -- 39 years.  The film has a very different style and effect than films such as Star Wars, Star Trek or even Alien which, like this one, was directed by Ridley Scott.  Blade Runner may well come to be seen as being Scott's masterpiece if it isn't already.  There are a few flaws and anachronisms here and there.  A building in the  futuristic city has the ""Pan Am"" logo.  Neon displays, which have already mostly disappeared, are seen in store displays along with CRT type televisions, also largely gone now. Coca-Cola signs, as expected, seem to be displayed practically everywhere.Leonard Maltin gives this film a very negative rating in his annual movie book and I, at first, agreed with him.  But subsequent viewings slowly began to change my mind.  It must be said that the first DVD issue of this film was technically terrible.  The color red was misconverged putting practically everything a little out of focus.  This Blu-ray 5-disc issue put that and practically everything else right.  The ""Final Cut"" version displays the truly remarkable cinematography and sound recording of this film.  Some of the shots of Sean Young are truly mesmerizing.  In fact the film as a whole in its visual and audible aspects has a sort of hypnotic effect unlike any other film of its type.  Especially effective is the superb score by Vangelis which adds great atmosphere to the visual aspects of the film.I won't go into the complexities of the plot as to whom is and whom is not an android -- in this movie referred to as a ""replicant.""  In addition, the ending of the story was altered by the producers which in itself set off a storm of discussion by fans of the film.  Also, a narration provided in the first person by Harrison Ford in the 1982 version(s) of the film was deleted in the 1992 ""Director's Cut"" and ""Final Cut.""  All versions of the film are provided in this extensive set so no one should be disappointed.  This is a very comprehensive and meticulously produced collection.  It is unlikely ever to be improved upon, but then one never knows."	4.0	This Set Has It All and the Benefits of Blu-ray	2012-09-24	8	7	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1HG2DOSBZEX4I	Bryan A. Pfleeger	"When the five disc Complete Collector's Edition of Blade Runner was released in December it was a cause for rejoicing among the many Blade Runner fans who made Ridley Scott's 1982 film a cult hit. The film, based upon Phillip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was a critical failure when it was released but with constant tweaking by the director has reached cult status. The presentation offered in this package is probably the must complete coolection of edits and variations of any film on the market today and Warner Brothers must be commended for the effort put forth here.The package opens with the 2007 Final Cut of the film. Introduced by Scott as his perferred cut the film features added materials (albeit one short scene) resynched dialogue in a few scenes and a face replacement that was long overdue in another critical scene. The Final Cut is essentially the Director's Cut of the 1982 International Version without the voice over. The Final Cut features three commentaries: by Scott;by writers Hampton Fancher and David Peeples with added comments by Producer Michael Deeley and Production Executive Katherine Haber; and by the films design team including Syd Mead, Laurence Paull, David Snyder, Douglas  Trumball and others.The Second Disc features the 3.5 hour making of feature Dangerous Days. This film interviews all of the surviving member of the cast and crew and presents possibly the most in depth making of feature I have ever seen.Disc Three is the film archive and presents the three versions of the film that  have been seen in theatres up to now. This was one of the reasons that I bought the set. It is here that the casual viewer finally gets the  long unavailable Theatrical Cut from 1982. This is the version with the voice over narration that Ridley Scott is so critical of. This version has many fans and there have been complaints over the years about its lack of availability. In my own view this is the version that I  perfer the best having only been able to see the ""Director's Cut"" in the late 1990's. The International Theatrical Cut (1982)is  presented next with its few seconds of added violence. This version also contains the voice over narration. The 1992 Director's Cut minus voice over and with the infamous added unicorn scene rounds out the disc.Disc Four is titled Enhancement Files and contains a plethora of bonus features divided into three catagories: Inception, Fabrication and Longevity. These may be played all together or separately. If played together make sure that you go back and listen to the audio only interview clips with writer Phillip K. Dick for his unique insight on the production. There are also three separate features on the importance of the poster design, a discussion of whether Harrison Ford's character is really a replicant and a discussion on the film's influence on other filmakers.Disc Five contains the rarely seen Workprint Version of the film. This version with some 70 plus variations from the released versions is closer in spirit to the Final Cut. Do not miss the commentary on this version by author Paul Sammon. Sammon wrote Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner and his commentary is probably the best of the four commentaries presented. Also on this dis is the featurette All Our Future Varients detailing the  differences between the versions and the Final Cut.All in all this is a detailed set which may be too much for the more casual fan but it does give a complete look into the making of the film and is highly recommended."	5.0	Excellent, But Do  We Need This Much Blade Runner	2008-01-29	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3SZATOPWZE0HN	B-Side	5 different versions of the film - crazy mad extras and cool little collectable spinner hover car and a small Art of Blade Runner book. Yes am a nerd/geek whatever, but you have to realize just about all the modern CGI Sci-Fi movies copy some, if not all, of their visual concepts from THIS MOVIE! To name a few Fifth Element, Total Recall reboot, I Robot, Minority Report, Judge Dredd Reboot...just about anything with flying cars, overcrowd culturally diverse modern cityscapes and heart-thumping jumping from building to building chase scenes. If it was made after 1982, they probably were at least influenced by this movie. Way ahead of its time and no computer generated anything, Blade Runner in my humble opinion, is in the top 5 Sci-Fi movies of all time, but its my personal favorite (dare I say it - even above Star Wars). OH NO HE DIDN'T! Watching it for the first time you probably couldn't tell it was made in the early 80's because the cinematography is that good. But all the actors are 31 years older now and some of the companies no loner exist (Pan Am being one of the more prominent). But a Ridley Friggin Scott film with Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos...I mean Damn!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2229XPD8WX12H	"Caliban821 ""Frank"""	The ultimate Bladerunner DVD set is a good purchase for the serious fan. Addressing all the extra collectibles that come with it, I think it is worth the $30 jump in price from the 4-Disc version. I only saw a description of those elements beyond the 5 discs listed recently. The briefcase is an entertaining piece of packaging and I admit to being very fond of the models of the car and orgami unicorn. The interior of the case is well organised and configured. The setup is attratcive enough that I have had no desire to even remove the hologram block or the screencards from the compartment. That being said, this is really only meant for the obsessive fan and understandable why it is a limited edition. For 90% of the people considering purchasing Bladerunner, they should just stick to the 4 Disc set.As to the film, the final cut print is quite exquisite and very satisfying. The technical changes they made are very well done and in a much more organic way then say some of the new effects in the updated Star Wars trilogy. I will say that having 5 versions of the film gets to be a bit too much. However the bonus features are where I think the real strength lies. The 3.5 hour documentary on the film's history is totally comprehensive and enthralling. It's structured into multiple parts and has a good narrative format that evokes the movie to a certain degree. Almost all the major members of cast and production are interviewed. The interviews are highly informative and revealing. There is a willingness by all to be honest and discuss the problems and the uglier aspects of the film's history before, during and after its production. People are candid without being incindiery or insulting. The doc is so insightful that a fair amount of the audio commentaries seem redundant or unnecessary. And there are at least 3 of them.The more technical based features dealing with the film production are very educational and well documented without being bloated or too long to make you lose interest. This is a problem I find with DVDs covering more recent special effects movies. They include a rare radio interview with the late Philip K Dick that is a pleasure to hear. They also address the issue of the book vs the movie and the question about Deckard and this is also done honestly with plenty of disagreement.Any other issues I have with the DVD set up is minor. I would have preferred a little user friendly setup on the arrangement of the bonuses and the activation of commentaries. Also the flickering camera grid gets annoying after a while. Been nice if they were not on every menu.	4.0	A top level piece of packaging for fans	2008-01-18	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"Due for re-release in December, this motion picture is one of the finest science fiction films of the 20th century. Part of this is because it projects a future that could be - the earth as a place with a ruined environment populated by people that couldn't or wouldn't make the jump to one of the more habitable off-world colonies. The other part is because the film questions what it means to be human, and explores the possibly unsatisfactory answers you might get if you could, like the replicants, hunt down your maker and ask him Why am I here? Why must my life end? I'll pretty much let Warner's press release do the talking from this point forward. Basically you have your choice of three different sets - 2-disc, 4-disc, and 5-disc. The discs are described as follows:Disc 1 - Ridley Scott's All-New ""Final Cut"" Version of the film - Restored and remastered with added & extended scenes, added lines, new and cleaner special effects and all new 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio. Also included is commentary by Ridley Scott and a host of others that worked behind the camera.Disc 2 - Documentary - Dangerous Days: Making of Blade Runner - A feature-length documentary revealing all the elements that shaped this cinema landmark. Cast, crew, critics and colleagues give a behind-the-scenes, in-depth look at the film from its literary roots and inception through casting, production, visuals and special effects to its legacy.Disc 3 - 1982 Theatrical Version - The original that contains Deckard's narration and has Deckard and Rachel's (Sean Young) ""happy ending"" escape scene.1982 International Version - Also used on U.S. home video, laserdisc and cable releases up to 1992. This version is not rated, and contains some extended action scenes in contrast to the Theatrical Version.1992 Director's Cut - Omits Deckard's voiceover narration and removes the ""happy ending"" finale. It adds the famous ""unicorn"" sequence, a vision that Deckard has which suggests that he, too, may be a replicant.Disc 4 - BONUS Disc ""Enhancement Archive"" - Eight featurettes, image galleries, radio interview with the author, and screen tests for the part of Rachel.Disc 5 - Workprint Version - This rare version of the film is considered by some to be the most radically different of all the Blade Runner cuts. It includes an altered opening scene, no Deckard narration until the final scenes, no ""unicorn"" sequence, no Deckard/Rachel ""happy ending,"" altered lines between Rutger Hauer and his creator Tyrell (Joe Turkell), alternate music and much more.Also included is commentary by Paul M. Sammon, author of Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner and a featurette - ""All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cut"".2 Disc Edition : Discs 1-24 Disc Edition : Discs 1-45 Disc Edition : Discs 1-5The downside of this 2-disc version is that you are only getting the Final Cut version of the film and the documentary disc. You won't get the bonus disc of featurettes, the disc of past releases, and the workprint version of the film. The upside is that the 5-disc version of the film has some expensive packaging and promotional material included that seems to really raise the price of the entire package."	5.0	Details & Features of Blade Runner Final Cut are announced	2007-07-28	638	577	61

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3U8QSO2EXATVQ	Cameron Ladd	I'll keep this short and sweet:  Blade Runner is one of my absolute favorite movies, if not my number one pick.  The Final Cut is the definitive version of the film, as it doesn't have the tacked-on (and horribly cheesy) ending, nor Harrison Ford's lazy, tiresome voiceover.  This film stands on its own, and if you haven't seen Blade Runner before, this is absolutely the version to get.  Superb on every level imaginable.This particular transfer is as good as we're ever going to get.  It's got some minor flaws here and there (particularly with some bits of uncompressed audio), but the messy production that plagued this film from its very inception is primarily to blame.  In this case, its the film's imperfections that give it so much charm.If you only have a stereo system, this Blu-ray won't murder your ears.  The Dolby TrueHD audio track sounds great on stereo speakers.  I wanted to point this out, because I know a lot of people don't have 5.1 surround sound systems, and unfortunately a majority of Blu-rays lack a stereo track, so the movie becomes a bit odd to watch.  This is not the case with Blade Runner, so purchase away!For the big fans or the collectors out there, keep in mind that this Blu-ray I'm reviewing is the single-disc version.  You will not get the 'Dangerous Days' documentary that tends to be so revered in the community.  If you're interested in that, the DVD multi-disc version is cheap, and you won't be missing out on quality.  If this were a two-disc release, the second disc with said documentary would actually be on an ordinary DVD, not a Blu-ray disc.	5.0	Excellent quality!	2011-09-14	4	4	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2VGC2EYC98RHA	Cameron Neil	I love Blade Runner, it's one of my favorite movies from one of my favorite directors. I will say, though, that the US theatrical cut isn't great. The voiceover is just unbearable, and it has a lot of the more violent scenes cut.Good thing is, though, this box set comes with 5 different cuts of the movie AND the unfinished Workprint version. I'd highly recommend watching 2007's Final Cut, which removes the Deckard voiceover completely, along with a few other changes. Then you can go back and watch the other cuts in whichever order you'd like.Definitely worth buying for any Ridley Scott or Blade Runner fans	5.0	Great movie, excellent package.	2013-07-02	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AWHFZHRA0GKLW	CandyStalker	"Yep, same thing happened to me (as indicated in the other customer reviews): Disc 1 is labeled The Final Cut but the content is the same as disc 5 (The Workprint).I thought this kind of thing only happened to OTHER people.I hope Warner Video responds to my complaint and makes it right.Meanwhile, it was good to revisit this classic, but imperfect, movie.  I first saw this as a youngster when it premiered in theaters back in '82, and numerous times since in its various incarnations.  Here are some observations upon watching it again with ""fresh eyes"":  Great cast... all except for Harrison Ford.  I never really noticed (or acknowledged) how terrible his performance is.  It is ""sub-Keanu"".  Ford appears to be in a coma/pot-stupor throughout the movie and is truly the weak link in an otherwise exceptional cast.  There are plenty of actors from the era who could have done so much better playing Deckard.  But nothing can be done about that now.I was impressed with the skill Sean Young brought to such a flimsy character.  Good job, girl!  Same goes for the other broads: Daryl Hannah (sexy and creepy) and Joanna Cassidy (sexy and violent).  Cassidy is onscreen so briefly but provides the movie's liveliest scenes (and not JUST because she gets topless).  Most of the film's (few) laughs come from the lively, otherworldly Rutger Hauer.  Brion James seemed to be an unusual choice to play Leon but is thoroughly effective.  William Sanderson, Joe Turkel, Edward James Olmos (saying olmos nothing) M. Emmet Walsh, even James ""Lo Pan"" Hong: all delightful.The movie really could have benefited from more energetic scenes like those featuring Cassidy.  This is why audiences were initially irked by the movie upon its original release: the preview was specatcular and this was Ford's follow-up to ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"".  We were expecting an action spectacle.  But the film has endured as a classic due to the considerable richness of its other qualities.Here's another observation: ""Blade Runner"" is very Kubrickian.  Despite the terrific cast, the photography is the star.  Special effects maestro Doug Trumbull also worked on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and here, as on that film, his work is still dazzling and magical after all these years.  It should also be noted that both movies feature a prominent Pan Am logo whereas that company did not last into the time-periods depicted in either!  Sure, Joe Turkel appeared in a couple of Kubrick movies, but tell me that the nose on J.F. Sebastian's diminutive ""friend"" is not almost identical to the one on the mask that Alex wore in ""A Clockwork Orange"", or that the replicant eyes do not remind one of the eye of HAL 9000.There's probably numerous other comparisons to be made if one has the time.

Sci-Fi story telling and movie making have not been the same since; can you even imagine a 'future' unlike the one depicted in this movie? The DVD transfer is adequate(but should only be watched in widescreen format).  The Directors Cut is the version to watch. Thank goodness the ridiculous narrative has been removed (a last minute add-on for it's theatrical release in '82). The added 'unicorn' dream sequence (although quick) fuels the debate over whether Deckard (Harrison Ford) is an replicant himself and pays slight homage to the original title of the book it is based on: ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"".The DVD however could use some more extras. A 'behind the scenes' section or a 'deleted scenes' section would've been nice; interviews with the cast would've been great.

The Director's Cut, however, is a sci-fi Hitchcock thriller.  While the Director's Cut is still visually fascinating and taps into some of the same themes, the actuall movie Blade Runner is an infinitely fascinating take on the original black and white film-noir genre and how Sam Spade would fit inside a future world.  If you've never seen either version, I would say get this DVD and watch it today, but I really wish that Ridley Scott would allow the original and much more intelligent thought provoking 1983 Blade Runner to come back.	3.0	Director's cut is all wrong	2002-02-12	9	5	4
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3GW14989FU2N9	"carlaf ""carlaf"""	Blade Runner is a movie that just cries out for the clarity of a DVD. This was the director's cut, so it is a little different, a bit darker than what was released in 1982. This story doesn't age with time, not just because of the great special effects but the story. It asks what happens when humanity creates replicants of itself and basically plays God. It gives them memories but only a limited lifetime - 4 years and sends them on assignmnets deemed too dangerous for human beings. They were banned from Earth and Decker, a Blade Runner, someone who hunts these replicants, is sent to find them and terminate them. The whole cast is very good but Rutger Hauer is outstanding as the head of the replicants. His final confronatation with Ford is almost too painful to watch. Buy it. IF not already considered a classic, it soon will be. And if you think the movie shows a bleak picture of a future earth, read &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by the late,great Phillip K. Dick on which the movie was based.	5.0	A great movie made even better with DVD	2001-08-24	1	1	0

There are all the different cuts of the film each with commentary tracks. After you are done watching the bonus features you will know more about blade runner than you ever thought possible. The only downside to the collection is that disks 2 and 4 (the making of and bonus features) are standard dvd and not blu-ray. The advantage of this is that if you have an upscaling player you can at least upscale to 1080 unlike the special features on Pirates 2 which were on a blu-ray disk and therefore unable to be upscaled. So not perfect but at least you arent forced to watch special features in 480.	5.0	The Best way to watch blade runner	2008-01-28	2	2	0

The narration is still one of the best things in the movie, the 1920's style detctive narration keeps the fils going and from putting you to sleep. I can do without the lame unicorn scene {which is probably a lame outtake from the cutting room floor of legend.} i dont care if harrison might be a replicant and the happy ending people complain about is more ambiguous than happy.to be honest whilst the directors cut is still a fairly good movie, it is very slow and boring. the theatrical cut is easily a 4 star movie if not higher.

Bass ""Chris"""	When Ridley Scott decided to make a movie version of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,&quot; he took on a daunting task.  This short novel grabs the reader from the beginning and won't let go until the story is over.  I couldn't put it down.  To translate that to the screen, Ridley Scott appropriately added a voice over narration to help explain the development of the story.  In his director's cut, he removed this voice over and made it all but impossible to truly understand what is happening in the story.  I love this movie, but refuse to buy... ...the Director's Cut.  Even though I know the story, the film is just not complete without the narration.	2.0	The Director Had It Right the First Time	2001-01-23	5	2	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2PJ7PREW58K1Y	cburke	I've viewed both origional and DC versions, and I'm sorry, but the DC is much better.  If I want sci-fi that's easy to understand and has a happy ending, I'll watch Star Wars.The narration in the origional actually  doesn't bother me that much.  It was largely useless, either irrelevant or  not hard to figure out.  It's neat background that the guy was speaking a  local dialect that was a combination of other languages, but it didn't help  the story at all.  And it's not hard to figure out that Decker is a Blade  Runner, or what Blade Runners do.  While not horrid, I prefer the movie  without the narration so I can focus on the movie, and also to get rid of  that nagging feeling that my intelligence is being insulted.What is  horrid in the origional is the ending.  For one, it's happy, and Blade  Runner is not a happy movie.  BR is a tragedy, and trying to force it into  being otherwise doesn't work.  Second, the ending came out of nowhere.  It  was obvious that it was just tacked on.  Also, it did a nice job of  ignoring the central question of the film (plotwise) -- whether Decker is  human or not.In the DC, there are some more scenes with character  development that help bring the afforementioned question into better focus.  Especially the important unicorn scene.  The unicorn scene is important!  At the end of the film, there is a reference to the unicorn scene -- a  reference made by someone who should not have known about it.  That's what  makes it important, and why it further calls into question Decker's  humanity.  Talk about not making sense -- in the origional, the reference  to the unicorn scene is made, but with no unicorn scene.  That makes no  sense.Now despite prefering the DC much more, I will say that I'm  dissapointed that both versions don't appear on the DVD.  I may not like  it, but it would be usefull for comparison and for those (obviously  plentiful) people who miss having Harrison Ford explain everything to them.  What else are DVD's for?  So I have to give the DVD a 4 instead of a 5.	4.0	The DC is a good thing.	2000-03-10	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1PCNEEX0LGV3J	"""ccouples"""	Contrary to the opinions of the reviewers here, I believe that the Director's Cut of Blade Runner is far superior to the original release. Having both the original and director's cuts on video, and the Director's cut on DVD, I've watched the movies probably fifty times over the years.The original cut worked almost in spite of itself; Harrison Ford's narration moved the movie in a particular direction at a particular pace. Unfortunately, it also left very little regarding the story open to the imagination, or to interpretation. While the narration created a vaguely &quot;noirish&quot; feel (maybe), it actually undercut the ambiguity that Scott was going for (and which the best film noir work has).The Director's Cut remedied the flaws: it got rid of the narration, which slowed the movie down a little bit, forcing the viewer to follow and try and make sense of the film (which to my mind is a _good_ thing); the more ambiguous ending fits far better, I think, with the fundamental questions concerning the nature of humanity which Scott attempts to explore throughout the film. From Sean Young's &quot;personal question&quot; to Deckard (&quot;Have you ever retired a human by mistake?&quot;) to Deckard's own struggle between his responsibility as a Blade Runner to off Sean Young's character, and his growing empathy/love towards her.The original cut was a good to very good film; the director's cut is far superior.	5.0	Um... no	2002-04-09	4	1	3

It would be redundant.  Yet it is such a fascinating movie that is worthy of study.

My personal favorite is The Final Cut, though I do reserve a certain fondness for the original theatrical release.  The documentaries and interviews are comprehensive and  well-done.  I cannot praise the thoroughness of this compilation highly enough, though perhaps that may also be the one point I could criticize:  there is an awful lot of material, and not all of it would be of interest to everybody.  I found myself wandering and nodding off at times.Nevertheless, it's just about ALL THERE!  For uber-fans, this is a must!  (Though I kind of wish I had the Final Cut on Blu-Ray...)

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3K0NUOGEQDJ0W	"""ceraph"""	This is a review with 3.75 stars, but I rounded up for lack of incremental stars.First off, let me mention who this review is aimed at specifically.  It's mainly aimed at people like me, avid readers and  watchers of SF, Fantasy, Anime, and specifically cerebral anime.  (Cerebral  anime is anime which is often more of a social statement than a narrative,  ie. Serial Experiments - Lain.)  If you're used to cerebral anime, Blade  Runner is a walk in the park.  I really don't understand the complaints  about ambiguity -- I saw none in the Director's Cut.  I have never seen the  original, but I presume from all the comments that it is the typical  Hollywood-geared plot with a happy ending.After watching the Director's  Cut, I don't think I want to see the original.  It would ruin the artistic  beauty and intellectual aspects of the movie that I enjoyed during my first  viewing.  Most cerebral anime has to be watched multiple times to gain an  understanding of the social and intellectual arguments.  Blade Runner is  clear-cut to those who are used to ambiguous plots and characters.  That  doesn't detract from its multiple viewing aspects, however...As a movie,  Blade Runner is a masterpiece of dark SF.  I had always heard &quot;Blade  Runner inspired&quot; when I saw something Dark SF, but I had never  understood it until now.  The dark cityscape of future LA is enthralling to  me, and I just wish I could find more movies/anime that could create the  dark, sullen mood that Blade Runner created for me.The movie still  contains some Hollywood-esque moments that do little to further the  artistic quality of the movie.  But they do not necessarily detract  either.The visual effects of the movie are gorgeous for a film made in  1991.  The sound quality of the DVD was a little bland, but I presume it is  because of the sound technology at the time the movie was made.	4.0	Specfically to those who have never seen Blade Runner...	2000-06-09	9	3	6

I purchased this for a friend for christmas, mainly cause he's young and needs to learn about the classics. The presentation is nice, small hardcovr book with every version of the movie you can think of with a really nice amount of extras. The artwork in the book is great as well. I have another version of this, and may get this copy in order to get the book itself, great for collecting or for  a conversation piece. I have been getting more blu ray book versions and this one looks great (packaging) and is a must have for any die hard sci fi fans. For literary buffs, although it's based on the Philip K. Dick novel, &#34;do androids dream of electronic sheep&#34; there is a huge huge deviation from the book. So do not prejudge and simply appreciate it for what it is, the movie story line though is compelling There is a lot more depth added as well and so much additional scenes as it's only based on a short story not a full novel. So purists beware. the next part is a spoiler in case u haven't seen it yet. One point of contention betwe4en Harrison Ford and Ridley scott was the &#34;unicorn dream&#34; and how it was suppposed to make us think he is a replicant. Ford says it's better for him to be human, while Ridley seemed to like the ambiguity that it implies. I for one never found the unicorn dream to mean anything. It just seems like  something any man might dream about in a future where animals are priceless commodities. There is the telling of how he wanted an animal for himself but couldn't afford it. so the dream to me didn't imply too much. Maybe cause I am thinking of it in more of a literary sense and not so much as a standalone movie. But other than that this is a definite classic and should be watched and enjoyed by any sci fi fan or harrison ford fan.	5.0	A classic goes High Def	2013-01-08	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3BG4WDJTMHRTF	Charles Glover	"They say there are at least seven different versions of Blade Runner out there.  I have seen at least four of them.  SPOILER ALERT:1) Original theatrical version with Harrison Ford voiceover narration and ""happy"" ending which featured landscape footage that Stanley Kubrick cut from the credits of ""The Shining.""  This was shown at the end when Deckard and Rachael made their escape and he said there was hope that she would live.  They say they showed the film to test audiences who didn't ""get it,"" so they made Ford come back to the studio to narrate it.  He didn't want to, so he delivered it in the flat, deadpan voice on purpose.2) This version, which ""contains scenes of graphic violence edited from the theatrical version.""  THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT!  Aside from the ""director's cut"" this is the best.  It has the same as the theatrical and MORE.  It shows an extended version of Harrison Ford gunning down the first female replicant, a longer and more brutal fight between him and Pris, and Roy Batty kills Tyrell and we get to see his thumbs poke out the man's eyes. That's about it, but it is worth it if you watch the narrated version.3) A 10 Year Anniversary which is not much different than the above two.4) The director's cut which trims the ""graphic violence"" footage, removes the voiceover narration, adds a unicorn scene (taken from footage of Ridley Scott's movie ""Legend"") which suggests Deckard might be a replicant (as does the original Philip K Dick book), and trims the landscape footage at the end, stopping the movie where Deckard and Rachael flee.Rumor has it that there will be a special edition in 2007 which includes the original version (which of the two I'm not certain), the director's cut, and a new director's edition which nobody seems to know what it will contain.  They've been talking about this for years so I'm not holding my breath. Still, this remains one of my favorites."	5.0	Make Sure You Get the Right Version	2006-02-24	30	29	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A11L8QJD2JXBUP	Charles M. Britzman	"There is some debate over which version of BR is the ""best"".The original theatrical and videocassette releases containthe voice-over narration and the ""feel good"" ending, plusextra violence scenes - all of which are gone from thedirector's cut version. The film's creators, the actors,and,(from what I can gather)most fans of the film hated thenarration and the ending because they were imposed onRidley Scott by the studio after test audiences had troublefollowing the plot, and after control of the film had beencontractually taken away from Scott after budget overruns.Thus, an otherwise great film hadsupposedly been adulterated by non-artistic interlopers intenton dumbing-down the film to increase it's appeal to thegreat unwashed masses (and their wallets).In the specific case of Blade Runner, I feel the studio execsactually improved my enjoyment of the film. When I saw theoriginal release in '82, the dreamy Vangelis score, the excellentvisuals of a dark and dying Los Angeles, not to mention thegraphic violence, conspired to alternately seduce and distractme constantly. The voice-over narration provided the viewpoint""above it all"" that called me back to the plot after being ledoff by the texture and power of the production design and themenace of the fugitive replicants. The famous death scenewhere the replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)comes tohis preprogrammed end, is one of the great moments in ALL ofscience fiction - and the point at which anyone unclear on themeaning of the film will be straightened out. Another great andpowerful moment, is when Deckard callously informs Rachel(Sean Young)that her memories are not her own - they are implantedcopies of Tyrell's niece's. An immense wave of silent devastationplays across Rachel's normally stoic face - perhaps the finestmoment of Young's career.But the voice-over version IS the one that put BR on the map- and has more charm. As for the unicorn sequences in thedirector's cut, I don't need or wantDeckard to turn out to be a replicant. (Deckard's unicorn dreamsknown to Gaff,who makes unicorn origami, because Gaff learns ofunicorn ""implants"" in replicant Deckard from Tyrell) I feelthat it's important to see a true human go thru an evolutionof awareness regarding engineered human life, notanother replicant.  In any other film it would be afascinating subject to explore, but inthe context of the rest of BR, awkward. That would mean thewhole movie is about a high-order replicant (Batty) teaching alow-order replicant (Deckard) what it is to be synthetic. Well,that's a cool idea, but to have it descend on us in the last5 minutes, after assuming Deckard is human the whole time,and especially after Batty's dying words(written by Hauer),isn'ta thought-provoking shocker ending, but a needless confusion ofan otherwise perfectly wonderful lesson in the dangers of playingGod.

We watched this movie repeatedly on cable tv back in 1984 while we were in college.  I vividly remember it as one of the most haunting and captivating  films I had ever seen.  Late at night, the whole picture seemed to flow  right out into the always darkened room, meeting and penetrating a  spellbound audience.  It was, and still is, almost impossible not to grab a  glass and join Deckard when he pours that drink in his apartment.  I  thought I had scene everything in the movie over the last 15 years, until I  bought the DVD version.  STUNNING!!!!  It was like watching an entirely  different movie, scenes behind scenes, behind scenes.  Do Androids Dream of  Electric Sheep?  I think they do.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2O47MG6OIMAJK	C. Harris	While I think I prefer the directors cut to the original (although I'm not as adamant about it as some), I've noticed something in recent years.  There's alot of us out there who swear by this movie, but almost all of us saw it for the first time as the theatrical version.  People seeing the directors cut fot the first time don't seem to like it as well.As akward as the voice over was (I didn't think it was that bad to begin with), I've begun to believe it was neccesary at least for the first or second viewing.  Some very important, beautiful subtext just may not be there strongly enough without it.So if you're a first timer and you can actually find the original version, start with that.Why I like the movie-  Harrison Ford is fine in this.  Yes he is a bit flat, as people say (course I think he usually is).  What's interesting about this movie on a character basis is not Deckard, but Roy Battey.  Roy Battey is one of my all time favorite movie characters.  The murderous genious child man who hasn't had enough time to understand morality and wants nothing more than time.  The ending of the movie makes sitting through the slow bits completely worth while.I think it's the ommision of the voice over explanation of some of the events at the end of the film that seems to be making it more challenging for new audeinces.  The visuals, textures and ideas are why this film is good, but it's the ending that made this film great.	5.0	All time favorite movie	2004-12-04	13	12	1

Harrison Ford's voice over add greatly to the atmosphere of the movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A233KZTTRORQRF	"ChefBum ""chefbum"""	Ridley Scott's 'Bladerunner' is a visual masterpiece, a stunning classic and original science fiction film noir.  The special effects and set design are well done, especially for their time, and the great attention to detail  and numerous nice touches are evident even after multiple viewings.  This  stark, visionary look at the future of L.A. is absolutely the most highly  original and stylish of any science fiction movie yet.I am disappointed  by the DVD version of the 'Director's Cut', which could and should have  much more in the way of extra features, including out-takes, director and  cast commentary, and many other extras usually included with films that  have state-of-the-art special effects.  This version of 'Bladerunner' has  none of that, only the bare-bones selections for languages, subtitles, and  track access.This is an inexcusable omission for a movie of such cult  stature.  In fact, I am sure that if the studio were to release a second  DVD containing nothing but the 'extras' for 'Bladerunner', it would surely  be a profitable seller.  This movie was too well-done and too influential  to not have all the DVD extras.So: I give it five stars for content  ('Bladerunner' is the best movie in existence of its kind), and three for  the DVD rendition, for a composite total of four stars.	4.0	a classic, underdone	2000-01-16	81	74	7

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AOHBRQOWCDHZ4	Chris  D.	This movie is a complete experience. I saw this movie for the first time as a 3rd grader (too young) back in 1983, and it is still my favorite. Visually it is flawless - not a &quot;1990's-looks-like-it-was-done-on-a-computer&quot; crap that every studio churns out now. This movie spawned a vision of the future that is now the standard in japanese animation. Ridley Scott is THE most visually- oriented director of our time and this movie is a perfct example of his &quot;look&quot;. Now, there are other great looking sci-fi movies out there (Star Wars), but this movie does not have a simple good vs. bad theme. S.W. was an excellent vision of the future, but for adults it lacks the &quot;grey&quot; areas of human existence. It also lacked adult passions. NOT BLADERUNNER. In this movie, the essence of what it means to be human is questioned, love between a man and a &quot;woman&quot; is explored, and androids wrestle with the idea of death. Humans have wrestled with these matters since the beginning of time, and seeing them projected into humans (and non-humans) in the future are what really make this film work. NOT your typical &quot;guy movie&quot; about the future that focuses on technology - but one that can appeal to both sexes equally. A good choice if you want your girlfriend to watch a sci-fi movie with cool guns, androids, and flying cars.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2ZGEWSKL9VGSG	Chris	I haven't noticed anyone commenting on this in any other reviews so I'm assuming this is not a well known fact. But this so-called &quot;Director's Cut&quot; leaves out several of the more violent scenes shown in an earlier Unrated VHS version of the film. These include a graphic shot of the eyeball squish scene, a longer segment of Deckard pulling the nail out of his hand, as well as a few others. Why is the heck would they not include these scenes in a Director's Cut? Doesn't make any sense...BTW, this VHS version has been out of print for quite some time and I have never seen another copy like it, other than the one I purchased &quot;used&quot; from a now-defunct rental store.	3.0	An interesting side note....	2004-01-27	3	3	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A377LPVLLAI42D	Chris	I loved this film when I saw it at the movies in 1982. It only got better with the small adjustments, losing the voiceover and all that. I was surprised to find the US had never seen the version the UK got. When I bought my first VHS machine in 1987 this was my first tape, when I got my first DVD player in 1999 this was my first DVD. It will probably be my first HD-DVD, when they end the format wars.But here we have the final cut. Some of the dialog has been adjusted, it's subtle and I'm far from convinced it was necessary and don't always agree with the change, but that's fine. The movie finally scans right for the US audience, it makes sense the way Ridley Scott always intended it to. So it is the definitive version and I expect to watch it often.But the thing that makes it worth every single cent is the director's commentary by Ridley Scott. This is an outstanding and wonderfully informative commentary. He goes in to the background of details, Rutger Hauer penned the final version of Roy's last words, Harrison Ford came up with the blood in the glass and catching the bottle as he sat up. Loads more. But there's also details on the methods used to achieve the lighting effects, like how the owl's eyes light up and why he used it on Sean Young later. He even explains why some people thing Deckard is a replicant.Excellent. Christmas came early for me.	5.0	Wonderful - well worth buying again	2007-12-18	5	3	2

I prefer the narration but the  tape version does not have the picture quality.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2ACA449E80MUL	chrisjr	I really like the way this film blurs the distinction between human and machine, and seems to beg the question, &quot;So if a human is no different then a machine, then what makes a human human?&quot; The film subtly  responds, &quot;It is the complex interaction and relationship between  these machines that make them more&quot;. You could probably pull the  thread of a number of underlying themes.The Vangelis soundtrack is also  my all time favorite. The music swells and glistens and is rich with  texture and subtle sound effects. It actually adds to the environmental  atmosphere of the film and is very effective even without the visuals.Personally I think the film is strong enough that both the original  release and the Director's Cut are just as good. I do like the slightly  darker feel and ending in the Director's Cut. I find the narrative a bit  unnecessary and distracting. However, as one other reviewer mentioned the  original release has more of a vintage 40's noir feel due to the narrative.  Either way this film is brilliant. Watch it a few times to fully appreciate  it.It is too bad the DVD release doesn't take the opportunity to  include extras. To make up for it pick up a copy of the book &quot;Film  Noir: The Making of Blade Runner&quot; by Paul M. Sammon&quot;.	5.0	An Intelligent and Beautiful Poetic Film	2000-04-30	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A39KJOCZGCM8P1	Chris Lee Mullins	"I'm not going to bother reviewing the film. Its awesome. Its awesome having all five versions in the same box together.What's **more** awesome is the documentary, ""Dangerous Days"". Its extremely detailed, exhaustively researched and (amazingly!) never boring. Topping out at nearly four hours, I actually managed to get through it in one sitting. This is compelling stuff.The doc is not one of those ""HBO Sneek Peek"" affairs where everyone is compelled to heap praise on one another. While there may be a few punches pulled, you'll still notice actors or gaffers or writers or producers damning each other with faint praise. And Harrison Ford swears. Alot!What's more, other rising stars in the world of cinema weigh in on the impact of Blade Runner in their world. Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption), Ronald Moore (BSG, Star Trek), Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Devil's Backbone) and more show up to pontificate poetically on what Blade Runner meant to them.""Dangerous Days"" leaves no stone left unturned. Its honest and straightforward. I left it feeling much more informed about the creative process than in other docs such as ""Hearts of Darkness"".If you are a Blade Runner fanatic, I think your choice is made. Now you just gotta figure out whether or not the plastic case and the ""Spinner"" replica is worth another 30-40 bucks.NOTE - ""Dangerous Days"" is not in HD, j ustregular old 480P.

The definitive version of the film, a comprehensive documentary, and all the other versions of the film for comparison (except the workprint, which quite frankly, your average non-obsessed fan will not care much about). Plus deleted and alternate scenes, featurettes on Phillip K. Dick, trailers, and lots of other goodies to keep you entertained for hours.Just as an aside: I saw the theatrical version with narration for the first time with this set. I alternated between grimacing and laughing at Ford's narration. And the ending was atrocious considering what had gone before. Maybe it's because the Director's Cut was the way I first saw the film, but this version didn't work for me at all.Nope, I think the Final Cut is the best yet. Cleaned up, ""fixed"" digitally, and just the right tone. But if you're a fan of the original, it's here, too. That's the great thing about this set: something for almost everyone.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2JQWN0MFQNODC	Chris Moon	The one word that I very quickly associate with the directors cut of Blade Runner is, WOW!  After having seen the original movie, I thought it was so-so, and I was really annoyed at being told the story by Harrison Ford's  character, the choice to eliminate the voice-over was very  intelligent.The movie follows a detective-type character (a blade  runner) in this case, as he chases down a gang of escaped killer  androids(or replicants).  However, during the process of tracking the  replicants, our blade runner begins to uncover a disturbing truth about  himself and those others around him.The unicorn dream sequence that was  added definetly added to the overall effect of the movie, the effect was  absolutely jaw dropping.  Such a clear message presented in such an  abstract way.The only thing that I would fault with this movie is the  quality of the sound editing, I found that sometimes the voices could have  used some jumping to contrast the sometimes very loud background  music.Overall however, I would highly recommend this DVD to any avid  sci-fi DVD collector, and I think it did a respectable job basing itself  off of Phillip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.	4.0	Perhaps Androids Do Dream of Electric Sheep	2000-05-17	2	2	0

The visuals are superb, this movie was made before computer era and special effects in it  rival the most expensive, computer-generated effects in today's movies. It  has an atmosphere that many tried to copy but very few succeeded. I've seen  it many times and each time I see it I discover new things. During my last  viewing I started contemplating it's religious points. It is a tragic story  of androids created by humans with a limited life span and made for human  (God?) purpose. Yes, they are violent, but that's how they were created.  They are not to blame; it's their creators who should be. If you just  watched this movie once you have to see it again. You'll discover many  hidden aspects that are not apparent during first viewing. It is a classic.	5.0	The best SF movie ever made	1998-11-21	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A78UK4PFXMLH4	Christian Hokenson	"5 stars for the film only...  2 stars for the DVD presentation from Warner Home Video.For being the studio that launched the DVD revolution (the DVD format we know and love today is a product of the combined research and development between Warner Home Video and Toshiba electronics), Warner Home Video/Warner Bros. could seemingly care less about the fans and the home cinema experience.  Typical of the neglect they shower upon consumers of DVD's is ""Blade Runner.""  Warner's pretty much sums up their attitude with their (sub)-standard packaging: cardboard and a wee bit of plastic... There are no booklets (as usual on early Warner's DVD releases), no image on the DVD itself (since this DVD offers full screen on one side and widescreen on the other, it's a negligible problem for this release), and nary an extra to be found.  Warner Bros. has an AMAZING back catalog of films in their archives... and they certainly don't mind releasing them in droves to unsuspecting consumers;  however, except for the rare DVD release of a great Warner's film in a well presented DVD package (""Citizen Kane's"" DVD release is a good example of what they can do when they kinda sorta care) the studio seems, for the most part, to just toss 'em out there without extras (or limited extras), and very often with no commentary from the technical team or the actors. Furthermore, the awful, cheesy packaging they foist upon the average consumer (Criterion they ain't) just makes their DVD packages pale compared to other studio's home video releases (even MGM finally cleaned up their act a bit, and now release special editions of popular films and critical classics).  ""Blade Runner"" MORE than deserves a proper DVD release, and a re-release should include (on a seperate disc): the full script (NOT in a CD-ROM format thank you very much (for those of us that own Macs)), the full production notes, behind the scenes archival material (of which there is tons), any deleted scenes, a seperate version of the original release (with the awful Deckard voiceover and the ""Shining"" ending... film geeks, you know what I'm talking about) and anything else they could graciously put in there for the fans (like a background-bio on Phillip K. Dick and ""Do Androids..."").  The first disc, of course, should be a proper, 16X9 enhanced widescreen presentation with a completely remastered soundtrack in DTS, Dolby 5.1 (at least) and 2.0 Surround.  Commentaries from Scott, the cast, and the special effects technicians (including Syd Mead) should dominate this disc on separate tracks... and, though Ridley Scott's films on DVD are notorious for very small letterboxing (the image often looks like the opening slit on a box of Kleenex) they could spruce it up for 16X9 at a higher resolution, with few compression artifacts (a nasty DVD affliction common to all DVD's) and STILL offer a full screen version!  A three-disc set is not out of the question for a film of this caliber.  But, alas alack, Warner's continuously screws the pooch and feels content to release crappy DVD presentations in order to do what they do best: grab your cash before you know how worthless the product is.Shape up Warners!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ATO1357YBM6TD	Christian Lowensprung	This is probably one of the most stunning movies ever. Not the best action of all time, and not the best science fiction movie of all time. It just, in its own way, explains the beauty of life, and how precious we all are.At first, I thought the movie stunk, because there really is just one action scene in the entire movie. But now, when I &quot;saw between the lines&quot; as it were, I discovered the fragilety in each of the characters. Whenever the characters start to fade away, such as the replicants tend to do (robots that they are (one played by brilliant Rudger Hauer)), the music of Vangelis does the rest of the job. The music, the dark of theme of the movie, the great but not overdone acting, everything is at it should be for a good science fiction flick.George Lucas seemed to misunderstand that fact with the new Star Wars 1 movie ey? They don't make them like they used to, plus this version doesn't have the annoying Harrison Ford voice over in the ending, and doesn't have that &quot;chipper&quot; ending that seemed &quot;finished in the last moment.&quot; You earn it to yourself to get this movie, and appreciate life in all its glory, and sometimes also downside.	5.0	If movies were in a Museum, this would be Mona Lisa	2001-11-16	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1CZICCYP2M5PX	Christian Pelchat	In the Year of 2019 from the Futuristic City of Los Angeles.

Ford is Terrific (In One of Best His Roles). The Film has an Stong Supporting Cast-Including:Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, M.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1J6WQF5OY4DIV	"Christian Puzder ""C. Puzder"""	"Last night I had the pleasure of watching Ridley Scott's masterpiece Blade Runner in beautiful HD DVD. Blade Runner is the story of a Deckard, a retired cop played by Harrison Ford who returns to service to hunt 4 Replicants - humanoid robots - built by the Tyrell corporation that threaten the peace and civility of 2019 Los Angeles. An erie look into human existence with technology in the future, Blade Runner is a dark movie. This HD DVD version has fully restored audio and video by Ridley Scott. In a :37 introduction to the movie the director says this HD DVD version is his favorite - we agree.Despite the dark colors and tones the image was as clear as you would expect from a our beloved HD DVD format. I have seen this movie many times on VHS and cable. In those formats the picture was grainy; sets and characters blended togather. On our HD DVD format the depth of the images was astounding and added new life to this cult classic. The TrueHD audio does not disappoint and adds to the future environment portrayed by Ridley Scott's images.Along with the 2007 HD DVD ""final cut"" version the 5 disc set includes a making of Blade Runner documentary, various behind the scenes featurettes, the obligatory director's commentary and some bonuses including the original theatrical release in 1080p, the international theatrical release in 1080p, the 1992 remaster in 1080p. On top of all that content included also is a first cut of the movie. Truly a collectors set. I opted to get the $34.00 5 disc set from Best Buy on my way home from work. I have to say it is quite a value, 5 discs for $34.00.So should you buy this movie for your HD DVD collection? Yes. absolutely. The picture is beautiful, the attention to detail comes to life in HD DVD. The audio is a  model for HD DVD mixing and the special features are over the top. Unfortunately it did not pass the wife test. She is not much of a film noir/sci fi movie fan."	5.0	A must have for any HD DVD collection	2008-01-03	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A30JPZ9TZ7I61U	"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi"""	I won't bore you with the story or plot of the film here, I want to report on the quality of the transfer to blu-ray.So many films have been released on blu-ray that do little justice to the HD format: this is NOT one of those films.  Along with Kingdom of Heaven, this is one of Ridley Scott's true masterpieces.  The ultimate edition is not much different than the director's cut (which was a vast improvement on the theatrical release), but the set contains every edition released.  I do not intend to ever watch the theatrical release ever again as the narration was a horrible afterthought by the film execs (who really should not [...] in where they have no expertise).  Both the director's cut and ultimate cut are included as well so you can select which to view.  There are plenty of extras that are well worth watching, again not the norm (most extras are empty filler).Basically if you are looking to purchase this, you have already seen Blade Runner and I am here to say YES the blu-ray is worth the purchase, WELL worth it!	5.0	For the Blu-ray edition: a masterpiece made better!	2008-03-23	1	1	0

I am in no way related to the Tyrell Corporation that is in ""Blade Runner,"" but since the names are so similar, people are always asking me questions about it.  Consequently, I've become quite an expert on the movie over the years, but I am in no way affiliated with the movie.  And thank Godness!This movie is a science fiction movie, but there are not any kind of cool laser fights or villainous aliens like you would expect in any movie from the genre.  In fact, the plot revolves around Harrison Ford walking around and whispering in the rain and then...oh wait a minute.  That's all that happens!  Oh, and Darryl Hannah does some backflips that are actually pretty cool.  Other than that, though, this movie fails on most levels and especially I don't like Rutger Howard.In the future, according to this movie, there are robots and evil people and somehow they are all outsmarting Harrison Ford.  This is very hard to believe, because if you've ever seen ""Presumed Innocent"" or ""Working Girl"" or ""Six Days, Seven Nights,"" then you know that it is very very tricky to outsmart Harrison Ford, especially when he is at the top of his game.If they decide to make a Blade Runner II (and I'm sure they will) what they should do is give Harrison Ford a funny sidekick like Chris Tucker who says wisecracks while they are tracking down the robots.  Then it would be a charming movie, instead of a depressing rainy mess, which is what this is.  I'm sure by the time we reach the year that this movie takes place (in the future), there probably will be flying cars and such, but I would guess that at the very least we will have figured out a way to make it a little sunnier.  Note to scientists: work on making more sun for the future, and please don't work on Blade Runner II!I like my future bright like in ""Back to the Future II"" or ""Back to the Future III"""	2.0	Snorefest 2007	2007-07-30	190	12	178

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A29MU8NCEVUYWX	"Chuck ""Spaced Out"""	Surprisingly, some think this masterpiece is boring and overrated. I'm not one of them. Blade Runner is futuristic film noir. It's like The Big Sleep on speed. Ford is a Philip Marlowe type. If you don't have a strong film background, you may not apprieciate the nuances of the production. It is slow paced, and I welcome this more each year. Every action film released today is wall-to-wall action, with little real character development. Seeing a film like this today is a breath of fresh air. Another plus is the production design, which created a lived-in look to the city. Before this film every sci-fi flick was bright. This film presented an atmosphere of societal's downfall. And the point to the film is that everyone acts like a robot, whether they actually are one or not. Decker probably has the most feelings of anyone, and he is an andoid! Hauer's character's speech at his time of death reinforces the argument that these robots have feelings. He regrets that all his memories will be lost after he dies. Finally, in our world of 2007, where everyone seems to live in his or her own world, with their cell phones and blackberries and Type A personalities, running around for no apparent reason, Scott's prediction of the future seems to have come true.	5.0	Blade Runner is Excellent Film Noir	2007-07-31	14	9	5

The very first DVD I bought back in 1997, before I even owned a DVD player, was ""Blade Runner""; it was my litmus test to see if this new DVD movie format was any good. And boy-oh-boy, was it ever. But over time, the original ""Blade Runner"" DVD has really shown its age. It had no extras, terrible picture quality compared to current DVDs, and inferior sound.So now we have the HD-DVD Ultimate Collector's Edition of ""Blade Runner"". I could write a magnum opus about everything that is good about this set, but I just want to concentrate on the really, really important stuff.First, the picture and sound quality is simply amazing. The entire film has been remastered in 4K and 8K high-definition, and every frame painstakingly cleaned of dust and scratches. The result is a totally immersive cinematic experience that looks as good now as when the movie was first released in 1982 (it may even be better). Simply breathtakingly good.Second, CGI and reshoots have been used to clean up all of the niggly little mistakes that have been in the movie all of these years. Wires holding up the spinners, the obvious stuntwoman when Zhora crashes through the glass, Deckard's mouth not matching his spoken words when talking to Abdul Ben Hassan, the wrong cityscape when the dove takes off, the finger on Batty's shoulder when he's in the Vid-Phon booth. All of these, and more, have been fixed, absolutely seamlessly.And finally, the continuity errors that plagued previous releases have all been corrected. For example, now there were TWO replicants that got fried running through an electrical field, so the numbers through the rest of the movie all make sense.The result of all of this is that the best SF movie ever, and one of the best overall movies ever, is now as close to perfect as it's ever going to get.Add to all of that the 4 OTHER versions of the movie, including the legendary Workprint; all of the supplemental materials, deleted scenes, documentaries; and the cool toys in the box.This set is absolutely worth buying. I'd give it 6 stars if the system would let me."	5.0	I've... Seen Things You People Wouldn't Believe...	2007-12-20	4	4	0

"In many ways, Ridley Scott's films remind me of Brian de Palma's: many people consider him a filmmaking icon, a notable director among the many many other ones making good or bad films. Sure de Palma has his Scarface and his Untouchables but don't forget he also had the forgettable Snake Eyes and Mission to Mars. Ridley Scott meanwhile has Alien and Gladiator(overrated personally) but he does have White Squall and 1692 but chalk Blade Runner up in his more memorable films has its probably one of the better made sci-fi films of the 80's.It's 2017 and mankind has developed Replicants, humanoids who look very similar to humans and used for degrading work. After they decide to revolt, humans start making specialists - blade runners - to ""retire"" the replicants, in other words, kill. They bring in Deckard, a retired blade runner, to track down replicants who recently escaped all the while falling in love with one.A lot of futuristic films seem to be very ambitious where the technology reaches a point where anything's possible. Interstellar travel, flying cars, sophisticated ID systems and holographs are very present in these kind of films but oddly, Blade Runner doesn't have as much. While it does have some scenes involving flying cars going over neon-lit cities and a woman's face on a building, when we're on ground level the technology isn't as apparent. It helps the film feel real and plausible without looking too ambitious for its own good.It's interesting to note that although the film is considered a sci-fi film, it's kind of light on action scenes. It's not that big of a deal but when you look at the main cover art, Deckard with gun in hand, but people thinking this is going to be a slam-bang action film by Ridley Scott might be disappointed. I was surely expecting it but seeing the film, as good as it was, I was like ""wow, not a lot of fast parts"". Then again, Alien had deliberate pacing so I guess it's to be expected.For those of you wondering, this isn't the super deluxe edition where we have different versions of the film(that's in 2007), so with this one we only get the remastered version of the film with a better transfer. So if you want to replace your crappy original director's cut version with horrible main menu and crappy transfer, go ahead but if you want more bang for your 30 to 40$ whatever it will be come up to, wait till 2007."	5.0	One of Ridley's best films and a sci-fi classic	2006-09-15	4	1	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"This 1982 film loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's novella, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", hit the theatre's running, hailing international critical acclaim, and now, twenty-four years later, has become a science fiction cult classic.The time is 2019, and the city in which the story is told, is dark and smog-ridden, where acid rain pours down constantly. Decker (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner, a police officer or bounty hunter whose job it is to capture renegade replicants, human-like robots who have gone bad. The only way blade runner's can determine whether a suspect is human or replicant, is a series of unrelated questions, while the subject's eye is examined, measuring pupil movement.Rutger Hauer plays the leader of a group of escaped replicant's that are on the run. Hauer's performance in this film is mesmerising, and in my opinion, the greatest performance of his film career.The central question the film and book proposes is what constitutes being human?Hauer's character is a dangerous and extremely intelligent replicant. His mission is to find his creator and murder him, the inventor of replicants. He displays no mercy in this highly charged scene where they finally meet. However, in the end, this replicant displays mercy and even compassion. These so-called machines do in fact have a conscience, show kindness and even real love; ironically, the attributes and virtues that many ""humans"" lack in many ways.In terms of production value, this film, every scene in fact, was created with care and adept skill down to every detail - an atmospheric work of virtual genius.There are many films that one will view that might have made an impression at the time but will soon be forgotten. Blade Runner is a must to have in one's DVD library because it can be viewed hundreds of times and continue to impress.One of the great film's of the twentieth century."	5.0	A Twentieth Century Masterpiece	2006-09-09	12	7	5

Price might be an issue, with the extra disk costing $25 more.  If you're not that big of a fan than you should for the 2-disk edition and not the 4 disk edition.  If you are a big fan you should just for the 5-disk.  To see a workprint of a film is a rare and wonderful thing indeed (the workprint is in fact the extra disk of the 5 disk version).  I have the feeling that the 4 disk version won't be around for a long time, with most people opting for the two options above.	3.0	It's nice to have choice, but this seems wasteful	2007-08-01	68	16	52
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A513IRP7DDC4D	C. Montemayor	Contrary to original popular belief, &#34;Blade Runner&#34; is not a film that's all style/no substance--- but, fascinatingly, it wants you to THINK that it is (this is, of course, in marked contrast to the approach of most science fiction--- from &#34;Star Trek&#34; on down--- written by overenthusiastic Asimov-wannabes who pile on pseudo-philosophical as well as pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo in an effort to convince you there's more 'profundity' going on than the facts).  &#34;Blade Runner&#34; came out in 1982, one year after the debut of MTV, that incredibly kitschy and gimmicky era that saw the proliferation of such consumer mainstays as home video and home video games (wise guy viewers will of course never tire of cracking jokes about the &#34;Atari&#34; references, and indeed &#34;Blade Runner&#34; fell just short of predicting the rise of home computers), the year when the biggest and still best sci-fi fantasy classic could be summed up as 'boy-meets-alien'.  It simply wasn't the right moment for a thought-provoking postmodern sci-fi-fantasy epic (assuming any moment in the '80s would have been--- and someone probably should have sent David Lynch a memo), a fact which Ridley Scott himself must have been at least subconsciously aware of, emphasizing as he did imagery and ambiance over more conventional narrative methods of 'pulling us into' &#34;Blade Runner&#34;'s philosophical themes.  The themes are there, all right, lurking moodily beneath the surface--- a surface populated in &#34;Blade Runner&#34; by awe-inspiring cityscapes, miniature Chinatowns that look like graphic novels, GIF-style skyscraper billboards advertising Coca-Cola, and of course sexy female androids whose look inspired two generations worth of anime.  &#34;Blade Runner&#34; works more like music than most sci-fi, noir, or comics, gradually and languidly taking you 'to another place' (and like a lot of great music it may not quite 'hit you' the first time around; it was only on a 2nd or 3rd viewing that I really started to feel, Oh yeah, I could WORSHIP this), as, granted, all great movies should.  Like listening to a Radiohead album, you know there's a cautionary tale about a dystopian future buried in there, but you just keep getting distracted by all that dreamy, dreary beauty.

I caught the film about half way through, the score by Vangelis to this day is my most played CD. I was hooked by the ambience & overall look of this film instantly. The narrative is weak, but that's this film's only true weakness. A film without any CGI effect's that still looks this great is only all the more awesome on blu-ray.This is a reminder of how awful many modern movies SFX can look due to a heavy reliance on CGI. If you have invested in a good home theater set up then you will reap the benefits with this transfer of Blade Runner. You will forget this film was released in 1982, the picture & true digital sound could not be better. The extras are a fan's dream come true, worth the price of admission alone (over 3 hours of documentry material). I had last seen this movie many years ago & recall it like a dream. And that's what this edition is...buy this if your a fan, it's an absolute must own.	5.0	Thank you Warner Bros	2009-07-06	3	2	1

The panel included the legendary director himself answering fan questions. The material on the five discs should be almost all there is, including all 5 versions like the new ""Final Cut"" that has the recent footage of Joanna Cassidy redoing her death scene where she barrels thru the plate class. The fan favorite ""The Work Print"" is also included, along with documentaries and 1 disc full of scenes. For the fans of Blade Runner, the film inspired by P.K. Dick's brilliant novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", the five-disc Ultimate C.E. is a must. And it comes in the neat ""Deckard Case"", and Amazon has it listed at $69.99 as a pre-order.

It is a huge disappointment. Harrison Ford's narration was added to the released version because the 'Director's Cut' was too unclear on what was going on. The great narration of the Blade Runner was added after looking at the Director's Cut. They knew, and rightly so that the movie would flop without the verbal support from Harrison Ford. His explainations make this a great film. I would really like to get a DVD of the original movie released version.	3.0	Ford's narration	2001-06-18	6	4	2

"Well I was disappointed with the quality of the case it comes in, I thought it was metal but plastic is OK.  The main problem with this is uness you have small child like hands and fingers you will never carry this by the handle, the handle is just to small (although I dont know where you will be taking it much).  The plastic cover that comes over the cast it self was kinda bent at the corners due to the shrink wrap that was over that.  I just dont like it when there is a plastic sleeve over cases, they just get messed up some how.Whats inside the box is cool, the art work is great and the hologram thingie as well.  But the unicorn and car are cheep looking, the unicorn is plastic that was been chromed up and you can tell the edge is still there from when it was molded not really smoothed out.  The car has doors that open which is cool but only the back wheels move, and I can see visible glue on the windows on the bottom of the car.  There is a clear plastic insert with a message from Ridley Scott which is nice to seeThat being said the quality of the Movie itself was above par for most all HD DVD's out that were transfered from film that was oldishFor the most part the price is great for what you get (there is also just the 5 discs for something like $30 USD or something like that) but I would have paid 2 times this for a metal case with a handle you can use and a die cast unicorn and carbut for the fans out there this is a must buy weather this one or the 5 disc stand alone one, but apparently there are only 103000 of these made since there is a sticker on the bottom of mine (that is not on straight as well) that says ""Limited Edition 076209/103000"" so I guess thats how many there are.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2DB22MRLKXUT4	"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000"""	What sets Blade Runner apart from its science-fiction brethren is its reliance on atmosphere and uncertainty over more obvious sci-fi tendencies like unnecessary convolutions or CGI-heavy battle sequences. Instead of giving the audience long-winded and confusing speeches about how this futuristic world came to be, we are given a few simple sentences from the start and then are completely entrenched in a totally vivid yet surreal society where the past and future collide. The film noir style contrasts splendidly with the flying cars and massive mechanized advertisements from Coke and Pan Am that loom over the dirty, crowded streets. It's far from just style however. The subtlety of its ideas is incredible. It doesn't beat the audience over the head with blatant symbolism or out-of-place philosophical spoutings. Blade Runner's theme of humanity runs deep through the story, and in true noir fashion, the audience is left with more questions than answers. The screenplay, based on legendary author Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, is a brilliant base for Ridley Scott's auteristic vision of America's future. His atmosphere is what makes Blade Runner an endurable piece of classic cinema. It's rich, stunning, hazy, and 100% Ridley Scott. The cast is truly iconic, featuring Harrison Ford in the peak of his career, Edward James Almos, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel, Brion James, William Sanderson, the then unknown talents of Sean Young and Daryl Hannah, and Rutger Hauer, who steals the show in the films closing quarter. The score by Greek composer Vangelis again mixes past and future elements through the use of synthesizers and classical piano pieces. Simply put, Blade Runner is a thought provoking masterpiece to be watched over and over again.	5.0	Am I A Human?	2014-06-10	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1AS5JILVJQ957	contentgrrl	"I've had the director's cut of Blade Runner for about 12 years now, on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD.  I wasn't able to find the theatrical release, and I've always disliked the director's cut, but I could never put my finger on exactly why.  He cut out the voiceover at the beginning and made the ending cooler, and still I always thought that adding the unicorn in the middle was goofy and unnecessary.  I figured Scott just had some extra footage from Legend that he wanted to find a place for.  He almost completely cut Tim Curry out of the director's cut of Legend, so I expect him to do inexplicable things from time to time.Then I saw it:  At the end, the other cop leaves an origami of a unicorn at Deckard's apartment.  This explains what Scott was trying to do.  It's supposed to tell Deckard that he's a replicant, due to the fact that Deckard had a ""vision"" of a unicorn earlier in the film.  Everyone knows his thoughts, too, because he's a freakin' robot.This is the stupidest plot twist in the entire history of cinema!And here are a few reasons why:1.  Deckard got beat up, bloodied and pounded on by every single replicant in the entire movie, with the exception of Sean Young.  If he were intended to be a replicant he wouldn't have been so fragile.  Don't you think he could at least have been able to beat up Daryl Hannah or Joanna Cassidy?2.  At the beginning of the movie he's a retired cop.  Wouldn't he have to have been a cop for a while before in order to now be a retired cop?  I thought they only lived for five years.3.  The whole point of the story is that he's a human who kills without feeling, like a robot, and he falls in love with a replicant because he realizes the replicants are more alive than he is.  This is reinforced for Deckard when Roy saves Deckard's life when he doesn't have to.  Roy loves life so much he gives Deckard his as a gift.  Without this dynamic, what's the point of the movie?  Seriously, George Lucas would look at this and say ""Man, you shouldn't mess with your movies.""4.  If the cops all know Deckard is a replicant, and they know Rachel is at his house, why don't they ice the both of 'em?  Instead, they let them get away?  Maybe that's why they pulled the happy ending; when they got to the bottom floor in the elevator the cops shot them both down.In spite of the fact that it has no extras, no 5.1 sound, and the worst stunt doubling in the history of movies, I still love the movie.  In fact, now that I know why the unicorn is there, I can ignore Scott's ineptitude and enjoy PKD's story the way it was intended to be."	4.0	Why Ridley Scott shouldn't edit his own movies- SPOILERS	2004-10-28	40	24	16
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A25ZVI6RH1KA5L	"cookieman108 ""cookieman108"""	I love this movie. It's such great example of what a science fiction movie should be...that said, I know people have problems with this particular version, the directors cut. One obvious change was the omission of the narration by Deckard (Harrison Ford). People have said that it takes away from the noir aspect, and maybe it does. Others will say that the narration doesn't need to be there, as the studio didn't give people enough credit to figure out what was going on themselves. I read somewhere that the studio, prior to a full blown release, ran test screenings and made changes based on audience reaction. I actually own the other version on laserdisc, and I just recently picked up this director's cut, and I like both. I am not sure why both versions couldn't be released on one disc so people could just watch the one they want, but there you go. Maybe this will happen in the future. Back to the movie. In case you haven't seen it, it's set in the future, a future where man has created replicants to do the hazardous work for humans. Only problem is they made the replicants too good, in that the newest versions have developed a sense of self awareness, and some have gone renegade. Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner, played by Harrison Ford, is responsible for hunting and terminating these renegade replicants. A small group of replicants has escaped some offworld colony, and made their way back to earth to try and save themselves from shutting down as replicants only live for so long. I don't want to give too much away, maybe I already have, but this review cannot do the movie justice. The attention to detail, the amazing backdrop of a hellish Los Angeles of the future, just the right mix of story and action, the grittiness, it's all so amazing well done. And Rutger Hauer gives what I think is his best performance ever as Roy Batty, leader of the group of renegade replicants, specifically during his scenes with Deckard. He creates within his character a sense of danger, forboding, but also a sense of sympathy. There are a number of layers at work in the movie, so it's prime for repeated viewing. I would suggest seeing both versions, and then making up you own mind which you like better. Regardless, this is the epitome of a great science fiction movie.	5.0	Man Has Made His Match...

The video transfer is absolutely gorgeous. The sound is also top notch. One of the problems that plagued the VHS version is the terrible video transfer because it's such a dark movie(in terms of lighting). The HD DVD version brings out every line of detail and lighting contrast.  If you prefer the original Theatrical version with the Harrison Ford Narration, that version is also in high definition and included in this set. There are a total of 5 discs in this set. 3 of the discs are HD DVDs, and 2 are standard DVDs. The different versions of the film are on the High Definition discs, and the supplemental material are standard DVDs. If you've never seen this film before, now is the best time, because it's never looked better visually. However,  keep in mind it's a bit slower paced and more story driven than most fast paced sci-fi movies. So don't expect any big Hollywood explosions.	4.0	Outstanding HD DVD transfer and great movie	2007-12-19	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	All in all, Blade Runner is a passable film, a 65-70 out of 100 (mainly on the strength of its technical achievement), but nowhere is it near great, much less the masterpiece its fans claim. Like its source novel, it has a few good ideas, more bad ones, a thin plot, trite and leaden dialogue, and poor characterizations, made all the worse by mediocre to bad acting, from the always overrated Ford, to the abysmal Young, to the over the top Hauer (aptly demonstrated by his silly soliloquy) to the lifeless Hannah (both of whose portrayals do nothing to engender sympathy for the Replicants), to the quirk-infested Olmos. Add in the chemistry lacking love story between Ford and Young, and the far too long sequences designed to simply show off the visuals and inner workings of Tyrell's corporation, the muddled plot (especially in the later non-voiceover versions), and the film is a classic triumph of `style over substance.' Even that clich&eacute; grates, despite its aptness. Granted, it would not surprise me if claimants of the Deckard as Relicant posit point to the chemistry lacking love story as proof that both characters are inhuman, but Occam's Razor points to the simpler interpretation that it's just bad acting and writing.Similarly, the overall film ultimately falls far short of its claimed greatness because it simply is never sure of what it wants to be- another strike against its `visionary' claims. It has too many feet on too many boats that diverge- is it sci fi, is it existential, is it film noir, is it a character study? In truth, it has elements of all these and more, but not enough of any of them to make it work as one, much less all of these. In fact, the chief failing, on all scores, for this film, is that Ridley Scott really had no vision for the project, grafting elements from Alien and many of the other films mentioned in this essay, trying to take what worked from each, and ending up with a film that, in many ways, is a mess, and a dull one, at that. Yes, it has plenty of visions, but no single vision; and in its own myopia, Blade Runner's dystopia founders. And I doubt any further cuts or recuts can retire that ill.	3.0	Overrated	2009-07-29	18	4	14

However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter.  The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic.

The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" That's good enough for me.

The film was unfinished, having gaps in the titles, music, and certain scenes. What it lacked was the awful narration that drug down the theatrical edition. I'm sure the studio believed audiences weren't intelligent enough to understand the story, hence the need to add ridiculous explanations. The film also didn't have a happy ending which seemed tacked on, and didn't fit the world as it was portrayed. Yet it was the best version I've seen yet of the film. How many versions have been released to date--6? This version is closest to Scott's original vision and to that first viewing. How many versions will yet come out remains to be seen. Ford is inspired in this futuristic decopauge, showing grit and humanity in an uncertain world. And he is nicely pitted against Rutger Hauer, a villain you can fear and feel for.

Many good films are sitting at twice that bitrate and that is still not really enough for film. I would wait for a better version before buying. I can almost smell a 4K ready release in the future or simply a native 4K release a little further down the road.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3TYC8T6W81DDB	C. Sawin	"Blade Runner is one of the most influential science fiction films of all time and it's also a film that has stood the test of time incredibly well. While Harrison Ford already had the first two Star Wars films and Raiders of the Lost Ark under his belt by the time Blade Runner was released, the sci-fi thriller can certainly be labeled as the film that put Rutger Hauer on the map while Roy Batty is probably Hauer's most recognized role. After Alien, Blade Runner is one of the main films that first added credibility to Ridley Scott's name. Despite its flaws, Blade Runner is still a brilliant sci-fi film that seems to get better with each viewing.The atmosphere in Blade Runner is revolutionary and thick right from the start. The Los Angeles of 2019 features the likes of flying cars called spinners, giant skyscrapers riddled with moving advertisements and commercials, and the Voight-Kampff machine (VK for short) to help determine if someone is a replicant among many other cutting edge things. The lighting in the film is key to making the film feel as futuristic as it does. Take any scene where Deckard is in the depths of Los Angeles. Those congested city lights are probably the main visuals you'll take away from those scenes. When Deckard first meets up with Captain Bryant, Bryant runs down the list of Nexus 6 replicants. A blue light blankets the room they're in. There's something about that blue light along with that conversation between Deckard and Bryant that makes that scene incredibly memorable.Blade Runner is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. I've never read it, but I certainly intend to. I'm unsure how similar the film is to the source material though. Other than the film still feeling like a neo-noir film set in the future without feeling too dated, an extraordinary story is buried underneath. Genetically engineered organic robots take center stage, but just the idea of something like implanted memories will make the wheels in your brain spin a little faster. Everyone has heard of ""making friends,"" but its definition will be a little bit different after one viewing of this film as Gaff's origami will be one of the last things on your mind once the film ends. There's a lot to take in with Blade Runner. There are several layers to the film and it certainly requires multiple viewings.Blade Runner may come off as a frustrating experience at first and that could come down to which version of the film you watch. There are at least five different versions of the film and that could be a bit overwhelming. I'm pretty sure I originally sat through the theatrical version at first, which I thought was okay. My general consensus was that there was a fantastic film buried down in there somewhere, but it felt like I was missing something; almost as if there was an entire film before this one that everyone else had seen but me and I decided to jump in later on. That's where the frustration came in. I wanted to like this film, but it was difficult to do so when nothing really seemed to add up. After viewing The Final Cut a few times, things are a bit more clear and it seems like I'm able to catch certain things I didn't catch during the previous viewing. I'd recommend checking out The Final Cut first and then venturing onto the other versions of the film, if the interest is still there.While we're on the subject, is it just me or is Deckard kind of a wimp? On the surface, he's fairly similar to the other roles that made Harrison Ford famous. But once the action starts getting heavy, Deckard is usually on the receiving end of a beatdown without much offense on his part. In the entire film, he lands one punch, three gunshots, and two pipe swings. He spends a good portion of the film getting roughed up by women and then he practically rapes a replicant. He just seems like an odd choice for a hero. Rick Deckard is still an exceptional character, but just kind of a bizarre protagonist once you think about it. Roy Batty is definitely worth a mention or two, as well. Any scene with Roy is guaranteed to be good, but his highlight is of course the rooftop scene. The chase through The Bradbury is just as good though. That ""tears in the rain"" speech that Roy makes at the end is something that'll live on for decades. It's just so perfect and the fact that it was partially improvised by Hauer just makes it all the more spectacular.In the end, there probably isn't a whole lot that can be said about a film like Blade Runner that hasn't already been said. The cast is near perfect, especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, the storyline in the film is done so well that it seems to unravel a few pieces at a time every time you sit down to watch it, and the film is just able to offer a spectacular vision of the future that still looks and feels like the future thirty years after the fact. Although, this is one film you should try to catch in theaters if at all possible as it sounds incredible. Throw in the fantastic lighting to help establish the futuristic atmosphere and the film is rounded out so well that not much else can compare to it. Blade Runner is a film that makes you think and makes you admire things you normally wouldn't in a film. It's a sci-fi masterpiece that was definitely ahead of its time. Films like this don't come along very often. They should be cherished to your best ability while you're able to do so before they're lost in time...like tears in the rain."	5.0	A sci-fi masterpiece ahead of its time	2011-05-01	2	1	1

The 1080p resolution made it seem like I was watching it for the first time all over again! There were myriad little details that I had never seen before, graffiti on the walls and so forth, that makes me very glad to have upgraded my 27"" Standard Definition TV to a 50"" 1080p DLP TV. Hi-Def ROCKS! I'm a fan of the original cut with Mr. Ford's voice-over narration and I've had several copies on VHS but never in widescreen. Now, to have all the versions available in one set is a dream come true. Don't even get me started on how good the audio is!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AWP70V34YS2IA	"Curt D ""Economic Philosophy and Political Eco..."	"This new version simply looks far better than the older versions using early DVD technology.  It is stunningly clear with crisp color and great sound.  While it may be true that we can wait until the new versions come out in 2007, that does not diminish the quality and beauty of this release.This version of the film does clarify a few mysteries by confirming the hypothesis that Ford's character is a replicant by inserting the unicorn scene.  Although the deletion of the Mary character is still subconsiously obvious.  I found that for some reason, the clues that Deckard uses to find one replicant after another were more obvious and easier to follow in this version, perhaps just because of the remastering, or possibly because one is less dependent on being bridled by the voice overs, and pays more attention to the movie.To the reviews that find the film more challenging: This version is less ""Accessible"" since it loses the voice overs that provide cartoonish explanation. And it is worth saying that Blade Runner is not an action movie for pulp sci-fi fans.  It is a heroic, tragic, deep, meaningful, literate essay on individualism, memory, life, technology, and what it means to be mortal. It is a modern day Greek tragedy.  It is a movie to be personally witnessed and contemplated. It is not a Saturday afternoon popcorn venue for friends looking for reprieve from the work week.  There many of those, are prescious few of these. And this one is to be savored like a late night dinner of champagne and lobster.Buy this version, buy the next version.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AW128UKKVXAVQ	Customer	"The movie is so great because it combines many layers:(*) A philosophical discussion about what makes people human.(*) An action movie(*) A truly ""hard-core"" Science fiction creation - Ridley Scott creates a whole futuristic world, with incredible attention to detail. No shortcuts.(*) A horror movie. Blade runner in genre is close to Dr.Frankenstein and other ""we made a creature in our image, but flawed - because people are flawed, because playing God is arrogant and has nasty repercussions, ... - and now they are out to get us""(*) Film Noir. Deckard is played brilliantly by Harrison Ford as a classic noir detective - Hard on the outside, but compassionate on the inside. With of course the iconic raincoat.  Rachael is mostly ""lost soul"" and not ""Femme Fatale"", but her look is totally Femme Fatale.As Sci-Fi, Blade runner is very far from the ""classic"" Star Trek universe with it's bright optimism [unless you're an Ensign. The Ensigns tend to have a high mortality rate], and totally unrealistic Star-Trek semi-magic technology : faster than light travel, transporters, people getting injured in one episode - and magically appearing good as new by the next episode. The star-ship Enterprise takes a terrific beating - and returns in mint new condition for the next episode.Blade runner on the other hand is much more realistic. Now this may seem illogical - after all there are flying cars and replicants who are androids with the ability to put their hands in frozen and in boiling water and incredibly strong.However Ridley's world is grimy and used and frayed. A replicant or person once shot is injured - no ""magic self healing"".The costumes are futuristic - but based on 40s styles and combinations of existing fabric.So with all the futuristic and ""non-real, Sci-Fi stuff""  - it's also ""40s Noir"" with the Sci-Fi added to make it visually fascinating but without detracting from the real-world feel.The 4 disk edition contains Tons of excellent extras - like a comparison of the movie to the book Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep, how the ""Look"" of the movie was created, commentaries, etc.And at long last we get the Theatrical version on DVD."	5.0	Sci-Fi Horror Movie, Tons of excellent extras (4 disk edition)	2008-01-26	2	1	1

I'm very much into the idea of science fiction writers being agents of the new world order and using their works as a way to psychologicly condition people for what they have in store for us in the future. I have no doubt that H.G Wells, and Aldous Huxley were just that. With George Orwell its debatable whether or not he was a propagandist working for them, or if he was warning us about them. Either way he worked for them at one time writing war time propaganda for the BBC, as well as being active in Communist and Socialist movements in his younger days. So regardless he had gotten a glimpse into the belly of the beast so he was privy to inner knowledge. As far as Phillip K. Dick I don't think there's any evidence that he was working for ""them"" but I did pick up on stuff in Blade Runner that are reality today that I don't see how they could have known about back when this movie was made (was it the early 80s?) Like there's all this stuff with eye scanning for example. The public had no knowledge of this back then, but its real now. I haven't read any of Dicks books so maybe the eye scanning and other stuff was added to the film by Hollywood and not pulled from his stories. But anyway as far as the story itself and just being entertained I loved Blade Runner just as much as I did when I saw it years and years ago."	5.0	Blade Runner	2007-11-15	11	2	9

Don't be fooled! This film is better, much better, in the original version. The scenes which are supposed to leave one wondering whether Deckard is also a replicant are lame and stupid - they add zero to the narrative and are precisely as Yorkin loabeled them: a cheat. Not only a cheat, but one which adds nothing to the story.On the other hand, the best line of the ENTIRE film is in the voice-over, where Deckard sums up why (for heaven's sake why?) would the murderous killer spare Deckard in the end? It is stupid and untethered without it. Those who forgive this vital piece's absence are surely remembering the original, and so know the answer.

So many people complained about the quality of the film, that the sound transfer was off, that the color was off etc.If you need to have three or four versions of a movie to get people to like it and agree about it, well just my opinion here, but that oughtta tell ya something about the real content of the movie. THAT'S what should be critiqued, not if there were a few more seconds or deleted or added scenes or conversations with the director or different endings or whether it came out on blue ray.And personally, being a Harrison Ford fan, his best movie was without a doubt, ""Regarding Henry"".  It was his most dramatically challenging role ever.Ridley Scott did a much better job in conveying the bleakness of the future in his post apocalyptic movie Aliens.I'm a total sci-fi fan, AND I think Harrison Ford is an amazing actor.But THIS movie, wow, I was nodding off after 30 minutes. I thought the opening scene was good, when Deckard was asking the replicant questions, mainly to ascertain whether or not if he had the one human emotion that all replicants lacked: empathy. The writer should have stuck with that theme because that could have turned it into a real sci-fi, psychological suspense. The plot was original, but adding the theme of the whole 80's punk rock scene (see thru plastic rain coats, Darryl Hannah's airbrushed eye shadow, etc) detracted from what COULD have been a truly original post apocalyptic suspense nail biter.I guess I don't understand how a post-apocalyptic movie, made in the 80's, with the whole film noir theme (with shades of the 80's punk rock scene) is appealing or entertaining.On the whole, I thought it was boring and dry (even though it's raining all the time in the movie). I DO understand the complexities that the story is trying to convey, but I think the director could have done much better in the adaptation of those deep philosophical undertones."	2.0	I LOVE sci-fi, and Harrison Ford even more, BUT..........	2014-04-19	4	1	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A292L0KQEO9JFZ	"Dan ""bored00"""	As a big fan of the movie, I was really anticipating watching Blade Runner on Blu-Ray on my new HDTV. However, it was a disappointment. Not just because the changes in the Final Cut didn't do much for me, but also because of the changes they made in the Director's Cut, which I thought was going to simply be the same as the DVD release, but at higher resolution. I was wrong. One of the reasons I really like the Director's Cut is the unicorn scene, and that's one of the changes that bummed me out about this Blu-Ray release. Originally the unicorn scene is tinted a beautiful, dreamy yellow, and in combination with the Vangelis music, it's just an epic thing to watch. For some reason, though, they got rid of the tint in BOTH the Blu-Ray Final Cut and Director's Cut versions, leaving the scene with normal light and thus feeling less transcendent, less emotional, and more mundane. Very disappointed in that. They have also messed with the coloration of other scenes, such as Deckard's first scene in the movie, where he's sitting in the rain, waiting for a seat at the Japanese food stand. It was originally awash with a beautiful deep, moody blue; now it's kind of a harsh, electric white. The same for the food stand, which had a lot more atmospheric lighting with lots of yellow elements; now it seems kind of washed out, too. There may be more changes in coloration for the rest of the movie, but I haven't made it that far in my viewing yet. I really wish they had just updated the special effects and not messed with the color palette, which was perfect before. What a let-down. I will therefore be hanging onto my DVD two-disc edition of the Director's Cut and sadly I will endure the low resolution when I want to watch it, because even with low resolution it's visually superior to this messed up release in the Blu-Ray edition. I hope they do a re-release of the Director's Cut in Blu-Ray with the original coloration someday.	3.0	Some Good Changes, Some Bad	2010-12-02	14	9	5

My feelings side with the director on this one.What I can't believe is Warner Bros. treatment of this film. Why re-release &quot;Blade Runner&quot; if you're  not going to add anything to the disc? The frame of film, lobby cards and  posters are nice, but as a film enthusiast - and a fan of this one in  particular - I'd much rather have director's commentary, or at least some  trailers or featurettes. Surely a documentary isn't too much to ask for,  considering everything that people seem to NEED to say about the movie.  (There were nearly 300 reviews here alone when I wrote this.)  I can't  believe one of the best and most influential science fiction features of  all time is getting the Paramount DVD treatment! (Star Trek DVDs have  virtually no features either.)I suggest you save your money and look  through Amazon's book area for a book called &quot;Future Noir&quot;, as it  appears to be the closest thing we're ever going to get to a documentary or  director commentary.Great film, disappointing package. &quot;Blade  Runner&quot; could be so much more on video.	1.0	What?

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AQ990HW13DP08	Daniel B. Clendenin	"Set in Los Angeles in November 2019, Harrison Ford stars as the ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard, a special police officer who must track down and ""retire"" four ""replicants"" who have returned to earth from ""off-world"" colonies. Their crime is that they want to be fully human; as it is, they are genetically manipulated humanoids, virtually indistinguishable from normal humans except that they are superior in strength and intellect, lack full emotions, and have a life span of four years. Deckard falls in love with Rachel, a fifth, experimental replicant who thinks she is truly human, and there are ambiguities that Deckard himself might be a replicant (""Did you ever take the test yourself?"") and in the way the film ends. Blade Runner fared poorly when it was released in 1982, the same weekend as ET, but since then it has become a cult classic that regularly appears on lists of the best films ever. Much more than a sci-fi thriller, which it is, the film explores nothing less than what it means to be human in a very dark world. The year 2007 marks its twenty-fifth anniversary, and since its original release there have been seven versions of the film, including The Final Cut (2007)--notable because it's the only version over which the director Ridley Scott had total control.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A60D5HQFOTSOM	"Daniel Cooper ""dancoopermedia"""	I have seen Ridley Scott's Blade Runner quite a few times, including the original run in a movie theater. I have loved it. I've read about how Alan King couldn't understand what was going on in the rough cut and took control away from Scott and added the narration. But I never before saw Blade Runner as Ridley Scott intended it. It is a work of genius. There are flaws: Harrison Ford was quite young then, and he hadn't quite developed his acting chops. Like the first three Stars Wars pictures, he's not really comfortable in his skin as an actor, but he looks great. Rutger Hauer does go way over the top. But the lead women are perfect and all the rest of the cast are impeccable. What is essential is the history of film with regard to Blade Runner is that it combines the most brilliant of noir with the most brilliant of sci fi. It set a standard that countless films have attempted to match. It remains in this version a movie that is actually about something and yet is mesmerizing. Ridley Scott. What can you say? He is the master's master.	5.0	Stunning: One of the greatest films ever made	2014-06-24	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2RY1N6F1JB9WA	Daniel J. Staggers	Yes, it's been tough finding a copy of Blade Runner that has the narration. Which is the only reason I bought this set. But, at least I did wait until it was on sale. I realize Ridley Scott claims the newest version is what he really intended, but I'll take the side of the studio on this one. Blade is a very dark, slow moving movie. I find the narration to be helpful in moving the story along, and important in giving insights into what Decker was thinking at any given moment. I was very surprised Scott didn't like or endorse it. Then, after sitting through this dark slow film, I think we deserve a happy ending. After all, aren't all fairy tales supposed to have happy endings and what's wrong with that? The Decker character certainly deserved it, didn't he? We did...I think a lot of times, directors get a little full of themselves from past successes (ie. Aliens) and forget the focus of a film is for people to actually want to go see it. All these many, many versions of this film, to me, only amount to milking the cow for all it's worth, not from any deeper insight. I believe the changes the studio demanded were right on the money and as a result, we're all here having this discussion. I don't believe Ridley's newest version would have resulted in the cult hit Blade Runner was to become. Studios know what sells, directors don't neccesarily. See Gene Roddenbury and Star Trek 1, vs. 2, The Wrath of Khan. The first was Gene's and the second was the studios. While I like Star Trek the Motion Picture, there absolutely No comparison to The Wrath of Khan.Back to Blade; the International version is very nice. While the sound is spot on excellent, the video transfer isn't near as good as I would have liked to have seen however. It almost looks like a dubbed video tape actually. Much like they stuck it in this set because they had to give you as many disks as they could for the high price they were asking. If you use zoom 1 to get rid of the black bars, it's readily apparent how lacking the transfer is. But, it's not bad and well worth the buy if you're a fan; especially if you don't like the direction Ridley Scott took the movie.	5.0	A tough road to walk:	2009-01-11	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3QINBTHS8VQNC	Daniel Kepley	If I were in charge of that AFI's 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list, I  would definetly place Blade Runner at Number One.  This is the greatest  movie of any genre ever made, period!  No other film can compare with the  impact Blade Runner has had on my conciousness.  Of course, I am referring  to the Director's Cut, which I have on video.  I have seen the original  version on the Sci-Fi Channel a while back, but I kinda giggled at the  voice-over narration in the beginning (not a good sign), and I found the  original ending (made of outtakes from the opening of The Shining) really  lame.  This only makes me appreciate the Director's Cut even more.  I have  seen the Director's Cut four times (the third on New Year's Day to  celebrate the Y2K-less year 2000; the fourth a week after seeing the  original) and I still feel amazed every time.  The look of the film is  truly a sight to behold; the most beautiful depiction of a future city ever  made!  And without that dumb narration, the story about Deckard and his  assignment to retire replicants Roy Batty, Leon, Zhora and Pris draws you  in easier.  And the new ending has greater impact as the last words stick  with you as the credits role.  Love that Vangelis music score, which  enhances the feel!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A312D9B9I8IYOD	Daniel Smith	I see a lot of opinions from folks who say the director's cut is better than the theatrical release.  But the main reason given is because that's the way R.Scott originally intended for it to be.  That's not much of a reason.  I've held somewhat of a grudge against Mr.Scott for a while because he's the main reason I could not get a DVD copy of the theatrical version.  I saw the theater version in the early 80's on VHS and loved it so much I wore out the tape.  When the director's cut came out eventually on DVD, I was disappointed that the movie was not as I remembered it.  The narration adds such a great feel to the movie.  I don't think it was over-done, meaning, it didn't dumb the movie down by trying to dictate to the audience what to think as they were watching.  The narration didn't try to fill in all the blanks or define each scene.  It simply gave a glimpse into the mind of the main character and, in my opinion, gave the movie more depth.  And, as I said, it gave such a great film-noir feel, which is one of the reasons I loved it so much the first time I saw it.  This movie is one of my all-time favorites and I will spend extra for the set, knowing that I will only ever watch the theatrical version.As for the rating, the five stars is certainly for the movie itself.  Having to buy 5 discs to get the one I want is irritating, to say the least.	5.0	The narration	2007-12-19	14	11	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ATS7LYGLUX34L	Daniel V. Reilly	"I saw Blade Runner on TV when I was younger, but I have never seen it uncut and commercial-free, and I've never seen The Director's Cut, so it was with GREAT enthusiasm that I purchased the DVD.....Yawn.The story of a cop being pressed back into duty as a ""Blade-Runner"", a hunter/killer of sentient rogue androids, is very promising, but Director Ridley Scott, while delivering a great LOOKING movie, gives the viewer nothing else to latch onto. The characters are all cold, one-dimensional pawns being put through their paces; I didn't care about any of them at all. Harrison Ford seems to sleepwalk through his role. The replicants themselves didn't seem too menacing; If they're so dangerous,why not send a few more Blade Runners after them, so they can be dealt with that much quicker? Why is Edward James Olmos' character being paid to stand around and do nothing???? Get to killing some replicants, pal!The DVD has NOTHING in the way of extras, just some...""Production Notes"", that are really nothing more than Cast Bios. This movie screams out for a Ridley Scott commentary track. And the much-ballyhooed ""Unicorn Vision"", that is supposed to reveal whether or not Deckard is a replicant himself, is all of two seconds long, and told me nothing new. The climactic battle between Deckard and Roy Batty is exciting and beautiful to look at, but that's about it. I had no emotional stake in the outcome of the fight, or the film itself for that matter. This DVD is obviously older than dirt, so hopefully the studio will issue a new version, with some commentary tracks and extras that will shed some light on the more puzzling aspects of the story. In the meantime, I have purchased the BFI Modern Classics Blade Runner book, and I'll be looking for answers there."	3.0	Much Ado About Nothing.....	2002-01-27	8	4	4
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2JLSHTST2SP1I	Danno	"Do you equally enjoy film noir and science fiction? If you do, you would probably enjoy Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner."" Set in 21st Century Los Angeles, ""Blade Runner"" is the story of a jaded, borderline depressive detective (played by Harrison Ford) who's been manipulated into hunting down a potentially dangerous series of 'replicants.' Replicants look human but aren't; nor are they robots. Rather, they are synthetic humanoids created in labs and virtually identical to human beings. Of course, as with all film noir detectives, Harrison Ford ends up learning far more about personal and societal corruption than he does about the case he is investigating. The film's visual style is stunning, especially considering that it was released in 1982; huge chunks of James Cameron's ""Terminator"" and ""Dark Angel"" series would have been impossible without ""Blade Runner,"" and the film also mightily influenced Japanese animation for over a decade. It was a welcome antidote to the ""Star Wars"" formula when it was released.""Blade Runner"" is a worthy addition to your collection if you are a noir or science-fiction fan. If these interests intersect, as they do with me, you will love this movie.Unfortunately, ""Blade Runner"" was one of the first DVDs released in the 1990s. As such, there are no extras to speak of (though it includes subtitling and both widescreen/fullscreen versions), and it only contains Ridley Scott's ""director's"" cut of the movie, which is slightly different than the version shown in theaters in 1982. Due to extended behind-the-scenes legal problems, it's unlikely that we will see ""Blade Runner"" rereleased in a more extensive package anytime soon. Still, I would rather have ""Blade Runner"" in a no-frills package than not at all. It's proof that a science fiction film doesn't have to be written for an audience consisting entirely of 10 year old boys."	4.0	Equal Parts Noir and Science Fiction	2005-01-05	3	2	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	"I have seen both the original cut and the final cut on the big screen. The first Blade Runner left me feeling elated, entertained and full of inspiration. This tired retread left me feeling disgusted and flat.Why disgusted? In the first Blade Runner we witness the snapping of an important man's neck. The one scene in the whole movie that I could have done without, but it didn't ruin the movie for me! At least it was an instant death. This time in the film, for some godforsaken reason, the director had the replicant's kill by pushing people's eyeballs into their brains. It's horrifically shown once and implied twice. Now what possibly does that add to the movie? Is society becoming so sick that Hollywood thinks that's entertainment? Are we so desensitized that gruesome violence no longer revolts? All it did was turn the bad guys (replicants) into monsters. One is left without an once of sympathy for them unlike in the original Blade Runner.Why flat? Well the speech at the end of the film by the dying replicant leader now rings quite hollow. Who gives a hoot what wonders he's seen. Just hurry up and die so you don't kill anymore decent people. While those replicant designers were short sighted and a certainly terribly naive, does that warrant a death sentence? The replicants are like spoiled children: If I don't get my way, I'm gonna throw a tantrum! In this case if you don't ""fix me"" I'm gonna push your eyeballs back into your brain! The other reason it left me flat was the ""boy meets girl ending"" is so trite! At least the original Blade Runner had what I would consider a passionate ending by a being that does not torture its victims.Too bad Hollywood doesn't pay its writers better, instead of forcing them to go on strike. Maybe then we would have some really daring sci-fi film making instead of this tripe!For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:ZardozandEnemy MineandFantastic PlanetandA.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)andBicentennial ManandGalaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)"	1.0	Can Hollywood Leave Well Enough Alone?

But this one finally looks to live up to, and even exceed, the word ""Ultimate"".Fans of Blade Runner have been in for a rough treatment over the years. For a time getting a genuine copy of Blade Runner on DVD was a rarity because there were so few in print. The movie was not the darling of the film world when it first come out, so being a fan of Blade Runner back then was like being in a small dedicated cult. Which is exactly the best way to describe Blade Runner, the biggest cult classic of all time.We were also tempted with rumours of the famous ""master copy"", the copy of Blade Runner that had no alterations to it, nothing cut out and no voice overs added in. The want, no the NEED for this master copy was tremendous with us fans, not least of all because there has been so much said about which version is best, talks about how Ridley Scott was forced to do a screen freindly version, how Harrison Ford was forced to do a voice over at the last minute (which is he allegedly did half arsed in the hope that it would be unusable and wouldn't make the cut) and we were even given a ""directors cut"" which not even the director was happy with. But here it is in this ultimate collectors edition, all copies of the movie AND the master cut in HD DVD. It really doesn't get any better than this.Well it does actually. You get all the extras that Blade Runner dvds had been missing all these years, you get it all in a Voight-Kampff style suitcase (Voight-Kampff being the famous android test from the films), you get the famous spinner toy car (the flying car that was even referenced in the Star Wars movies, look it up on imdb), you get a cheeky reference to the famous endings I was talking about with the unicorn figurine. You even get one of those movie frames that people keep putting on their book cases, you know like the star wars film frames some people have. It's all here and it's all coming soon, and it is all worth 70 measly bucks after a 25 year wait. For hardcore Blade Runner/sci fi fans I couldn't recommend this enough. For movie fans there is the same set on HD DVD, but you don't get the physical extras like the figurines or the suitcase, but it is half the price of the suitcase edition.25 years in the making this collectors edition was, and it looks like we are finally being rewarded for our enthusiasm for this film.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3MKHD3AKS69BH	"Danny Kim ""Taste"""	"""Blade Runner"" relies on two tremendous driving forces. The heralded visuals which have been imitated countlessly over the years, not just in science fiction, but music video, thrillers and commercials. While Blade Runner itself borrows a few elements from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", it distances itself from the great German piece with a realism that is uncharacteristically grounded (pun intended) for science fiction.The startling thing about Blade Runner is that every year that passes by, Los Angeles bears a closer resemblance to this skin grafting, smog congested, racist society that was projected by novelist Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott, visualist Syd Mead and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. Organ and tissue implants are better known today as plastic surgery. LA is a town in which such an emphasis is placed on physical appearance. Inevitably, clones created from a superior genetic stock would arise in a society such as this.The Director's Cut gives the smoky and towering visuals more breathing room and the subtleties of Ridley Scott's detail come to light. The central conflict and irony of this film is that you have a sardonic Humphrey Bogart disenchanted Blade Runner commissioned to seek and retire all androids, regardless of their own personal involvement in a crime that was committed Off-World. This forces the androids to kill in order not to be killed.Just who is the true protaganist of this film? Deckard is just doing his job, and is, for the most part, a static character. One moment largely affected by the additional unicorn scene is when he finds the origami unicorn on the floor. This is one of the few intuitive moments where Deckard reflects on the human nature of his own being. The unicorn is a dream that Deckard imagines, and dreams are our own to treasure and fear. The origami folding Gaff places the very mythical creature in his dreams. He dissects Deckard's mind much in the same manner that Deckard smashes Rachael's precious childhood memories.I could go on much longer, but for the sake of this recommendation, I hope the complexity of this story speaks for itself. It is emotional in a deep sense and the visuals are stunning for its time. Many of the model techniques and wire effects outdo its contemporary rivals who utilize digital effects. They are close to 20 years old, and still drop jaws all across the world."	5.0	Best Science Fiction Movie Ever Made	2001-01-04	4	4	0

Like others have expressed, there is simply no getting around the superiority of the original release over the many lame versions that followed. Not only does the narration aid in giving you Deckard's p.o.v. and evolving character development, but is essential in making (albeit, only some) sense of the story.  The ""Final Cut"" adds very little other than a few seconds of beautiful visuals extending 4-5 scenes, but the expanded score (and I do LOVE the score) actually undercuts certain scenes where silence was much more effective.

For 25 years, since I was a kid in the 80s, I have never made it through a complete viewing of this film. All I have stored in my memory are bits and pieces. The problem in the past is the film does not keep my attention. I figured maybe I was too young to enjoy the concepts, or I wasn't listening to the dialog closely, or whatever.20something years later and after numerous releases and reedits (so I've heard) this film still cant hold my attention. And thats a shame because Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors and he normally excells in films like these. The sci fi neo tokyo environment is great but watching him constantly mope around his dark apartment drinking and staring at underdeveloped pictures was dreadful. The pacing is horrid, as usual I was sleep within the first hour and will likely never see this through to the end. So with the release of the Final Cut, I thought I was going to finally gain an appreciation for this film and understand why its considered this great sci fi classic; sadly I realize it aint gonna happen!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	"This five disc version is a nearly exhaustive treatment of this seminal work in movie history, one of my favorite movies, and one of those great movies that forever remind of the time that I first saw it.Roy Batty was my favorite character in this movie.  Harrison Ford and Sean Young really did not have much chemistry in this movie, and Daryl Hannah was completely uglified by her fright wig and makeup.  Rutger Hauer, IMHO, carried this movie, and I have yet to see either Hauer or any other character or actor display in any other movie such a wide and complex array of charm, love, anger, malice, menace, machismo, sadness, sensitivity, and poetry as Roy Batty.  The various featurettes and commentaries make clear just how much Rutger Hauer's ideas contributed to the creation of this character.I got this five disc version mainly to get the work print, which is the only thing different, DVD-wise, from the four disc version.  Oh, and you get the serially numbered ""Collector's Edition"" plastic briefcase, some prints of conceptual art for the film, a clear plastic display with four pseudo holographic photos of Decker - stuck together with magnets, a plastic unicorn, and a plastic model of a spinner car.The best part of the work print DVD is the featurette about the restoration team that put together the Final Cut version, and their description of the various digital changes in the Final Cut.  There is also a richly detailed commentary track by author Paul Sammon explaining all the differences between the work print version and the other versions.The work print version of the movie itself was disappointing.  The introduction by Ridley Scott admits to its rough edges, and the fact that it was based on the only remaining print left that they could find - it had deteriorated and needed to be restored.  The movie shakes slightly in the projector throughout the DVD.  The soundtrack does not have all of Vangelis's tracks, and the sound quality is horrible, despite the restoration.The work print movie has a number of small snippets of additional footage and tiny bits of additional  monologue, some of which re-appear in the Final Cut, but from a film standpoint, the main difference from any of the other versions is Roy Batty's death scene which is totally different.  There is a wide angle shot of Batty sitting down as he dies on the rooftop and the spinner car rises up behind him, and Harrison Ford does a totally different, long, and pedantic voice-over (this was the voice-over part that Ridley Scott had agreed to do).  Vangelis's poignant soundtrack is filled in by some ""temp"" music (Ridley Scott's words) which sounds like dental office music.  It's an unrefined and impotent version of what would later become the most powerful scene and signature moment of this movie.As for the rest of this DVD collection, the extensive featurettes on the history of this movie are fascinating.  Hearing the original participants talk about it does clear up some myths.  For one thing, there was an even longer version of this movie which has never been seen by more than a select few people  - the very first cut was 4 hours long!Many of the outtakes from this longer version are in Disc 4, including a brief nude scene from Sean Young.  These outtakes are cleverly strung together in what amounts to an alternate universe version of Blade Runner - the Blade Runner movie left on the cutting room floor. But there are only hints of still other missing scenes - for example, a brief flash of a longer love scene in bed appears in one of the ""Making of"" featurettes.After all the controversy about the voiceover, it turns out that the voiceover had originally been written into the script by Hampton Fancher.  The first versions of the voiceover were done willingly by both Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott after test screenings of the work print on the public showed that many viewers were completely confused by the movie.  It was only in the final version of the voiceover that Ridley Scott was removed from the film and Harrison Ford was forced to do it in his absence.  Similarly, the ""happy ending"" was filmed willingly by Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford because of negative audience reactions elicited during the initial test screenings.I had seen the Final Cut at the Laemmle theater in Los Angeles, and was surprised to find, after all these years, and all the controversy over the lack of a voiceover, that I did not miss the voice-over except perhaps at the scene of Roy Batty's death.  The Final Cut contains a few small snippets of extra scenes that can be found in the work print as well as some digitally replaced improvements that are fairly subtle and well done.  The DVD version is crisp but quite dark, although you can adjust for that with your screen or DVD playing software.As for the two different endings, the two interpretations of whether Decker is a replicant or a human, well, I like both versions equally.And so this great 5-disc set makes clear that there really is no definitive version of Blade Runner.  There is instead only the Blade Runner Multiverse."	5.0	A review of the many alternative universes of Blade Runner, including the work print and outtakes	2007-12-29	5	4	1

The missing naration doesn't add or detract from the movie, in fact, I kinda missed it.  The ""unicorn dream"" sequence is footage Ridley Scott stole from his 1983 disaster ""Legend"", the movie he dumped ""Dune"" to make. The only other major difference is the lack of a happy ending. The real story here is that this is not the definitve version of the film. There is another... a friend of mine saw a sneak preview back in the day in which Deckard was a replicant (remember all those old family photos on the piano?).

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3KHFRTRUPJKHH	"Dave Jeffery ""Author of Amazon UK #1 Bestsell..."	Bladerunner is a paradox in that: the older it gets the fresher it looks. When first released in 1982 it's public reception was luke warm to say the least. Over time, fuelled by it's video and subsequent DVD release, an army of Bladerunner fans have emerged to fight its corner. Some films achieve cult status on a whim and question marks continue to hang over their quality. With Bladerunner this is certainly not the case.Set in 21st century Los Angeles, Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a policeman from an elite unit (Bladerunners) with the remit to hunt down hunanoid robots (Replicants) who attempt to integrate into human society. When several replicants come to earth aiming to infiltrate the company that made them in a bid to extend their lifespan, Deckard is sent to track them down.This cut removes the voice over and upbeat ending prevelent in the original 1982 cinema release and as such the film morphs into a darker and more claustrophobic entity. This enhances Doug Trumball's (2001, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) stunning special effects which easily match any of the CGI work on show today. And Hampton Fancher and David Peoples have crafted a script which forever questions the ethics of creating sentient beings but not allowing for the growth of autonomy or rights.The 25th anniversary cut of Bladerunner is soon due for release but for those who have never journied into this remarkable and uncertain future, this is a memorable introduction.	5.0	A Masterpiece just got better	2007-03-10	3	2	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AC07BEE9PCKQP	Dave Ridolfi	I saw this film for the first time about nine months ago. In my opinion this proves that a sci-fi film doesn't really need CG images to make it a popular film like so many of them today. I instantly fell in love with the dark, dingy over populated, polluted cityscape that is Los Angeles. I thought Rugter Hauer did a excellent job as portraying Roy Batty, the leader of the renegade Replicants.After I saw this I became a Ridley Scott fan (litterly) overnight. I think it's a perfect blend of sci-fi and the grim outlook of the future. (Which probably in the next fifty years is quite possible.) And a combinaton of an intriguing story makes for a great film. It's definately worth a look. Who know's, you might get hooked like I did:)Hey, this movie was placed on the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress as being &quot;cultrally, historically, or esthetically significant.&quot; I guess that mean't somebody thought it was important. . .And for those looking for a little bit further insight, this movie inspired a by now well-known Konami video game producer, the great Hideo Kojima, (does Metal Gear Solid ring a bell?) to create a game called Snatcher. Those of you who might still have a Sega CD system in your possesion might recall this one. It has Blade Runner written all over it. Not in a bad way, but in a good way. Like it pays tribute to this film masterpiece.As with any movie, there could be some flaws depending on what you like. If you're looking for intense action, you won't find it here. There's a couple shooting scenes, that's it. The movie moves at a slow pace, which I thought was cool because it showed off a decrepid LA, the hi-tech, but yet not-to-far-off looking gizmo's they had. (Like the Voight-Kampff [or something like that] machine.) And then it picks up in certain parts, mainly the end. My only real complaint is that the Director's Cut is only available in widescreen. But it's still worth a look. Check it out.	4.0	One of the Best Sci-fi Films Ever Made	2002-04-03	0	0	0

Akward!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Not to dismiss the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"", but I have a soft spot for the version I saw in the theatre during the Summer of '82 with it's studio imposed narration and happy ending.  When I saw this film then I was just blown away.  Bear in mind, though, that it was released in the summer of ""E.T."" when the audiences were more inclined toward feel-good alien movies and not somber futuristic sci-fi.  The reviews at the time said it was more style than substance, and the box office was lukewarm.  The fortunes of ""Blade Runner"" were revived with the emerging home video market(Another classic futuristic film was released that summer, ""The Road Warrior"").  Why is this film a classic in either version?  The sets and special effects in this film are just mind-blowing.  It imagines Los Angeles in the year 2020 where hi-tech mingles with decay, where the cultural influences are hybrid Anglo-Mexican-Japanese, and there has been an ecological change in weather patterns where sunny California now more closely resembles Seattle.  The plot involves a group of replicants(androids) with a built-in limited lifespan who escape slave labor in the off-world colonies who return to Earth to find their creator to increase their life expectancy.  Since replicants are outlawed on Earth it is the job of blade runners(bounty hunters) to exterminate them, Deckard (Harrison Ford) being most prominent among blade runners.  Ford gives an appropriately world weary performance as Deckard, something akin to a detective from a Chandler or Hammet novel.  Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, gives a multi-leveled performance where we are simultaneous sympathetic to his plight but repulsed by the apparent barbarity of his actions in carrying out his goal.  Sean Young is beautiful and mysterious as Rachel, like a femme fatale from a 40's noir film.  A young Darryl Hannah is also quite good as Pris, one of the replicants.  I'd also like to note the presence of Joe Turkel who plays Tyrell, head of the corporation who created the replicants.  Turkel was a veteran of Stanley Kubrick films, specifically ""Paths of Glory"" and ""The Shining"".  ""Blade Runner"" is a great film in either it's original version and the director's cut.  My only question is what is the meaning of the unicorn dream?"	5.0	A Sci-fi Classic With Style and Substance	2004-10-07	15	14	1

The other was the bright ending after a dark night of terror. Since some like the director's cut and the theatrical release why not put both versions on one DVD?

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	I have been a fan of Blade Runner since it first came out; I have always been both intrigued and repulsed by the world of Blade Runner which has exercised a fascination over my imagination that will probably never let go. Every so often I have to revisit that world and watch each time with renewed interest as the story unfolds.The movie is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick called, &#34;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&#34; In this case I found I actually enjoyed the movie more than the book.Were I to guess I would say that most people could be divided into one of two groups, those that are intrigued and repulsed and those that are only repulsed; if you've seen the movie before you probably already know which group is your group. I'll address my comments to the former group and those who have never seen the movie.If you've never seen the movie and you're a devoted science fiction fan then you'll likely be part of the first group; if you&#8217;re not a science fiction fan then the jury is out on you.This collection is, to the best of my knowledge, the ultimate collection for the Blade Runner fan; the collection includes Disc 1, &#34;The Final Cut (2007), Disc 2, Original Theatrical Cut (1982), International Theatrical Cut (1982) and the Directors Cut (1991), Disc 3 includes &#34;Workprint and Special Features&#34;Also included are 40 pages of assorted sketches, art work and photos of the making of the movie and scenes from the movie.  I bought this version in spite of the fact I have two previous versions on Laser Disc and one on DVD; I guess that sort of marks me off as a fan of the movie.If you're a fan of science fiction and you've never seen this movie, then you have a real treat in store; I encourage you to go ahead and get this version which has so much to offer. If you've got an earlier version, well I can say to you I'm really glad I added this one to my collection and suspect you'll be glad you did if you decide to take the plunge and buy another copy for your collection.	5.0	Beautifully Done Collector's Edition	2013-12-20	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1Z8L7FIJ9BCTX	"David Caro ""West Coast Opinion Czar"""	"I've been well guided by my predecessor reviewers, to whom I owe a debt for helping with a big decision - has anyone else noticed how HARD it is to obtain money these days AND how ungodly expensive things have become!? I mean $5 lb for BACON???? - and to whom I also direct a well earned, ""KUDOS!"".  Your reviews were knowledgeable & heartfelt, as befits this work. A film that's SO MUCH MORE than ""just"" a film!  The philosophical, ecological, ethical, theological and political questions raised by BR make it one of my personal TOP 10 FILMS OF ALL TIME; which is as close as my mercurial personality allows me to come in naming any work BEST above all others.  Both as an artist (I'm a musician) and a fan, BR hits ALL the right buttons, what's more, in those spots where I'm left wanting; desperate for answers I'm not given, I realize this is by design.  In a conspiracy between writers Philip K. Dick, Fancher, et al & Director Ridley Scott and his actors, I'm forced to LEARN TO FISH; because they're not handing out any fish dinners.  This comment though, leads me to pinpoint the single flaw I note in the reviews that have gone before.  To wit, no credit given to the IMPRESSIVE work done by secondary cast members; the ""below the title"" players who make movies possible.  I'd therefore like to call to your attention 3 PERFORMANCES - though, there were very few, if any, less-than-stellar performances ...Edward James Olmos / Gaff; an actor who later made hay with another SciFi character, Adm Wm Adama, Olmos brought just the proper amounts of gravitas and street trash to his bright-eyed 'bad' good guy role;William Sanderson / J.F. Sebastian; with credits literally too numerous to mention, an undergrad degree & Juris Doctorate, Sanderson is as much a thinking man as he is a thinking man's actor!Lastly, a performance almost universally overlooked & (IMHO) under-appreciated, that of 'pleasure girl', Pris:Darryl Hannah; setting herself up to be invited inside with more panache than most centenarian vampires, young Pris gives the impression she's in her element, as much when she schmoozes Sebastian as when she tries to 'off' Deckard.  Again IMHO, this is a phenomenally nuanced performance and what's really incredible about it, is that it doesn't seem incredible - because the bar for acting is set SO HIGH, then continuously bested by this cast.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AI9STF7QHFDGV	"David Coy ""Author of the Dominant Species Series"""	"Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner, based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Phillip K. [...], is an allegory that teaches us something about the nature of our mortality. It asks the questions we all ask: ""Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got?"" I know it asks these exact questions because the character of ex-cop Deckard tells us so exactly in the voiceover-laden theatrical version of the film.In spite of the persistent flaw of the VO's, this film goes on my list of top 15 favorites nonetheless. It is a beautiful film, moody, poetic and yet suspenseful. It is an intensely human drama set in a dark and rainy future where genetically engineered humans are relinquished to roles of servitude. Disenfranchised, they are built and programmed to be prostitutes, laborers, soldiers or other grunts.  All the jobs ""real"" humans either can't or won't do are the rice bowls for this new generation of slaves called ""replicants"". Programmed into them is a biological clock that shortens their life span, making them easier to manage and very expendable. The knowledge of their shortened life span sends a small group of replicants on a quest...oh, hell, I'm telling you the storyline -- see the movie for that...  One of the many memorable things about this film is the relationship between Deckard and Rachael, a replicant so well made and supplied with memories so complete she has no idea she's one of them.Deckard's job is to terminate errant, runaway replicants, and when he forms a relationship with Rachael, his ambivalence, already to the point of impairing his professional judgment, is made worse. This sets the stage for the powerful transformation of Deckard later in the film, making his repentance about killing who he now perceives as real people, replicants or not, all the more moving. The end of the film has one of the most beautiful, hanky-dabbing cinematic sequences I've ever seen when Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy Batty recites in his moment of death: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe - troop ships on fire off the..."" Crud. I used to have that especially poetic passage memorized, but I'm afraid I'll just butcher it now.Strong characterizations, fascinating themes, great special effects and brilliant art direction make this one of the best SF dramas ever made. Replicants Pris and Rachael are wonderfully portrayed by Darryl Hannah and Sean Young, and Harrison Ford is spot on as the morally tortured blade runner, Deckard. The movie is filled with characters and concepts you just won't forget. If you can, see the director's cut without the VO's. It's a much better version of the film and makes one wonder why the VO's were used in the first place."	5.0	Dark and brooding, (e.g.) a great film	2007-04-25	8	6	2

I didn't get it the first time, then I read, ""do androids dream of electric sheep"", and then saw it again: liked it, and saw it a third time: loved it. Finally, I saw the realse of the ""Fina Cut"" here in NYC. It's not really a spoiler, but the truth is you won't notice much of a difference between the ""director's cut"" and this cut except they cleaned up the sound and the print looked a lot cleaner. I give it 4 stars because there's no great difference between the last two versions. It's only a good buy because you have all the versions available to you (w/ a bunch of extras).

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2FBK25KUO7YRD	David Ingram	As a fan of the original 1982 movie, I was excited to see the different versions of this film coalesce into a single high-def collection. The extras of the so called Ultimate Collector's Edition were just too tempting to pass up.Looking at the images on this and other sites, and considering the price of this collection at retail brick-and-mortar stores, I figured I was getting a deal. The truth is, however, that the quality of the packaging and included items are sub-par and thus do not justify the price premium over the Complete Collector's Edition. The briefcase, origami unicorn, and replica Spinner car are all made of cheap plastic and lack heft, feeling as though they would break if they sustained even a short fall. That's not to say that the packaging within the case isn't nice, I just expected more.As far as the movie itself, you can't, and shouldn't, expect miracles just because it's been pressed to shiny Blu-ray. Still, for something filmed in the early '80s, it looks pretty good. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, even if he is the most monotone person on the planet.The final verdict: unless you're a completist, don't bother with the Ultimate Collector's Edition. The Complete Collector's Edition with just the five (5) discs should round out any collector's library nicely.	3.0	Nice, but not as good as it should have been.	2008-02-15	3	0	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A9K0YU07JICHI	David Olson	"Bladerunner is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the best films of the decade, along with Raging Bull and Blue Velvet. A lot of the reviews on this site deal with the original versus the Directors's Cut. I'll say it  simply: The latter is far superior. The director's cut is the version that  was meant to be seen; the original was destroyed by the studio because they  wanted it to have a happy ending and a simple plot. Ridley Scotts's version  takes away the horrid ""happy ending"" and leaves us with the principle  character stumbling upon his ultimate identity. The original had a  &quot;film noire&quot; voiceover to help the audience understand the story,  in this version the voiceover is removed and we are left with the silent  hero wondering through the dark city. Also in this version there is a dream  sequence featuring a unicorn running through the forest which is a very  important image in understaning the ending to the film. This is one of the  three greatest science-fiction films of all time, along with Star Wars and  2001. This film is a little different though. While those films were bright  and inspiring, Bladerunner is a dark and nihilistic film, set on an Earth  that is barren and dying and where Coke adds illuminte the city. And I  think it goes without saying the only way to watch this film is in  widescreen."	5.0	One of the best films of the Decade. A masterpiece!	2000-07-03	5	2	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1XQF8ZBRVQLKG	David Robinson	This is a great version of a great movie.  It is a bit longer than the original release and it doesn't have the horrible Harrison Ford voice-over narration that the studio required.If you're not familiar with the film, it is an excellent film that attained cult status in 1992 when it was rereleased.  The original theatrical version had an abysmal voice over that pulled you out of immersion in the film to explain things you could have figured out on your own from context, or that didn't help the enjoyment of the film.For example, in one place the narration of the theatrical release explains the language spoken in the slums of the future, where it comes from and who speaks it.  In this version in the same spot, there is music building dramatic tension.  Notoriously, the voice over originally contradicted the ending of the film, explaining the finish differently from how it actually happened.  Harrison Ford, Ridley Scott, the director, and even the author of the voice over hated it, but the studio insisted because early test audiences found the movie confusing.This version does not have that voice over, and it's a great version of the film.Mark your calendar for your Roy Batty's incept date, January 8, 2016!

New films are still compared to it - Minority Report, for example. It was stunning in the cinema, amazing to revisit it on DVD. But now, surely it is time to amaze us again with an anniversary edition, complete with respectable extras - commentary, background etc. If a dire film like Pearl Harbor is worth multiple editions, then this is long overdue for its definitive DVD.Interestingly, after Sonny Chow (see above) saying that the Special Edition is due in 2003, Amazon.co.uk has a new edition being released on August 12 2002.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3UUGZRTBS81YN	David W. Jones	This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Blade Runner: Final Cut is superb.  Despite the fact that it is an older movie and shot primarily in lowlight conditions, details are sharp, colors are vibrant and blacks are deep.  While there is some film grain in certain scenes, it is soft rather than gritty.  It did not call attention to iself.  The sound was initially a little weak on my system, but I cranked it up a notch or two and then it sounded fine.  I highly recommend this blu-ray transfer.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is totally worth it.	4.0	Excellent transfer for dystopian sci-fi flick	2013-04-29	3	2	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2ZYUQDAVBQKT8	David Yatim	Until the release of 'The Matrix', the film Blade Runner was considered by many as the finest work of Science Fiction to date. Everything that had to be written about Blade Runner as a movie has been written, so I will just focus on this particular Blu-ray release. In my opinion, it is one of the finest Blu-ray conversions of any movie I have ever seen, certainly for a movie with this many years.The first thing you will notice is that this particular package includes more relevant material about the movie than any other release (that I am aware of). In addition to the 'Final Cut' (the actual Blu-ray product) this five-disc set includes the theatrical US and International releases (both in standard definition) as well as bonus material, such as a clip on the life of Philip K. Dick, who wrote 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?', on which the movie is based.The actual Blu-ray conversion (which, as I mentioned before, is the 'Final Cut' version) can be considered a standard by which older movies should be upgraded to high definition. For starters, the Studio logos are not simply upscaled, but are recreated anew. This puts you on notice on the commitment of the authors to the quality of the conversion. Then, the opening scene (the gloomy skyline of L.A. in the year 2017 - I may be off by a year or so) is simply fantastic. But the high quality of the conversion is not limited to the CG shots: as the scenery moves to the street action, you continue to enjoy excellent quality of image. The sound is equally good, and if you are able to crank up the volume on a 5+1 home theater audio system, you will not be disappointed.In sum, you can not go wrong with this Blade Runner release: it is reasonably priced, has lots of material, and the main feature is released on Blu-ray on a level of quality that is very, very good.	5.0	Excellent Blu-ray conversion...	2009-12-24	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1W6JCOG8VJUCJ	Davin Heidelmark	Blade runner is often called &#34;Blade Crawler&#34; for its awful pacing. It doesn't really matter what cut you watch, the movie does not flow well. The movie can be commended for introducing some enduring styles in film, however many parts of the dialogue is just silly, the lighting (while trying to be stylish and giving an impression of a dystopian future) is annoying and often distracting and the cliche of a retired law enforcement guy being convinced to come back for one last assignment aside, if it difficult to care about any of the characters. Even Deckard. Those who enjoy the Neo-noir genre will inevitably enjoy this film but many (myself included) just do not find this film as a whole entertaining. I enjoy many different genre's of film, Sc-Fi included, however those who have yet to see the film (if you choose to watch it now) I find it extremely doubtful that at the end you'll say &#34;That was awesome&#34;!  Many will say &#34;Oh but the film has so many complex themes about what it means to be human&#34; and I say &#34;I don't care, the movie is slow and boring&#34;. It is similar to Costner's &#34;The Postman&#34; in that you're not exactly mad that you took time to watch the film, BUT you have no desire to watch it again and you'd be hesitant to recommend it.	2.0	Overrated	2014-06-26	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1T9YSDAYS097M	D. Bannister	As with almost all Director's cuts (maybe with the exception of Das Boot and Brazil (Criterion edition)),the film is diminished from its original release. The theatre voiced-over ending was much superior to this one and the unicorn sequence, other than contributing to the speculation that Decker is also Nexus, adds nothing to the film. You would have thought that at least the alternative ending would be on the disk, but sadly there are few extras.Since there were so many possibilites for the DVD edition of the film it is disappointing that Scott and the Studio couldn't make a better product.  Under the guise of artistic vision, Scott has taken what was an excellent film and turned it into one that is just ok. If you can find the original VHS tape anywhere grab it.	3.0	It Deserves Better	2001-03-05	7	6	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2EEHYGQJJC0OV	"D. Barr ""Movie fanatic"""	"All the press about this DVD release is that it's going to include four different versions of the film: the original 1982 U.S. theater release, the original international release (which contained a little more violence, basically; it's been available on VHS before), the 1992 director's cut, and then the new ""definitive"" Ridley Scott cut with updated special effects and everything supposedly just the way Scott wants it.I'm starting to get concerned about the release though.  The original press releases about this DVD said that the director's cut would get a limited reissue in late 2006 (which did happen), then the new definitive cut would get a brief theatrical release this year before hitting DVD soon after.  That was all said last year.  I haven't seen a thing about a theatrical release or a DVD release for this year.  Anyone heard anything new?For the record, I'm a fan of all the versions and flipped over the 1982 theatrical release, but I prefer the director's cut.  I much prefer the ambiguous ending, and the unicorn scene making you wonder about Deckard's character.  After seeing the director's cut, I felt that the original narration, in particular over Batty's death scene, made me feel like the studio believed I wouldn't understand the movie otherwise.  Give me some credit, studio!And the original's ending always did feel like a cop-out to me to make the audience feel happy.  Remember that the studio took the film from Scott and tacked on that ending, using extra footage from Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining""!  It wasn't fair, when you hadn't seen a clear sky the entire film, to tack beautiful scenery on at the end.  That took away from everything you'd seen before about enticing people to leave Earth for the Offworld colonies.  Why leave Earth, or even live in the city, when there was still scenery like that to run to?  I thought the ending of the director's cut was much better, leaving it all up to the viewer.Regardless, no matter which version you see, it's one of the best and most influential science fiction films ever made."	5.0	Definition of Definitive	2007-05-23	18	13	5

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3MAZM138KFVOW	D. Blackdeer	"Dark science fiction adventure set in the year 2019 about a special police-operations officer who hunts down five artificial humans in Los Angeles.  Harrison Ford stars in the main role as Deckard, a ""Bladerunner"" policeman who specializes in hunting down ""Replicants.""  The Replicants are artificial humans manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation, used for hazardous duties in off-world exploration in place of humans.  Replicants have become violently dangerous due to self-realization of their situation, resulting in bloody rebellions against their human owners.  As a result, they're declared illegal on Earth, under penalty of death.  Bladerunner is about the particular case of five who return after escaping from an off-world colony, and try to penetrate the Tyrell Corporation for unknown reasons.  Deckard is retired, having lost taste for his work, and is forced by the Bladerunner unit to take the assignment of running down the five escaped replicants.Released in 1982, the movie boasts impressive visual effects that hold up quite well with today's productions that enjoy digital animation.  The model effects create a massive Los Angeles metropolis of super skyscrapers, millions of lights, neon signs, floating blimps, and flying cars crisscrossing the impressive skyline.  Ridley Scott created an eye-catching atmosphere by looking back 40 years in history to determine the look of architecture and clothing.  The outcome is a timeless appearance that is not mottled with `80's techno-punk.  While being futuristic, it maintains a classic detective-story flavor.The movie received mixed reviews after it first opened, probably due to audiences' expectations of another `Stars Wars' action adventure with Harrison Ford.  Instead they got a deep and dark story of a man [Deckard] hunting down artificial humans who are looking for an answer to their existence.  Midway through the story, Deckard himself begins to develop emotions for the replicants' plight.  Rutger Hauer, a Dutch actor who was at the height of his career in the U.S., stars as the replicants' leader Roy Batty, and turns in an exceptional performance.  Eleven years later, the Director's version was released in theaters and is one of the few movies to have enjoyed such a success, differing from the original 1982 release by excluding Harrison Ford's narrative and a `happy ending' sequence, and the addition of an unusual unicorn scene.  Curiously there are no extra features such as deleted scenes or the trailer, which is particularly interesting since it shows scenes never used in the final release.Bladerunner is one of the better movies in the science fiction category, both in content and visual creation.

Your average bluray will be on a double layer disc and average about 35mbps in video and will always be uncompressed in terms of audio.I really love this movie and was really excited about seeing it on bluray. Bluray makes a big difference in 80's films because they were generally lit very dark as it was the style. Because of the low quality of the hd conversion, the movie in turn looks very grainy and the contrast is not very good. DVDs are usually around 8-9 mbps this bluray is not much better.

Now, if they included the origional Blade Runner with the Director's Cut in a two disk set, with the same sound quality, this will allow fans to be more objective.In my opinion, while the sugary ending (a recycled scene from ""The Shinning"", I've heard) is not something I would miss too much, I found the film empty and silent without Deckard's noirish narration, which completes the classic draw of the film and is how it is best remembered."	3.0	Worth while DVD, needs improvment	2002-10-21	9	8	1

Though Scott re-edited the film for a 1992 release, he has tinkered further, creating his ""final cut"" for the 25th anniversary. Scott says it ""now is in its purest form.""Among changes: A longer ""unicorn"" scene.

Plus: enhanced special effects, a new surround soundtrack. Bonuses include a new making-of documentary.Also: The ""final cut"" will be shown in New York and L.A. theaters this fall and at film festivals in Venice (Aug. 29-Sept. 8) and New York (Sept. 28-Oct. 14)."	5.0	Finally!	2007-07-26	63	47	16

I say bad boy, but in fact, he is the good boy who stood up to his beliefs at the time when the studios used their contractual powers to impose foolish creative control.Personally, I didn't think the Final Cut was that different from the original Director's Cut; but yes indeed, it had a couple of new moments that, I guess, could justify the hype.Also, I am personally not a very big fan of such ""complete collections""- yet another trick by the studios and their greedy sales teams, trying to 'extort' additional money from the customer. I was gladly going to buy just the Final Cut, separately- it's enough to me. Honestly who (except certain teenage kids with rich parents) has the time and the energy to see all available versions- including the unfortunate ""narrated"" version that Scott was forced to release first? Blade-Runner marathon? Overdose guaranteed!Anyway. All in all, this is the best copy of Blade-Runner ever released for purchase by the rest of us mortals.

Even with the voice-over, I remember that I didn't even really like this movie the first time I saw it on VHS in 1983 (like many, the movie is confusing if you only see it once).

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AXYGT3CBHC1WA	DH	This dark, brooding thriller, ranks as one of my all-time favourite science fiction movies. Stirling acting performances from Harrison Ford and Ratgur Hauer, coupled with the dark, murky atmosphere created by Director Ridley Scott combine to make this an engrossing thriller that draws you into Ridley Scotts hazy labrynth of futuristic Los Angeles.  Movies such as the Fifth Element have drawn inspiration from Blade Runner, but none quite manage to pull it all together like Ridley Scott has done with Blade Runner.  Expect a very atmospheric movie, excellent acting, appropriate background music score and an intertesting twist that keeps you interested right to the end.

This movie doesn't look like something that was filmed 25 years ago.  If it wasn't for the fact that Harrison Ford looks so much  younger, you would think that this was a newer movie.Obviously, it is a great film with dark sci-fi themes that was way ahead of its time.  But seeing how mind-blowing the special effects look in HD just makes this a totally new film.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

Some say its Jaws, or Godfather 2, or Casablanca, or even Its a Wonderful Life.  Good movies?  Sure.  But Blade Runner is more than a movie.  It's an experience, a vision of a nightmarish future with brilliant special effects and deep, deep insight on humanity itself.  Almost none of the films on AFI's list fit this.  Blade Runner is an overlooked masterpiece, often regarded by critics as &quot;just are sci-fi movies about a guy hunting androids.&quot;  It's much more than that.The special effects are some of the best ever.The &quot;villain's&quot; final speech (tears in rain) is one of the most memorable ever.The combination of 40s noir and futuristic imagery is nothing ever seen on film.Everyone in the cast gives an excellent performance.It simply has the best camerawork, set design, and production design of any film (OK maybe Scott's other masterpiece, Alien, is just as good)So why not add this baby to the AFI list?

It's so well done cinematically that you truly can suspend disbelief and dive into the rich characters and storyline. As for the Final Cut version, I think it lacks something without the narration by Decker but it's still so full of imagery and detail that missing narration is just nit-picking.  I've always thought there was so much care taken to bring realism to each shot - for instance, the crane shot from inside the police headquarters where the camera pans down past what looks like decades of dirt and refuse scattered around the ceiling of the office before elegantly dropping in on what could only be a well used office filled with a collection of items one might expect from years of police work.Another aspect of this films importance in Sci-Fi is the prognostications of future tech brought to life that really build the foundation for so many scenes.	5.0	The BEST Sci-Fi movie of all time!	2014-06-28	0	0	0

It's absolutely fantastic, and the versions on Blu-Ray are great. As someone who has seen this multiple times, but only owned it on VHS before, I'm extremely happy with the physical product. I love the movie, and will be watching repeatedly.However, the big problem, and why I didn't give this package 5 stars, is the UltraViolet version. In the past, when I've bought UltraViolet movies, I was able to download it through iTunes. Which let me play it on iPad, iPhone, iEverything. Inception, Big Lebowski, all the Lord of the Rings, and others I'm forget are all in my iTunes library.Now, the UltraViolet copy requires some goofy, third party, that uses Adobe Air which is required to play this on your one laptop/desktop. And you have to have accounts at Flixster and UltraViolet. What's with all these hoops? I just want convenience, and this isn't it. I'm sure I can rip the movie to a local file, given all the media I have with this set (multiple BDs, and 1 DVD) but I don't want to. I just want to download and go. I want convenience.So, if you value the digital download, and think it's worth part of the price, you might want to find some other version without it.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	Warner Bros had a downer on this film just prior to its release. Test audiences were inconclusive in their verdicts and Warner Execs insisted that Ridley Scott edit the film, considering it far too downbeat for mainstream audiences.The result was the voice over narrative which apparently Harrison Ford tried to make as unconvincing as possible so that the Execs at Warners would drop it - he failed. Scenes were deleted, and the upbeat flying sequence at the end of the film was added.The film opened to ok returns in the US but did huge business in Europe. In the UK release, it filled cinemas nightly for weeks with many people choosing to make return visits.The early 1990s saw the release of the Directors Cut which was minus the narrative and the upbeat end sequence. It saw some scenes such as the Unicorn sequence restored. Although a limitedrelease, fans turned out in droves, particularly in London's West End.I must confess that I enjoy both versions as different approaches to the same film. I have recently ordered 'The International Version' which apparently is an augmented version of the first release so I will pass comment on that when it arrives.Set in the future, it sees Los Angeles as a rainy, polluted, and totally cosmopolitan metropolis. Mankind has colonised other worlds and uses synthetic humans known as replicants, with superhuman abilities to carry out the dirtier work that doing this involves. Being superhuman comes at a price, as the lifespan for a replicant is only 4 years. The plot revolves around a former cop (Harrison Ford) who specialises in hunting down replicants. Known as a Bladerunner, his task is to eliminate any replicants setting foot on Earth where the punishment for doing so is death or 'retirement'to quote the jargon of the time.Ford's character has quit the job but is blackmailed into hunting down a particulary dangerous group of replicants who have made it to Earth. Their leader is played by Rutger Hauer, who together with his companions are on a dangerous quest to find an end to their limited lifespan.Visually the film is stunning with its depiction of a gaudy and seedy futuristic metropolis. Flying cars, huge neon signs, and advertising blimps dominate the skyline. Life is cheap and violent in this future, and the point is not lost on the viewer that this is a highly likely evolution of our society.The replicants hunt for more life reflects that of humanity's generally, and Ridley Scott's depiction of a replicant meeting his cold and heartless maker, mirrors ongoing theological questions that ultimately we all have to varying degrees.The drama plays out in the style of a classic detective/ Film Noir story, against a superbly realised Sci Fi background.A sequence that could have been cut is the sickly symbolic scene with the dove (which apparently was Rutger Hauer's own suggestion). It detracts from the film and is cloying.What prevents me from giving the dvd 5 stars though is the lack of 5.1 sound on any discs that I have viewed so far.... This film is not so great in Pro logic sound, someone please give it a full digital soundtrack so as to do it the justice that it received in its cinema release!See it though for what it is, a superbly staged Sci Fi Film Noir which reflects on the human condition, and the future that probably awaits us.	4.0	Sci Fi meets Film Noir	2005-02-04	6	3	3

The digital quality is amazing, and it's interesting to watch the movie in it's various versions.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2L074AXOU2MS0	DLF	This is one of two great sci-fi thrillers that Ridley Scott made earlier in his career (the other is &#34;Alien&#34;). While it was largely ignored at the time of its release (in part, due to it being overshadowed by the march of the &#34;Star Wars&#34; franchise), it has since become such a cult classic that there are at least five different versions of it in circulation. This one, which does away with the &#34;explanatory&#34; voice-over by the title character, is I think, the best of the bunch. And among the excellent cast, Rutger Hauer is especially impressive as Roy. See it if you haven't; own it if you can.	5.0	This version has no annoying Harrison Ford voiceover....	2014-06-25	0	0	0

The best quality it has is that the fact of being a sci-fi film does not overshadow the interesting plot. Far from being vacuous and pretentious like f.ex. The Matrix and  many other sci-fi movies, Blade Runner presents us a very interesting story which revisits at the same time the myth of Frankenstein and the life-myth of Christ: very very interesting indeed. The actors are good, especially Rutger Hauer, who interprets the more human character of the film. The new scene (well, old one but not added in the 1982 version) of the unicorn (the dream-the paper unicorn) introduces a new nuance in the story: since the unicorn has been a dream dreamt by Deckard, he is a replicant himself; they know his past, his dreams...	5.0	unicorn introduces new interesting possibilities	2001-07-26	5	5	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1QO7HLN7WBY3Z	DocSmithers	There seems to be much confusion over what exactly was the first ever released DVD in the U.S.  DVD was launched in Japan in late 1996, and early-mid 1997 in the U.S.Warner Home Video was the first to release 4 DVDs in Japan for 1996, including Blade Runner.  Now, here is where things get a bit confusing:  For the U.S. launch of DVD in March of 1997, it is widely believed that Batman was the first DVD released in the U.S.  This is not true.  5 days before Batman was released, four Imax films were released on DVD, beating Warner Home Video to the U.S. market.How does this relate to Blade Runner you ask?  Well, to the best of my knowledge, the initial release of Blade Runner in the U.S. (catalog 12682) is the only U.S. release DVD with a 1996 copyright on the back.  It's a possibility that the other three titles Warner released in Japan in 1996 also have the 1996 copyright for the U.S. versions, but I just don't know...As for the first pressing of Blade Runner, we have quite a rare DVD due to the 1996 copyright date.For those of you who are DVD collectors out there, the first pressing of Blade Runner on DVD will continue to gain historical value as time passes.	4.0	Historic Piece of DVD history	2004-10-19	9	2	7

Directors and actors should enforce Warner to stop the poor film manipulation of their movies when they release widescreen versions. If you don't take my word for it, then start investigating for yourself. If it isn't wide-screen, then leave it that way.That said: the movie is one of the best Sci-Fi pictures ever.

And now in the movie where Deckard used to be narating, it's just silence. What's the point. I only watched about 10 minutes of the Director's Cut version and then I shut it off.Blade Runner used to be one of my favorite movies. I would have put it as a 5 Star rating in the original version.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ADQX0C5IQ5V32	"Donald Varns ""dov"""	First of all I seen this movie for the first time in 1982 when it aired on HBO. Of course it was the version with Deckerd's voice over. I loved it for it's original  style of music, sets, characters and mood. Then in 1992 they released the Directors cut and I was excited about seeing it. I was hoping for scenes of Roy Batty's life on off world, like what he described to Deckard at the end of the film. Or more story on Deckard's past, which would of help telling if Deckard is a replicant or not. What we got was a scene of a unicorn an the voice over eliminated. I again enjoyed this version of the film to but like I said I was hoping for more. Then in 2007, they released this 4 version set with plenty of behind the scenes goodies. I just purchased this set about a week ago and I am glad I bought it for less than half of the original price. Once again I was hoping to see more never before seen scenes, especially since there was a version called the final cut included..If you count less than a minute of scene variance difference between the U.S. version, the U.K. version and the directors cut worthy of seeing it 4 times. The minor changes on these three versions were so insignificant, they made no change in the story or mood of the film.  I watched the extras and what surprised me was, several times they mentioned this film was almost 4 hours long before the editing was done. You would think with an extra 2 hours of film that was not used they could have given us an almost complete new version of this movie. I was impressed with the cleanup of the films making for better picture and sound than the first release of them years ago. This movie, set new standards in movie making with dark sets and music that set the mood of the story telling. It was not widely accepted in 82, but over the years with the help of video tape and then dvd it found cult status. I just hope one day soon they decide to use the unused footage to give us a truly alternate version to the 82 release. Five stars plus for the movie itself, but three stars to Warner Brothers idea of selling 4 versions, with three of them with extremely little difference.	3.0	4 versions with very little difference	2009-02-22	4	1	3

If you liked the theatrical release (like I did), you'll love the director's cut. Without Harrison  Ford's voice over, you have to pay even closer attention to what is going  on onscreen. It's well worth the extra effort. Even if you ignore the plot,  the visuals alone make it well worth your time.	5.0	Amazing	2000-01-21	5	4	1

The original director's cut I would consider to be my favorite movie of all times. What Ridley Scott did with this release is fantastic. Unlike some directors who say something like, ""if you want it on DVD or Blu-ray you will watch the version I want you to watch"" or who release the different versions one at a time costing a fortune, Ridley Scott put all the releases in one fantastic package. He even said that he knows some people have a passion for one release over others and he wanted to honor that and release all of them in the best possible format. Now there is a director that cares about his fans!If you have never seen Blade Runner, you are in for a treat. If you are a fan of Blade Runner, you must buy this set! Don't just buy the new version, spend the extra money and get the whole thing. If you have Blu-ray or are thinking about getting Blu-ray, buy the Blu-ray version.

However, now that the producers have finally settled their legal problems, we are being deluged with a surfeit of Blade Runner editions. This is the first and the least promising of three planned editions. The 1992 Director's Cut is a compromise cut. This barebones DVD is the same as the previous DVD except that it has been fully restored and given an anamorphic remastering.Following this edition, there will be another entitled, ""Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Final Cut,"" to be released in early 2007 to mark the 25th Annversary of the movie, which will include newly restored scenes and will be Scott's final word on the film. Then later in 2007, there will be the ""Ultimate Blade Runner"" which will contain all 4 versions of the film, the original U.S. theatrical cut, the expanded international theatrical cut, the 1992 Director's Cut and the 2007 Final Cut, all fully restored and in anamorphic transfers plus tonnes of extras. In addition, Blade Runner will also be released simultaneously on both Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats.Buy this with your eyes open.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2VJ80PM1G00QV	drkhimxz	With more than  2000 reviews on Amazon at the moment, what more is to be said.  All I have to say is that the essential plot is an ancient one in films, but that is not a criticism. There are some nice views and many devices from, what would they call it, the age of noir? I could just see Mike Mazurki going into the saloon where Velma used to work (with Dick Powell whom he had just hired to find her) and tossing the bartender who came to stop him into eternity. Of course, Charlton Heston took a sci-fi shot at getting rid of the not wanteds, and........Nevertheless it was entertaining to see Harrison Ford at work although yet another scene on the roofs didn't exactly have the thrills it should have had as  the final confrontation (remember Edward G. Robinson and Orson Welles in the bell tower of a church and...............). So, as one who never had seen nor even known the film existed, all I can say to those others who  will know nothing about it save that it stars Harrison Ford, is that it is worth the slight cost of a used copy for it will give you a couple of hours of shoot-em-up, chasin'  'em down, and battered PI to enliven the evening. If I remember correctly, Harrison Ford even gets to kiss the girl.	4.0	A Traditional Film with Harrison Ford	2013-03-25	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3EQQP0LD4Z375	Dr. Lee D. Carlson	"Described a few days ago by a public radio announcer as being a ""box office flop"" when it was released in 1982, this movie nevertheless has had a huge following since that time. Some have considered the movie as a warning against dangerous technological influences, while others, a small minority in fact; consider it a tour de force, as an indication of where technology is headed. If one examines the evidence carefully, there are strong indications that advances in genetic engineering and neuroscience will allow the kinds of beings portrayed in this film to be produced in the near future. These beings, called ""replicants"" in the movie, have mental and physical abilities that are enhanced to a large degree over the humans that surround them. These abilities were designed into them by their creators, with the hopes of using them to perform dangerous physical labor on the ""off-world"" colonies. All of the actors who portray the replicants in the movie give convincing performances, especially when displaying their emotional immaturity and their reaction to fear. In the latter, they are behaving like any ordinary human would: protecting themselves against forces that seek to destroy them.Everything about this movie is interesting, and for a technophile it is an excellent vehicle with which to project oneself into a future that he may not get to experience. Indeed, there is so much to contemplate while viewing it: advanced space travel, flying cars, sophisticated toy robots, voice recognizing machines, the artificial owl and snake, and of course the advances in genetic engineering. But whether put in by the director on purpose or not, there are a few things in the movie that point to the limitations of scientific understanding at the time (2019). For example, the toy-maker J.F. Sebastian complains about having ""Methuselah syndrome"", which as he explains it is a form of accelerated aging, which prevents him from living in the off-world colonies. Medical science is apparently still not advanced enough to cure him of this illness. Another example is when Roy Batty challenges Eldon Tyrell to extend his lifetime to one that is greater than four years, but Tyrell gives Batty the biological reasons why this cannot be done. So even though genetic engineering is advanced enough to create functioning replicants, it is still unable to ""alter the coding sequence once it has been set"". These two examples exemplify the idea that there are always issues, problems, and areas that science has not yet explained, thus motivating further research.The replicants Zhora and Pris are both sexually enticing figures in the movie, and of course this was by design. But they cannot compare to the desirability of Rachel, a special replicant designed by Tyrell and who totally overwhelms all the other characters in movie. Her fragility and naivet&eacute; are to be contrasted with her sophistication in dress and demeanor. Every set she is in becomes her runway, but the best scene is when she first meets Rick Deckard, and asks him about the artificial owl. Her clothes, makeup, and hairstyle are pure twenty-first century, and naturally Deckard is very attracted to her, as any man would be. And in this regard it does not matter whether Rachel is a replicant or not. All that matters for an attraction to take place is the responses in the brains of both parties. This movie gives a glimpse of the love affairs between humans and machines that will be a common occurrence in this century, and there is no rational or ethical reason why they should not take place.And far from being evil, the Tyrell Corporation exemplifies the kind of future that is ahead. No doubt corporations in this century will cause some difficult social problems, and technological advances of course have their negative ramifications (the ""acid rain"" and filthy streets in the movie), but these can be cured by new technology. Thus one technological advance requires another, and this one still another. Each advance seems to occur much more rapidly than the other, forcing an unrelenting march into the future. Sometimes this march can be as a drunkards walk, and sometimes it takes place with huge leaps, but as this movie and those it influenced after it was released portrays, there are always consequences, sometimes negative and sometimes positive. But far from being a dystopian vision of the future, this movie portrays one that all humans should strive for. And in the process of doing so, we will be assisted by the very technology we create. This technology will also develop its own vision of the future, and it might be very different from our own."	5.0	A future worth striving for	2007-12-21	9	6	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	&quot;Blade Runner&quot; is, in my mind, one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time.  The movie takes place in the early part of the 21st century.  Harrison Ford plays a cop whose job it is to track down  illegal artificial life forms called &quot;replicants.&quot;  So, sounds  like just another action /  beat-em up / shoot-em up, right?  Wrong.This  movie is not an action movie.  It is, if anything, a drama.  It deals with  the 20th century postmodern condition and has many philosophical  implications.  For one, it deals with the rights of artificial life forms  and what, exactly (if anything?) distinguishes them from us;  something  that is not far fetched at all considering the horrifying technology we are  right on the brink of having in regards to microbiology and gene  manipulation.The sets are lavish &amp; have a haunting, gothic feel to  them.  The acting, with Harrison Ford in the lead, is top notch.  This is  one of the few movies where I can say that Sean Young turned in a credible  performance.  Also, the soundtrack is by Vangelis;  it is  subtle....stirring....perfect for this movie.This is a movie I would  highly recommend to ANYONE who lives in this day &amp; age of scientific  marvels &amp; their potential hideous consequences.  Even if you don't like  science fiction, per-se, this movie is worth watching at least once.	5.0	A thinking man's movie	2000-07-13	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"1982's ""Blade Runner"" was a highly original and dramatic sci-fi thriller starring Harrison Ford as Decker, a burnt-out bounty hunter living in a high tech 21st Century Los Angeles.  Decker is a so-called blade runner; his job is to hunt down rogue replicants, human-like androids genetically engineered to resemble humans and who sometimes go out of control.  The replicants have exceptional strengths and abilities, but come with a pre-programmed lifespan.  Only an experienced blade runner like Decker can spot one in a crowd.As the movie opens, Decker is lured out of retirement to track down four renegade replicants, led by Rutger Haur as their ruthless but oddly philosophical leader.  The four rogues attempt to hide in the dark, rainy forest of high-rises that is Los Angeles, a multi-cultural Tokyo on steroids.Decker will hunt down the rogues one by one.  Each confrontation serves to build sympathy for the replicants, who seem only too human in their desire to live, and for Decker, who has come to loath his job.  Decker will get assistance from Rachel (Sean Young), herself a replicant.  Decker's confrontation with his final opponent is a haunting indication of what a replicant might or might not be capable of.This edition of ""Blade Runner"" has the ending presented in the original theatrical release, including Decker's explanatory voice-over.  Other editions of this movie, which has spawned its own cult following, have other endings, director cuts, and revisions.  Highly recommended as a ground-breaking example of the sci-fi genre."	4.0	Blade Runner: the theatrical release...	2007-09-18	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2GK1VO5H0MRL8	Duane A.Hanna	Having seen the original cut of Blade runner, I recommended it to everyone who mentioned an interest in sci-fi.  However many told me that they rented the movie (director's cut) but couldn't follow it.  Much to my chagrin I  found out why.  The original cut had Ford providing a voice-over that  explained some of culture, environment and  gave insight as to why he  (Decker) quit the force.  So much was lost by removing he voice-over. In  the  director's cut, you're left with the scene of Ford flying off with  Young to live out what remains of  her 4-year lifespan.  The original has  the same scene but the voice-over explains how they beat the system ( and  Olmos ).  Hands down the original  cut with Ford's voice-over would easily  earn at least 5 stars, yet this director's cut was too deep, especially in  the scene where Ford confronts Hauer. This could be an fine example of it's  genre.  As it is, I bought this DVD in the hopes that Ford's commentary  would be there.  Still, I pray that someone will re-release the original  cut on DVD.	3.0	I keep praying they will rerelease the original cut	2000-02-28	19	17	2

Whether you prefer the original theatrical release or the director's cut of Blade Runner, and there are many in both camps, to not include the narrated version is a huge mistake and the reason I will not be buying this DVD.  This time the studio had it right.  Not for the right reason, perhaps, but the VO convention ties Deckard to his 1930's noir kin and makes Blade Runner timeless. The happy ending is unfortunate but the unicorn image in the director's cut is as well.

The other times I had seen Blade Runner it was always very dark. Perhaps this was the way it was intended to make the viewer sense how dark they thought the future would be. This one seemed to cut off some of the ending. Because it seemed to me when Harrison Ford left with Rachel they were leaving the city for the country and he was talking about how she had a normal life span v.s. the four years.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A35AMPDFAB8JLT	Edmonson	"Bladerunner was based on Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep"". Was Deckard (Harrison Ford) an Android too? This question was left unanswered, but various clues indicate that maybe he was an android, such as Deckard's unicorn dream matching up with the origami unicorn found at the end by Deckard. Did the police officer(Edward James Olmos) know something that Deckard didn't know about himself. One of the androids (Sean Young) asks point blank if he has ever given himself the test, but he never replies.The 1968 novel is actually quite different from the movie in many ways, such as with the drug dependancy of the central characters in the novel. In the novel Decker and the rest of the human race is obsessed with collecting either real or lifelike robotic animals. In Decker's world it is considered a status symbol to own a real animal, but those without the financial means settle for robotic animals. All the while people are constantly regulating their feelings and emotions by plugging themselves into machines, thus the humans have developed a symbiotic relationship with machines just as advances are being made to create androids that are ever more human like. In this crossroads with the future humans and androids are virtually the same, but this threatens the humans' belief that they are unique. In this context androids have no rights, since androids are made by humans. Thus bounty hunters like Decker make their living chasing down runaway androids. In an ironic twist Decker kills these intelligent and emotional androids in order to buy a prized living animal.This darkly atmospheric film establishes the stage for many other sci-fi movies to come. And in this blu-ray set we get the first theatrical versions (1982), plus the director's cut (1992), and now the final cut (2007), which has the Deckard voiceover deleted, as well as numerous never-before-seen shots, improved special effects, and added lines. There is even included a working copy of the film. This 5 disc set has it all.

Dolnack	"What no one has answered is what is different about this ""30th Anniversary"" edition blu-ray that the previous blu-ray edition from 2007?Is there any noticeable difference in image or sound quality at all?Fans are acting as if this is the very first time that Blade Runner has appeared in high-def blu-ray and that's not the case. Has everyone forgotten the previous five-disk 2007 release that also contained the so-called ""final"" cut?First of all, I doubt that Ridley Scott can keeps his hands off this film, and that more final-final-this time I really REALLY mean it versions will come out in the future.Secondly, I never for a second bought into the lame idea that Harrison Ford's character is a robot. Even if the androids THINK they experience memories (implanted from real human donors), the idea that they can love each other is absurd. I always read the film to say that Deckard is a living flesh & blood human being like you and I.Thirdly, the best version of this film by far was the original theatrical release with the Harrison Ford narration. Ford's narration is vital to the story, as this plot is rather vague and hard to follow at times. Any newer versions that try to establish some lame sort of ambiguity towards the main protagonist is just a cheap gimick to make suckers spend more money on new ""versions"".Lastly, Ridley Scott's lost his touch. Compare this masterpiece to his most recent ""Prometheus"", a very tired formulaic film that sadly tries to capitalize on his monumental 1979 original ""Alien"" movie's coattails. Lets just say that I no longer trust the director's artistic whims. Leave your classic films alone, Mr Scott, because like George Lucas, you're just ripping off your fans at this point.Lets see less new re-versioning of this classic, shall we. All I want is the best image and sound quality available of the original film. Is this that? Is this version better than the 2007 five-disk blu-ray package at all, or are fans being ripped off?"	5.0	Is this 30th Anniv. version better than the previous blu-ray version?	2012-11-25	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AGDKSHVJCAKBA	Eduardo Luna	Okay, so its been 25 years since the release of Blade Runner. Over time this movie built a pretty sizable fan base.A few years ago Warner released this movie in a Directors cut with a horrible transfer and no special features of which to speak of.And the Directors Cut was not to the liking of the Director...Ironic isn't it? So Warner gave Ridley Scott the go ahead to make his definitive edition. This product exemplifies the hard work and dedication that every single person in the cast and crew gave. This product is the be all end all for Blade Runner. The transfer is awesome with crisp clear colors and very defined blacks. The Audio is just as amazing with its 5.1 surround sound. All of the special features are very interesting with amazing insight as to how the movie was made. Included in this box-set are all of the different versions of the film, including the extremely rare work print version. All of this is in a very nice plastic case that resembles Deckards Voight-Kampff case. Included in the case is a Unicorn Oragami Figurine and spinner car model. Also included is a lenticular motion still and a mock case file with various pictures of Pre-production art by Syd Mead and other artists. All in All a very good and very rare box-set.	5.0	One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever finally gets the treatment it deserves!	2007-12-29	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"Never thought I'd say this, but for once the producers/studio actually showed far better aesthetic judgement than the director!This version is much slower and more self-indulgent.  Whereas the first 1/3 of the studio cut was a little slow, in this director's cut it's more like the first 3/4 of the film positively CRAWLS along, loaded with tons of fat that was justifiably trimmed off---it's as if Scott were trying to emulate Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" artistic genius.  And, sorry to say, fails miserably.The only improvement with this version is that the ending is much more open-ended which fits in better with the whole content of the film, as opposed to the studio version's imposed Cliched Happy Ending.I was also disappointed that the DVD contains zero bonus features, other than the choice of Widescreen on one side and Standard Screen on the other.  It would've been nice to have the option of viewing different endings, or having the director's version on one side and the studio version on the other.For those of you who've never seen this film, it's based on Phillip K. Dick's postmodern classic, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  The subtext of the film, which is much more developed in the novel, is the blurring line between humans and machines especially in a dystopian corporatist and hyper-technological future---or rather, an exploration of what we conventionally think of as ""human nature"" itself.  Namely, in what ways are humans similar to machines?  Like the androids in the film, we also become aware of our mortality and try, in equally futile and pathetic ways, to resist it.  Like the androids we also base our personal identity on our memories.  And like them, we are also very much programmed and conditioned to be controlled, manipulated and regimented into narrow slots by  our social elites, which like in the film consist mainly of oligarchical corporations.Unfortunately, neither versions of this film really delve into those subversive questions at the expense of sci-fi entertainment.

The main character of the story is Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is ordered to kill replicants. Rather than explaining the story I am simply going to suggest that this is a movie that must be seen. However, what I intend on reviewing or comparing is the Director's Cut against the theatrical release. The Directors Cut is obviously the better choice. The original voice over narration is horrible, meaningless, and offers a fake happy ending. Harrison Ford himself admits to doing the voice over poorly hoping that the studio would not use it. The Directors Cut version is a much better film, not just because of this, but because of the ending. The film is a difficult one which takes a few viewings to fully comprehend the whole story and the ideas but it is such a brilliant film that any movie fan must dedicate themselves to Scotts masterpiece."	5.0	A dark film, which is further emphazised by the Direct.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2TV6SBCWT7P8S	ehakus	"I have not seen the original version of this movie, so I can't compare the two. Regardless of what the other version of this film was like, however, this version was extraordinary - I've never seen anything quite like it before! Besides providing the viewer with a mesmerizing combination of a bizarre setting, appropriate music, and action sequences, this film raised many essential questions about what it means to be human...Blade Runner is, more than anything, a film noir - in many ways it is very similar to Humphrey Bogart's noir detective thrillers from the 1940s (The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep, for instance). But instead of being set in the dark city streets in the 1940s, Blade Runner is set in L.A. in 2019. By 2019, the movie asserts, L.A. has been transformed into a decaying mega-metropolis, and consists of multitudes of people fighting their way through constantly rainy streets (turning the idea of sunny California on its head) filled with strange shops. Great shots of this bizarre city combined with a perfectly fitted soundtrack create a nightmarish, haunting atmosphere in this film.Essentially, the plot of this movie concerns Rick Decard (Harrison Ford, in an unusual and very, very good performance), a one time blade runner (i.e. police killer) who is forced by to track down several more replicants (androids w/a 4 year lifespan who are used as slaves but sometimes escape and are illegal on Earth). As the movie puts it, replicants ""were designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The designers reckoned that after a few years, they might develop their own emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, anger, envy. So they built in a fail-safe device...Four year life span.""Anyhow, as Decker hunts down the remaining replicants, he begins to learn to feel again - at the beginning of the film, he seems even less human than the replicants he is supposed to kill. Also, along the way, he meets Rachael, a beautiful replicant who has been modified (she has been given memories) to even more resemble a human. Saying any more about the plot would give too much away...but one thing is for sure - this is a fantastic film which raises many important questions about humanity and life. Watch this soon - don't let this film's moments get lost ""in time like tears in the rain.""

I just watched the ""Directors Cut"" (the only cut available)last night (having only seen the original version many years ago and at the theater). I had heard so many things about this version, yet never anything specific.  It turned out to be nothing that I had expected.  Here's what went through my mind; (if you've never seen this film, beware of spoiler stuff!!)-I remembered the original being a bit more exciting...  ...I think?-The lack of narration had little effect on my opinion of the film.  It did seam a little ""lonelier""...  ...I think??-Harrison Ford sure looks young!!  He really didn't need to act much.-I had forgotten how ""Asian"" L.A. had become in this film.  Not sure why this is our future?-Could not get over the fact that this film takes place 20 years from now.  Doubtful L.A. will look like this in 20 years.  I would have picked a date most of the viewers would not live to, like 2100.  That's just me...-I had heard that Ford's character dies in this version.  I kept waiting for that...-Some say he is a replicant and will die soon.  OK??  I'm going to need some help with that one.  It was not apparent to me (Though intriguing).-I guess they imply that the ""Unicorn dream"" was implanted, at the end.  THAT'S REALLY SUBTLE!!  But I get it.-If he is a replicant, I really don't have much reason to care for him.  And why isn't he stronger?-Given all this, I like the original better... ...I think?You see, my biggest problem is my memories of the original are fading.  I really think there is something wrong with that.  When I first saw this film in the theater, I thought it was outstanding.  Now I see the Directors Cut and think it's OK.  It actually moved a little slow for me.  If I could just have a clear point of reference/comparison.  I'm a little upset that the choice has been denied me.  Why is it that both versions were not released together?  Now that would be great!!I haven't said much about the DVD itself.  Eh.  It is an old DVD.  NO extras at all.

However, over the years it was discovered by millions more and now stands as a sci-fi masterpiece, due to its stunning visuals, storytelling, acting and ambience.  Unfortunately, when it was rereleased as the director's cut, and as much as I regard Ridley Scott as a master of his craft, I considered that the elimination of the voiceover was one of the biggest mistakes ever made in cinema history, as most of the storytelling and mood that made it a classic, was gone.  Regarding the different endings, either are OK as to me the climax of the movie was really in the final scene between Batty and Deckard.I am one of many fans that will love to see the original BR restored for DVD, as companion to whatever other version Ridley wants included, which I understand will be the so-called Director's Cut and a new Definitve Cut,that, if made right and honest to its many fans and not solely to the director's ego, should reinsert the voice-over along any other new scenes and edits.Let me emphasize that I have been a longtime fan of Mr. Scott since the groundbreaking Alien, and really hope he brings back the movie that convinced millions that Alien was not a one time stroke of luck but rather the indication that a legendary career was on the making.	4.0	A Lost Gem That Needs To Be Re-discovered	2003-09-28	7	6	1

Burroughs's little so-called BladeRunner ""screenplay,"" our first clue to how this monumental epic cinematic creation acquired its compellingly spellbinding name. Not recalling this connection included in the film credits we consulted a literary journalist friend who instantly wrote a fascinating short article. Most interesting,he suggested the Burroughs diabolic outlook  explaining gross discrepancies with Philip K. Dick's ingenious humanitarian concepts throughout his novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" presumably the only text that inspired the movie. We later learned that the solitary use of the Burroughs piece was its then-obscure title, and no part of its adaptation of the Philip E. Nourse novel by that name. In pursuing our adventurous inquiry, the mystery has grown evermore bewildering with the years. Wouldn't many other enthusiasts of this profound cinematic colossus be encouraged to participate in this somewhat pleasantly obsessive expedition in cultural private investigation along film noir routes of research. As with Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey,(like Blade Runner including Douglas Trumbell)the possibilies seem infinite for ourselves, and Amazon has no apparent shortage of materials."	5.0	Hunting of the Shadowy Snark, or Blade Runner's Magical Mystery Title	2012-07-15	3	0	3

But there are still several qualms that many people, myself included, have with the DVD release. First of all, the sound and video transfer flat out suck. There is no 5.1 sound, and as for the video, well, that's just because no archival negative has ever been made, so what you see is what you get. Secondly, the only version of the film that you can get on DVD format is the ""Director's Cut"", which is just a hurried fix-up from the original. Ridley Scott even said himself that he wasn't totally happy with this version, but it met his basic artistic vision of the film. Lastly, there are not special features except for a crappy cast and crew synopsis.Okay, so before you start to think that I'm totally blasting the film, hold on. The true version of this film is yet to be seen by anyone. According to Scott and Warner Bros., a three-disk, definitive version of Blade Runner is supposed to be released. Contained will be all the different versions of the film, including a new version which Scott has painstakingly digitally re-edited and reworked. It's not the original, it's not the director's cut, but it's just simply, ""Blade Runner"". Also included in the ""Blade Runner: Special Edition"" will be loads of extras, including interviews and documetaries. This is the true version of the movie, the version that should be viewed by the masses. One problem though. Legal struggles between Scott, Warner Bros., and the ""Blade Runner Partnership"" have made the release of this version all but certain. Scott has already done the work, and Warner Bros. is ready to distribute, but Jerry Perenchio of the ""Partnership"" seems less than thrilled to let Scott have his way.So, my advice is to hold out until the ""Special Edition"" comes out. I know, who knows when that will be, but trust me, if you are a fan of Blade Runner, you will only be doing yourself a favor by waiting."	3.0	Good, but waiting for better...	2004-08-05	20	18	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AM78CP8ZBK6XD	"E. Olson ""lovethatgoren"""	I love the narrated version. I saw it in the movie theater and on video may times, and frankly I liked the voice of Ford telling his impressions of the other characters and the story line. But not having the narration  leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions, and the added footage  makes the movie even better. This is a classic futuristic film without all  the made-up monsters and gooey gore - it's raw and gritty either way. And  of course, seeing Harrison Ford in an early role, before he became  president of the United States or ``the good doctor'' is an exciting  adventure. He's self-centered, mercenary and not such a nice guy after all.  That's the best part of this film.	4.0	A dark side of Harrison Ford is a must for any fan.	2000-07-02	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2LYKUZX7TX2M5	"Eric B. ""Eric B."""	I purchased the Four Disk regular DVD version.  The image quality and sound quality is excellent, especially for a movie that is multiple decades old.  Disk One is the new director's edition.  This disk contains three comentary tracks. The director  is on one; several screenwriters are on track two; they discuss how the screenplay went from the book through several good and bad rewrites; the final commentary is by several of the special effects workers.  I sampled a little of each, and it was quite interesting.  Disk Two is a documentary on making the Blade Runner. Disk Three contains the three previous versions:the original American and international cuts, and the one previous directors cut. Each of these has the same great picture quality as the new cut.  However, my version(U.S.) had no alternate language (english only and no commentary) on these archive cuts although the new cut does.  Final disk has several short features that seem to concentrate on Philip Dick's writings.  I sampled a couple, and they seemed really interesting.I am not a Blade Runner fanatic, but I always enjoyed the movie since seeing it at the college union several years after the original movie release.  I thought this new cut does provide the best version. I sampled part of the original version and liked this one much better without the narration by H.Ford. I really enjoyed this collection. Amazon has a great price. I payed a little more when I picked it up at one of the big box stores in February 08.  The four disk version was well packaged also.  Its size is compact as it is only slighter bigger than an individually packaged DVD.	5.0	Excellent Restoration (4 disk version)	2008-04-17	0	0	0

I can tell you that it looks and sounds better than that original theatrical debut.  I DO have a 50 inch plasma TV, but not HD playback so no blu ray or HD.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AVQJD41PLPOOQ	Eric F.	"I had the opportunity to see the new ""Final Cut"" of BLADE RUNNER on screen in New York City this past weekend.  As always, it's one of my favorite science fiction films of all time and I welcome any opportunity to see it on the big screen, in any version.First, I have to say that I saw this when it was first released in June 1982.  The original theatrical version with Harrison Ford's voice-over and the Hollywood happy ending is still and will always be my favorite version.  That said, the only thing I can honestly claim is an improvement with the ""Final Cut"" is the sharper, remastered print.  As far as the film itself, it is almost completely identical to the 1992 Director's Cut.  There are some extra pieces of dialogue and extended scenes thrown in, which in my opinion, don't expand the film at all.  The added scenes of violence are not new to the BLADE RUNNER fan.  They've been available for view ever since the film first appeared on video cassette in the '80's.If you already own the Director's Cut of BLADE RUNNER on DVD, then save your money.  Buying it all over again for the ""Final Cut"" will not gain you much, except a larger hole in your wallet."	4.0	Always fixing, but never broken in the first place.	2007-10-08	129	106	23

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC	Eric J. Anderson	Of course, in the DVD format, there is no reason there should not be a director's cut release. But there are legitimate reasons that people might prefer the theatrical version. I  found the director's cut to be flat without Ford's ironic noir-style narration. A lot of the classic lines from the film are from the voiceover narration, which does not appear in the director's cut.And personally, I don't feel the original ending was a &quot;Hollywood happy ending&quot; either. They are driving off into the wild blue. Whether Rachel lives 100 years or 4 years, it is not going to be a bowl of cherries. That's just the point. Deckard didn't know how long she would live, or how long he would live. That's life. And now they are fugitives. This is a happy ending?For me, Deckard was not an android and never will be. He was a crotchety, burned-out human blade runner who fell in love with an android.So I will add my voice to the chorus of people begging for a proper DVD release of the theatrical version. There is no excuse for its unavailability. The public should have its choice, just as it did in VHS. I personally own the laserdisc release of the theatrical version, and visually the mastering is not that great. We need the DVD.

Before this release I had never seen Blade Runner before and often pondered several of the DVD releases before HD DVD was ever available.This film almost never came on cable (if it did I never saw it) and I said finally I'm buying in for HD DVD; and the results are amazing!  Its kind of hard to imagine this film being a 1982 film, it looks like it was made in the late 90s or something.  The picture is nice and crisp and its sci-fi entertainment at its best.  The only indication that this was an old film was the original sound recording from the 80's era.  Still sounds really good, especially the score.You get 5 discs loaded with extras for only $27.95, its well worth every penny and more!!!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A21G4K41H632S3	Ericovan	FYI, I received a copy of this DVD with Disk 1 incorrectly identified as the Final Cut. In actuality the disk features the Workprint edition (which already is on Disk 5).  You can identify this error by either noting it in the special features menu where Ridley Scott introduces it as the Workprint edition, or in the opening credits where the movie starts in bold red as Blade Runner and provides a dictionary definition of replicant (no screen credits are shown).Warner Brothers is aware of this.  I contacted them directly at their service hotline at: 1-800-553-6937, and they replaced the disk for free.This DVD is a great value and well worth watching especially the commentaries where cast and director offer their opinions on whether Deckard is a replicant or not.  The 1982 version with voice over still is the best and consistent with the film noir aspect of the movie.	5.0	FYI Final Cut Replacement problem	2009-03-04	8	7	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"Okay, so it's true that Blade Runner has a very slow pace. But to be honest, I'd rather have that than a swift, explosive, over-the-top adventure that's mixed with George Lucas and John Woo. This is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. The main reason why it's so great is the awe-inspiring style of the entire film. This is futuristic Los Angeles at its filthiest. There's smoke everywhere, the streets are always wet and dirty, and the hovering vehicles with searchlights would be a constant irritation if you're living on the top floor of an apartment building. But that's not the only thing that makes this film a magical experience. You also have Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" as an adaptation. The screenplay is drastically different than the original story, but at least the inspiriation is still there. Also, you have some incredible performances from Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, and James Edward Olmos. It's a very disturbing environment, so you can see that their characters are clearly affected by it. But Hauer could have at least been given an Oscar nomination; his performance here is probably the standout. His monologues give chills and tears. And this film has an actual message that involves the future, technology, and society in general. If you haven't seen this film yet, I won't spoil the message for you.You can call it slow, and you can call it boring. I love it for what it is: a sci-fi noir masterpiece that's thankfully devoid of mindless action and loud techno music."	5.0	Not your usual style-over-substance	2009-09-23	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AYMPVLWFKTAYE	"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic"""	"With ""Blade Runner,"" Ridley Scott has given film lovers a stunning  film that appeals as much today as it did when first released. From beginning to end, his attention to detail in lighting, set design, blocking...*everything*...is breathtaking. Even twenty years later, ""Blade Runner"" does not appear dated or low-tech; Syd Mead & Jordan Cronenweth out-did everyone else of the period.The story takes place in 2019, in the city of Los Angeles. Humans have invented robots (called ""replicants"") to serve as slaves, especially in off-world colonies. The latest version of the replicants, though, is so close to human (""More Human Than Human"" is manufacturer's motto) that they begin to develop their own emotional responses. This leads to trouble, as they have fully-formed, adult bodies, but the emotional experience of children (which the actors who play the replicants do a fantastic job of portraying through facial expressions and body posture.)  Because their anger can often lead to violence, replicants have been banned on Earth. Should any turn up, special units of the police called ""Blade Runners"" are dispatched to ""retire"" the replicants (killing them was not called ""murder"" or even ""termination,"" since they are viewed as sub-human.)Deckard (Harrison Ford) is the main character, and we experience the story mostly from his perspective. He is a retired Blade Runner quietly going about his life, when he's suddenly yanked back into the business by his old boss (M. Emmet Walsh,) who tells him he desperately requires Deckard's help. Six replicants hijacked a ship off-world and have found their way to Los Angeles, where Tyrell Corporation, their manufacturer, is located. They are seeking their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell, for answers and little will deter them.As the story unfolds, we learn more about the replicants Deckard must track down and retire, and it is to be hoped that we develop some empathy for them. To add another layer to the story, Rachel, Deckard's love interest, comes with a full package of complex issues that force Deckard into a bit of a dilemma as he pursues his quarry.This is not a fluffy, happy movie; it is filled with dark, dripping scenes of haunting beauty (highlighted by the Vangelis soundtrack,) and a moral that is not beaten into viewers with a large, heavy-handed hammer. One of the scenes near the end has Rutger Hauer speaking a monologue that remains one of my favorites, because it speaks to a deep, central part of me that selfishly grieves because when I die, all of my memories will die with me - no one else will see things the way I have. I connect with Roy on a very intimate level at that moment, and I feel most other viewers will, too.The cast is out*standing*: Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, Joanna Cassidy, William Sanderson, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, Joe Turkel, James Hong...holy smokes! Each actor perfectly portrays his or her character with absolute believability, right down to small tics and expressions, and their chemistry is fabulous.This version of the film leaves out Deckard's narrative, adds a few moments of footage to more clearly establish an implication regarding Deckard's humanity, and removes other footage to clean things up a bit. The loss of the narrative removes a lot of the 40's gumshoe, film noir aspects of the movie, but it doesn't make the movie difficult to understand at all; the film very clearly stands on its own without it.However, the narrative in the original verison adds a lot of charm to the film, and gives us a clearer understanding of Deckard; I really enjoy that version as well. The film is much more elegant without it, though, allowing viewers to pay more attention to the gorgeous scenery and background sounds, instead of listening to what Deckard is saying, and missing some of the details.I can't say that I prefer one version to the other, as they both  have so much to recommend them. I couldn't even argue which version a person ""should"" see first; each will color the viewer's experience of whichever film is seen second.""Blade Runner"" in either form continues to blow me away, even though I have seen it dozens of times. It is always in my list of of top five favorite films, and I very much recommend both versions to anyone who enjoys science fiction, detective movies, or generally excellent film. Sit back, relax, and allow the sheer beauty to sweep you away into a thoroughly enjoyable experience."	5.0	Perfect	2002-11-10	9	8	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ADWQPR0LJD4J	"ERSInk . com ""Eric"""	"Watching ""Blade Runner"" is an emotional investment no matter how many times you see it. I don't know if it's the lighting, the music, the dialogue, or a combination of all of the above. How a science fiction film from 1982 can still have that effect on me after seeing it dozens of times is beyond my comprehension. I always come away from the film with my insides all mixed together with sadness, excitement, and that warm feeling of happy nostalgia you get when you experience something you never thought you could again.Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's release of ""Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition,"" science fiction fans can view any one of five different versions of the film whenever they want in the comfort of their own home theater. You can choose from ""The Final Cut,"" the ""Original Theatrical Cut,"" the ""International Theatrical Cut,"" the ""Director's Cut,"" or the ""Rare Workprint Feature Version.""No matter what version of the movie you watch, they all tell the same story. In the year 2019, a group of organic robots called replicants kill a ship full of people while escaping an interstellar trip and head to Earth. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to hunt the fugitives down and destroy them. Deckard is what is referred to as a ""blade runner"" - a special police officer that ""retires"" replicants when they wander back to Earth where they've been banned.I've seen ""Blade Runner"" in many different environments and formats. I've seen it on VHS on a 25-inch television. I had the opportunity to see it on the big-screen a couple of times at revival screenings. I've watched it on a 50-inch flat screen in a regular DVD format. I can wholeheartedly tell you that if you haven't seen this amazing piece of cinema history on Blu-ray in its restored ""Final Cut"" version then you've never properly viewed it.Each version of the film has something different to add to its viewing experience. There are different endings, additional footage, and even a monologue by Harrison Ford that tells you everything you need to know (and many fans would say some things you shouldn't) to help explain what's happening throughout. I suggest watching every version of the film to truly appreciate and take it all in.Douglas Trumball's special visual effects are a step beyond stunning. The use of models and practical effects gives ""Blade Runner"" a realistic look that filmmakers today using CGI only wish they could achieve. Everything from the architecture of the buildings to the designs of the vehicles still influences designers to this day.""The Final Cut"" is breathtaking to look at in high-definition. I've never seen the movie look so pure. Yet somehow it still has that nostalgic grainy element that only real film can provide. The last time I remember feeling this satisfied with a high-definition transfer was when I saw the Blu-ray version of ""Jaws"" for the first time. The 5.1 surround sound mix gives viewers everything they could ever want by immersing them in an excellent musical score by Vangelis mixed with sonic treats like the blips and beeps of communicators, the engines of hover crafts and cars, and the chaotic noises of the futuristic city.Special features included in this edition include the 211-minute ""Dangerous Days"" documentary, ""All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cuts"" documentary, HD stills, and more than 1,000 archival images. There are also introductions to the different versions by director Ridley Scott and audio commentary by various people. Let's just say there's enough material to easily pack four discs.We also get an exclusive hardcover art book full of behind-the scenes photos, production art, sketches, and storyboards. Let's not forget the lenticular mini-poster and Concept Spinner model included in the box set. ""Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" truly is the gift that keeps on giving.There's no possibly way any hardcore devotee of ""Blade Runner"" could be disappointed in this new edition of the cult film. It's an exhaustive collection of every version of the movie combined with hours of behind-the-scenes and making of features to give special insight into the construction of this cinematic treasure. It's an absolute must-have item to complete any science fiction buff's library of essential movies."	5.0	"Blu-ray Review: ""Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition"""	2012-11-14	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2UR7P7T76G6ZI	Evan Waters	First off, I'm surprised to see so many people arguing for the Theatrical Cut. The idea of narration to make the story clearer (it can be a bit overwhelming at first, due to the visual spectacle) is superb on paper, but in practice it really doesn't illuminate much, and Ford's deliberately-flat delivery of the lines hurts the product as well. The &quot;happy&quot; ending is a cop-out, featuring an upbeat twist with no precedent in the film, and being much too sappy given what we've seen before. I'd be fine with the theatrical cut being available (after all, the BRAZIL deluxe box set includes the &quot;Love Conquers All&quot; cut), but it's in no way superior to Scott's true vision.Okay- the movie itself is one of the great science fiction films, with an astoundingly atmospheric portrayal of a run-down L.A. of the future- the Art Direction and visual effects are superb. However, there's substance to go with the style- like Philip K. Dick's original novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP (quite different from this film version, highly recommended in itself), it's a story about what it means to be human. Are the &quot;real&quot; humans in this movie really any better than the Replicants? Do they have the right to exterminate their own creations? And which is which anyway? Another highlight is Rutger Hauer's astounding performance as Roy Batty, alternately passionate, crazed and sympathetic. It's a shame his career hasn't gone better.The flick has a lot to recommend it, but unfortunately the DVD seems to have been produced when Warner Bros. was just getting the hang of this newfangled technology. Picture and sound quality are adequate, enough to show off an already great-looking movie, but there are no special features of note- not even a trailer! The greatest flaw on this DVD is that the &quot;Jump to a Scene&quot; feature doesn't even cover all the chapter stops in the movie- if you want to get to, say, chapter 6 or chapter 12, you're going to have to crack open the manual that came with your DVD player. I suppose I wouldn't have a problem with all this if the disc weren't so expensive, as Warner Bros., if nothing else, is usually pretty reasonable on pricing. I can name several DVDs released by the company which are better-presented and cost less- heck, just do a search and you'll find them.Fortunately, BLADE RUNNER is a good enough movie that it's worth the purchase price- if you've got a DVD collection, you should probably consider adding this. However, it's a shame that WB didn't wait just a tad longer to give this a better treatment. I have a feeling that some time from now, we're all gonna have to buy this movie again...	4.0	Great movie, so-so DVD.	2001-08-03	5	3	2

But I have watched the Director's Cut and it was amazing. Picture and sound were incredible on my DLP and 7.1 Surround Sound system. This will be a perfect snow bound day way to spend the time.

None of the movie versions or extras have been improved in any way (it was rumored that ""Dangerous Days"" would be upgraded to 1080p for this release - not true, it's still 480p).No content was dropped, which is a good thing (I'm always mystified when a new release comes out with less content, especially when what was dropped was of value).  All commentaries, featurettes, etc. remain.New to this package are about 1,000 still photos.The artwork has changed dramatically.

It is not that the narration is crucial to understanding the movie, but it gives the movie a Sam Spade quality; Mickey Spillane meets the the 22nd Century.  I very much like the deadpan delivery of the narration...very matter of fact.  The narration adds texture to the film that the director's cut sorely lacks.  I, in fact, am writing this following a search for the theatrical release on DVD.  Though the video and sound are so much better on the DVD, I find myself watching an old video tape version because I want the lead character narration.  More IS sometimes better.

"This review is for the 3-disc Blu-Ray 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition version.I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attacked ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate. All those... moments... will be lost in time, like [cough] tears... in... rain. Unless, of course, I buy the DVD, in which case I can relive those moments. Again and  [cough] again.Although deciding *which* moment to relive might be a problem. You see, there are at least seven versions of the Truth that I know of. While makes Blade Runner a transdimensional entity spanning a multitude of alternate universes, much like Khan Noonien Singh, since there is no way that Benedict Cumberbatch could sell a car in this timeline, even if it featured the thickly-cushioned luxury of seats made of fine Corinthian leather... but I... [cough] digress...As I was saying, there is the International Cut (also known as Criterion Edition) from 1982, which was more violent than than the US theatrical release (What? Pris holds Deckard up by his *nostrils*? I've heard the expression ""to get your nose out of joint"" but this appears to be a very literary interpretation of the idiom). This version was released on VHS and on laserdisc (as the Criterion Collection). Second, there is the US theatrical version, also known as Original Version or the domestic cut, where Batty did *not* gouge Tyrells eyeballs out in an orgy of blood (as he did in the International version). There is also the workprint version which was shown only to a few folks as a preview, but which  was callously distributed in 1991 as the ""Director's Cut"" even though Ridley Scott did not  authorize it in any way. Then there is the 'official' Director's Cut, which *was* blessed by Ridley Scott, and released in 1992. Also Ridley Scott's Final Cut, was released in theaters and on DVD in 2007. And let's not forget the so-called ""San Diego sneak peek cut"", which was only shown once in 1982. And of course the various broadcast versions, which were edited predominantly to meet TV broadcast standards (so in many of these versions Deckard never asks asks Rachael about reading a magazine, and we never see her response, when she wants to know if Deckard is testing whether she is a replicant or a ... [cough]...)So know the contents of the version you buy. The 3-disc Blu-Ray version includes the Final Cut (disc 1) US theatrical release, the International version, the 1992 directors cut (disc 2), and the rare Workprint release, a documentary (""Dangerous Days"") and a lot of cool stills from the movie (disc 3). It also includes pages sandwiched into the DVD case with some interesting artwork and photos.And now you must excuse me.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1WUGLK5OIZVIZ	"""filmbuff2000"""	Top-notch action packed sci-fi by the same director that made `Aliens'.  `Blade Runner' is one of those rare films that mixes thought provoking  science fiction with a `film noir' edge. Along with `Brazil', the most  stunning, original and most probable vision of an apocalyptic future. The  film is intoxicatingly heavy on atmosphere. Amazing special effects bring  to life an apocalyptic neon-drenched futuristic Los Angeles. Filled with a  unique brooding `noir' atmosphere, a rare thing in sci/fi films. Even the  memorable score is contemporarily jazzy. Harrison Ford had just become a  star with `The Empire Strikes Back' and `The Raiders Of The Lost Ark', just  two and one year earlier respectively. This was a brilliant career move but  unlike those two past films, the role of Deckard was no star-making  machine. Ford's brooding presence really helps and he makes for a  compelling and memorable Deckard. As with almost all great `noir', the film  has a private-eye/murder-mystery plot involving mutinying `replicants' on  earth who must be eliminated by the best of the `Blade Runners' that  happens to be Ford. Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah are great as two of the  replicants. Based on the thought-provoking Philip K. Dick story `Do  Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The action-packed ending is a  knock-out, this is really intense action not just `cops and robbers' or  `good guys vs. bad guys' action this is real adrenaline pumping stuff. You  really start to fear for Deckard and Rutger Hauer really seems like an  indestructible superhuman force. This is what I most look up to when I see  the film, I just think the ending is expertly shot and edited for maximum  impact. The director's cut was released in 1993, making for a much better,  adding a little more character development and a more dark and unsettling  ending and eliminating Ford's tedious voice-over narration. This more  unsettling ending loosely implies that Deckard himself may be a replicant  hits you out of nowhere and leaves a memorable impact and one that you will  think off for at least weeks to come. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film  a 9!	5.0	Excellent Science Fiction, Action-Packed and Thought Provoki	2000-09-07	4	3	1

The disc box could not be closed properly because some parts of it were damaged and the actual box had tears on the corner.But besides that, the movies were great. The discs were in great condition.

The lighting and set design were meant to evoke '40s Film Noir but now remind me of an over-produced MTV video. The acting is of the less-will-seem-like-more-when-it-really-isn't school that Robert DeNiro inspired.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1QWM4UO2IIDBC	Forrest Mcclain	"Now I'm not going to lie... this is one of the cooler DVD packages out there today! The set contains five DVDs, (one more than the regular special edition) production designs and production stills, a movement cell, a ""Spinner"" replica, and an origami unicorn replica. Everything is topped off with a signed plastic letter by the director, Ridley Scott. On top of that, there are only a limited supply of suit cases (designed after Harrison Ford's in the film) and each one has it's own identification number on the bottom, unique to each case.Seem like overkill?Well, let's talk a little bit about the film itself. The story revolves around a special policeman/bounty hunter (Blade Runner Unit), who has been assigned to eliminate 4 murderous androids who have made it back to earth from an off-world colony. The androids, known as replicants, have only a certain amount of time to live; for their specific model 4 years. However, as we progress through the story, we begin to see the desperate goal of the replicants: to obtain more life. The plot writhes around different concepts of what make us human, and of course, what doesn't.The original release of the film contained a narration that many believe to have been a bad choice. The ending is happier, and the scenes are shortened.The directors cut, released some time later, contained a different (better) ending, no narration, and lengthened scenes.The final cut, released this year, takes the directors cut, and makes it the definitive vision of Ridley Scott. For those worried that it will be too much, don't worry. It's not a whole lot different, however, it has some extending scenes that are worth seeing. Be warned however, this version is rather gruesome.Overall, this package is remarkable. For the price you will pay, it is more than worth it. It even includes the extremely rare rough cut of the film, and a never-before seen documentary and deleted or alternate scenes.

My only hope of buying a DVD of this movie is if they bring out an Ultimate Edition that includes both versions... Until the Ultimate Edition is released, I'll hold on tight to my VHS copy of the original.  There is hope that this may happen since Ridley Scott's Legend Ultimate Edition has been released.  This disk includes both the original release and a director's cut.  This would make sense for the studio since those people that bought the stripped-down sterile director's cut would also buy the new disk...

I left the final cut version the last to view and I spaced my viewings of each version starting with the workprint over a period of days so as let each version sink in and for me at least the Final Cut is indeed the best version although I thought the voice over version also has its good points.I only wish more blu-ray releases could be like this.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved especially where the final cut is concerned and I like the way they managed to package all 5 discs in a very nice and compact manner taking up less space on my shelf which I truly appreciate.  The bonus feature documentaries are also very good and so is the nifty colour booklet.  As a big fan of the old noir films likeThe Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray] I couldn't help but like this sci-fi noir which has been imitated e.g.I, Robot [Blu-ray] but never really improved upon although kudos should go to the film that helped inspire the setting i.e.The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray] (check out the buildings and you'll see what I mean).This is certainly among the best blu-ray releases that I have in my video library; great content, great picture and sound quality and excellent compact packaging makes this an easy review.Very highly recommended!	5.0	The Definitive Collection for the Diehard Fan Now In Blu-ray!	2012-01-03	3	2	1

From the pictures of the product I was imagining the packaging as oversized and the book being much larger, it's not... it's the same dimensions of the Blu-ray case etc. It's tiny and so is the little spinner toy car, the lenticular collectible is nice. Overall it's a decent set of merchandise if you don't already own the previous Blu-ray release. I already own the other basic set so this turns out to be a waste. I honestly thought the art book would be more substantial than it turned out to be. If I hadn't opened it in a blind rush to check it all out, i'd probably return it.	3.0	Great IF	2012-10-26	13	11	2

The visuals are stunning for the time, and the overall picture of the movie conveys is amazing. As for the comments that have been made about the directors cut, I prefer it to the original. Just taking out the voice over opens up the movie to a more 'spacey' feel. The last thing I want to have to do when I see a movie is have half the plot shoved right in my face, I would rather figure things out myself. The dvd could have been much much better. The picture quality is decent, but very lacking. No special features. I'm hoping for a re-release sometime in the near future.

Everything about it, from its exceptional music and script to its brilliant direction; oozes with substance and style.The screenplay, by Hampton Fancher and Philip K. Dick, is intelligently written and has a good mix of drama, action, and science fiction. The dialogue is smart, philosophical, and meaningful.The cast does a fine job at bringing voice to the script. Harrison Ford delivers a fine performance as the troubled Blade Runner, Rick Deckard. Rutger Hauer gives the best performance of the film, though. Hauer plays the replicant, Roy Batty, whom is searching for a way to prolong his life. He delivers his lines with cold-menace and a sorrowful undertone. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah also give noteworthy performances.Ridley Scott is in top form here. As in Alien, he shows us that he has a very fine eye for details. His vision of Los Angeles in 2019 is frightening gritty and dark.Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography is extraordinary. His use of lighting is quite effective and intriguing.Vangelis's jazzy blues music suits the images on screen nicely and adds a lot of soul to the film.The legendary, gothic, and often imitated set design of Blade Runner is incredible and helps in creating a sense of doom and in bringing Ridley Scott's vision to life.Like so many films that have now attained classic status, Blade Runner was panned by both critics and audiences upon its release. I suppose people just weren't ready to see Harrison Ford in a film-noir and to see a science fiction film with this much power and grit. Blade Runner is, in my opinion, the finest science fiction films ever made.	5.0	A Smart And Stylish Science Fiction Movie.	2000-12-09	4	4	0

Its greatness is evident by the number of new releases who continue to borrow visually from Blade Runner (A.I. and Dark City are prime examples). It is a shame Ridley Scott didn't devote more time to the sci-fi genre, instead of giving us ""classics"" such as White Squall, GI Jane and Hannibal. That aside I must agree with some of the other reviewers. I too enjoy the director's cut more, but would've liked to have seen both versions available. Each version has its own admirable qualities, but I think the narrated original is better for the casual viewer. I tend to straddle the fence of movie snob and ""Joe Popcorn"" and would like to have the option of watching either version as my mood dictates. And in all honesty, the narrated version is probably the only one I could get my girlfriend to watch."	5.0	Old vs. New	2003-02-10	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	I have never seen the original theatrical cut.  I notice some reviewers complain the director's cut is confusing; although I had issues with the script, I did not find the film confusing per se.To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.  The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay.  Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir.  The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.The cast--including Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, and Rutger Hauer--gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone.  But the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and &quot;retiring&quot; (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth.  Although I greatly admire the film's decidedly &quot;open-ended&quot; conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.  We are persistently asked to ask believe that Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponet more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.  In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance.  It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.The DVD offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats.  The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film.  The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional.  Aside from the choice of formats and brief biographies of the principal players, there are no extras of any kind.	4.0	A Triumph of Style Over Substance	2002-01-07	12	9	3

I agree without the narration it makes the directors cut pretty much a whole new movie, but to me, a movie very much lacking in depth.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1ZHR9MG8IOXI0	G. Couet	First off, I must admit that the first contact I had with the 'Blade Runner' universe was with the book. It is a good but short and to the point novel, in the likes of Bradbury's 'FARENHEIT 451'.The movie was more of an adaptation, but it was achieved with so much skill that when I saw the movie for the first time (I was alone, in my darkened living room), I had to watch it a second time right away. This is one of the most artisticly genuine movie ever. I have seen it again and again, but there was always something wrong: the dialogue is scarse. when I learned that the narration was cut out in the Director's cut, I started looking for the original version. It is nowhere to be found.All the collector sets, special editions, and other re-editions are lacking the original version. Why it is not released, I don't know; but I'm sure a great lot of folks are waiting for this event!I'll never buy a Blade Runner DVD without the original version, even if I think the 'Director's Cut' is still in my top 3 movies of all times, with 'The Big Blue' and 'Run Lola Run'.My opinion: if you are already addicted, you probably are waiting like me for a re-edition. If you have yet to see the movie, buy it and you won't be disappointed.	2.0	I always wondered if I was the only one...	2003-02-04	5	4	1

Not much was changed from the  original to this version- the narration was cut, a two second vision was  added, and the ending was cut down a little bit. While I felt that the  narration was very important to the movie, the lack of narration REALLY  makes the roof scene at the climax of the movie MUCH more powerful. If have  not seen the movie then you are in for a treat of some of the best writing  in any movie to date and acting to match, I would recommend this movie to  everyone. The violence is not to intense and the nudity is very brief and  not sexual (you see someone changing her shirt).

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	Much has been made of the DVD version of this film, and it does leave a lot to be desired.  No extras, lousy sound, transfer that looks only marginally better than the tape etc.  But, get over it.  Someday we'll get a nice one, and as of right now you can get this version for next to nothing, so you won't loose much of anything in the long run.`Blade Runner' is just about the ultimate example of the cult film.  Much maligned on release both critically and popularly, it now has a massive cult following and is seen in a much better light from a critical standpoint. (Much like the also brilliant and innovative `The Thing' of the same year.)  Why it took so long to be appreciated I can't say, particualrly since a large part of its genius lies in the groundbreaking visuals, which while extremely impressive today, should have been completely astounding initially.  But, there's more to it then that, as the film has intriguing ideas, mostly courtesy of Phil Dick, and an stunning, compelling climax followed by a moving a truly denoumont.  Unquestionably one of my 10 favorite movies.Loosely based on the novel `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K. Dick, `Blade Runner' is the story of Rick Deckard, a blade runner, meaning a policeman whose duty is to `retire' replicants, who are organic, artificially engineered androids used for slave labor.  He's retired, but is forced back into duty as there is a new case which no one else but him can handle: 4 replicants escaped from the colonies and have returned to earth, seemingly to infiltrate the Tyrell corporation.  (the company responsible for their production)  While searching for them, Deckard finds some important discoveries regarding replicants: First, that they have a mere 4 year lifespan, which explains why they've returned, and second, that they now sometimes implant memories into them so that they function better.  Thus, they don't know if they're replicant, thus anyone *could* be one.`Blade Runner' is, of course, the seminal `tech-noir' film, cleanly combining an over-populated, over-industrialized, dystopian future with characters and conventions of the noir film and hard-boiled detective novel, complete with a synthesized, future-sleaze soundtrack.  Deckard is a classic noir protagonist, reminiscent of Spade or Marlow.  Not actively malevolent, but far from conventionally moral and distinctly alone.  He's not an incredibly sympathetic character, but for the purposes of the film he needn't, and really shouldn't be.  Some have complained about Ford's acting, but I think he's pefectly fine, as is everyone else in the film.  The real standout is, of course, Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicant group, a powerful, charismatic adonis of man.  This is one of those performances where it is really difficult to conceive of anyone doing it better then he does.  This is a film of complex morals, as pretty much everyone is at least somewhat sympathetic, and no one is obviously right.  Yes, the replicants kill, but they are, for all intents and purposes, human.  Certainly, few would condemn humans for fighting in order to escape enslavement, and we could at least somewhat sympathize with their killing simply in the hopes of gaining more life, especially considering they've only lived for a few years, and have been enslaved for most of that time.  But, the real humans are sympathetic too, as the replicants kill both the wicked and the innocent, and Deckard himself is clearly back against the wall, as he is flatly, if vaguely threatened when he initially refuses the assignment.`Blade Runner' was and is a miracle of traditional special effects and set design.  I am not inherently opposed to CG, but I think that you should ALWAYS use conventional effects whenever they can do it well.  And here, Scott and company have made a world as complete and real and alive as any you'll ever see.  Visually, `Blade Runner' set the standard for the futuristic dystopia, with endless urban sprawl, impossibly large building and the continous neon glow and flashing lights, mysterious explosions and the perpuetual twilight and rain.  Some modern audienes may be less impressed as they've seen other stuff like this, but they shouldn't be, because this is original, and it's still the best.The visual power of the film goes beyond the design and into the direction.  This is a very slow-moving, but truly poetic film, with beautiful shot composition and long periods of time with no dialogue.  Make no mistake, this is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination.  It's an arty film, no doubt about it, and a somewhat complex one, but not selfconciously or needlessly so.Though I don't dare go into specifics, the final confrontation between  Deckard and Roy is fantastic.  It's a truly eerie, otherwordly experience, with some truly fantastic lighting and set-design.  And, like I said before, I think the ending is very powerful.  Nowadays, theDirector's Cut is the only version of the film readily available, and while most people feel strongly one way or the other, I don't care that much.  Yeah, the DC is better, but the changes are sufficiently minimal that it doesn't matter too much.  Yeah, the tacked on happy ending of the TC was lame, but I didn't think it really hurt it that much, and I don't really care too much for the idea that Deckard may be a replicant.  I saw the TC first, and didn't mind the voice overs at all, but seeing the DC made me realize that it's better without it.  The voice- overs kinda take away from the atmosphere and sorta poetic feel of the film, I think.  Still, the film would probably be pretty confusing without them if you didn't really know anything about the movie.  But, if you can get it all together, it definitely works better without them.As I say a lot, you just have to see it.  If you don't like it that much the first time I strongly urge you to watch it again, as sometimes it takes a while to really take it all in and get into it.  I also recommend Dick's original novel.  They're way different, but each is brilliant in its own right.	5.0	Total Classic	2005-04-16	17	15	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2DVBW9N2N3EXP	George Penston	"This film has captivated me since I first watched it on VHS years ago. Since then I went to the theaters and saw it on the big screen when the director's cut was released. Ridley Scott is truly an amazing director in every sense. This film plays with your emotions, the imagery spellbinding, and the soundtrack transcends and compliments perfectly the cinematography. I think you either can appreciate this for an incredible work of art in many respects or it's lost on you. So be it.I can understand how many people find the film confusing and the pacing rather stifling. It's a slow moving, rather heady movie. But I think what makes people think this way is that they're used to sci-fi being action-packed and not too much to think about. Both of these established trends in sci-fi movies run counter to Blade Runner.On to the HD version. Well, I can tell you that this DVD set is what pushed me over into buying into the HD format wars. I think the HD format wars are incredibly stupid and I can't believe this sort of thing is allowed to go on in the world still. Decided and standard media and content formats makes total sense. And having two HD formats to confuse and split the HD market doesn't really help make HD mainstream. I really wish some consumer group would step in and say we only get one. Can you imagine if we had two CD formats to deal with? I know competition is good but when it comes to standard media and content formats, it often becomes a setback to me.  With all that being said, I now own a HD TV and really want to take advantage of it.So I opted for the HD-DVD format since players still tend to be cheaper and the 10 DVD was too much for me to pass up. Plus I just went through a horrible year with Sony and their incredibly awful customer support that I've sworn off Sony products in our house. It's funny since from what I read HD-DVD usually offers more features than their Blue-Ray versions. Reminds me how Betamax was truly superior but that didn't matter in the long run, did it? Sure, one of these HD formats will become the Betamax of this decade but I didn't want to hold out any longer. I don't plan on buying too many DVDs but rather rent them from Netflix when I want to see a movie in HD.Now on to the DVD set itself. The Final Cut is well done and the HD transfer is incredible. When the opening scene shows up on your HD set, it's really one of those ""Wow"" moments. The Final Cut definitely feels the tightest of the versions, clocking in just shy of 2 hours. But I think I miss some of the scenes I'm used to seeing in the Director's Cut. But that's okay since this collection has every version for your viewing pleasure. As another reviewer mentions, the Dangerous Days feature is enough to make this collection worthwhile. It's an amazing documentary for anyone the least bit interested in what went into making this landmark film.So for any Blade Runner fan, this is an obvious must-have. If you've appreciated the film in the past, you'll fall in love with it all over again watching it in this collection. If you like Blade Runner but not a huge fan, I would suggest getting just the 2 disc version since it has The Final Cut and Dangerous Days. The two best parts of this collection that I can say so far. I haven't had a chance to dig into the fourth disc with all the extras and deleted scenes, but I'm guessing this is hard-core fan material anyways."	5.0	One of my all time favorite films	2007-12-30	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3SQS455KJMOBP	George Riner	Ok, first off - I think after seeing this, that it's still up in the air whether or not Deckard is a replicant or not.

I can say without reservation that this DVD really delivers the goods and is a vast improvement over the previous directer's cut in every way. When the opening scene of the hellish L.A. landscape opens to Vangelis's magnificent score re-mastered in rich 5.1 surround I knew they had finally done it right this time and I thank all of those people involved in the making of this DVD. The crisp rich picture and the extras on disc two, which run the length of a regular film, make this a more than worthwhile investment for fans of this incredible film masterpiece.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2008-01-04	3	3	0

I think it's a contender for the most positively and thoroughly discussed film in the history of cinema. At one time it was probably Star Wars, but mostly negativity surrounds that now. It's a safe bet to say that this is the best film Ridely Scott ever committed to celluloid, with Alien following a close second. It's dark and brooding but yet touching. It's a really human story. And as far as I'm concerned, I am not swayed in one direction or the other on whether or not Deckard is a replicant or not. I find the question and the discussion about it infinitely more interesting than settling on a final answer. The film is so widely open to intrepetation that it's not much fun to form an opinion on the matter. Despite that, I believe that this is Ridley's masterpiece. I prefer both the Final Cut and the Original Theatrical Cut (depending on my mood), but no matter which version I see I will always marvel at the magnificent scope of the visuals and the touching underlying human themes within the story.	5.0	Best Sci Fi film ever	2011-07-30	3	3	0

Dick's wonderful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the novel upon which it was based, more or less totally  ruined it for me.  Virtually all of the rich layers of reality, religious  allegory, and *many* significant plot points were completely absent from  the film.  One of the main characters, Jack Isidore, was entirely  eliminated, and the shared messianic experiences and electronic animals  were also gone.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2W3QN3Q2BGFSG	G.F. Snell III	"Back in December, we listed our ""8 Coolest Sci-Fi Flicks"" and got some heat for not including ""Blade Runner"" (1982) on the list. We remembered Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's science fiction classic ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" as being a disappointment - as well as a bit heavy-handed.We recently revisited ""Blade Runner"" to see if the sands of time had softened our opinion of the movie. But we also wanted to see if Scott's director's cut version of the film would improve it.It did, but our opinion of ""Blade Runner"" remains mediocre.We agree with film critic Roger Ebert: ""Watching the director's cut (of ""Blade Runner""), I am left with the same overall opinion of the movie: It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story.""Ebert gets this one right. ""Blade Runner"" is slick on production. The special effects are so impressive that Scott lets them take over parts of the movie as he pans the camera back to take in breathless shots of his futuristic version of Los Angeles. The movie, at times, is in awe of itself.We'll give Scott credit here. He does a magnificent job in crafting his world. It's a bleak one, but it resonates as realistic: the driving, black rains, the pollution-scarred skies, the blinking, moving billboards, the strange fashions, and the crowds of vampire like citizens.But this is all background.The rest of the movie doesn't live up to the set. The plot is achingly mediocre and stolen from half-a-dozen film noir movies. It relies on characters hand-picked from central castings old stereotypes closet.The usually dynamic Harrison Ford is wasted here. Ford sleepwalks through the role of a world-weary police officer who quits to crawl inside a whiskey bottle. But predictably his crusty, insensitive boss calls him back for one last job. Then there is Sean Young as the femme fatale - smoking cigarettes and looking both confused and earnest at the same time.Ford plays Deckard -- a blade runner (a police officer assigned to hunt down and kill ""replicants"" also known as cyborgs). The replicants are illegal on earth and only used on other planets for jobs too dangerous for real human beings. It's never explained why the replicants are not allowed on earth (can't we all just get along?).The movie carefully avoids another major problem: if they are illegal on earth then why are the replicants designed to look exactly like human beings? They are also designed to look differently from each other - no two are alike. In fact, the only way to tell a replicant from a real human being is to take a complicated oral exam which takes about 45 minutes to an hour to administer.Wouldn't it be easier to design the replicants with blue skin, for example? Or make them all look exactly alike? That way they couldn't escape and hide among the population of real humans. Seems like an easy fix especially since the replicants have become such a dangerous nuisance that it's necessary to create the job of blade runner to hunt down and kill them.But then, of course, we wouldn't have a movie.Another problem with the replicants is that they only last four years -but no one - not the replicants or their creators - seems to readily know the expiration dates. Given that the replicants are used for dangerous off-world work wouldn't it be prudent to know when they ""die""? After all wouldn't it be a disaster to send replicants on a mission and have them start expiring halfway through?Deckard is assigned to kill four replicants that murdered a shuttle full of people and now are hiding out in LA. His investigation is riddled with holes and convenient consequences that only happen in movie scripts (he finds a tiny snake scale in the bathroom tub of an old haunt which lead him, of course, to a stripper who uses a snake in her act. She happens to be one of the replicants). He even calls them at their secret hideout and... they answer the phone.We were also amazed at how Deckard never ever calls for back-up - even when he finally locates the replicants' hide-out and knows he will be up against two super powerful androids that have already murdered more than 20 people.""Blade Runner"" wants to be a film about the definition of humanity - an action flick with a philosophy. But it fails in both aspects. It spends too little time exploring the idea of manufactured life being real life because the characters don't really care about the answer. And the action sequences aren't even as good as the average fare on TV.Want more ""Literate Blather?""

I am an avid moviephile and already had many, many DVDs in my library.  So it was with great reluctance that I bought my BlyRay player.  I bought about 20 DVDs right off the bat, most of them being the ones that were supposed to make the most of the format, including Fifth Element, 300, Planet Earth series, and the Pirates/Carribean series.  Now these movies did look and sound great, but I didn't think they warranted the huge upgrade in price.  Thankfully, Close Encounters came out and was SUPERB!  That was my fave until now.Blade Runner is the BEST BluRay transfer I have seen to date.  And by a huge margin.  In the first 10 minutes when you see that dark cityscape you'll be in awe.  When Batty and Sebastian cruise up to the pyramid, the detail of the pyramid is breath taking.As for the content, note that only the movie in all it's versions are bluray.  The discs with the extra content are NOT bluray even though they are included in the bluray set.  Not that they really need to be.The story of the FInal Cut?  Brilliant. I loved Blade Runner and at 39 was a product of the 80's.  I used my swingset for the Millenium Falcon.  I was immersed in the Sci Fi of the day.  Even at that young age I love Blade Runned.  But this new ""Final Cut"" version really isn't just another rehash.  It's far more mature and more dark than it's original release.  Most notable is the absence of Deckard's constant inner monolgue/narration of the film.  No ""driving into the sunset"" happy ending.So in conclusion, if you want a bluray disc that will really show off your system and amaze your friends, then Blade Runner is it.  If you're an avid fan of them film for years and are wondering if it's worth buying...yet again, then it most certainly is.  The quality is worth it alone, but the recut is actually very lovingly done.  All in all a true masterpeice of BluRay and it has raised the bar for what older movies can look like if they spend the time/money on them to make them look great.I can't recommend this particular title strong enough."	5.0	BluRay Hi Def at it's most amazing!

If you look at the technical section you'll find that although encoded for Dolby digital the audio is still only the original 2 channel stereo and only contains left-right tracks. This movie cries out for an audio remastering to at least 5.1 discreet. I can't vouch for the supposed transfer improvement since I already on the previous director's cut and don't need another one. If this is released in HD (whatever the format) without the addition of an audio remix it would be a travesty. And if anyone involved with the movie ever reads this stuff (doubtful)... When the audio does get remix please no hack jobs. Upgrading to 5.1 is great only if the time is taken and the money spent to do it right.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1T63SBKYTDAFP	G. Lindsay	The original theater version of this sci-fi masterpiece is, without doubt, one of the best in the genre.  The director's cut is only a tribute to the (understandable) ego of Ridley Scott.  A novice viewer of the latter can only wonder about what the heck is going on.  I agree with the comments of another reviewer that the death scene of Rutger Hauer is irreparably damaged by the missing voice-over.  This drama definitely needs the aspect of humanity provided by Harrison Ford's narration; it is far too dark and brooding otherwise.  His narrating words in the ending scene, with Ford driving to safety, provide emotional closure:  no one knows how much time they have [so enjoy every moment].  I felt so strongly about all this that I went out and bought a used copy of this movie for 80 bucks on EBay.The DVD medium allows viewers to watch the version of their preference.  Why not let them choose whether or not to have the voice-over?  It would clearly sell some more DVDs.P.S.:  I have always wondered why I have never seen anyone comment on one (irrelevant) flaw in the script:  try matching the number of fleeing replicants accounted for in the movie (5) with the number that originally fled the off-world colony (6, according to the skin-job hater).  Yeah, yeah, one more showed up later, but she wasn't from off-world.  There's still one more replicant running around somewhere.  DECKER, COME BACK!	1.0	Let the People Choose	2002-04-29	8	6	2

One that made you use your brain. Although the gimmick is nice and you get all 5 versions including the work print, I was slightly disappointed at Mr. Scott's commentary. No real discussion about the movie and why he did this or that or why this was symbolic of this or that. Just a regurgitation of what was in the supplementary documentaries. I got more from Rutger's insight about the film or from the actors/writers than I did the director. Too bad he didn't take the time to really give us a sense on why he did what he did. Then the set would be really complete. But you do learn quite a lot from the supplementary material to keep this a definitive collectors set.	4.0	Blade Runner: The Gimmick	2008-01-27	3	2	1

Nguyen	I recently purchased the bluray 5 disc collector's edition, and after watching it, it's a must buy for anyone who enjoyed it in theaters. First disc is the director's final cut, which is my favorite, the plot, the ending, everything is more believable. Disc, 2 and 4 are dual layer dvds, the extra stuff, creation of blade runner, etc. Disc 3 has all 3 versions on it. So those who like the voice overs can enjoy them. Disc 5 is the workprint version. Subtlety changes, longer action scenes. The visuals on this movie is great, they did a great job restoring it. Highly recommended.	5.0	Just fabulous	2008-04-17	1	0	1

Since then i watched it like 6 or 7 times and i was thrilled by it every time. When i realized that collectors edition will be available on Amazon i preordered it immediately. What i noticed right away when film started is that movie has grain which gives additional flare to the legendary movie. I could probably write for hours about it but right now i can't so i'll leave it as it is.

The Directors cut seems like a hoax, long periods of silence that seem shot for narration. I'd buy the Original theater release in a heartbeat (meanwhile  I'll treasure my old and aging VHS of the original). This movie has been  mired in egotistical controversy since it's original release. The original  soundtrack was never released and Vangelis' recent soundtrack release was  coifed to his preferences. Get the egos out of the way! Fans have always  wanted the original flick and the original soundtrack...and have been left  waving our dollars in the air for the taking. I was stunned the DVD version  did not allow for the original cut.The egos must be stopped -  Bladerunner is one of the five best Sci-fi flicks. How it ever lost a Best  Original Costume Design oscar to Ghandi (ha) I'll never know.I own the  current Directors-Cut DVD, both non-original &quot;soundtracks&quot; and  the original on VHS.	4.0	Where's the original Bladerunner?	1999-12-14	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A26TY6GCGBF5HT	Graves	"Re-released this is one of Harrison Ford's best works. Based on Philip K Dick's short story ""Do Androids Dream of Electonic Sheep,"" Harrison plays a detective who's job is to hunt down replicants, life like androids who are used as slave labor off world but are banned on earth because of their tendency towards violence.The problem is although better, stronger, faster than humans, Replicants can pass for human. ""Retiring"" one, as it is euphemistically called seems more like a murder than turning off a dangerous machine and Harrison's character is burned out from being a 'killer.'  It doesn't help when corporate secretary Sean Young snidly asks ""Have you ever retired a human by mistake?""More than a sci fi adventure Blade Runner questions what makes a person a person. Is it just biology or are dreams and hope the difference? rutger Hauer as the leader of the replicants gives a silioquie about his life that transforms his character from a savage killer to someone worthy of compassion. These are issues later touched by Brent Spiner's Data in Star Trek and Grace Park's Sharon V on Battlestar Gallactica, but here they appear at their eloquent best.In style, Blade Runner combines film noir and science fiction in a form that was unheard of then and now forms its own genre, cyber punk. There are lots of imitators, but Harrison Ford does it best and first. The others can just follow in his wake."	5.0	cyberpunk comes to the screen	2007-11-21	10	8	2

This is one of those &#34;Prometheius&#34; type films which provokes basic questions about humanity and all those basic &#34;why&#34; questions.On top of the wonderful, foundation of a great and deep story, I had a lot of fun seeing the future that the 80's mentality projected.

I love the sort of cyberpunk, grungy take on the future that Blade Runner portrays, I loved Vangelis's soundtrack, and I loved the imperfect characters. I'm also a big fan of Ridley Scott especially when he gets to play around with lighting.This final cut (different from the &#34;director's cut&#34; which wasn't really a director's cut but...well...it's complicated) is likely the closest you'll get to what Ridley Scott wanted...sorta.Long story short, Blade Runner had a rough ride and this end result is what happens when Mr. Scott finally had some time (and was allowed to) recut the film. It means they cleaned up the mess that was introduced by others after Mr. Scott was fired from the film in post-production and builds upon some of the fixes that went into the director's cut (thank you for no voice-overs...we've got brains, we can figure it out). Granted some of those fixes were in the Director's Cut (the voice overs), but this Final Cut includes a laundry list of fixes to the print including some notables like having Joanna Cassidy actually look like Joanna Cassidy in all her scenes.All in all, I really love what they did. It's cleaner and better. I don't agree with everything that was done but I'm not the director. If you haven't seen the movie, this is the version to see. If you have but haven't seen this cut, this is the version to see. If you have no idea what Blade Runner is and want to see a gritty Sci-Fi movie about what LA will look like in 5 years as envisioned 32 years ago, this is the version to see.And, if you watch it and still feel the need to ask the question about Deckard that most people ask by the end of the movie, well, then Mr. Scott did his job.	5.0	Best cut of the film	2014-07-01	0	0	0

Ridley Scott is one of my all-time favorite directors and I consider Blade Runner to be his masterpiece.  Sci fi without all the lasers, space battles and explosions of other movies, this is a very reflective look at the human condition and thirst for life set against a dark future.  The opening prologue refers to the year as 2019 but it would make a bit more sense if it read 2119, given that we don't have flying cars and are years or decades away from creating artificial lifeforms like the replicants.

I switched to a full Sony ""Blu-ray"" setup a year ago. I have three previous copies of this movie in various packages. I place this movie in my personal top ten list. This Blu-ray 5 disc collectors addition is a rather poor repackage that obviously had the minimum of effort put into it. Disc one is extremely poor rendition with very low quality color and green bands running through it on both the top and bottom. The ""Directors Cut"" is a copy of the standard definition print of a copy already in electronic archive. Color intensity in this copy is wanting but not as poor as the ""Final Cut"". I was hoping this would rise above but there was no effort to reproduce a high quality product. The standard def 5 disc set is much better quality. My guess is the Studio no longer has access to a high quality ""master"".

Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty was a completely deviant man and awesome actor in this movie.  Harrison Ford's character Rick Deckard, plays a good foil for Hauer's Roy Batty.  Hauer's character's obvious love for the Pris (Darryl Hannah) character is as evident as Deckard's mixed emotions for Rachael (Sean Young).Graphically, this was an over the top movie.

The fact that the DVD pack came with the documentary was gravy, but definitely a plus. Now I realize that I was getting the DVD for a good price and that corners might be cut somewhere, however it was somewhat telling that when I first opened the plastic case housing the discs, the actual plastic DVD case tore as if it were paper! No big deal, it's just a case, right? So I was able to watch the movie and loved it. However, the second DVD (the one with the documentary) would not play. After examining it, it definitely appears to be faulty as the physical DVD appears cloudy. I tried the disc in multiple players without luck.While I am still happy to own the movie, I would be hesitant to order from the same supplier a second time not knowing where they source their movies.	2.0	Motion Picture is great; the DVD was faulty	2011-08-25	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AYTV6G5C7D0AI	"""hawk1138"""	Before director's cuts became a mainstream phenomenon and every other movie being released starting carrying that label for leaving in five extra seconds of unneeded footage, Blade Runner was rereleased as Ridley Scott's original and far superiour vision. A cult following bloomed into a not-just-cult following and fans everywhere rejoiced.Blade Runner was filmed in the early eighties, before Return of the Jedi was released, and with effects that play just as well today as they did back in the heyday of the sci-fi special effects revolution. Scott's portrayal of a dark, often-raining, overcrowded LA is a thrill to watch as the scenes, blessedly free from the distracting narrative of the first theater release, pan slowly across the bizarre archetechture of the near future. The storyline is good, and gives the characters time to develop with the help of some brilliant acting, but it's the visual magic that puts Blade Runner in the much-deserved spot of &quot;Best Science Fiction Movie Ever.&quot;This is one movie that should ONLY be seen in it's director's cut. Only then can you truly appreciate the dark hopelessness of the world where synthetic beings are hunted down just for trying to live. It's dirty, it's dark, it's unkind, and it needs to be seen without the studio's unwelcome brightening up and spoonfed explanations. Much better to spend your attention and energy trying to figure out whether or not Decker is a replicant, or if the rogue band of replicants can survive.As has been pointed out, the DVD itself is short on extras. That's unfortunate. But maybe that's because the focus is supposed to be on the movie itself.Some behind-the-scenes stuff or a good interview for the fans would have been nice, though.	4.0	Black science fiction as it should be	2000-12-14	5	4	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A20JXCREBFYS4T	Henry H. S. Yoon	Ridley Scott is a director who, at times, can perfectly create a certain atmosphere he desires for his films, most notably being Alien and Blade Runner.  As he captured the void of space, fear of unknown, deadly creatures within confined space in Alien, he is able to channel some of the best qualities of an usual Philip K. Dick novel- surrealism.Many of Dick's science fictions focus on the grim, dark outlook of the futuristic world he creates, and infuses a sense of other-world into them, which worked well and create a legion of followers, not to mention several films influenced by or adapted directly from his works.In Blade Runner the main conflict is Deckard hunting down the androids, who possess many humane qualities that Deckard feels certain sympathy towards them, or at least thinks twice about the job he's about to do.  At the same time Deckard questions his own identity, and has certain doubts about his own existence of himself being a human, not an android.  The androids he terminates also have strong will towards life, a very human desire.  Top that theme with the dark portrayal of Los Angeles, with brilliant narratives are the reason this film remains as one of the most influential science fiction films of all times, and easily the best adapted work of Dick.  Scott obviously picked up the spine of the original short story, and was able to create the perfect world for the story, and added more character development to be a successful film.	5.0	A science fiction masterpiece	2003-10-19	0	0	0

The theatrical version  represented everything that is bad about Hollywood: studio execs that were  too stupid/pig-headed to trust a brilliant director's judgment; they  assumed that the audience was too stupid to follow the story so they put in  an insipid narration to lead the audience along by the hand, they thought  that the audience would be upset or unable to accept the fact that maybe  Decker was, himself, a replicant so they cut out the unicorn dream and  worst of all they added on an &quot;everyone goes home happy&quot; ending  which virtually ruined the dark theme of the whole movie.Blade Runner,  in the Director's Cut is a true Sci-Fi classic. Watch Scott's true vision  of the film on DVD and hope that the original theatrical version has been  burned, never to be seen again.As for the original DVD, its content is  a big disappointment.

The menu system is pathetic, there are no extras, not even a theatrical  trailer, BUT it is anamorphic so not all is lost I guess.  This is the  director's cut version, and in truth I like the original cut with Deckard's  narration better.  Some say it's poorly narrated, but let's face it,  Deckard isn't the most animated character in the world.  The narration  added that film noir element of a '50s detective story, but set in 2019,  and I sorely miss it.  The addition of the very short unicorn dream  sequence seems to have no meaning other than tieing in the end a little and  causing speculation that Deckard is in fact a replecant.

They become out of control and lethal.  Blade Runners are sent to ""retire"" them.  Harrison Ford's job as a Blade Runner is to round up a team of Replicants known as Nexus 6.These particular Replicants are stronger, more agile than humans and capable of mass destruction.  But Who is looking for Who?Ford's character, Deckard is sent to eliminate them, but simultaniously, the Nexus 6 ""pack"" (who include Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer) are looking for Tyrell...the man and coorporation who made them. He only developed Nexus 6 with a 4 year lifespan and the Nexus 6 are looking for life.  It's a gritty world of who will get who first.  Ridley Scott creates a most fantastical world that feels dirty, futuristic, hard, and it has his signature darkness pierced with beaming lights. It makes the movie ""the Fifth Element"" seem child-like.  I watched this movie and I was often reminded of ""Aliens""...with it's eary, dark, pulse- raising feel.There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is hard to review a DVD like this one.  The one that stands out most in my memory is the scene where Deckard finds ""Zhora"", played by Daryl Hannah. She disguises herself as a ""toy"" in J.F. Sebastian's home (a gentic designer who is lonely enough to create AI toys to keep him company). As Deckard approaches, she sits there, perfectly, like a doll hoping Deckard won't notice her. He does.  The action that ensues from that point on is wild to say the least.  It is pointless for me to go on about the plot. Most of you have seen this movie.I hope this review has tantalized the newcomer and warned the true fan about a fabulous must-own.  Could this be Ridley Scott's greatest film?

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	Blade runner is a futurist nightmare set in L.A. in 2019.The dark, cloudy and contaminated atmosphere , and the two billions towers surrounded of that claustrophobic gothic landscape persuades you something bad about to happen.This magnificent set inspired Tim Burton in Batman 1.Harrison Ford is a police hired to kill an extraordinary generation of replicants , humanoids whose mission is to make the dirty work and gifted of emotive memories, but built to live just four years , who have decided to rebel.In this frenetical search, Ford falls in love with one of them (Sean Young) and he must exterminate the other three.Rutger Hauger is the leader of the group, and we have all along the film very smart clues; the Vermeer in the wall of a room, the sinister aspect of the city reminds us to Metropolis from Fritz Lang; and the presence of Edward J Olmos as the evil preacher; (who cares if you live?); like a leit motive musical in the story. Poignant moments in the romantic scenes and unforgettable sequences of splendid kinetic energy as the brilliant coreography fight against Darryl Hannah in the room of toys.That ending climax final and the last dialogue Hauger-Ford are from its release in 1982 a classic.The soundtrack from Vangelis is another important factor that adds aditional dramatic effect to the film.Riddley Scott made his most intimate and even original film in this serious futurist scenario: and more over his other triumphs as Gladiator; Thelma and Louise and Allien 1 , this movie could remain as his masterpiece.	5.0	Once upon a time in 2019	2004-05-26	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A29TJXPMT1QBNB	Hiredgun	I was 18 years old in 1982 when I saw the original release of Blade Runner.  I was mesmerized with Blade Runner and I have been ever since.  Can you imagine my longsuffering all these 25 years?  Like so many, I have waited, first for the long awaited soundtrack, and now this.  I didn't feel the need for the 5 disc set and I have no regrets having purchased the 4 disc box set.  As of this writing, I have only viewed the 4th disc called the Enhancement Archive. (kinda like eating the side dishes/veggies before I savor the big steak) AMAZING!  Finally, I am getting my satisfactory fill and I'm just loving it.  For any of you considering just the two disc set, you must spend the extra to get this 4th disc alone.  I must say the segment on the director of photography, Jordan Croneweth, is so touching and insightful.Since purchasing the movie yesterday from the local Borders bookstore, I have been walking the streets of Seattle in the December gloom and pouring rain--living like so many in the movie--under my umbrella.  I have been walking among the large assortment of homeless (Seattle is a utopia for the homeless) and the ubiquitous Asian population and I feel such a kinship with the movie.I'd like to share a little tidbit from the 4th disc.  I don't recall which segment, but it shows a take of Rutger Hauer (Roy Batty) doing his poignant last scene and then you see the movie clapper board to end the take.  Someone comes up to Hauer and puts their hand on his shoulder as to congratulate him on a good job, he smiles and then seems to lose it a little bit emotionally.  It's subtle, but demonstrates the pathos he, the human being, must have felt doing that scene. What more can I say? It is just a great feeling to have all these treats to relish again and again.One last thing... I'm in the camp that likes to examine all the clues that suggest Deckard may be a replicant, but in the end I believe he's really not a replicant.  He's a human who seemed to have lost his humanity over time with his career, divorce, etc. but then regained it from his life, death and love experiences with this group of replicants.ENJOY!!!!	5.0	BLOWN AWAY!!!	2007-12-19	9	8	1

I prefer the Original Release  (also know as the International Cut, voice-over version, uncut version, or the Criterion Edition), because I like the idea that Deckard is certaintly human, and hence I find his romance with Rachel more intense and dramatic, since he has to struggle internally with the idea of falling in love with somebody/something he used to think of as a disposable machine; besides I must admit I like the voice-over, despite it was nailed by the executives at the end of the production, and that Harrison Ford was forced to did it, but it was the version that I first saw, and fell in love with. But if you like any other version (the main and most ""polished"" one is the Final Cut, which is similar to the 1992 Director's Cut), here you'll find 5 of them (there are actually seven). Definitely the most weird of them all, is the workprint version, since is the one that was shown in test previews. I think it's great that Ridley Scott decided to release all these versions so you could pick the one you like the most, instead of forcing everyone to stick to one version. Scott himself makes a small introduction before the beginning of each movie, describing the main aspects of each one."	5.0	Best edition ever	2008-02-08	1	1	0

I'm sure the DVD is even better, certainly  more durable. The scenery and dark theme match well to create the mood of  the movie, set in a dark, seemingly run down, futuristic Earth.Harrison  plays a retired Blade Runner who is sucked back into service to stop  renegade replicants. Even with the movie's age nearing twenty years, Blade  Runner is a solid movie even today. The Director's cut forgoes some  voiceover work that bridged a few gaps for viewers that had trouble keeping  up, as well as adding some cut footage.Rutger Hauer does a commendable  job as the leader of the band of replicants, who are gaining too much free  will to remain docile. This is a classic movie that should be a definate  addition to the collection of any Harrison fans, or Rutger fans for that  matter.No to be missed. Make sure to go for the DVD version to get the  Dolby 5.1 surround that would &quot;put the icing on the gravy&quot; for  all cinematic audiophiles out there.	5.0	A Dark Classic	2000-08-24	1	0	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2PNKC1AQYIF6D	hockhamb@hotmail.com	I'm not getting into the argument about which version is better. It seems there's a lot of emotion flying about but suffice to say that each to his own, and as long as you enjoy it.I think this movie is based on a novel  by Stanley Kubrick (I think??? Correct me if wrong!) called 'Do androids  dream electric dreams' (another book I've never got round to reading).In  terms of casting, this film about did it perfect. Harrison Ford was,  naturally, the choice for the cop, with Rutger Hauer providing the  performance of his life. Each of the other androids are played beautifully,  especially Darryl Hannah's unusually cast role as a sex droid, capable of  breaking a mans head between her thighs.The music is almost definately a  classic - it drifts along catching the ear, slightly permeating the feel of  the city, it's rough streets awash with grime.There are several classic  scenes in this movie; the snake womans (painful) demise (who'd of thought  death could appear so disgusting and beautiful, yet its a robot...), 'Time  to Die', the final moments for Ford and his new lover.I think you'll be  hard pushed to find anything close to this in it's genre, and for me  personally it rates in my top ten favourites (somewhere). Buy it, watch it,  love it.	5.0	Now classic cyberpunk movie	1999-05-11	53	5	48

The only similarities are the names of a few of the characters and the (unexplained) replacement of animals with replicants.That said, I have to admit that I've watched both released versions of this movie a total of at least fifty times.  It has a darkness about it that I find compelling, but there are so many rough edges, plot mistakes, and so much general hokeyness, that I generally watch this at bed time, and fall asleep by the end.Unlike a lot of folks, I much prefer the original release version (which I have on VHS, and plan to have converted to DVD one of these days) with the narration.  The script is such a POS compared with the P.K. Dick novel that a narration to put a guide for the story is a must.  This thing will never be much of a movie, and the WB executives were entirely correct in their assessment of the need for it.  At the very least, a DVD (with its soundtrack capability) should offer the option of watching it either way.Those who don't like ""happy endings"" would I suppose agree that the original ending of Charles Dickens' _Great Expectations_ was better.  I'd disagree that the original ending of _Blade Runner_ was particularly happy, since the two lead characters were going into a life on the run.This movie excels in one way, and that's the visuals -- this view of a dying future, with humans struggling against replicants for no reason they can remember, is enough to hold the interest.  And it's pretty cheap.  Just buy it, and bemoan the lack of the narration as I do."	3.0	"""Have a Better One"""	2003-06-06	6	5	1

According to Ridley Scott, this is his absolute last word on it. I hope he's right. I love the movie for it's senses-staggering design more than the actual plot or writing. This thing is basically a thinly-veiled 1940's filmnoir dressed in futuristic excess. But what gorgeous excess it is! There is so much for the eye to feast on in this movie, no matter what part of the film it is or where your eyes travels within the film frame. After several versions and multiple viewings over the last 30 years, I still discover new things to gasp at, and if more than a year or two goes by between viewing it's the equivalent of an optical sledgehamer blow to watch it again. Ford still seems wrong somehow in the role, as if he's decidedly uncomfortable with the part, second-guessing himself after every line he delivers or move he makes. The other actors here however are pitch-perfect. I cannot imagine anyone else in the role of Roy Batty except Rutger Hauer. But after it's all said and done, without the stunning visual contributions of Doug Trumbull & Syd Mead this movie would be nothing and have had none of the power to remain lodged in the movie-going subconscious that it has maintained over the years.	4.0	Hopefully the last version of this to buy.  :-)	2013-12-22	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1BDJK501QH72G	HugeStakkaBoFan	Is the packaging gimmicky and stupid? Yes. Did Ridley Scott sign every copy by hand? No. Did I expect anything else? No, but then again, I'm not a moron who thought that something which was very clearly advertised as a restoration/polish job was somehow going to turn into a completely different movie made just for me to download, complain about, and throw away.This product was made for people who don't watch movies on laptops or iPods. If you're one of them, then yes, it's a complete waste of money. If you have a decent TV and want to see the best quality transfer of this film to date with a lot of annoying continuity errors fixed up to boot, then you won't be disappointed. The extras border on excessive and I honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to make it through them all, but again, that's the point.My primary complaints are that the menus are loaded with mystery-meat style navigation cues that make no sense, so finding a specific documentary piece or deleted scene is something of a shot in the dark, and that the DVD version is packaged in a cardboard case with overlapping discs that are very difficult to pull out. I also bought the Blu-Ray version in anticipation of hardware price drops, and that one comes in a nice plastic clamshell kinda thing with each disc in its own little holder.I do have to say that it seemed a little dark to me, and by that I mean I noticed a distinct increase in contrast and a corresponding loss of shadow detail at times. There were other portions where the film looked almost as if it had been cross-processed, but I've never seen the original negatives, so I'll just have to trust that Ridley knew what the picture was supposed to look like better than anyone else and that the technicians did all they could with what they had. The black levels of the live footage are at least in sync with those of the matte paintings, and it really does make a world of difference in terms of immersion and believability.	4.0	I'd say it delivered	2007-12-23	13	12	1

The commentary is a bit dry and really only for those who like watching the History Channel (I do) but it gives the background to what the director was trying to convey and the struggle involved in making the movie.  Blade Runner was a film ahead of its time and it spawned a generation of film makers that were inspired by its darker vision of the future.  The movie was loosely based on the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" and was endorsed and enjoyed by the book's creator.One question that this version answers is the question, ""Is Deckard an android as well?""

I write recalling the first time I viewed it, somewhere in the mid 80's while in the university. The images and hidden messages is something that will captivate you and encourage always to look for some detail that may have been overlooked (trust me this is a movie to be seen)....fantastic images.. and yes.. Vangelis does the soundtrack...atmospheric settingTo me geniality of the movie lies in the fact of telling a tragic tell of a group of ""humanoids""- improved biological replicas designed to have amazing physical powers- they were created to do chores and jobs such as soldiers, inter-stellar explorers and ""pleasure models"". Replicas have one limitation by design, they cannot live more than 4 years.The replicas are  manufactured by a supercorporation, whose CEO is a genious who still lives in earth (a place mostly inhabited by the degenerate, outcasts and unfit to pass the migration criteria for interplanetary travel).. a group of rebelious replicas want a to meet with their Creator and asks for more life, a request that this mortal god cannot concede... Harrison Ford is a retired ""skin remover"" - that is , a policeman in charge of removing replicas- that is forced back to his former job to help take the group of replicas or ""become little people"". He is a antiheroe we can quickly relate to.. the world is now a babelistic mixture of tongues, so we hear chinese, spanish and english words as a background of street pappiamento. No I am not going to spoil it for you.At least the replicas have the chance to find their creator- they are moved by our same existencialistic motives, but they are not given the paths of faith to find the answers. What do they want? I guess the same as everyone else, they just want a fair share of life- We have created new slaves whose notion of equality is just to live longer or at least as much as we do.I wonder what would I do if I found my maker and could openly ask for more life, and find out he has limitations on that? A god with limitations, if we could forget the damn Aristotelic and Scholastic tradition of the contradiction of such a term, and we indeed find a god- made into our same image- and listen to his benevolent amorous advice and consolation- but realice that- ""Yes Virginia (I am so sorry to say)- there is no santa claus""-I forgot where I read it, was it Nietche, was it Schopenhauer?, oh well, it goes like this "" truth can only belong to those who can bear it""In spanish sound better ""La verdad es de quien la pueda soportar""So many angles to start an interesting discussion with a group of good friends over a good argentinian Malbec wine."	5.0	A deep look at humanity.. basic existencialism..and  dystopia	2007-05-09	5	3	2

I will compare the Director's cut with both, after I review the movie as a whole.This is my favorite Sci-fi movie.  Those who have read my other reviews know I divide science fiction into true science-fiction (which is based on what could possibly happen), science fantasy (which is fantasy is a futuristic setting, like Star Wars), and science horror (which is primarily meant to terrify, with the Alien movies and Jurassic Park fitting into this vein).  Both the movie and the novel fit clearly into the first section.  The movie is very thrilling, but the action and suspense do not distract from the themes being explored, and you leave the movie focused more on the themes than on the action (at least I did).The acting is great.  It wasn't until seeing the movie again that I recognized William Sanderson (Newhart, A&W; Root Beer Commercials) as J. S. Sebastian.  Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Batty seemed low key at first, but by the end, his performance reminds me of Malcolm McDowell's in ""A Clockwork Orange.""  Harrison Ford is, well, Harrison Ford.  Sean Young is an attractive love interest, and Darryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy are appealing as well.The movie deals with three themes:  1) prejudice, with robots being the new slaves; 2) mortality (in the movie, the androids can only last for four years, and the primary antagonist, Roy Batty is in search of prolonging his life); and 3) what makes a creature human (the androids show signs of humanity and feeling, while the humans, including the protagonist Rick Deckard, can seem to have robotic lack of emotion.The Director's Cut adds a little to the mortality theme and even more so to the humanity theme.  One of the things done here is the removal of the voice-over that many hate.  I actually enjoyed the voice-over; it made me smile when Ford says his ex-wife referred to him as sushi, cold fish, and the concluding voice-over helped with the upbeat ending, though I considered the ending to be a little out of place.  The lack of the voice-over omits any hint of the marital status of Deckard, though there is definitely no suggestion of him being currently married.  At the end, the upbeat ending is gone, leaving one to believe Sean Young's character may not last more than four years (the voice-over says there was no expiration date for her, allowing for a happily ever after ending).Having not seen the movie for over 20 years between seeing the original and the director's cut, I saw some scenes I didn't remember, and wondered if they were part of the director's cut.  One scene I knew was added was one of a unicorn running, which was as out of place as the beautiful tree footage at the end of the original.  However, that out-of-place scene does heighten the question of whether Deckard was human or an android.Most of the time a movie is based on a book, people feel the book is better than the movie.  This absolutely is not the case here.  The movie uses the characters from the book, and some of the setting elements such as most animals being artificial instead of real, but from there it has no similarity to Dick's book ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"".  The novel is more nihilistic (that is, that there is no purpose to anything).  The book also has an anti-religious tone to it, which the movie lacks.This movie is very violent.  Even the love scene is a little rough for some people.  The violence and one topless scene earned the movie's R-rating.  Thus, I would not recommend it for children at all, and that teen-ager's should see it with parental presence.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2JD9YDHLC76IB	infinte_variety	The first time I saw Blade Runner was at a theater in its initial release.I left the theater stunned.then years later VHS comes out and I see an add that there is a different version. supposedly the corrected version. I bought it instantly.I ended up buy 3 copies I watched it so often.The hook for me is that, like Alien, this wasnt a space fantasy. This was actual science fiction. Except for 2001, real science fiction movies were, and are, rare.Most what claims to be are actually just fantasy masquerading as science. This was realistic and dirty and brutal. Ridley Scott knew how to make a movie back then.I like this set mostly as a tome of the history of a classic movie. I dont find any one version (there are 5 here) perfect. There are flaws in each, but different flaws. But with movies this huge you an look past them and see what, maybe, Ridley Scott saw.I have a hope that at some point in the not too distant future that, now that Star Wars has been removed form Lucas' endlessly tinkering hands, that a set like this will one day come out of A New Hope. then finally we can see each version of that movie side by side, and the same progression of thought that made it the single best of the set.	5.0	Anyine for every conceivible version?	2013-09-15	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1R0IX6U1ADTXL	Innoculo	With 708 reviews there is little more can be said for this movie/dvd. Not to mention most people have seen the movie by now. This DVD was available for the launch of the DVD platform so you have to take that into consideration.Video Quality 3/5Audio Quality 2/5Extras 0/5Movie 5/5The film itself is generally accepted by many to be one of the greatest Science Fiction movies of all time. It was indeed a film before it's time and was not well accepted by audiences of the day. It has taken on more relevance now after the technological explosion of the 90s and it's legacy still echos in Hollywood 20 years later.Blade Runner is a drama set in a future LA showing the struggles to survive in the oppressive technological environment of the near future. The film at it's core asks the question what is human and is it just our DNA that makes us so? I think this struggle and questions asked in the movie are becoming more and more relevant in our daily lives as we ride the explosive growth of technology over the last 20 years. I can relate in my personal life to a much greater degree to Blade Runner than any other Sci-Fi movie before or since. This is a shame that Hollywood has not done a better job raising the genre of Sci-Fi above the level of juvenile level of spaceships, aliens, and CGI effects. I think Sci-Fi can be so much more than just space ships and aliens and can teach us about ourselves by placing humans in unusual/future environments (as does Blade Runner) Granted, maybe because I work in a technical field and use a computer at least 8 hours a day Blade Runner is more compelling for me. Blade Runner has such a strong impact to me emotionally and at the same time it has a very good plot that includes, action, romance, intrigue, and life and death struggles of almost all the principle characters and their evolution as human beings.This is a fascinating movie which can be watched more than once, unlike most movies in my collection which I have watched but once or twice max and have no desire to watch again for a long long time.Blade Runner is an intriguing and stunning prediction of the human race's future. Will technology steal our humanity as we lose ourselves in the world of machines??? Time will tell if Blade Runner is correct in that prediction.	5.0	So so DVD, but the greatest sci-fi movie ever made	2004-02-05	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A28DMDFQKPCSX4	Irene Helen Zundel	Directed by Ridley Scott, possibly the best director in Hollywood, Blade Runner: The Director's cut is an outstanding medley of action, noir, sci-fi, and suspense.  Robots have been taken to a new level - Nexus 6 Generation Robots called &quot;replicants&quot;, which outmatch humans in strength and ability and equal in intelligence, but lack one human quality - emotions.  They were used for &quot;slave labor&quot; to work in places too hazardous for humans.  However, replicants after a few years begin to develop their own emotions, which causes them to rebel against their masters.  Special cops, called blade runners, were assigned to exterminate criminal replicants.  Eventually replicants were declared illegal on earth, and were banished to a shuttle in space.  LA, 2017.  Rick Deckard, (Harrison Ford) a retired blade runner, is forced to &quot;retire&quot; five replicants that have escaped from the shuttle, but winds up falling for one, Rachael. (Sean Young) Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads the other three replicants to find their creator, Eldon Tyrell, to expand their short four-year life span.  Incredible action scenes, dark, brooding noir, creeping suspense, and excellent sci-fi, Blade Runner: The Director's Cut will please fans of any of these genres.  The Director's Cut offers production notes, subtitles, added character developement, the original ending, a unicorn dream sequence, and the deletion of unnecessary scenes and the annoying voice-overs.  Plus, it is digitally restored to excellent picture and sound quality.  Some &quot;sensitive&quot; viewers might find the plot and noir atmosphere cold, but action, noir, sci-fi, and suspense fans will enjoy it very much.  With stunning special effects, incredible cinematography, compelling plot, and rich, incredible characterizations (esp. Rutger Hauer), I strongly recommend Blade Runner: The Director's Cut to action/sci-fi fans.	5.0	Stunning - The Best Sci-Fi Film Ever Made	2001-04-20	4	3	1

I was thrilled to see it available on Amazon instant video and was excited to be able to share it with my 12 year old son.I was disappointed to find the voice overs removed. It made the story confusing, brooding and boring. My son lot interest quickly. I had to explain a lot of what was happening and why things were being done from what I remembered of the original narration.I showed him the original ending and deleted scenes on YouTube to try to explain what made the movie exciting to me. But by then it was too late after the first impression and couldn't get him to see why I was so enthusiastic about the movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A19JYLHD94K94D	Itamar Katz	It is popular opinion that the movie Blade Runner was altogether better than the novel on which it was based, Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Quite frankly, having read the book before seeing the movie, it seemed quite disappointing to me, when compared with the original. The importance more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfuly; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel. These were all removed. The idea of the artifiacial animals was only hinted, as was the unsolved question of whether Deckard himself is a replicant or not.But IN SPITE OF ALL THAT -- when considered individually by its own right, as it should be (it's no accident that the film and the novel have different names!) Blade Runner is still one of the masterpieces of sci-fi cinema. Harrison Ford - though he plays the exact same character he always does - fits right in. Ridley Scott's directing is superb. His biggest stroke of genius is in his relating to a theme that was very subtle and weak in the novel - the film noir atmosphere. Scott did an incredible job creating a futuristic classic film noir, right down to the electronic-film noir musical score.As an action and an atmosphere movie, Blade Runner is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Highly recommended for all fans of the genre. Reading the novel is completely unnecessary to appreciate the film.	4.0	21st Century Film Noir	2002-04-05	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ	"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski"""	"What can I say? The wait was well worth it. It's taken over 25 years for this movie to be released on DVD since it came out in the theaters and this release does not disappoint in the least.First off, the V-K case is great. It's made of a very sturdy plastic and is not flimsy at all. Just carrying it you can feel the weight of all that is included with this set which is great. There are two push buttons that unlock the case and it opens up. In the lid is a dossier folder containing various rare art prints for many scenes in the movie. There is also a motion film clip picture containing a scene from the movie.In the bottom part of the case placed into cut-out foam is the 5-disc movie box containing 5 DVDs and a booklet, a spinner replica and a plastic origami unicorn.The 5 discs contain over 9 hours of film and features. None of them disappoint and they are all worth their weight in gold.Disc 1 is the Final Cut. This is the definitive version of the movie. No voice-over, restored picture which looks wonderful and vibrant and other touch ups that do not destroy the integrity of the movie. Some of the ""changes"" include cables that were attached to the spinners for a crane have been digitally removed; dialog and lip synchronization has been fixed during the scene with the snake dealer; digitally put Joanna Cassidy's head on the stunt double's body during the windows stunt scene and many other minor fixes that do nothing but enhance the movie. No replacing of special effects since they don't need it.Disc 2 contains a three-and-a-half hour feature called Dangerous Days that goes through the entire life of the movie from concept to release. This has to be the most complete ""making of"" feature I've seen since the release of the extended editions of the LOTR movies. Just wonderful to watch and interesting.Disc 3 contains the US theatrical, European theatrical (which is the common VHS version) and the '92 Director's Cut, all seamlessly branched together and each one has a introduction by Ridley.Disc 4 contains a lot more background information about the movie and Phillip K. Dick. The interviews are with people not associated with the movie as well as people that were behind the scenes. One featurette that was very interesting was the comparison between the book and the movie. There are also original making of features from 1982 when the movie was ready for release. Nostalgic and very interesting to watch!Disc 5 contains the work print version that was shown as the preview before the movie came out. The Final Cut is very similar to this one but there is a different beginning, some scenes shortened and some different music. It's about 7 minutes shorter than the Final Cut but it's a nostalgic piece of history that some have never been able to see and now you have the chance. The sound and picture aren't bad but they could only touch it up so much. It's very watchable and it's interesting to see how Ridley initially released the movie to the public to preview.Also included on the fifth disc is a 30-minute feature that shows how the various versions of the film came to be and how the Final Cut was finally created.For collectors, this is the movie set to get. If you are a true Blade Runner fan, there is no other option. Definitely the best DVD collection set I've seen yet."	5.0	Excellent release. Possibly the best ever.	2007-12-19	7	6	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1UQW526YXUF1U	iWINuFAIL	"As a collector of Blu-rays, I must say this is one of the best, if not the best addition I have made to my collection thus far.  In fact the only two which come close in terms of quality and sheer amount of content are ""Apocalypse Now: Full Disclosure"" and the ""Alien Anthology""  Blu rays.  Blade Runner is not only one of the greatest films of all time, it is a sparkling example of how the idea of the 'director as the author' can create a profoundly different film.Of the FIVE copies of the film included, my personal favorite is the Final Cut, which is Director Ridley Scott's true view of what the film should be.  If you have only seen the theatrical version, or the 'director's cut' (which actually was edited by the studio, not Scott), you will feel like you are watching an entirely new film.  Finally, the 'workprint' is the most raw of the versions, but for fans of the film, it is a must watch so they can see the developmental process of the film.The second disk contains a 'making-of' Documentary, which is actually longer than the film itself.  This documentary is not like the featurettes you'll find on most films, but instead a full, comprehensive look at the making of Blade Runner and the lives of the people working on it.  Really the only film I could use as a comparison is 'Hearts of Darkness', which is a documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now (which is included in the Full Disclosure).Overall, if you're a fan of the film, considering the average price of a Blu-ray is around $20, the extra $10 goes a long, long way.  I can not recommend this purchase highly enough."	5.0	The Best Blu-Ray	2011-05-31	0	0	0

I particularly like that this compilation has the original screenplay version with Harrison Ford's voiceover.  I'm one of the few, apparently, who thinks that is the best version.  When I watch one of the other versions, I always miss Harrison Ford's voice guiding me along.  I also like it's happy ending.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AE6ID6Z4UJJX2	Jack Heath	"It's not my intent to anger anybody. I just want to understand. How did this movie become one of the top ten sci-fi films of all time, according to The Guardian and the American Film Institute?I saw Blade Runner quite recently, and I wanted to like it; I've spent my life writing dystopian sci-fi novels, and my favourite things include detective stories, action movies and Phillip K. Dick. (If you think it's unfair to describe Phil as a ""thing"" rather than a person, you might not know that he was turned into an android whose whereabouts are unknown. Seriously.) But the film struck me as superficial, pretentious and dull.You can't make statements like that without backing them up, so I will - but be warned, spoilers follow.There's no question that the filmmakers involved were talented. Ridley Scott directed Alien. David Peoples wrote Twelve Monkeys. Harrison Ford starred in Morning Glory. But evidence of their talents is absent from Blade Runner. The excruciating tension of Alien is missing in action. Ford, whose character arc in Morning Glory was surprisingly nuanced, flatlines here as a prosaic, alcoholic womaniser. (His kissing scenes look a lot like assault.) And the matryoshka-doll of plot twists from 12 Monkeys are nowhere to be found.You could argue that the simplistic plot is not the fault of the filmmakers, since the movie was based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. But you would be wrong - an adaptation should outgrow the source material, not redact it. The plot of DADOES is as follows:""In a depopulated world where animals are so revered as to fund an industry of fakes, Rick Deckard is paid to hunt androids who, but for their lack of empathy and short life-span, are identical to humans. Gradually, he realises that humans often lack empathy too, including himself, and he wonders if there is a meaningful difference between his victims and their executioner.""Meanwhile, the plot of Blade Runner can be summarised thusly:""In futuristic Los Angeles (just like present-day LA, but with flying cars), Rick Deckard is paid to hunt androids who, but for their short life-span, are identical to humans. Later, it turns out he, too, is an android. Credits roll.""Opinions differ on how many twists constitutes a plot, but I'm pretty sure ""one"" doesn't quite cut it.Critics will argue that the story wasn't the point - Blade Runner was stylistically influential. That's true; The Fifth Element, for example, was probably inspired by it. But Blade Runner wasn't in TIME magazine's list of the 100 ""most influential"" movies of all time. It was listed as one the 100 ""best"". And there's a reason that ""style over substance"" is usually cited as a bad thing.Perhaps I'm not looking deep enough. Perhaps the movie has some symbolic or thematic importance that I'm missing. Is that right, Blade Runner?Blade Runner: Yes! Like, at the beginning, there's a close-up of an eye, right?Jack Heath: Uh-huh...Blade Runner: And then, Deckard's machine focuses on the eyes to tell if someone's an android!Jack Heath: And then?Blade Runner: And then an android gouges someone's eyes out! See? Eyes!Jack Heath: That's great, but it's not really a symbol or a theme. It's just a motif. The phrase ""See? Eyes!"" has just as much artistic merit as all that stuff in the movie.Blade Runner: Okay, well, what about Roy Batty?Jack Heath: What about him?Blade Runner: He's Jesus.Jack Heath: Because he dies at the end?Blade Runner: Because he sacrifices himself for Deckard, despite being cartoonishly evil up to that point. And he sticks a nail through his hand.Jack Heath: Why does he do that?Blade Runner: Because he's Jesus!Jack Heath: No, I get the symbolic reason, but why did he think he was doing it? What was his motivation?Blade Runner: I... uh... did I already mention the eyes?Jack Heath: You did.Blade Runner: Listen, I'm sick of your cheek. It doesn't matter if I have proper symbolism. I'm classy. I'm film noir.Jack Heath: Oh, that genre which is notoriously difficult to define? How convenient.Blade Runner: Every scene takes place at night. And there's a femme fatale.Jack Heath: The first thing you said is a plot-hole, and the femme fatale stereotype is about sixty years out of date.Blade Runner: Cut me some slack! I was made in 1982.Jack Heath: Oh, sorry; thirty years out of date. You know what we call female villains these days?Blade Runner: What?Jack Heath: Villains.It could be that my standards are too high. I've definitely seen worse movies than Blade Runner. But in this instance, I felt betrayed, because Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was a beautiful novel. It made me chuckle, it made me weep, and most of all, it made me think. There are few things as depressing as watching your favourite characters reduced to action figures, and seeing the philosophy of a book wiped out to make room for special effects.No doubt some readers are keen to inform me that Phillip K. Dick really liked Blade Runner, but in reality, he only saw the trailer. And do you know what else Dick liked? Amphetamines."	1.0	Why is Blade Runner so well-regarded?	2012-05-25	18	5	13

For everyone else, I hope the following is a useful review of this particular box set.Suffice it to say, the package pretty much satiates any need you may have in connection with this haunting, gorgeous film. Be warned, though: even the most ardent lover of Blade Runner is likely to walk away sick and tired of the damned thing if it is watched in one session.It is breathtaking in its scope: The 1982 Domestic Cut, the 1982 International Cut, the 1991 ""Director's Cut"" (falsely advertised as such, but closer to our man Ridley's intentions), the 2007 Final Cut - a true director's cut - and the Workprint, previewed in Dallas and Denver three months prior to the film's general release.The 'making of' documentary runs to a staggering 3 1/2 hours, and talks to every surviving person you would want to hear from. Everyone. And that's not the only documentary. There are profiles of the late Phillip K Dick, the late, lamented cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, and features on costumes, graphic design and the making of the Final Cut. And there are trailers, audio interviews with Dick, and other assorted segments.There is also a 45-minute sequence of deleted scenes and alternate takes, tastefully edited into a linear narrative, featuring unused voice-over material from Harrison Ford. It doesn't quite work as an alternate version of the film (if you saw it without knowledge of the real film, you'd likely be lost), but it is a fascinating document.The briefcase is plastic, and contains a plastic faux-origami unicorn and a miniature spinner, plus other little bits and bobs. This briefcase release is the only one to feature the workprint and the documentary on the Final Cut.So: curious about Blade Runner?

Of course, if I could take three tries for everything, I might get it right, too. The first version seemed a little too cute and almost flip; just about 2 clicks too happy. But, of course, you didn't know that until you saw the directors cut, which, in the end, seemed about 2 clicks too glum.But seeing this version, and after all these years, not even keeping the state of the art of 1982 in context, is an astounding experience. It is simply beautifully done. It all just seems so right. It is amazing how they have seemed to create something so whole and in some way, seamless and beautiful, and yet, gripping.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	This is a film whose meaning changes with time. When it came out it was soft science-fiction and adventure. Ten years later it is completely different. Cloning men to produce slaves, with no past, no emotional growing, no infancy, no memories but also with a limited lifespan was a vague menace ten years ago. Today it is a reality. This cloning implies DNA manipulation and this is today perfectly possible. Then the film gets some renewed interest. If those clones have no past, they have no emotions, hence they are machines. Yet they are stronger than and as intelligent as normal people, which means they develop emotions on the basis of their present experience, hence they rebel because they want an answer to their fundamental question, viz. what is life and what is the meaning of their lives and the meaning of their early deaths. When they do not get those answers, they kill the boss of the corporation who produced them, their  father , rediscovering or reinventing the dipus complex. Then the film is no longer an adventure film but an ethically rebellious film. Bladerunners are those who chase and hunt the replicants that have dared come on earth. They don't kill them, they retire them. Ethically unacceptable because they are human, just like us. And this unethical action is emphasized by three elements : the disgust and sickness of the bladerunner of the film in front of killing  human beings , even if they are replicants ; the last act of the last and dying replicant that saves the bladerunner's life to have a witness to his death, to maybe show life is more important than death for him, or even his survival ; the love affair that develops into an elopement with the new generation of replicants who do no have any limitation on their lifespan. Replicants are able to develop feelings and emotions, to become human, even if it is not based on those simple things that are called puberty, adolescence, growth, family life, father and mother, etc. A human  machine  will necessarily develop a human psyche. This is particularly disquieting for us and it should make us think twenty times before trying to be God. Like God who was unable to prevent disobedience in his free-will beings, we will be unable to prevent human development in our intelligent creations. And these beings will overtake us. This is yet shorter than the same problem in the Dune novels, because the Duncans are created, cloned from the DNA of the original dead one, but they recuperate with that DNA all the memories of the original Duncan. DNA has a memory. And then the problem is the discrepancy between what the cloned Duncan remembers and what the world he is thrown into is. This questioning about clones will go on and will become more and more pressing and pregnant in the coming years.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2QK19IK6DL6KV	Jambo	If you like the original Blade Runner better than the Director's cut, please read &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by Philip K. Dick. This is the story BR is based upon. The difference is like reading  Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; in the 600-page version, then the  recently released 1100-page version. Very important things are lost when it  is cut.BR-DC is true to the original story, where the original release  seemed more an attempt to emulate James Ellroy. The elimination of the  voiceover was a huge step to getting out of the '40's film noir style, and  the ending, like the ending of the book (and the PC game) left just enough  doubt to Deckard's humanity to give the viewer something to think  about.The unicorn scene, while not in the original story, gave something  back to it. Dick's book had a sub-storyline about Deckard's wife (really?)  and attaining a real animal. The unicorn scene accomplished this same  effect while still being viewable in a reasonable amount of time. Without  this scene, the DC ending would fall flat.Speaking of the DC ending, it  is much closer to the story's original ending than the &quot;happy  ending&quot; WB forced on the theatrical release. It's also a lot more  real. How often have you had a happy ending? Remember, it has to be happy,  and it has to be an ending.Blade Runner: the Director's Cut should be in  every true sci-fi fan's collection just for sticking (mostly) to the  original story. Ridley's direction, wonderful acting, a great soundtrack,  and incredible effects are only bonuses tacked onto what was already a  masterpiece waiting to be captured.	5.0	Finally, true to a book	1999-12-14	20	19	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	"From the description of the set, it sounds like this was the version that was released a few years back when it was the five-disc DVD Voight-Kampff Gift Set that came in the mini-suitcase, but sadly it turns out that it's not. At least it has the little Matchbox-style Spinner included.If you're a die-hard fan of BLADE RUNNER and really want the best picture/sound quality that is currently available, this might not be a bad price, since I'm sure that previous Blu-Ray sets of this are selling for a lot more with it being out of print. If not, then this is pretty easily skippable. The 5-Disc set has a glut of bonus features and four different versions of the film: The ""Final"" cut, the 1992 Director's Cut, the 1982 Theatrical Cut, and an early cut of the theatrical release. The fifth disc is an amazing 3-and-a-half hour behind-the-scenes documentary called ""Dangerous Days"" (a reference to the original working title for the film as scripted by Hampton Fancher) which is LOADED with interesting tidbits and anecdotes about the making of the film as well as long studies of its conceptual art to its continuing influence on Sci-Fi and neo-noir genres. Having watched only the Final cut (to see what significant changes were made from the '92 Director's cut, and there aren't many) and the Theatrical cut (because there are moments in the Theatrical cut that are really interesting as well) and the documentary, there's a lot to digest and again, is only for really hardcore fans of this film.I know that everybody HATES UltraViolet because of the issues they have with streaming the film on the various devices it's supposed to support, but that's so much of a non-issue because it's almost not even worth it to see it on a smaller screen than a television and someday, manufacturers will start getting the hint and just continue to provide digital copies, because those work quite well.Of course as far as the film is concerned, it's beyond classic status, and well-deserved of its vast acclaim. However, the ""Final"" cut is not extraordinarliy different, aside from some digital clean-up, some insertions of some shots from the workprint version, some shots that clean up some editing inconsitencies, and some lines of dialogue that clear up some logical inconsistencies. The most obvious difference is the digital superimposition of Joanna Cassidy's face over her very different-looking stunt-double during the Deckard-Zhora shootout sequence, which has long been a source of bother for fans.Personally, I loved both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's cut, warts and all, so all of the Final cut changes are nice, but don't make a significant difference in the enjoyment of the film. At least Ridley Scott didn't go all Lucas on the film and start inserting scenes that make no sense and actually hurt the film more than help it (See the ""Special Editions"" of the original STAR WARS trilogy if you don't know what I mean)."	4.0	Is this the VK Gift Edition on Blu?	2012-05-29	16	14	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	It is great to see Blade Runner finally being the deluxe treatment.  With so many options, it is hard to choose, but this 5-disc Blu-ray edition seems like the most value for your money, but then I guess some will pay twice the price and go for the fancy box that comes with the ultimate colector's edition.Blade Runner has long deserved better treatment than it has been given over the years.  This is one of the quintessential science fiction movies, based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep.  Of course, Blade Runner is a more catchy title and Ridley Scott took a lot of liberties with the story, but he created a masterwork in the process.Blade Runner paints a distopic vision of the future set in a murky Los Angeles, where Deckard (Harrison Ford) tracks down androids that have escaped from their work colonies.  He meets his match in Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), an android who has taken on many human features and seeks out his maker.  While the movie has many shades of Metropolis and other great science fiction films of the past, it is very much a unique work and has garnered much critical attention over the years.  If one can, one should experience the movie in 70 mm, as it will simply blow you away with its visual effects.It is hard to believe it has been 25 years since it was first released.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A26KU66ZXB0FXI	James G. Ronsse	"When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as ""eclectic"", ""noir"", and ""dazzling technology"". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum.In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, ""Alien"", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was ""The Duelist"" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie Alien was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie ""Blade Runner"" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Although it did not do well at the box office, is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryonic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and  that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts.  In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages. There is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS  systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a ""better"" location.Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect. This movie is a much watch for any fan of science fiction, or to anyone who wants to get a look into the future."	5.0	A Look Into The Future	2010-11-26	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1FGG93X6HT374	James O'Blivion	"Finally, the greatest science fiction film ever made, the way it was meant to be seen.  Ridley Scott & Co. have gone to great lengths to craft an all-new cut of the film, consistent with Scott's true vision for Blade Runner.  This new ""Final Cut"" truly is the definitive version of Blade Runner, and after years of half-hearted acceptance of a so-called ""Director's Cut"" made in the director's absence, fans can sit back and enjoy the film that we SHOULD have gotten a quarter century sooner.  Of course, with so much time now past, Scott and his team make use of the new technologies at hand, but never undercut the original FX.  Indeed, the original Visual Effects supervisors were brought in to shepherd and approve the new digital FX, with complete respect for their original work in 1982.  Also of note is the improved color timing of the Final Cut, which serves to enhance the neo-noir style and atmosphere of the film.Of course, for those who may not share my feelings of complete satisfaction regarding the Final Cut, this set also includes the U.S. and International Theatrical Cuts, the 1992 Director's Cut, and the fabled Workprint from the Denver and Dallas screenings.  While the Director's Cut was one of the very first DVDs on the open market back in 1997, this is the first time the theatrical cuts have been made available since the Criterion laserdisc of the International Cut, and the first chance for fans to own the Workprint.  And though the Workprint is as rough as may be expected, all cuts of the film benefit greatly from the 1080p presentation of Blu-Ray.  The look of Blade Runner on BD is highly cinematic and certainly reference quality.  A fine layer of film grain is present throughout, colors are rich and vibrant, and the detail is astonishing.If you're not sold yet, there's also a three and a half hour documentary on the making of the film.  And even with its incredible runtime, not a single moment of Dangerous Days is filler.  It's easily the most comprehensive documentary I've ever seen on any film, covering every conceivable topic, from conception to legacy, from every conceivable angle, with a host of interviews.  And if that's not enough, there's a fifth disc with even MORE extras, including a feature on the history of the alternate cuts and the restoration and creation of the Final Cut.  In short, the extras are every bit as definitive as the rest of the package.  You get every cut of the film in HD, and hours upon hours of extras (in standard definition), all for an extremely reasonable price.If you're even remotely a fan of Blade Runner, you owe it to yourself to own this set, and to see the film in such amazing detail.  I owned the DVD set prior to this, and the quality there was as strong as standard definition would allow.  The Blu-Ray set absolutely trounces it in every way.  The PQ and AQ are a revelation, and any fan should be overjoyed with this brilliant set."	5.0	After 25 Years....	2010-04-21	3	2	1

The audio and video is the clearest ever, and the added remastering in Final Cut exceeds the transfers of the other versions included in the disk set. Blade Runner is a visual experience, the better the video and audio, the better the movie is too. The clarity of BD immerses you in the experience, as if you too were there. Enhanced audio is exquisitely clear and has superb imaging in 5.1.  You can see the stitches in the clothing, and so much of the background that was once blurry now reveals details of a noticeably Japan flavored sets.

It hasn't got 5.1 sound or any special features.What always annoyed me about this ""Director's Cut"" is that it is missing some very satisfying extra bits in the violent scenes which I've only seen once (in a pre-directors cut screening at a local cinema) which are as follows and which greatly affect the scenes they are in:1.  Where Roy Batty crushes Tyrell's head, there are some extra bits of him pushing his fingers in. Sounds crude, but the scene plays a lot better and is no more gruesome.2.  When Roy is trying to stay alive by pushing a nail through his hand, there's a bit more of the nail going in. This is very squeamish but again the scene works better.3.  The most annoying omission: Pris' dancing attack on Deckard is AT LEAST TWICE AS LONG and WORKS WAY BETTER! In the usual version, she drops him to the floor, does one run up and is shot dead. Very tame! In the never-to-be-seen-again version, she attacks him much more convincingly, and her death scene is also longer and much creepier, with her extra-weird android screaming and wriggling up the walls!Surely Ridley Scott would have wanted these bits kept? They aren't as ""strong"" as many things I have seen, and this is an adult-rated movie anyway.

I inspected the disks and found no major flaws ... then proceeded to place the first disk which contains the feature movie into my PS3 .... nothing happened ... removed the disk to re-inspect it and noticed a strange looking logo on the front of the disk ... it was labeled HD-DVD! ... two of the remaining 4 disks had the blu-ray logo with the remaining two having the standard DVD logo ... obviously having one studio with multiple formats is just a tad too complicated for them ... guess they should have stuck with laserdisks ... a bit harder to confuse them with the beta version.	1.0	BUYER BEWARE!

I'll just briefly go over what's necessary to convince you to buy this exact item on Amazon.com.  First, the blu-ray transfer is top notch as far as I can tell.  I'm running it on a very nice 55"" Sony Bravia LCD LED tv with a very nice Sony Blu Ray player & Sony 7.1 BraviaSync Receiver with Bose Speakers and subwoofer.  I'm an audiophile and cinephile, but I couldn't measure the differences really in a coherent manner well enough to describe the details to you.  It looks great and sounds great.  That's all I can really say about that.  Second, the release of The Final Cut itself is spectacular to the Nth degree, partly because of the re-edits, but mostly because of the clean up and remastering and what not.  The packaging and shipping, well done as well.  It came in a few days and wasn't damaged at all.  Not much to really live up to with just a Bluray to be sent.

It was a waste of my 2 hours and my $1 to rent it. The dvd is awful. Its got no special features, the menus are about as pretty as Christopher Lloyd in one flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. There was no plot to this movie, there was no action in this movie, there was no sex in this movie. So what's so good about it? I don't know. It was awful. Harrison Ford had about as much testosterone as the Olsen Twins. The evil man was an idiot and the naked woman was about as ugly as Whoopie Goldburg. Everybody on the internet rants and raves about this garbage so I figured I'd watch it. This is not a classic. I could have wrote this script in 5 minutes.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A18OUQEK7IZ2F2	"Jason Kirkfield ""The Pride and Sorrow of chil..."	"After years of almost secret worship predominantly by sci fi fans, Blade Runner should be regarded finally by critics and mainstream movie fans alike as a masterpiece.Blade Runner is a film best savored over multiple viewings. Happily, this DVD set (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) includes four different versions:1982 Theatrical Cut (U.S.)1982 International Cut1992 Director's Cut2007 Final CutNot to mention multiple commentaries (3) on the Final Cut.Perhaps it is fitting that a movie which was so difficult to make (see ""Dangerous Days"" documentary) would take so much time to find the respect it deserves.It's a detective story unlike others, and takes place in a future that seems very familiar. Unbelievably stellar supporting cast, and probably the last great special effects movie *not* to use CGI (and it's so much better for the use of in-camera FX).On the 25th anniversary of the film's premiere, Warner, Ridley Scott, and just about everyone involved with the production worked together to produce this definitive release. There were 2-, 4-, and 5-disc collections available, and this 4-disc set is the best deal in my opinion. Much cheaper than the 5-disc extravaganza with all the props and goodies, it contains everything worthwhile with the exception of the workprint disc.I won't ruin your enjoyment with talk about the differences among the different versions. But probably it's best to start with the Final Cut, then watch the documentary (DANGEROUS DAYS: MAKING BLADE RUNNER), then you can wade into the earlier cuts and also the commentaries."	5.0	One of the Best Movies Ever.  oops, did I say that?	2009-09-02	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ	Jason Ralsky	"** This is a Review for the 4-Disc Box set **Blade Runner is a masterpiece of a movie which presents a fantastic sci-fi vision of the future; that over 30 years later still stands strong.  The movie has a very ""cyber-punk"" feel to it, and does an exceptional job of integrating the viewer into this visionary style of the future.For those unfamiliar with Blade Runner; The Movie is about a man named Deckard who specializes in hunting ""Replicants"".  A Replicant is essentially a clone of a human that has a fixed lifespan and exists in off-world colonies.  Well A bunch of Replicants have escaped and come to Earth and it is Deckard's job to hunt down these replicant's and kill them.  In doing so this tests Deckard's understanding of what it means to be human and the value of life.This is a movie that in 1982 was ahead of its time, a brilliant masterpiece that perfectly molds Science Fiction, Drama, and Detective work together.  What the 4 Disk Collectors Edition contains is a vast amount of bonus content that will please any Blade Runner fan, and make a great piece in a movie collection.Disk 1: The Final Cut(2007)  This is a completely restored version of the movie. Digitally Restored and Remastered, this version contains additional footage over the director's cut and even improves upon the special effects.  The soundtrack has also been remastered in 5.1Disk 2: Dangerous Days  This disk contains the Making of Blade Runner.  Everything from outakes, deleted scenes, set creation and interviews can be found on this diskDisk 3: Archival Versions  This disk contains the 1982 US, International Versions, as well as the 1992 Director's Cut all on a single disk.  You can view each separately or chose to seamlessly integrated them together to form one Ultimate Director's Cut edition.Disk 4: Enhancement Archive  This disk contains Audiovisual mosaics, Production footage, and how they did restoration of the movie on DVD for the Final Cut.** OVERALL this is a fantastic Collector's Edition that will make any Blade Runner fan's day.  Not only do you get a final cut of the film, completely restored... but tons of behind the scenes and making of featurettes, as well as a copy of every previous release (the 1982 original and 1992 director's cut).  A fantastic, visionary film that was given a true Collector's Edition Box set.  5 stars!*NOTE:Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)contains Disk 1 and Disk 2 of this set*NOTE:Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)orBlade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] contains Disks 1-4 and Disk 5 contains a workprint version of the film.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AN6V71E0S98UC	Jason Schepers	"Blade Runner.  The name alone conjures up an ambience, a palpable onscreen mood that many directors have attempted to replicate for 25 years now.  The film's monumental influence on the substance and style of science fiction is indisputable, with echoes of Ridley Scott's dark vision and interpretation of Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"" continuing to haunt a number of notable productions, most recently that of the ""reimagined"" Battlestar Galactica and the new Cylons who struggle with determining who they are and how to relate to their human creators.  The philosophical concept of what humanity is, both to humans and to the machines they've created in their own image, continues to be a theme that resonates.This ""Final Cut"" of Blade Runner does not offer any new insights into that premise that the ""Director's Cut"" did not provide fifteen years ago.  There are some minor changes to dialogue and special effects that will continue to be debated by the fans, but by and large this is the Blade Runner that comes closest to Scott's true vision.For the fans, the most important point of note is that the visual quality has been cleaned up and given the professional treatment that such an amazing film deserves [presumably, that is -- I write this after only having seen the ""Final Cut"" in the theater].  No more will we have to watch the wobbly and muddy straight-from-vhs transfer of the ""Director's Cut"" dvd and bemoan the fact that the movie was treated like an unwanted stepchild by all parties involved.  Perhaps with it's release Ridley and co. can finally let go of the film that caused so much bitterness and heartache during it's production and marketing."	5.0	Blade Runner revisited	2007-11-08	5	4	1

So I apologize if this is a reiteration but I believe that this subject warrents a fresh review.Like I said there are editing mistakes in this film, at least two really horrible ones.  Ridley Scott was quoted at saying he did a quick edit for this dvd release and has plans to do a better job for a more complete (one would presume special edition) release.I too bought this, drooling in anticipation of the director's cut of one of my most beloved films.  While I do believe that the lack of narration improves the film (although this never really bothered me all that much, perhaps because my first several viewings were when I was a kid), the bad editing means you should wait for a better DVD release.	2.0	Rating for this cut	2004-10-15	2	0	2

I still loved the movie, but I was let down.Finally the original theatrical release, with the cheesy detective narration is released, and the image quality is amazing!Not only do you get the original theatrical version, but you get the directors cut, work-print version (with scenes not seen in the ther versions) and ""Final Cut"" version which looks and sounds amazing. All of this comes in a briefcase that resembles a voight-kampf case.

I remember that when I first saw the film that I had a little trouble figuring out what was going on and needed the narration to help me along, I might have been a little young maybe (12 or 13), but I imagined I'd have been lost without it. Fast forward to 1993 and I finally get to see it on the big screen but it felt hollow without the narration, I'd seen it many times by then and didn't need it, but I still missed it's charm. Then when the DVD came out, there were no plans for a narrated version, so I had to keep a hold of a VHS copy way longer than I ever kept a hold of a VCR. Finally we have the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition and was it worth the wait. A shiny new version of the film sans narration but fantastic (I'm still on the fence about the ""I want more life father"" line change; I'd agree it fits better, but I loved saying it the other way for the last 20+ years....) and for the old curmudgeon in me I've got the original release. If I had to show it to a new viewer, I'd give them the new version without hesitation and keep the old version, my version, for myself.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"In the not-too distant future, replicants - nearly perfect organic-robotic machines - are difficult to distinguish from ordinary humans. A crew of 6 of these creatures has escaped from exile and has returned to Earth. Deckard, a retired replicant hunter, or Bladerunner, is called back to duty to ""retire"" them.There is a lot of spooky weirdness about the setting of the movie. The locale seems to be an amalgam of New York City, Tokyo and Hong Kong, with lots of enormous neon billboards high on buildings, and lots of hustle-bustle on the streets below. Police cruise the city in aircars, and the citizens scurry, mole-like, through the maze of buildings and streets below. The musical score is haunting and disturbing, and frequently got on my nerves, yet was creepily appropriate for the film.Sets aside, the plot revolved around Decker's apparent distaste for his work. It's not apparent from the film why this might been, but it might revolve around issues of how similar the replicant are to humans. Are they menaces to terrestrial peace and security? Like humans, are they autonomous beings desperately trying to steal another day of life? Can they love and be loved? Having raised these questions, the film doesn't try hard to address them, and the last half of the movie is an extended, dull and preposterous cat-and-mouse game between Decker and the replicants, led by the incredible Rutger Hauer.Shortcomings aside, Bladerunner was worth seeing, just for the sets and the discussions it inspires. How will humans react when their machines are fundamentally indistinguishable from -- even superior to -- their creators? The movie's writing fails to engage this situation adequately, but the visuals make up for this lack.For my money, the director's cut is superior to the original. The occasional narration in the original was jarring puerile and almost laughable, adding little to the understanding of the movie. Better to do without it and to risk possible confusion. Really neat, with reservations."	4.0	On the way to perfection	2006-07-28	1	1	0

You notice this with the over voice provided by Deckard, but at the same time the removal of the over voice  gives the movie more to think about.  The unicorn vision was kind of  creative because we all have our little random thoughts that come from the  back of our mind, but it was a little corny. Even though it's not as  appealing as a unicorn it would have made more sense for it to be a sheep  since the story was based on &quot;DO Androds Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;  where Deckard owns an artificial sheep.  But even though there are these  slight changes from the original, it is still a brilliant masterpiece.	5.0	They may be different but they have their own qualities	2000-02-18	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AQ38OU6SRFGU5	"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid"""	"BladerunnerIt's a toss up for the best Sci fi film of all times.  The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings, physically identical to adult humans, called replicants are used for dangerous and degrading work in Earth's ""off-world colonies."" Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody mutiny. Specialist police units -- blade runners -- hunt down and ""retire"" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment. This movie I believe helped to inpire many clone and cyborg type movies like A.I. The story is so ahead of it's time and one of those rare movies that is as good today as it was in 1982 and is almost more relivant. Well fleshed out characters, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a commando, Leon a soldier and manual laborer, Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) a sex worker retrained as an assassin, and Pris (Daryl Hannah) a ""basic pleasure model."" Bryant also explains that the Nexus-6 model has a four-year lifespan as a failsafe against their developing unstable emotions. Deckard is teamed up with Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the Voight-Kampff test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, Deckard discovers that Tyrell's (Joe Turkel) young secretary Rachael (Sean Young) is an experimental replicant (who believes she is a human) with implanted memories from Tyrell's niece, which provide a cushion for her emotions. I'm a character guy and believe it is imposable to have a great film without many stong multi fasited characters with more that a few layers. Lastly like any great film it is very thought provoking and leaves a lot to the viewer imagination. Many critics and movie goes hated this film for that reason but for the rest of us the compelling question of weather or not Deckard is a replicant is just that thing that makes the movie great. Oh, just so you know...Of course he is, you silly goose!This is one of those movies that holds up to almost anything made today.  the directing, acting effects, and characters are all spot on.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1RSXP7MB772E3	"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	Back in 82'this movie met harsh criticism and low marks from ciritics all over the country. And no wonder, with a narrative and optomistic ending in direct contrast to the film noir style. This edition of Blade runner was released in 92', starting, what is so popular for DVD's, the entising directors cut standard that follows popular movies. I still can't believe the level of superiority in special effects and the beautiful rendering of imaginatory work in this film, even to todays standards! Even more suprised that in the oscar race it was only nominated for best art direction-set decoration and best effects, visual effects. ET beat out this movie for the visual effects and Gandhi for best art direction. Although containing, still, many continuity problems and sketchy script mistakes (not a single manuscript was used in entirety, 3 were borrowed from). The continuity problems such as when bryant initially tells deckard there are four skin jobs on the loose, but minutes later says six escaped, and one was killed by the electronic gate, which sould leave five. Some cool trivia here: you can spot the millennium falcon as deckard and gaff approach the police headquarters in a spinner. It's disguised as a building, and can be seen in the lower left corner of the frame. Also, pay close attention to the character of Decker, determine whether or not, for yourself, if he is a replecant. Ridley scott was quoted to have said in 2000 that harrison's character was indead a replicant. Yet Harrison Ford later, said that the character, Decker, was always meant to be a human. Somewhat used in the film to identify replicants are irredescent reflection in the eyes. Decker, although blurred, once had this irredescence. Was it a mistake( falling in line with the many other discrepancies that plague this films masterpeice title), or a hint?	5.0	panel of 60 scientist voted it as the greatest sci-fi movie.	2005-02-05	3	3	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	What happens when you take a dark and moody movie set in a futuristic Los Angeles, take out the voice over and add a few minutes of footage...? You get a cure for insomnia. I'm sorry, I think Harrison Ford is a very good actor and I love his role in this film. I realize he did not want to do the voice over in the original cut but this movie screams for it. Ridley Scott in my opinion is a hit and miss director. He seems to think he knows more about what we like to see as entertainment then we do. There is good news and bad news about this Directors Cut. The good news first. Artistically, this movie is incredible, absolutely stunning. The production design was worth every bit of praise. Never has there been to this day a better looking futuristic city in the movies. Visually it's timeless and beautiful. The characters and scenes are well shot and inspiring. The story is a good one, too. A small group of escaped manufactured humans looking for freedom. Ford is very good in his character as the Blade Runner who is sent to destroy them. This all sets the stage for a very intriguing morality play. They may be manufactured, but they are still human, shouldn't they have the right to live? This is basically what the movie talks about. Now the bad news. Scott's pacing is so slow and cumbersome (come on Ridley how long do we have to look at every scene?) that boredom sets in. I'm not asking for fast paced action or explosions, I realize this is Science Fiction and there is a story unfolding here, but there are scenes that don't even do anything to keep your attention. In addition, the original novels were inspired as pieces of futuristic Sci Fi detective film noir. The voiceover helped establish that, it also helped keep the movie going at the slower scenes. I am the first one to say that movie executives don't have a clue as to what movies are supposed to be like but in this one instance they were right. The movie needed a boost. Ford may not have liked doing it but even though he purposely did it poorly, it still fits the movie. His deadpanned tone and lack of inflections are a throwback to the detective stories like Philip Marlow and Mike Hammer. I was extremely disappointed in the directors cut, only because of the lack of voice over. I think it added more to the morality and substance, it brought to the front of the mind the questions the movie was trying to make you think about. I did like the alternate ending and the dream sequence, very interesting if not ambiguous. But it could have stood with the original. I still give this movie two stars because it's still a visually exciting movie to this day, but you can only look at a movie for so long before it pushes the boundaries of your attention.	2.0	Big Mistake	2001-08-29	39	27	12

While I am glad that all versions are included in this 4-disc set, The Final Cut is the best version of the movie, by far, and is further enhanced by the gorgeous print and outstanding audio brought together for this latest release of the film.Harrison Ford himself has stated that they did 6 takes of the narration which just never worked, and I wholeheartedly agree. While in theory it seemed to fit with the film noir aspect of the film, it was poorly done and detracted rather than added to it. The narration, along with the extremely cheesy ""happy ending"", were mandated by the studio and almost dumb down the film and remove some of its character in a way that doesn't happen with the Director's Cut and this latest Final Cut version.The continuity fixes, the audio and visual fixes and the bonus extras make this an extremely worthwhile addition to your DVD collection, regardless of whether you already own any previous format or version of Blade Runner."	5.0	The Final Cut is the ultimate version in a fantastic set	2007-12-29	6	4	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1VTHUZIN04QQW	Jeremiah J. Timmins	"... quote attributed to Roy Batty, Nexus 6 Combat Model.  Designed for optimum self-sufficiency.  A fine product of the Tyrell Corporation.  ""More human than human.""LA, in the early 21st century, when old, abused, and greenhouse gassed Earth is inhabited only by the [humans] who can't make it off-world, or the decadents who revel in the multi-culti fin-de-cycle atmosphere of a depopulated city, six replicants - genetically designed slaves with a short lifespan - have arrived to meet their maker and be granted an extension to their lives.Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop who specializes in spotting and 'retiring' rogue replicants.  He must find the surviving four skinjobs and air 'em out.  But who is Deckard?  Why is Dr. Tyrell so callous about creating life designed for enslavement?  Is it because he's seen every inch of a human under the most microscopic detail and he has never come across the soul?  Perhaps he felt different after his talk with the prodigal son, Roy Batty, who defied incredible odds to meet his father.The performances in this movie were outstanding.  Rutger Hauer will always be Roy Batty for me.  Incredibly tough, enigmatic, brilliant, and dangerous.  The star list in this movie is awesome.  A great collection of A-list actors, and plenty from the B-list who do a A-list job.  One cool actor was Joe Turkel, who I've only seen in two other movies: Paths of Glory and The Shining, where he played the ghostly bartender Loyd.  Turkel plays a very, very good Dr. Tyrell.  ""The candle that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast, Roy.  And you have shined so very, very brightly.""I could go on and on about how well the casting was done, but just see it for yourself.  Everyone here is a standout on their own, but together they're one powerful cast.By the way, this movie is about the director's cut of the movie.  Don't go for the one with the voiceover.  That's a piece of garbage.  Apparently, the producers thought the movie was too hard to understand, so they insisted on a voiceover, a cheesy ending, and a bunch of changes to make the film more marketable.  When you look at the sales of the director's cut vs. the original, you'll see who knew how to make a good story - Scott.  And as long as the story's good, the movie will sell, regardless of whether or not she'll live.  But then again, who does?Also, if you're a Floyd fan, put in Wish You Were Here and turn on Blade Runner.  After the Ladd Company tree symbol (who the hell were they, anyway?), when you first see ""Jerry Perenchio & Bud Yorkin presents,"" hit play on the album.  The album and movie match up really well.  The best part is that ""Welcome to the Machine"" starts just as Deckard is being shown the replicants he has to chase down.Sci-Fi as an authentic form of expression uses scientifically valid concepts to bring a story about humanity into our reality.  This movie completes this perfectly.-- JJ Timmins"	5.0	Not an easy thing to meet your maker...	2002-12-18	11	8	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A20UNRL041U3E0	Jeremy Clark	Ridley's Scott's Director's Cut is science fiction at its finest, and it's one of the few films that I view on a regular basis.  The final scene between Batty and Deckard remains one of the most poignant moments in cinema for me.  As for the implication that Deckard might be a Replicant, as the unicorn dream suggests to some, I find the notion mere whimsy.  To me, the whole point as well as the heart of the story is Batty's evolution to humanity along with Deckard's reawakening to his own humanity, as evidenced by Batty's ultimate compassionate act and Deckard's soulful wordlessness toward that act.  I do agree that an edition should be released containing the Director's Cut as well as the original version, perhaps even the unrated original version where the viewer is able to witness Tyrell's skull being crushed.  As much as the Director's Cut is unquestionably superior in my mind, the original would allow for entertaining comparisons between the two, and itself is far from a bad film once you subtract the dreadfully upbeat ending.  It took numerous viewings of the Director's Cut before I grew accustomed to not hearing Deckard's voice-over narration; it was a nice, if unnecessary, touch.  Anyhow, such a special edition would be right at home among the Criterion Collection.	4.0	Not an easy thing to meet your maker.	2000-09-28	4	4	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2P1AXQAYKA60U	JeremyG	This is not a simple film.  This is not a film that one can watch simply to watch.  In fact, such a tactic will ultimately cause dislike for this film.  This is not a detective story with a good guy and a bad guy, nor it  is a shallow pit of special effects.Imagine reading a novel: Heart of  Darkness for instance.  Was Conrad's purpose in writing this book simply to  tell a story?  If you believe so, then don't bother with this film.  Return  to your shelf of those new and popular releases: to your Varsity Blues and  your to your Blair Witch Project.  Bladerunner is not a film to watch for  simple enjoyment.  It can be enjoyed but not until after it is disected.  So if your deconstructionist skills are always in practice and you are  looking to experience the greatest color experience, then this is the film  for you.	5.0	Greatest Color Film Ever	1999-12-08	31	21	10

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2EH58PUNO0XM9	Jeremy Hogue	This is the only movie that I can recall where the director's version is worse than the theatrical release.  The loss of the narrative (which was the only way I understood the movie the first time I saw it) is not worth the brief unicorn dream scene that was added back.  I remember an interview (I think it was with Johnny Carson) where Rutger Hauer mentioned the unicorn dream scene and was shocked to find out that it was cut from the theatrical release.  When the director's cut came out, my dad and I saw it on VHS and were both terribly dissapointed.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3CNGJUKED1G9Q	Jeremy M. Newburg-rinn	"This movie is astounding; it is about love, and what it means to be human.  Harrison Ford plays an essential role; but it is Rutger Hauer who makes you love and makes tears come to your eyes.  When you see his vision and beauty, it etches itself on your memory; every moment of life, and every act and sight, falling short of beauty (and love) is compared, and found pale, and the need is to make it beautiful.  That is, an inspiration toward life.  Hauer is vibrant in this role.  Nothing could be more moving than his performance in the latter scenes of the film.  Just about every word, action, and facial expression is worth your attention.Don't worry about ideas, or cognitive questions, maybe not even about ""moral questions.""  It is deeper than that, and the only adequate response to poetry is poetry, or love.

This version doesn't try to give you redundant information or a happy end. The new great end shows that all that we are,  all that we think, all our fantasies and deeper feelings could be unreal, a  ghost in our minds.  A happy end isn't always necessary.

The production, visual, attention-to-detail is superb thanks to Ridley Scott; the soundtrack is awesome enough to stand on its own as an amazing score provided by the master musician Vangelas; the story, based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, was masterfully edited and retold; and the actors Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and more.

Aside from the out-dated effects and crappy acting, it didn't even make sense. I have a hard time sympathizing with a ROBOT. Great, it has feelings. By that standard Short Circuit is a filmmaking masterpiece too. IRobot made a statement about society, but I don't see that here. You want to see a filmmaking masterpiece from the 80's? Go watch Conan the Barbarian. If you can't see how well that film was made then don't tell me I'm close minded because I can't see the greatness of this cheese-fest. People need to grow up.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ADENS68K21AQM	J.Gill	How many films mark an era in film making like Blade Runner? I've been fascinated by this movie since it came out back in '82. I was only 11, but I remember reading the Marvel comic, the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and eventually in college adding the vcr tape to my collection in it's various released editions. Finally the ultimate collection looks to be available very shortly and I find myself just as excited as when I first heard 'the guy who played Han Solo is in a new movie..!' 25 years ago.I've seen outtake stills and skimmed through the 'making of' books with much curiosity. Learning behind the scene facts about how miserable it was on the set at times and how Harrison Ford had a reputation for not 'liking' the film. This stuff always fascinated me. To think, that the creation of such a creative project could harbor with in it's working process so many negativities and still come out in my mind as perfect was very interesting to me. Time and again, I'd view this movie and see wires lifting up ships and dialog miss cues (that are apparently to be corrected in this latest version)and think that they were done for effect, not by mistake. I guess that's how much I wanted to love this film and still do.You can bet I'll be all over this brief case edition. To watch the new version and cherish the old, mistakes and all.	5.0	The Wait Is Over...	2007-08-07	9	9	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3A3J8FPELQV9L	J. Halmos	First the bad news. This is quite a lame transfer. Perhaps I got spoiled by the free copy of Bug's Life that came with my iMac DV SE. But man would I like Scorsese and his team of movie refurbishers to have a go at this  one. There is just way too much grain on the DVD transfer; like using 1000  ASP film and no flash to shoot the first dance at a wedding. No bells and  whistles either with the DC. I new I was in for it when I saw the dreadful  artwork on the cover. You gotta love Helvetica; such an expressive  font.The good news? Without the drab, spoon-feeding narration to fill up  those mean and nasty moments of silence (sheesh!) there is a newfound  tension between Rachel and Deckard. Without the narration, we are brought a  whole level closer to the story, and have to fend for ourselves during  moments of anti-voiceover. Whereas with the narration, we were simply  passers-by.This film is all mood. Slow yourself down. Pick a late  evening. No one else in the room. No popcorn. And slip into the film's  pace. You'll have a far richer experience with the DC, simply because  you'll notice more.	4.0	I've seen things you people wouldn't dream...	2000-03-19	17	13	4

You may love the movie, the characters, music, storyline, mood, photography, and directing as much as I and other friends and family do, but you do not have an obligation to buy into the ending of the director's cut. The director made that choice.Buy this film. Use it for discussions of the many ideas expressed, enjoy it, be saddened by it, be moved deeply by its messages. All the while, remember, while the director is talented and gifted in many ways, his alternative ending isn't The True One, or the 'right' one; his alternative ending is HIS interpretation. It isn't even the one the author wrote.All of us have the freedom and obligation to use our imaginations, make interpretations, and utilize the subjects raised in a movie, book, or short story.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1VAF3FRW24H81	Jim M.	Normally, I would post this as feedback for the sellers; however, this is a larger issue than that.  I ordered this from two different companies and both copies had a deep, two-inch long gash in the case.  It was the same size and at the same location for both copies (I had not yet returned the first one when the replacement I ordered arrived today).  In each case, the gash was covered up by a label - laid right across the gash to conceal it - at least most of it.  I write this here because it may be a supplier issue rather than a seller issue since the same defect was covered up the same way with the same type label when ordered from two distinct companies - at least the company names are distinct.I did not open the cases to inspect the damage to the DVDs because I wanted to return the DVDs unopened so they could see the damage.If you order this awesome movie from an Amazon Marketplace business, check under the labels before opening the DVD - it is very noticeable.JimPS - I gave the movie a 5-star rating because it deserves it - I can't see taking away stars for what is being sold cheaply probably because of known, but undivulged to us customers, damage to the packaging by several Amazon Marketplace companies.	5.0	Beware the Packaging	2011-07-06	1	1	0

My opinion is that Harrison Ford makes it so good.  He is 100% in character in Blade Runner as a tough but reluctant replicant hunter.Another thing I like is the way you can almost feel sorry for the replicants.  They didn't have a choice in their fate and they seem to have a legitimate reason for the havoc they are creating.  The end of the fight scene between H. Ford and R. Hauer (when the replicant dies) always chokes me up.I could go on for a long time on this one... but the bottom line is:Blade Runner has set the mark by which all other SciFi films will be judged for a long time.	4.0	My favorite SciFi movie...	2002-03-13	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3OD7GOXPSO9Z	JLR	"Answer: This movie, appearing on every list of not only the greatest science-fiction films of all time, but the best movies ever made. ""Blade Runner"" is a movie that you have to not only see, but own, because it's one of the few monumental American classics, along with ""Casablanca"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""The Third Man"", ""Vertigo"" and ""The Godfather"", that gets better by age. Like most of these movies, ""Blade Runner"" was a critical and commercial bomb, ludicrously dismissed as style over substance, for lacking a coherent story and for its one-dimensional human characters. Seen today, in a time of economic recession, class division and the state's utter disregard to come in human terms, ""Blade Runner"" feels more modern and relevant than ever.Why is ""Blade Runner"" one of the greatest movies of all time? I could write a lengthy review describing the movie's greatness, but I'll do the movie greater service by listing the reasons:1.) It's a simple story, brilliantly told, tightly paced and superbly directed. A retired police officer is forced by the police state to hunt down (or ""retire"") a group of bio-engineered cyborgs called Replicants. Under Ridley Scott's tight direction, the movie is a gripping experience as we see the main character struggle to fulfill his obligations and survive. The opening sequence where Leon is interrogated as rather or not he's a Replicant and the scenes where Deckard is pursuing Pris in a room cluttered with mannequins are as suspenseful as the best of Hitchcock.2.) The acting is utterly terrific. Harrison Ford probably gave the greatest performance of his career as the replicant hunter Deckard. Ford hated the movie and called it a miserable experience, yet in some ways, this helped add greater depth to his character, as we see Deckard's anguish, frustration and anger simmering throughout the movie. Sean Young is outstanding as the Replicant assistant Rachael and her scenes with Deckard, where he tries to teach her about love in his apartment, have an emotional intensity barely found in other sci-fi movies. Darryl Hannah made a huge impression as the lonely and tragic Pris and Edward James Olmos provides comic relief as the officer Gaff, who raises an ambiguous question at the end that still resonates to this day. But the highest acting honor, of course, belongs to Rutger Hauer, as Roy Batty, the movie's main antagonist. Subtle yet dangerous, a menace to society yet one with tragic grandeur, Hauer's Batty may rank as one of the greatest and most memorable villains in movie history.3.) ""Blade Runner"" successfully continues the tradition that has defined science-fiction movies in decades, in that it presents the central theme that the most humane characters are in the fact the most inhuman. Despite their supposed lack of humanity, Roy Batty and Pris are arguably the most sympathetic characters in movie, primarily because they are outcasts who refuse to blend in to an oppressive society (see below). In fact, the general complaint about ""Blade Runner"" when it was released was that the replicants were more interesting than the hero, when that was precisely the point. There's a disturbing sequence where Deckard is hunting down a female replicant and instead of having the audience root for him, the movie defies conventions and has us hoping that the replicant escapes (there's even a hint in the movie's finale that Deckard himself may be a replicant). At the end, when Batty chooses his fate, you feel a great sense of sadness for this inhuman yet paradoxically humane character.4.) No other movie, not even ""2001"" or ""Metropolis"", captures the feeling of being displaced, oppressed and and dehumanized in an oppressive society. One of the biggest reasons for the movie's initial failure was that it presented such a dark vision of a world where privacy is lacking, noise is abundant and commercialism runs rampant throughout the city. The sets, outfits, the insufferable rain and the cluttering masses on the street create a feeling of powerlessness, a feeling that prevents people from having the free will to be themselves. Deckard is a perfect example of that, as he is powerless towards a quasi-fascist police state that determines his fate or he will be part of the ""little people"". The movie is, for all its futuristic technology, is an expressive drama.5.) ""Blade Runner"" has one of the best musical scores ever made. Composed by ""Chariots of Fire"" conductor Vangelis, the music is a groundbreaking merge of futuristic synthesizers, organic compositions and even an element of jazz, as seen in the beloved ""Love Theme"", with its beautiful saxophone solo. You can listen to this music without seeing the film and imagine the whole movie in your head.6.) ""Blade Runner"" seems more relevant and prophetic today than it was released in 1982. Critics and moviegoers were taken back by seeing such dark, dreary vision, a vision where the rich care so little about the poor that they form a hostile, miserable ghetto. Yet walk down the inner slums of any city, from Los Angeles in early 1990s and Moscow to Tokyo and that vision is there before our eyes. Technology, which was supposedly man's gift to preserve humanity, has slowly overtaken our human traits, making us cold, mechanical and increasingly dependent on machinery.And yet...7.) The movie, despite its darkness, ends with a suggestion of hope. When Batty spares Deckard's life and delivers that immortal monologue which has earned its place in cinema, this scene suggests a promising hope in the future: that machines and human, instead of striving to dominate the other, can live side-by-side in harmony. This is not a hippie message, but a heartfelt plea for everyone in diverse groups to coexist and accept one another.""Blade Runner"" is one of the American cinema's most towering achievements and an institution for every science-fiction entity that has come afterwards, from ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"" to ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Cowboy Bebop"", from the fantastical adventures by Hayao Miyazaki, to the grim, political fables by Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron. Even ""The Fifth Element"", in some ways, plays like a sunny, cartoony alternative to this grim classic. It is essential that you watch ""Blade Runner"", even if you don't like it (which is highly doubtful). If you even think of starting a Blu-Ray/DVD collection without it, then you are simply just one of the ""little people"".Strongest recommendation to steal at all costs.P.S. Like many great movies, ""Blade Runner"" has come out in a variety of editions, each of them a worthy purchase. There was a five-disc ultimate collector's edition that came out on both DVD and Blu-Ray. That is currently out of print. In its place, there was 30th anniversary edition released in two box sets: a multi-format version (with that memorable Asian face on the front cover) and a three-disc set released with only Blu-Rays (that's the one with the unicorn on the front cover). Either version you watch is fine, but if you just want the Blu-Rays in an affordable set, go with the three-disc set. Besides nearly a dozen hours of supplements, the picture and audio qualities are excellent. Since ""Blade Runner"" is an intensely visual experience, it is highly recommended that you watch it on a big screen and with big speakers. As the saying goes, the bigger, the better...in everything."	5.0	It's too bad we won't live. But then again, who does?	2014-03-05	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AIDEXI30F4YIA	jmarshal	This has always been one of my favorite old sci-fi movies. But in the &#34;Final Cut&#34; version Ridley Scott removed almost all of Harrison Ford's narration. This totally killed the retro film-noir vibe that the original movie had, which was one of my favorite things about it. As someone who's seen this movie many times, I can say that that the most memorable lines in the film for me, were in the narration.So if you're a fan of the original Blade Runner, I wouldn't recommend renting this version; you'll be disappointed.	2.0	Ridley Scott's Changes Ruined a Great Movie	2012-12-19	5	1	4

Ford's narration adds so much to the movie.  The  so-called &quot;phony happy ending&quot;, though silly, makes sense to the  movie.  If the alternate ending for &quot;Stigmata&quot; was shown on the  DVD, then both endings for Blade Runner should be shown on the DVD. I think  it's a travesty of justice in this unfair world that one cannot find a copy  of this version, the non-director's cut, anywhere.  Not on VHS, not on DVD,  not even on Amazon.com.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A16ZX2QUEWQXRQ	joe buck	An amazing sci-fi movie that demonstrates alot of depth not only through its storyline, but also through its images.  Ridley Scott's use of &quot;selective focus&quot; is amazing during one of the most powerful scenes in the movie - a scene between Rutger Hauer and the actor who played his maker.  Superb!As well, the special effects put alot of todays CG animated movies to shame.  Model effects are still great when done properly, and dare I say, they still sometimes pale CG in quality.Overall, Ridley has created a rich world, as he normally loves to do.  We see this as well in Gladiator, though that one was not quite as good as this...	4.0	Beautiful Cinematography	2001-04-25	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1AFPMDDYNZ244	Joe Fiori	"It goes without saying, how fantastic it is to have so many different cuts of Blade Runner in one package.  I also don't need to mention how stunning ""The Final Cut"" is.  If you're buying this set, then you already know that.  The cool brief case, the toys inside, blah, blah blah.  A dream come true, all of it, sure.  But what turns out to be the best part?  Two words:  Dangerous Days.For rabid fans of the movie, the ones who immersed themselves in the conspiracy theories and the history of the movie.  The fans who obsessed over Paul Sammon's ""Future Noir"".  Dangerous Days is one of the most comprehensive ""Making of"" features I have ever seen.  Over 3 hours long, covering the genesis of the movie from the novel through it's release.  The new interviews, not only with cast, but also the producers, Ridley himself, but most importantly, the crew.  It's just remarkable hearing from the art department responsible for what has become one of the most visually influential movies of all time.The truth is, I have no idea why I'm writing this review, other than to gush over this answer to a fanboy's prayers.  But you don't need to hear it from me.  If you are like minded, then you ordered this set, months ago and I'm not telling you anything new.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AT1V9I77R6NOL	joe kavanagh	Reviews of cult classics are tricky enough to begin with (never slam publicly on a cult favorite) but with the various manifestations of Blade  Runner we have double the fun.  That said...I like both the original and  the directors cut.  The directors cut demands more of the non-sci-fi  initiated and puts many off.  Rent the movie first if you are unsure and  decide then.  Now the real reason I write:  this &quot;special  edition&quot; DVD release is a terrible dissapointment.  The &quot;special  extras&quot; are not worth the money and when you compare the availabe  features to any Criterion release...it is just sad and pathetic.  This  movie deserved more attention to detail - at the very least to help some  viewers with the vague complexity of the story.  Buy a tape for now and  save your money for another release.	2.0	Please save your money	2000-08-17	8	7	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2VHIKZVOZ1CXJ	Joel Bass	3 things bothered me. 1. Bad sound. This is a movie, like &quot;Star Wars&quot; in which the soundtrack plays a huge role, and my normally booming DVD player suddenly sounded like an AM radio. 2. The whole film seemed very jumpy. You'll notice this in the opening credits, which are fuzzy and occasionally bump up and down. Is this a film that needs to be restored? If so, somebody please do it.  3.  Extra features - where were they? For all its faults, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is a work of art, and deserves DVD extras at least as impressive as those of &quot;Fight Club&quot;, perhaps even the full &quot;Brazil&quot; treatment. Where are the storyboards, the making-of, the director's commentary? My dream is that Criterion or somebody gets their hands on this beautiful film and gives it the DVD it deserves.	2.0	Great movie, crappy DVD	2000-10-07	7	5	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A29PCQFO8JCYL3	Joe Vanderbilt	The movie itself is a materpiece of cinematography. I remember watching it as a kid of 11 and just being in awe of how awful a place LA was made out to be and how true its decline seemed.  In the movie, LA seemed to have been overrun by an Asian population, was in an utter state of decay, and everything was dark because you couldn't see the sun for all the smog and rain. Perhaps this is what it will look like in the far future when we get to the point where we can live on other worlds. People will leave the Earth in droves and head for other planets, just like today people leave the inner city and flock to the suburbs.The DVD itself is lacking, what with 2.0 sound instead of 5.1 and what looks like a lasterdic transfer. The movie itself more than makes up for it. Here's to hoping Ridley Scott gets to make a definitive version of his movie before he dies if the fool at Univision who owns this film ever lets him.** Here be spoilers ***Reasons why the Director's Cut is better in my opinion:1) No cheesy voiceover. If you need a voiceover to figure out what's going on, just watch it again and pay attention.2) No cheesy happy ending. It's enough of a happy ending that Deckard leaves with Rachael at the end.3) Removed gore for gore's sake. I don't need to see Tyrell's eyes being gouged out, thank you, in order to figure out what awful thing is going on. You can form your own mental image of what's happening as Rutger Hauer's sweaty face shakes and contorts from inhuman exertion while Tyrell screams.4) The unicorn. Ridley may not have intended for Deckard to be a replicant at its original release, and it may not even be be the unicorn scene that was shot for Blade Runner, but it is a thought-provoking concept. Deckard believes he is a human with as much conviction as Rachael did, except nobody has told him otherwise. Likewise, he has no reason to believe otherwise because he has memories - albeit artificial - to backup his sense that he is human.How does anyone know they're human when science and technology reach the level that they are in Blade Runner?  Memories?  The fact that you look and act like everyone else?  You can't be certain.	5.0	Incredible film.  Director's Cut is so much better.	2004-07-24	5	2	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3O4V8GPCYDR2Q	john a. iaria	Well this is the &quot;directors cut&quot;, usually this means they put in the previously edited portions that end up on the floor.  In General this is good, as has been shown in directors cuts of both Dune and Terminator 2 (I understand they cut out 45 minutes of Highlander, that they included in the UK version that had his feelings about living that long in favor of offering us blow up things happy americans shorter waits between action sequences, I am still waiting to see that one). However the perhaps 10-15 minutes they cut out of blade runner, and put back in do not make up for the ongoing thought verbalized in Harrison Ford's head.  Ok sure they make you think perhaps that Harrison Ford is a replicant himself with the vision of the unicorn, and Edward James Olmos character(perhaps his first job on sceen before Miami Vice?) leaving a unicorn origami, lending one the idea that perhaps the police dept knew more about Harrison Ford than he himself did, but that in No way makes up for the superb remeniscing done by Ford as the movie moves along, I even Showed my 15 year old son the whole DVD and then took out a VHS copy I had from an old showtime or HBO version of the original and played the ends back to back and even he agreed the original explained more about the characters thoughts and made the movie not only more intelligent but more desirable.  The Dvd ends in blackness, while the original cut has them flying over what is perhaps virgin North American Forests giving you the hope that they found happiness as Harrison Ford remarks, true they did not give an inception date for Rachel, but then again as Gaff said who knows how long we may have.  The end of the original, much as less the internal musings of Harrison Ford on the original cut are supremely superior to the directors cut, and if the original cut makes it to DVD i would buy it in an instant and sell my &quot;directors cut&quot; , which not to be redundant, however breaks the mold of directors cuts being better, this one is actually a disgrace to the original cut!!!	4.0	Not as Good as the original cut!	2001-07-12	10	5	5

Back then story didn't matter, but the special effects were  truly amazing. It holds up even better in its new format. The Narration and  ridiculous &quot;Happy&quot; ending were removed( I didn't think they  belonged either.), and the result is pure genius. The story takes time to  digest, but to me dosen't really matter as the pace works slow , but really  well edited and made. This film actually has 5 different Versions that were  created over a period of years, and if you want to know more, a great book  on the subject is: Future Noir: The making of Blade Runner by Paul M  Sammon. Very Comprehensive, with some neat tidbits about the film, even you  didn't know. Like the Electron Microscope Image of the &quot;snake  scale&quot; DEckard gives to the woman at the shop to analyze is actually a  Electron Microscope image of a Female Marijuana plant!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AQLZFWVUC7SQF	John C	I saw this film when it first came out and had mixed feelings when leaving the theater. I admired the production design or as we say the look of it and admired Rutger Hauer's galvanizing performance. The rest of the film and other performances stuck in my mind to this day. I watched the Final Cut on DVD and last night I watched the Blu-ray.  Although the DVD looked very good upscaled to 1080p on my Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray disc was stunning.  This is one of the best Blu-rays you will ever see & hear especially if you listen to the Dolby TruHD soundtrack. Do not hesitate to buy this disc. The careful restoration was approved by the director Ridley Scott and you know visuals are his trademark. The remixing of the soundtrack is impressive in its clarity and depth.I won't go into a detailed comparison of the original version and this one which you can read elsewhere as each one has their champions. I will agree with those who miss Harrison Ford's voiceover. Originally the film was conceived as a film noir detective story from the 1940's transported into the future. Supposedly the studio added the narration because they felt audiences couldn't follow the plot. Some accounts said it sounded flat because Ford was against using it and didn't put his heart into it. I thought it worked as he sounded world weary adding more dimension to his tired character. Voiceover worked in Bogart films and other film noirs so this technique worked for me in this film.The final version omits this narration and I do miss it especially for Ford's comment about why Hauer's character saved his life. The film does work without the  voiceover but I'm not sure if that's due to me seeing the original film several times and reading about it. I'd like to hear from people who never saw the original version to see if they had trouble following the plot without the voiceover.Another omission is the more positive relaxed ending where Deckard and Rachael are seen miles way on their way to safety. I think that version works too but some like the unsure frantic ending of the final cut, It seems to me both versions of the film work in their own way and luckily both are available for fans. I would have liked to seen a cross between both versions using Scott's technical tweaking and the voiceover and alternate ending, but that's just me. Anyway 'Blade Runner' is a great film in any version and all the better on Blu-ray. And I won't touch the argument that Deckard might be a Replicant.	5.0	A stunning Blu-ray	2014-03-15	0	0	0

This is the one I first saw, and the one I watched repetitively throughout the 1980's on cable movie channels.  I am in no way slamming the new cuts, which on their own are excellent.  Nevertheless, I wanted to be able to watch the original even with its campy noir narration.	5.0	has the original theatrical version	2013-07-24	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJPB8YA3EESEO	John Cooney	"I'm one who has seen and own both versions of Blade Runner, unfortunately the original (or ""Criterion's"" version) is unavailable on DVD.  The movie as a whole is excellent for a film of 1982, its graphic imagery and imagination matches that of Lucas and the Star Wars Saga of the same time period.  It's visually stunning with more unveiling suspenseful drama than action, to keep you glued to the film.Where the film falls short however is in the ""Director's"" choice of presenting the film.  Alot of Harrison Ford character's thought dialog (found in the Criterion Collection) is axed from the film, in favor of the Director's cut.  This can leave the viewer, who has never seen the film, lost as to what is going on.  The thought dialogs add ALOT to the film, as to who the replicant's are, his knowledge of the replicant's history (when he picks up a set of photos, his thoughts ask ""why... because replicants don't have families"" for example.  Information that makes the direction of his search more understandable, ""vital"", and less confusing.), his thoughts to why he retired from the Blade Runner force, and more.  The Director's Cut is a real hack job to the original and makes the new script very weak.  I can only hope that the ""Criterion"" version may soon be released, as Blade Runner is an excellent film and NEEDS to maintain its original strong storyline.  To those who may be searching, the ""Criterion"" version may only be found on the large laser discs (as it's been phased out after the Director's Cut release)."	2.0	Blade Runner's Directors Cut does little justice	2003-02-15	19	10	9

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1MCGG7A9G93YI	John Galvin	"The film is an adaptation of the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, an early exponent of a science fiction genre called cyberpunk. As the film opens, we stare at a black screen up which creeps the establishing preamble: it is the year 2019 and the Tyrell Corporation is well into production of the nexus phase of robot design. The robots, now known as ""replicants,"" are nearly indistinguishable from their human counterparts. They have human intelligence but greater strength for which they are used in Off-world colonies as slave labor. Following a series of violent mutinies, their use and presence on Earth has been banned. And special police squads, called blade runner units, have been created to hunt down replicants, who have returned to Earth, and to kill--or retire--them.The story begins shortly after four replicants have killed their masters, hijacked a ship and made their way back to Earth, and, more specifically, to Los Angeles. There is considerable mystery as to why they would take such a risk in returning, but there is no time for wondering. They have already disabled the city's best blade runner. So, the police pressure a former department star, named Deckart, to rejoin the hunt despite his obvious distaste for the morally ambiguous activity of retiring replicants. Deckart knows that where there are big people and little people, the little do the bidding of the big. So, he reluctantly accepts and begins his search with a visit to the Tyrell Corporation itself. There he meets Rachel, a new-generation replicant with whom he will establish a bond of gratitude and love. With various leads and powers of observation and serendipitous detection reminiscent of the stuff of Philip Marlow, Deckart proceeds to hunt down and retire Lyn, Leon, Pris and then, maybe, Roy. But Roy will deliver Deckart a lesson in irony as he leads him back to his humanity through pain, fear, compassion and marvel.This is, undoubtedly, Scott at his finest in terms of design and composition. The world of 21st century L.A. is a world corrupt, broken and oppressed by its own success. It is a perpetual momento mori--a dark, limitless expanse, punctuated by a chaos of city lights and giant towers spitting fire heaven-ward in what looks like one giant refinery. The night is endless as is the rain, and the blare of neon seems an emphatic reminder of Deckart's remote, impassible stance--it is perception from an alienated vantage point--cold but illuminating. Interiors are choked with light and suffused with colors and a kind of luminous preciosity borrowed from Vermeer. Blues are too extraordinarily blue to be of this world and reinforce the dull swelter of the everyday. And such color schemes and oppressive gigantism do perfectly combine with this future's withered moral landscape to create a film so close to the values of original film noir that it has since been deemed its first related successor genre, neo-noir.So, if you're looking for something dark and lovely and militantly fatalistic, please consider Blade Runner (not the director's cut), starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah and Edward James Olmos."	4.0	Bladerunne: momento mori	2005-04-06	5	4	1

Dick's award-winning Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is one of the most memorable visions of the future presented to date.The film seizes upon one concept from Dick's novel, the universal question of what it means to be human, and explores it through the pursuit of a group of renegade replicants--androids made to serve on extraterrestial colonies and so increasingly life-like so as to be nearly indistinguishable from humans save for their limited life spans--by a bounty hunter or ""Blade Runner"" from which the film takes its title.Unlike Dick's novel in which the humanity of Deckard, the Blade Runner, is made clear and only questioned once, Ridley Scott reinforced the question of human nature by inserting a series of clues meant to suggest Deckard himself may be a replicant.The director's cut of the film removes a voice-over narration by star Harrison Ford without compromising the story and replaces the ""happy"" ending of the theatrical release with one darker and more poignant.  The rainy, dark, and post-apocalytpic future in which the film is set remains unchanged and as memorable as ever."	5.0	Exceptional Tale of What It Means to Be Human	2003-03-14	4	1	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1UI2N2LBGVKC7	"Johnny S Geddes ""OC"""	'Blade Runner' is really a phenomenon in the sense that never before has a would-be screen Leviathan bombed so badly, so quickly upon release. There's so much awe with which to hold this movie that that awe has itself become  sickeningly cliched over the years, as if the ranks of 'B.R.' admirers have  swelled beyond the intelligentsia clique that was there in the beginning.  But, to be fair, the mystique that has formed such a powerful undercurrent  over the years does indeed exist. Firstly, the casting is as flawless as  the academic merits of the story. Director Scott, still fresh from his  'Alien' phase, handled himself well in the driving seat, pulling class A+  results from a heavily invested-in set. The violence is sufficient for the  film and the pacing worked just fine.  So what went wrong after all  that? The answer could well lie in the novel feel behind 'Blade Runner'.  It's not sci-fi per se but, rather, is a shaky hybrid of Forties Film Noir  and a new type of Science Fiction which had really only been seen before in  the likes of 'Outland'. 1981 and 82 audiences weren't ready to receive this  marriage of styles - the counterfeit glory of the 'Star Wars' saga had  poisoned far, far too many minds for a break with formulaic convention to  be welcomed. Also, the picture was derived from the short story 'Do  Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?' which proved that it had an immediate  grounding in a thinking man's world. Unfortunately, Thinking men's films do  not sell well when put alongside Hollywood sugar-coats. The masses are just  too vain, surface-oriented and gluttonous to want to strain their brains  too far and there were far too many cerebral elements in 'Blade Runner' to  pass this acid test. The heavy leanings toward symbolism are alone proof of  this (your average everday moron just can't accommodate stuff like this in  his own mind). It goes to show that a good idea and a good film  transcription of that are far from being enough to make the end result sell  well. What makes 'Blade Runner' a classic is simply that it has been a  solid catalogue seller on video over the years. Thanks in particular to the  1992 tenth anniversary re-release, Ridley Scott's gem seems to have been  well and truly granted a posthumous type of respect, almost born of guilt  from those who had lacked the mental stamina to take it in '82.  Last  point: Vangelis's soundtrack (the 1994 CD release) is otherworldly to hear.  It is but one more piece of evidence to demonstrate that the film was an  expensive gamble that failed initially (through no fault of its own) but  then bounced back because its redeeming features were too numerous and  fundamental to let it be defeated. This is an anti space soap-opera and  therefore the perfect antidote to all this neo 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek'  hype. It is also Ridley Scott at his peak. 'Blade Runner' stands to this  day in a category all of its own - a one-off curiosity - the oddity  blockbuster with a small 'b' which is loved by many, more because many of  them think it's cool to love an underdog rather than because the vast  majority want to discuss the work's actual content. Nobody wants to be seen  to hate it.	4.0	Too smart  to succeed, too cult to fail	1999-12-09	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2KW8K3Q5PAO2F	John Peter O'connor	Loosely based on the novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by Philip K.Dick, Blade Runner is a landmark in SF film making. It is set in a near future in which great technological advances have merely brought their own problems rather than delivered some form of utopia. The particular problem of concern in this movie is that of replicants. These near perfect copies of humans are not allowed on Earth and when a small group lands illegally, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is called out of retirement to dispose of them.As the hunt continues, he finds himself becoming attached on Rachel, one of the replicants whom he has been sent to destroy. Where will his loyalties lie?This film works and appeals on many levels. Of course, superficially there is the thriller aspect of the movie. Will Deckard kill the bad guys? Will he get the girl? Will she be allowed to live? But there is also the dark display of the future world. Something such as this is far more convincing that the sort of slick clean and perfect future that seems to be the view of most prior works in this genre.Finally, there comes the whole matter of identity. Can the replicants really love? Should their lives be valued as much as those of the humans and finally, the big question raised by the film, is Deckard a human or a replicant given false memories and sent out to kill his own kind?This last matter caused a lot of controversy. In the original book, Dick feels that the matter is sufficiently important that he has Deckard submit to tests to prove that he is human. The movie is more ambiguous. Many year after making the film, director Ridley Scott claimed that Deckard was a replicant. Reports from the shooting of the film say that there was a dispute between the director and his star. Ford wanted the audience to be with Deckard and did not want conclusive evidence that the killer was a replicant. It is this very ambiguity and the questions that it raises that is at the heart of the film's enduring popularity.The movie is available in two different versions. The original version has a Raymond Chandler style voice over narrative done by Ford. This was forced on the director by the film's financial backers who feared that audiences would not follow the plot. The subsequent &quot;director's cut&quot; version drops this and adds a single dream sequence scene which is designed to reinforce the impression that Deckard is a replicant.In an ideal world, you could buy a DVD with both versions on it but sadly, you cannot do this. In that case, the director's cut version is truer to the intentions of the films creators and it is inevitable that anyone watching the earlier version will feel that they are missing something.	5.0	Stylish SF Film Noir	2001-01-29	8	8	0

Unfortunately, most of the movie takes place in dark rooms, intended to symbolize, perhaps, a dark future but serves only to underscore the unreality of the film.  Any real person going into any of the rooms in this film would open the drapes or turn on a light.  It is like the technical director is about 14 years old.And it is slow, possibly so that we don't miss the product placement.I know this is supposed to be noirish, but noir films always clip right along.  This drones along with a David Lynch obscurity (again, think 14 year old).  I think if I were stoned as I watched it I might think it was deep.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A8N0WM620H8RP	John Salerno	"I'm one of those purists who wants to see things in their original form, no matter how ""improved"" they may have become over time. For that reason, I chose to watch the Theatrical Cut of Blade Runner first, because I figured this is the way it was meant to be seen before the tinkering began.There are two main differences that I know of: the voice-overs exist in the original, but not the Director's Cut; and the original has a happier, more hopeful ending than the Director's Cut.Ironically, I found both of these things in the Theatrical Cut very distracting and out-of-place. In fact, the voice-overs really only exist in four or five small points during the first hour of the movie (and one at the end) and I don't feel like they really add to the story. There was one specific moment when a character used a term and I figured out the definition on my own, but then Harrison Ford's voice came on the screen explaining the term. Very unnecessary.Similarly, where the movie ends in the Director's Cut is exactly where I thought it was going to end in the Theatrical Cut, and yet it kept going. The message that we take from that original ending is basically the same as the message conveyed in the final words of the movie, so again the scene was unnecessary.Finally, I just read that Ridley Scott filmed the original movie *without* the voice-overs or the extra final scene, but the studio felt (as they tend to do) that the voice-overs were needed to help the audience understand what was going on, and naturally they wanted a happier ending.The movie itself is great, and I think it's probably even better without the voice-overs and the original ending. Anyone who says otherwise has either given it real thought (admirable) or simply wants to like the original better than any altered version (not as admirable).So my point is, if you are trying to decide which version to watch, I recommend the Director's Cut (assuming nothing else major has changed in it) simply because that was the real vision of the director, and in my opinion what it leaves out actually makes the movie better."	4.0	Theatrical Cut vs. Director's Cut	2009-02-01	2	2	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3CJKAXWFE7L8R	"John Smith ""Bad Johnny"""	"How does one perfect on perfection? Well, what little there was left to improve upon, director Ridley Scott found a way. Blade Runner has a checkered past. Its production was plauged with monumental problems from start to finish.Even with the changed ending and the naration added in, the theatrical release is still an incredible film to behold.For Ridley Scott who is a perfectionist, it went over budget causing issues with the studios. Upon its late summer release, Blade Runner was pitted against summer block busters like Star Trek II,E.T and surprise hits like Conan The Barbarian. With its dark story and content, it didn't stand a chance with the public's demand for ""feel good pictures"" and ""happy endings"".Flash forward 10 years and Blade Runner finds new life and appreciation with ""the director's cut"",the version that it was meant to be and be seen.And now 15 years following its director's cut re-release; Ridley Scott's ""Final Cut"" of Blade Runner is the ultimate masterpiece in Sci-Fi film noir.There is nothing to pick on in this version of Blade Runner, it is flawless and still to this day, I get goose bumps and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up from the opening scene of the not too distant future of the hellish,overpopulated,polluted horizon of 2019 Los Angeles. This is a captivationg story that most all of you know is based on the Phillip K. Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""As with most novels turned film, the screen play deviates quite a bit from the novel, but retains its basic elements and Dick's portrayl of a dark,dismal,over populated, disconnected,technology dependent and polluted future which doesn't stray too far from our present day reality. His ever questioning ""What makes us human?"" is the real character basis and drive in Blade Runner and ""Do we as humans have the right to play god?""Sumerized to its basics, Replicants are artifiscial humans that are genetically designed for combat or for dangerous,toxic work that humans cannot do.They are superior in strength and at least as intelligent as the scientists and engineers who designed them.Problems with replicants caused their makers to instill a four year life span and after some escape and find their way back to L.A, our plot thickens. Deckard is an Ex cop/Blade Runner.Someone who hunts down illegal replicants and retires them.After he is forced back into service, he is put on the case to flush out the tresspassing humanoids and dispose of them.On that journey, he uncovers far more as the case unravels.To tell more would ruin seeing the film if you haven't seen it already. You really have to like ""film noir"" and with Blade Runner's Sci-Fi roots and dark atmosphere, it just really melds perfectly with the screen play. Harrison Ford is as dry and strait arrow of a character as you could think of. Hardned from his past as a Blade Runner and alomst as emotionless as those he hunts.Not enough can be said about what it really means to have  excellent writers in tune with the material they put to screen. Blade Runner also has probably the most incredible cinemaphotography seen on screen in 80's cinema.It is beautifully photographed frame to frame and scene to scene, and  let's not forget about the amazing visual effects produced by Douglas Trumbol.Next to Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner is probably amongst the last Sci-Fi masterpieces of visual effects.All was done practically with flawless matte paintings,light,smoke and superbly hand crafted film miniatures long before computers and CG became a regular tool at the disposal of directors and FX studios.If you are a true fan of cinema, sci-fi and great story telling, no DVD library should be without Blade Runner. I've been a huge fan of Blade Runner since its debut and while many don't like or appreciate the original theatrical release it is still a fine film even with the flaws.However, to find true appreciation of this film masterpoiece, ""The Final Cut"" is about as perfect as it gets.It has been digitally ""cleaned up"", but really only one scene CG enhanced to mark a monumental improvement  and eye sore over the original.This is Ridley Scott's finest film I.M.O and it is shameful that he was passed up for recognition let alone an Oscar and that the film was passed over for multiple Oscar nominations at the time so long ago.What could be more perfect than a film that keeps coming back that no one really forgets as it rises from the ashes like a Pheonix to be re-invented?If you love film, film noir and good sci-fi you will never tire of this film.I can watch it over and over and always discover something new. Most films fade away, but its the true classic that never dies and sears itself into your memory, and Blade Runner ""The Final Cut"" is one of them."	5.0	"""The fire that burns twice as bright burns for half as long, and you have burned so very,very brightly Roy."""	2011-08-01	3	3	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJ2MCPOPJA6EY	John Stratton	...Or it would have been, if you were able to pick it up a year ago or so. Through the latter half of 2011 the blu-ray set ofBlade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] was selling for about $30.00. The price was a steal as everything about that set looked beyond beautiful. It also included a fifth disc with the much-talked-about work print of the film. Unfortunately the price on both sets is now quite a bit higher than thirty bucks. As this is something like a quintuple dip, the true time to make this purchase has passed for me. I'll be sticking with my five disc collector's edition blu-ray, as it lacks nothing in picture quality, sound quality or added content. Knowledge is power when spending money. Purchase wisely.	5.0	The Five Disc Complete Collector's Edition is the one to grab...	2012-05-25	33	19	14
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2YSEZCP1O40FA	John Tanner	I saw Blade Runner in the theater years ago and thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time. The characters were struggling with the meaning of humanity itself in a dark futuristic setting. But all the darkness was worthwhile because in the end things work out very well for some of the characters. I definitely would have rated this movie with 5 stars.When I learned that the DVD version was out, I immediately bought it and watched it. When it was over, I was outraged. They cut the good ending. The Director's cut was NOT the same as I saw in the theater. Because they didn't have another ending to put in, this version has no ending. It just suddenly quits. They also cut the narration throughout which served to explain the movie. Because I had already seen the movie in the theater, I didn't much miss the narration until the end of the climactic scene near the end on the rooftop. The narration there in the theater version really added a lot.My recommendation is that if you want to see a dark 3-star movie, buy this. However, if you are expecting the great 5-star movie you saw in the theater, DON'T BUY THIS. I very much disagree with the review by Jim Emerson that says the director's cut was better than the original theater version. The movie executives knew best that the narration was needed to give viewers the full import of what was happening. They also knew that most people want a happy ending.I also recommend that Blade Runner fans petition the studio to release the theatrical version to DVD. I'd buy that one in a second.	3.0	Disappointed by Director's Cut	2001-05-21	22	14	8

The Faustian, Frankenstein theme of the replicants coming to meet their maker--and killing him...the idea of Pris kicking with zest even as she dies, and Roy saving Decker out of sheer love of life...the light that burns half as long burns twice as bright (my paraphrase)...just a few of the many precious things in this great work of art.	5.0	My Favorite Movie of All Time	2007-11-29	7	5	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AXYEW4EJR2BIA	"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com"""	"In 2019, the Tyrell Corporation has manufactured organic robots identical to humans called ""replicants"", which are used as slave labor on off-world colonies. If a replicant disobeys and returns to Earth, a Blade Runner hunts them down and ""retires"" them- in other words, executes them. This story follows Deckard (Harrison Ford), a retired Blade Runner, who agrees to hunt down four violent replicant that have escaped into Los Angeles. Blade Runner is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking SciFi film.I really enjoyed the story in Blade Runner; it's a story that doesn't have to rely on action. Although it may sound like a chase film, it's much more than a typical SciFi action flick; it uses it's visuals, dialogue, and action to create a deeper experience. The film uses hypnotizing music, and stunning visuals to create an eerie-like atmosphere- it places you into a thinking mood. There are many versions of this film, some more thought-provoking than others; I say this because the film can generally be perceived in many ways, especially the ending. I recommend watching this film multiple times, starting with the International version then the Final Cut. The pacing is a bit slow, the acting is great, the music is amazing, and the visuals are breathtaking.I own the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-Ray). The first disc has the Final Cut; The second disc has the Theatrical Cut, the International Cut, and the Director's Cut; the third disc has the Workprint Version and the special features. All of the discs are Blu-Ray, no DVDs. The picture quality has been upgraded significantly and the film looks phenomenal, matching most modern films; this is definitely one of the best upgrades I've seen and I hope more classic films get this treatment.Overall, Blade Runner is an amazing SciFi film, with an extremely immersive SciFi atmosphere, stunning cinematography, mesmerizing music, and a deep storyline (depending on your perception, of course). I highly recommend the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-Ray) for fans and first-time viewers, because it is the definitive version and has all of the versions of the film- the slightest differences can really change your opinion.Blade Runner has violence and blood, and brief nudity."	5.0	A Hypnotizing and Thought-Provoking SciFi film...	2013-02-12	1	1	0

For anybody else, it won't mean anything and it is a waste of money.Okay, so I am a Blade Runner fan. I love just about everything about this movie, and seeing it back when it came out was a formative experience for a young movie fan. Consequently, I won't even attempt to review the movie as such, since it wouldn't be very even-handed or rational anyway. Bascially, if you are already a Blade Runner fan, you know, and if not, I suppose all I can say is that I kinda recommend to watch it at least once.So, now that we are among ourselves, what about this edition. Well, it's great, it's what fans have been waiting for, it's well-made, contains all the relevant editions of the movie that matter (including, of course, the ""final"" one), plus a few gimmicks that will only be appreciated by die hard fans. The quality of sound and video is what you would expect it to be, i.e. great.Anyway, I suppose most Blade Runner fans already have ordered this and only casually peruse the reviews to see what others think about it. I think it's a worthy edition for the 25th anniversary.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1X3GV86BJDA6F	Jorune2112	Blade Runner: The Director's Cut has it's share of problems. Scott took a scene from Legend of a unicorn and inserted it into a dream sequence for Dekkard. Nevermind the fact that the scene looks forced and doesn't really  fit into where he choose to put it, it does add a little to the film. I  like the 'happy ending' sequence removed. What I don't like is Ford's  missing narration. Big mistake. Scott claims that he didn;t originally want  it in there, than why do some scenes linger on for no reason. I on an old  copy on VHS (ack) that has the narration and it makes the story flow  better. But the real crime here is that for the DVD, they easi;y could have  added it as a seperate track and than given us the choice as to what we  want.Blade Runner is a great movie, the original cut that is. If they  would combine the elemnts of the Director's Cut with the narration from the  original, it would be awesome. And apparently they think so since a new  version of Blade Runner is currently in production for a DVD re-release.

Yes, there were no CGI effects at the time, but the blending of miniatures that they did for this film has never been touched.  The acting for this film is absolutely impeccable by everyone that was involved.  The direction seems to be both completely epic and understated at the same time.  The blu ray is really utilized here, as you can tell that Warner really spent the time and money to go back into the original negative and this is one of the cleanest remasters that I have ever seen.  The different versions of the film really do change the meaning of the film with only very slight changes that really show just how subtle and perfectly spaced this film is.  I know people who like each as their favorite, but I have to say that the final cut of the film is pretty amazing if you haven't come around to this version of the film.

This is absolutely the collector's edition all Blade Runner fans have been wanting.  George Lucas could learn a thing or three from this collector's edition.The face that it comes in a Voight Kampf case is really an added bonus.  The little chachkis they put in like the unicorn and the spinner are also neat and show off your love and geeky-ness to your office mates nicely.  But what I love the most about the collection (and what George could learn from) is the inclusion of absolutely every version of the movie in existence in addition to the restoration of the film.Ridley Scott clearly knows his audience and fans and even though some of the fans' favorites were his own, he still catered their tastes and their likes and put out all the editions with the same care as he released his final, updated version.  So if you saw the original with narration and love it, it's here for you in beautiful, crisp imagery.  Want to see the European version that you've never seen?  Here as well.The most impressive is possibly Scott's final cut.  Beautifully cleaned up, true to the story, even reshot with one of the original actresses (remember the ""falling through the glass scene"" so clearly a double?) to make the movie seamless.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A367DWLF5M50DI	"Joshua Deeds ""Josh"""	Blade Runner is a movie based in Los Angeles in 2019. The environment is pretty much destroyed, and industrialization triumphs over nature. The result is no viable nature whatsoever, but a Mega-opolis in pretty much Post Apocalyptic Earth( the native language is a mix of Hungarian, Chinese, Japanese and English)The story involves 6 replicants that have escaped from an Off World colony( as they were slaves) and have come to exact revenge, or a longer lifespan if they can. However there is more to it than just that... the replicant's have 4 year lifespan for fear they become aware of their own emotions, and do irrational things.Deckard is a former Blade Runner, re-commissioned by his old boss to hunt down the 4. He sees that not only are the replicants more Human than expected, they outgrow their programming and ARE living, breath physical objects.The story is ironic as well as tragic as the replicants die, as near the end Deckard is skeptical if he is one as well. However, this is a great movie Rutger Hauer's first American movie, and Harrison Ford fresh off Return of The Jedi is excellent. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fanatics.I have the original directors cut within my possession, I am looking forward however to getting the 4 disc special edition to see the major differences in the edits.	5.0	Post-Apocalyptic Sc-Fi	2007-09-23	10	3	7

Unbelievable.This movie was brilliantly done and amazing in HD. Buy it. But I have a few philosophical thoughts so stop reading here if you are not interested or perhaps watch the movie first.I first watched this as a kid and thought it was great in a Sci-Fi kinda way. My brother and I use to run about quoting. ""Its too bad she won't live. But then again who does?"" I think we understood it then. But not within the context that under pins the entire movie.Today, I found deep subtleties that were quite haunting. What is life and is anything retained after we're gone? Or are our memories and experiences just like ""...tear drops in rain"".The death of Zhora was quite emotional and I now understand why it was suppose to be.I'm not sure if it was done deliberately or my current state of mind (I'll admit to that), but you come to understand the true philosophical context of this work, which perhaps comes out more so in ""The Final Cut"" version.Finally the question of Deckard and the answer (or no answer) reveals itself to be - irrelevent. This movie projects out the ""Untimate Question"" onto the ""Skin Jobs"" as a pseudo representation of ourselves. The quest of ""...More life"" and the ""...itch you can never scratch"" as the knowing of what its like to ""...live in fear"" of it ultimately coming to an end sooner than you would like.""Thats what it is to be a slave""Regardless of culture, religion or ethnicity - it doesn't matter. Live life, cherish life and cherish the life of all people (and pigeons). As there are no guarantees only delusions. As the deluded conclude that they are better, smarter, superior and more worthly of life - effecting the deemed less worthly into a desperate fight or flight for survival. The aware will admit to know nothing and given the choice - will save life.Watch this movie and you will see what I mean."	5.0	"Are you a ""Skin Job?"" - Are you sure?"	2013-06-12	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1XDH30R4OVZBN	"""jozq"""	First off I'd like to say I love Blade Runner; both versions, but I still think Director's cut is much better ( deeper, more atmosphere, mystic ).  The movie, overally, is a sci-fi masterpiece, one of the bestest, without  doubt. The dark atmosphere makes the movie so enjoyable, and quite sad  thou', because it shows masterfully the human emotions; and androids, and  what the future could be. Dark, dirty, clouded, wasted...So to the  story. It tells a story of a retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who is  chosen back to his job; to take another droid-hunt. ( This is not action  -movie, so I thought, but I wasn't disappointed; this is better like it is  ) So he takes the job, and you'll see what happens. The story is multiple,  and hard to understand at first ( maybe easier for those who have readed  the book ), but it makes it re-watchable. I've seen it many many times, and  I'm going to see it many times to come.&quot;...what is life?... it  vanishes like tears in rain...&quot;	5.0	Definetely worth the buy	2000-08-15	1	1	0

Patterson	"I bought this Blu-ray set during the 25th Anniversary, and again during the 30th for the Digibook.I could go on forever describing what it is I like about this film so much. Basically it is the film's visual style, its acting, and its deeply philosophical storyline. This film was a sort of omen in 1982 of ""what we had coming"" in America, and its vision is frighteningly closer to a reality with each passing day. We are becoming an increasingly individualistic yet homogenized culture, with small groups of elites making decisions and corporations influencing us with branding and advertisement. Technology has changed the way we socially interact, and our morality and ethics, even as we become more diverse. Though I won't spoil the film's ending for those who haven't seen it, it tells the viewer a great deal about how these cultural changes could ultimately impact what makes us human.My favorite version of the film is the 'Workprint Version' on Disc 3, simply because its unfinished state gives it a sort of ""feel"" that the other versions are missing. I mostly dislike the Theatrical Cut, due to the boring narration and butchered ending, but the Director's Cut and Final Cut are both great (I actually prefer the Director's Cut because it is less polished)."	5.0	My all-time favorite movie, and a stellar Blu-ray set	2012-11-27	2	1	1

It is very artistic, reflective and overall a wonderful piece of cinema that will hold up over the years despite being released in 1982. Ridley Scott is a superb director and this is one of his best films and is one of my personal favorites.  Harrison Ford also does a wonderful job and the story will keep you thinking long after watching this. What is great about this set is that you don't have to worry, ""which version should I get?"" because it comes with all of them!  How cool is that?  FIVE DISCS for ONLY 27.95?  Amazing.  This is THE version of the film to buy, and in high-def.  I've been waiting on this for YEARS.  Also Blade Runner and music fans, may I suggest the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis.  (UPC 0 7567-82623-2 6)  The expanded soundtrack features more music from the score not released in the film and is just as powerful and evocative as the movie."	5.0	Blade Runner - 5 discs - I said WOW!	2007-08-04	33	15	18

Price ""kreisleriana"""	"This five-DVD release is packed neatly into a small briefcase along with a toy spinner (a car), an origami unicorn, a hologram of Deckard at work, and examples of storyboard artwork.  It is ""quite a prize"" and something for Blade Runner fans to revel in.  If you feel that you don't need all of these goodies, however, you can still opt for ""Blade Runner - the Final Cut 2-Disc Special Edition,"" giving you the definitive 2007 version of Blade Runner, the documentary on the film (""Dangerous Days""), and more bonus material.There are many Blade Runner reviews already posted and I risk being completely redundant.  I  saw it in its original theatrical release in June of 1982.  I didn't own a VCR so, with the idea I might never see this movie again, I went back to the theater the next day, pen in hand, and scribbled down as much dialogue as I could, including, of course, Roy Batty's iconic farewell speech.  I needed to keep it forever.Blade Runner is set in Los Angeles in 2019.  I recognize my city:  the storefronts, street crime, red horizon, endless skyline and congestion.  The grimy rain depicts a city of dashed hopes and depression, yet Blade Runner ultimately discovers a passion for life that is ""genetic."" Roy Batty became my hero by defying his world.If you are new to Blade Runner I recommend watching the original 1982 Theatrical Release first.  I believe it is closer to the mark than is now acknowledged.  My hands down ""favorite,"" however, has become the 2007 Final Cut.  It is reworked to repair the slip-ups and also expanded somehow, taking a little more time and revealing the film's soul.  I discovered Pris in this version -- her conversations with Sebastian reveal tenderness and compassion.Another version of interest in this set is the Workprint.  It uses an even clumsier voiceover than the 1982 Theatrical release and the second half of the film is scored with awful music, exposing the actors by removing the support of Vangelis' miraculous soundtrack.  Now we see what powerful performances these actors brought to the film:  Rutger Hauer, is absolutely real, terrifying, intelligent, physical; Harrison Ford truly brilliant in a difficult role where his contribution has become underrated.  Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, and Brion James are all great.  Thanks to each of you.  And thanks to Ridley Scott.Blade Runner has become a classic and this collector's edition provides much to study and discuss.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2JJ6PPT2IV1SV	J. Reategui	"Walking home from class one day I pass by my local video rental store.  As luck would have it, it was the first day they were selling off their VHS library.  Curious, I step inside and browse around until I spot a title I've heard before but never really bothered checking out: Blade Runner the Director's Cut.  The combination of a futuristic film noir (two of my favorite genres) and one inspiration to Cowboy Bebop (one of my favorite series)? I decide to part with the 8 dollars.Before watching the film I feel the need to find out a little more about my version.  Upon checking the reviews I run into a little debate over the better or best version.  As I understand (and to boil things down), the original version was the ""Hollywood (forced/ feel good)"" cut verses Mr. Scott's ""own vision"".  In addition, the DVD Director's cut is a 1st generation release (i.e. distracting/poor transfer quality).  So how was the VHS Director's Cut? Amazing.From start to finish the film transports us into the gritty streets of a semi-advanced LA, planted in the classic 80's style.  The characters, driven through dimly lit environments and circumstances play very well together- from the decadent nightclubs to a monolithic corporation to apartment housing that mid 20th century forgot.  The music also fuses nicely, between jazz of a contemporary detective mystery and an 80's electronic orchestra, creating the synthesized trumpet that pulls me deeper into the night's chase.  And the performances? (You can read the product description for story) Well, without giving anything away, acting is never excessive, while subdued much of the time- as it needs to be.  It was those moments during the journeys, in between the confrontations that allowed time for the main characters to develop.  When sides did meet, the action was also very believable (like the settings).  In summary, the deliveries only built up until a great finish with an inspiring message to boot.While that sale went on I also picked up a few other 80's VHS classics:*Arcadia of my Youth- English SubtitledClassic from the creator of Interstella 5555(which also has a certain dream-like quality).  'Arcadia' also has a strong positive message it wants to convey.*Highlander- Original Cut(Heard director's cut is over explanitory.)Another 80's fantastic adventure.*Legend of Drunken Master II- English Subtitled (The complete version)Early 90's but close enough.  For those who want more action and less plot. Jackie Chan in his prime...I'll check out 'Police Story' afterwards."	5.0	The VHS Director's Cut Experience	2005-08-18	5	2	3

Reyna ""melodywhr"""	"As an avid fan of both the film Blade Runner and the book by Philip K Dick, I was very excited about this ""final cut"" as the original director's cut DVD was totally lacking in all areas.  The Final Cut has definitely cleaned up the picture and the 5.1 is truly magnificent... Scott says that Vangelis' Blade Runner score has to be his best score and to hear in in 5.1, you want to agree with him.  The ads for this release make it sound like there are loads of changes and additional footage and this and that, but if you're looking for a bunch of added stuff, you're going to be disappointed.  There are a lot of things that have been done to the film to clean it up in the way of digital edits and there is additional footage, but according to Scott in the commentary, this version of the film is the shortest version in existence.  The clean picture and the sound is well enough reason to get this version for your collection.  But you're also getting full commentaries from Scott and two additional commentaries from the screen writers and others that helped in making this film, not to mention the second disk with the documentary Dangerous Days that goes into the making of the film.  This entire documentary is over three hours and thirty minutes and includes a number of deleted scenes, random shots, extended scenes, pictures of the pre-production... they talk about the fifth replicant ""mary"" and a cut story line involving Tyrell being an android himself.  There are filmed auditions and interviews from cast and crew... it is truly a definitive account of the making of the film and I can't say I've ever seen such a documentary for a film.so to conclude, the blade runner film: well polished and fantastic. the dangerous days documentary: definitive and delicious."	5.0	Dangerous Days	2007-12-18	4	4	0

This is more than a film its a stunning cinematic achievement. Whether you like the OV or the DC is irrellevant personally I like the accidental Original Version and the happy ending. Although he didn't want to do it Harrison Ford makes a good film noir narrator and his voice over matches his characters outsider demeanor as he hunts down the replicants.  This movie really is my all time favorite I have to see it atleast once a year.  It had a dreamcast Sean Young, Harrison Ford,James Edward Olmos,Rutger Hauer,Emmit Walsh, Brion James, Daryl Hannah some of these great actors early in their careers.  Ofcourse Harrison Ford's performance goes without saying it remains one of his best.  Sean Young has never played a more likeable character than Rachel. Unlike John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"" Ridley Scott had the sense to set it far enough in the future 2019 that today it is still just as effective as when it came out.  When you think of Sci-Fi usually it is way way in the future and usually in space or other planets but amazingly this LA of the future saga makes for the best of the genre.  The opening titles sequence is incredible, the triumphant music justaposed with the open onto the dark rainy cityscape LOS ANGELES NOVEMBER 2019 with the factory towers spewing fire into the nightsky, the flyovers the giant electronic bilboards Coca Cola still rules, the glass pyramid  tyrell building the city reflected on Holden's eye as he prepares to interview replicant Leon, wow incredible film!!!!Vangelis soundtrack is extraordinary!  There's something about this dark rainy grim futureworld that is so compelling! The irony that Deckard ends up falling in love with one of the created beings that he routinly hunts down for a living and the effect it has on him makes us all think of our fragil human existence.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1YW7CQ4PCYBS0	J. Sheeley	Blade Runner tells of human-like robots which are in danger of gaining emotions and becomming too human to exhist by human laws.  I loved this movie when I first saw it and I find it wonderful to notice in the background the company logos (which at the time were powerful up and coming companies) of which most are out of business (though Atari has made a comeback).  The soundtrack sets the tone and the weather (which it always is raining in the film except for the very ending) also keep things looking bleak.  I do enjoy the directors cut cause I am a big fan of Widescreen... but that is the only reason I like it.  I wish they had kept the narration (or at least had a two sided disk so a person could chose to have the original unedited narration or the directors cut version).  I know some people think the narration is the studios way of saying that the audiance cannot understand the film without dumbing-it-down with narration.  This is definitily not the case.  The narration reminds me of those old TV Cop dramas where the cops thoughts are always stated as the action is happening.  I do feel that it adds to the film.  I highly recommend the movie regardless of which version you see.  Rutger Hauer is my favorite.	5.0	A wonderfully dark film!	2004-05-24	10	10	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AF41VDC2KK5ES	"J.S. ""road runner"""	"I watched The Director's Cut again (haven't watched it in a couple of years), and it is still a stunning movie for something made 24 years ago. Something I complain about with the first two Star Wars movies is not just the the dialouge feeling a bit forced, but the visuals, as cool as they look, lack the ""grit"" that was more evident in the original trilogy, and especially in this movie. Designing the bowels of Coruscant, they should've taken a cue from what a city should REALLY look like by watching this one.Anyways, back to Blade Runner, the removal of Harrison Ford's narration was much better to me. I felt when I saw the original back in the day, his narration seemed like it was more in-the-way than being helpful. Also, the removal of the ""happy ending"" made it much more open-ended, and more wide open to speculation. As for the possibility that Deckard was a replicant, Phillip K. Dick's book seems to stir up that speculation, without ever really answering it...even now, it's still subject for debate. That the influence of the book/movie to cyberpunk books/movies is apparent: individual vs. the system, whether it's Deckard working outside the system (ex-cop), or the Repllicants that are renegades outside of the system. The movie also has that detective/film noir feel, set in a futuristic, but bleak, setting.I recently read that because of legal issues, the movie hasn't been given the ""Special Edition"" treatment, which is a shame. I'd like to see both the original theatrical release, and see the D.C. version, and see how much different the two movies are. The film quality is in need of cleaning up (graininess here and there), and an improvement of the sound quality to digital couldn't hurt. But, even now though, this movie was certainly ahead of it's genre, and still looks decent today."	5.0	A sci-fi classic revisited	2004-09-04	5	4	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1ROZ9P38V7E4T	J. Victor	Back in 1982 I was fortunate enough to have actually seen Blade Runner in the theater. It made quite an impression on me, In 1992 I was able to see The Director's Cut in a theater as well. Either way, for me it's one of the  best films of all time. The difference in the two versions is quite  significant.  I happen to really enjoy and appreciate both versions, In a  sense it's two very different films. Harrison Ford's weary narration does  give it a 40's noir edge to it, without it, it becomes an even more distant  and very open-ended film, making Rick Deckard that much more of a  mysterious character. Is he or isn't he?Harrison Ford's haunting  performance as the weary cop, is among his best. Rutger Hauer is  spellbinding as the replicant who just maybe more human than his creators.  Sean Young is memorable as Rachel, the confused and conflicted replicant.  Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson and Edward James Olmos are the other  standout actors. Director Ridley Scott created a visual masterpiece, on  every viewing you always wind up catching something new to it. The  groundbreaking production design and visual effects become much imitated in  following years. The haunting and eerily atmospheric score by Vangelis  captures the perfect mood.  The story itself is filled with subtle and not  so subtle themes and imagery and very much open to discussions.This  particular DVD edition is ok, being that it was among the earliest DVD  releases. Warner Bros is in fact releasing a Special Edition later this  year that is to contain more features and remastered sound. For those who  have been intrigued by this unique Sci-fi tale, there is a must read book  for you..Future Noir The Making Of Blade Runner, which is a fascinating and  in-depth look at the making of this classic film.	5.0	Los Angeles 2019	2000-03-25	9	9	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3PISBFES0KBAG	"J. Villescas ""tin cloud"""	"My rating is based on the overall product and not just the film.  I have received the actual product and it is not the brushed metal finish as has been widely marketed.  It is unfortunate because the flat plastic gray of the actual product looks cheap considering the production of this set.  Ultimately it does not matter at this time since the only way to obtain the 5-disc set is in this form.  Perhaps in the future the 5-disc set will be offered separately.  The price of the set reflects the overall quality.  You get alot of stuff, but it feels cheap.  For Blade Runner fans who are starving for collectibles, this is a great set.  If this set is the only way to get the 5 discs then I wouldn't mind paying more and getting higher quality collectibles.  For example, the unicorn model included could have been sculpted to look more like the one pictured in the film and the spinner has a cheap feel, though it looks pretty much like the one featured in the film.  I enjoyed the lenticular animated scene and the production sketches, but I would have much rather had a photo collection consisting of those from Leon's drawer, of Rachael and her mother, maybe some from Deckard's piano, and especially the Polaroid-like print-out of Zhora.  The photos were, to me, the main ephemeral icons of the movie.Overall it is a fun set to have, but i would have paid a little more for a ""Collector's Edition"" with higher quality extras(aside from the dvd content)."	4.0	A note to quality	2007-12-29	2	2	0

Amazingly, every cut of the film is included and the clarity of each disc is phenomenal.The box is very well designed even having hinges as opposed to the usual bent plastic spine and mimics the briefcase holding Deckards famous Voight Kampff machine.

I have seen this so many times now, I know every scene like the back of my hand. Despite seeing all the versions, the re-mastering, the enhanced digital imagery, the altered scenes (like the dove taking off into the blue sky), the extra scenes (at the noodle stand) etc. etc., my favorite version, the one I like to watch often, is the laserdisc version of the Director's cut. I like the colors and there is a certain mystery and warmth to the scenes ... When I watch the Blu-Ray version, although it is much clearer and has more visible detail, the colors seem brighter, clearer and the movie's atmosphere doesn't hold... Dark, grainy, vague .. that is the atmosphere around LA in 2019 from the beginning of the film... Adding more color, lighting (a harsh white for the Noodle stand scene) only spoils this in my opinion.My 2 c..	5.0	The greatest sci-fi film ever made	2011-05-26	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AG65V3LSYO191	Kate	I accept that this movie may be considered a little strange to the average viewer; with its hood of constant darkness and seedy LA underbelly, with it's strange mix of film noir and science fiction. Certainly, it is a strange film, but one that is hugely meritous for it's somewhat apocalyptic vision of the capitalist future within the context of a city of fallen angels, and the manner in which it explores the concerns of the age and humanity's fall from grace. Does being human give us all the attributes of humanity, for example, compassion? Do we need to be on the edge of death before we can appreciate life?This version leaves many questions unanswered, and though I have not seen any version but the Director's Cut, I cannot imagine 'Bladerunner' with a positive outcome. It seems to defeat the entire purpose of the text, and the loss of the most important and beautiful line of the piece (as I see it) 'Its a shame she won't live, but then who does?' would affect the entire concept. A piece were life was present (like the original work) seems almost contridictory to the hopeless, loveless and careless setting of the work. Deckard as a non replicant (he is a replicant-how else would Gaff know his unicorn dream unless they were programed..) would also destroy the entire meaning of the work.It is truly a fabulous work if one really considers the concerns of the director, and how his view of the future and critism of the present world and growing capitalisation is considered.	5.0	This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen!	2001-09-11	1	0	1

After arranging a an exchange, I just received a second set with the same problem. Apparently others are facing the same problems as well. If you order the set be sure to check disc one and five to see if they are the same discs. One can compare the two discs for similarities.  Disc five has one commentary line and has a poorer screen quality than the other editions. Disc one is supposed to be a high quality edition which disc five is not.	5.0	Amazing Film Quality for Disc 3 but duplicate Disc 5	2009-02-12	5	4	1

The transfer shows the age of the film in some shots, notably in the beginning, but through most of the film it looks great. At times, it looks fantastic. There can be no doubt that it's a huge improvement over what we've had before. The sound seems clearer too although I hope there is a 5.1 mix added to the ultimate release next year.For anyone who doesn't know, Ridley Scott is preparing a ""Final Cut"" of the film that's going to be shown in theaters next year prior to the release of the big Blade Runner boxed set. That release is likely to appear on HD-DVD/Blu Ray as well.I'm in the minority, but I prefer the theatrical release of the film to the version presented here. For the theatrical release, the studio insisted on a narration by Harrison Ford to explain the film to audiences. I find that this director's cut has a lot of unnatural silences where the narration used to be and for me, that throws the pacing of the film off. I've heard that Ridley's final cut will include some of the narration. That could very well be the best version of this film yet.We'll know in 2007.Meanwhile, seeing this great film finally look great is worth the  $12.99, even for a ""double-dip"" release."	5.0	Great Film, Much Improved Transfer, But...	2006-09-06	23	21	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	"Blade Runner was a five star movie that had an exceptionally good plot.  It also featured astounding special effects which were amazing to see on the big screen.  Much of this work was done with large scale models and fog machines that really helped to establish the atmosphere and feel of the film visually. Several of the screen and sound effects were taken from Ridley Scott's Alien, including computer graphic screens and miscellaneous electronic sound effects.  In addition, the sets, models, and costumes were wonderfully organic, as were the original sets of Giger's from Alien.The story concerns humaniod robots in the first quarter of the 21st century that have intelligence and agility at least as great as that of the genetic engineers who designed them.  The robots are called Replicants because they are physically equivalent to human beings down to their organs, blood and bone structure. The strength and speed of these androids is much greater than that of a human, and they can be a great deal of trouble to deal with.The story takes for granted that such advanced robots possess true consciousness and are quite willing to fight and even kill human beings in order to continue their existance which has been intentionally limited to a life span of four years.  This is one of the few robot films to come out of Hollywood which does not depend on Asimov's three laws of robotics for the story.One new science fiction twist on robotics used in this film is the implanting of false memories of childhood, parents and a long prior existance. Though false, these implanted memories mean a great deal to the androids at the ""emotional"" level who carry photos of their false history, parents and childhood homes even when they are aware that these memories are false. This was a totally new concept to me as a long time fan of robots in science fiction film and gave me a new perspective on the value of memories.The film stars Harrison Ford who plays a special law officer or Blade Runner. As a Blade Runner he is authorized to use deadly force in the pursuit of ""Replicants"" to terminate (or retire) them on the planet Earth where their use has been banned.  The story becomes even more interesting when the Blade Runner falls in love with a beautiful female Replicant who is used to calibrate the andoroid detection software used by Blade Runner detectives.One scene which was particularly effective involved Harrison Ford revealing to the female android that she is artificial, something she has been unaware of since activation because of her false memory implants.  This is the scene in which Harrison Ford falls in love with this very beautiful ""woman"" because of her well portraid vulnerability, emotions and sadness at learning that she is artificial.  She is deeply hurt and shattered by the new knowledge and the tough Blade Runner instantly falls in love when she breaks down and silently cries after hearing his revelation and convincing evidence."	5.0	BLADE RUNNER-Excellent Science Fiction Film	2008-04-28	1	1	0

This movie is about so much more than science fiction, or what the world will be like in the future.  This movie  cannot be easily fit into one category...nevertheless, the movie remains as  the best movie that I have ever seen.  I wish that the original uncut  version with the Harrison Ford narration would come out on DVD.  I'm one of  the lucky few to have the original on VHS and I'm afraid to watch it for  fear it will wear out too fast.

The four-disc collection is valuable only for those of you who wish to listen to (on two discs) commentary by the producer/director/etc. as to the ins and outs of making the movie.  A third disc contains versions with later cut scenes still intact.  The fourth disc is the actual movie as released.  The story is interesting as, in additional to sci-fi, it raises some realistic philosophical questions as to where we are going with computerized this that and everything else.  Science has gotten ahead of us; hence the need for Blade Runners.  The computerized snooping into everyone's phone calls, emails and on-line purchases is in the current news.  The androids are only a small step of imagination ahead.  This movie, an early-early Harrison Ford masterpiece, was way ahead of its time - are we there yet?

The best thing about it is it's look - the vision of future LA as a sort of hell with huge pyramidal apartment blocks, floating video ads in English/Spanish/Japanese, and artificial humans and animals remains haunting.  Make sure you watch it in a dark room - the sun is never shining.  Harrison Ford is at his offhand macho best.  This film takes Philip K.

My only problem is that i have seen Blade Runner over a hundred times at the very least with the Harrison Ford Voice-Over (since it was  first in the movie theatres way back in the dark ages) - so every time I  watch the movie - I still hear the faint echoes of Harrison Ford's voice in  my head while he's sitting under the overhang waiting for a place to sit at  the noodle stand. Of course it might not be Deckard's voice I'm hearing -  but that's besides the point. GREAT MOVIE!	5.0	Androids dreams	2000-05-09	0	0	0

The brooding mood is set very well thanks in large part to the moving score by Vangelis, which plays nicely off the dark, sombre set.  The plot is intense; Harrison Ford is at his best here.  I don't care much for the unicorn scene, but it's very short and not really awful or anything (it's not nearly as bad as the voice-over on the original release).Maybe it's because I'm a Harrison Ford fan, or maybe because I'm just a fan of the dark future genre, but for overall entertainment value I believe this may just be the best science fiction film ever made.

I have seen many films in my day, but the one criteria of quality I NEVER list is a &quot;happy ending.&quot; Furthermore, not only did Harrison Ford hate the harration, but Ridley Scott was forced to include it by the studio. The film MINUS narration is the film the artists wanted to make, and you get it right here.If you want to see a film that more closely resembles the director's original vision, buy this version. This is the version the artists wanted to make.  It's much better than the theatrical version, which had a tacked on ending to lull casual viewers into a warm-and-fuzzy mood. It also had an embarrassing voiceover by Harrison Ford that insulted anyone who was interested in all the subtleties of the film. (Imagine a narrator on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.) This is the perfect example of how Hollywood can screw up a great film. Fortunately, we get to see how Academy Award winner, Ridley Scott, wanted the film to turn out.

While the open ending is different, the loss of the narration by Ford detracts from the film if you are a fan of film noir movies.Some film historians and critics find many influences of the film noir style of film making in this film, calling it  neo-noir, cyberpunk or tech-noir.To prove this film falls in this style it must include certain elements, all of which are in Bladerunner:Visual style:  while not in black and white, the film does make use of dramatic shadows with low key lighting, creating a bleak environment.Setting: film noirs tend to be centered around flawed individuals in a world that has no room for forgiveness.  Crime is a central element of the story and the protagonist is often a detective or  crime fighter (Decker).  Archetypal characters that are often found are corrupt cops, femme fatals (Hannah and Woods) and down and out characters.  Noir films are generally set in Los Angeles,  New York or San Francisco - so the setting in Bladerunner is dead on.Morality:  Noirs tend be ambiguous, the characters may have absolute moral values, but their cynical worldview forces them, or allows them, to adopt a way of life in which the ends justifies the means.  The very ambiguity of a noir film often finds the characters searching for what is right or wrong.  Again, Bladerunner fills the bill.Outlook of the film:  Film noir is basically romantic in nature and strives to tell the story of people who are trapped in situations beyond their control (the replicants with pre-set life spans) and are almost always doomed.  Film noir plots also center around the hard-boiled, disillusioned, cynical world view of the male protagonist - Decker.Other common features of a film noir movie are the voice over narrations, thus the use of Harrison's voice as narrator and flashbacks to tell parts of a story.If you are not a fan of film noir or tech-noir, I can certainly understand the preference for the Director's Cut version.  But, if you like film noir, the theatrical version is the way to go.	5.0	Is the Director's Cut better?	2006-05-22	8	5	3

When it was first aired, there were so may versions of the film. In my opinion, the European version is the best. It certainly has a lot more violence but it made the movie much clearer with Ford's narration and the happy ending that made the film less depressing than it already is. Sadly the DVD lacks all this offering us the director's vision only. Strangely the Criterion Edition LD(which offers the European version)has not made it to the DVD. This is sad considering that Ridley Scott's Legend is given a better treatment on DVD offering two versions of the  film in a Collector's Edition(the fantastic director's cut and the horrible U.S version). Hopefully, Bladerunner will be rereleased with both European version and director's cut in the near future(and possibly a 'making of' documentary as well).	2.0	A true classic that deserves better...	2000-11-08	6	5	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Blade Runner is a classic cult science fiction film based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by the late Philip K. Dick.  The Blade Runners were formed due to an Off-World mutiny by human like robots called replicants.  Blade Runners functioned to annihilate the replicants, a process called retirement.  The story revolves around the ex-Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is forced to rejoin and help retire four replicants.  However, these replicants are of a new model called Nexus 6, which are far superior to the previous models.  The Nexus 6 have a safety mechanism that automatically retires the replicant after four years.  As a result, they have returned in order to prevent their retirement.  Blade Runner provides a superior cinematic opportunity for suspense and reflection over existentialism, which is delivered with both brute force and gentle touch.	5.0	Superior Cinematic Experience!	2002-12-13	2	1	1

I never saw this movie  in the theater, and it's really a shame b/c one of the most stunning  qualities of the movie is its dark, noir description of the future Los  Angeles.  The contrast with current LA is partiucularly striking if you've  ever been there b/c one thing LA is NOT is dark.  Harrison Ford delivers  what I think is one of his best performances in this movie, and Rutger  Hauer is a fantastic villan, particularly becuase of the character's  vulnerability.One comment about the Director's Cut versus the theatrical  release: I would not have understood this movie without the cheesy overdub  of Deckard's commentary.

Blade Runner is probably my favorite movie; but, the Director's Cut is an abomination.  The actual difference in footage amounts to something like 7 seconds - big woop.  The only significant change is the loss of monologue:  a major mistake. The director was miffed at the studios for forcing the issue, and now, decades later, the release of the ""restored"" version has all but supplanted the original.  It's impossible to get a hold of - the die hard fans, not content to be told which version to like, seek out the theatrical release as if it were a rare truffle.  I would call the monologues effectiveness a happy accident.  In an interview, Ford disclosed that he agreed with the director.  He didn't want to do the voice-over.  As a result, he read the part as deadpan, monotone as he could, attempting to bore the studio into dropping it.  The way it turned out, the reading fit perfectly.  For one thing, it gave the movie a voice similar to that of classic detective dramas (something reflected in the sets and costumes, as well).  For another, it reflected how dead and empty the main character felt inside - whether that was because he was a killer, a washed up cop, a failure as a husband, or just possibly a replicant with a flimsy emotional crutch imprinted on his memory, didn't matter.  Ford's intended sabotage made the character.  Without sharing our hero's thoughts, the movie feels disjointed and comes across as annoying.  The original had meaning and vitality, but the Director's Cut, was to the jugular, spilling the life-blood of the film."	2.0	Almost My Favorite Movie	2004-01-27	29	26	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AYFCKZYQLJ6I4	Krista K	While there are technical issues with this version, and I suggest waiting for Ridley Scott's 'actual' director's cut to come out before buying, I'd like to focus on the STORY of this version.The good things about this version's story:- The voice over has been removed - Scott never wanted a voice over, but the studio made him add one so that the movie wouldn't be 'too hard to follow'; I like it better without (though I've seen the theatrical release often enough that it still runs through my head in places).- The ending is no longer 'Hollywood happy' but instead ambiguous - again under studio mandate, Scott had to add a happy ending for the theatrical version; I like this ending better, and it's certainly more true to the overall feel of the movie.Problems:- The awkwardly added unicorn dream scene - I've read a lot of Dick, but even so that didn't prepare me to see how this dream told us Deckard may be a replicant (as Scott indicated in interviews).Overall, 'Blade Runner' is only loosely based on Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,' yet it still succeeds (and Dick approved of this script before he died).  It offers a good script, great story, humanized villains, good acting, and a great score by Vangelis.  Even to this day, it taunts us with a glimpse of the ecologically devastated world we may be moving towards - and that's just background ambiance.  What this movie really does is to explore one of Dick's major themes - what does it mean to be human?  If it looks like a woman, emotes like a woman, desires to live like a woman and you shoot it in the back because those in authority tell you to, have you committed murder?  Not an easy question to answer, and much more important to contemplate than an alien invasion.	5.0	A SF great  (that should only get better with each new version)	2006-06-22	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	The definitive version of Ridley Scott's sci fi classic ditches the voice-over narration and sappy ending, and it all culminates in a more satisfying watch. Released in 1982, BLADE RUNNER sunk at the box office, and who knows what to attribute it's commercial failure to, perhaps it was the material that's now been taken out? Regardless, it's a deserved sci fi classic that has stood the test of time to become one of the greats. From the huge sucess of ALIEN, Scott's third film as director is perhaps not as clever as it tries to be, but is nontheless an entertaining thrill ride with some terrific action set-pieces.  Hugely influential on films like THE FIFTH ELEMENT, A.I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and STAR WARS EPISODE II, Scott's vision of a neon-soaked Los Angeles is one of the many astounding and unforgettable images throughout the film. Harrison Ford is in superb form as the man sent to bring in a replicant cyborg. The cinematography is breath-taking, the special effects are great and Vangelis' original score is excellent. With so many good points it's hard to name them all, Blade Runner is a true classic.	5.0	Blade Runner	2002-07-22	1	0	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A5I0I06VMU8U7	K. Steel	Having heard all the hype about Blade Runner, and being a huge sci fi fan myself, I was expecting more. I liked Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer in their roles, and their scene together at the end was good, but overall it was quite slowly paced and didn't hold my attention well. I had read the book before watching the movie (I try not to compare, because I feel books and movies should be judged in their own right), and it was much more interesting to me than the movie. I think the internal struggle of the characters and some of the things that got left out of the movie (which I understand, as it would have been awkward to fit it in smoothly without making the movie quite long), really contribute to the story, and I was sucked in right away. The movie's definitely worth a watch, but it's not a fast-paced action sci fi, and I definitely recommend reading the book (maybe after the movie? Not sure it matters, really).TL, DR: Good film, not what I was expecting based on what I'd heard. Read the book as well.	3.0	Not what I expected	2013-07-29	7	1	6
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A356RFKNIG043B	K. Swanson	I can't think of any other truly perfect film that was given a very different directors' cut years later and is still just as good.I believe this is in fact the first director's cut of any movie to be released. The original Harrison Ford voice-over is missing, which really dulls some of the great film noir-of-the-future vibe that makes this so special. What is better, however, is that now we hear much more of Vangelis' fabulous score, gorgeous music which resonates so well with the sublime images that Scott crafted so splendidly.I first saw this the weekend it opened; the theatre was hushed in awe throughout, and everyone applauded at the end. It has only improved with age. Neon-lit wet streets filled with shadowy underworld denizens of our crowded future, endless detail in every frame, imagination spilling from every scene; this film is made to be seen over and over. It's a magic spell that takes you to a unique place in your brain.I think Philip K. Dick would approve heartily of this treatment of his story; Electric Sheep is a typically fine Dick work, but it is even more fully turned out here, and with so much feeling.Above all, this film has heart, and makes you feel, not a typical science fiction accolade. Ford couldn't be better, and Rutger Hauer almost steals the show. It's one of those rare films that spills over with x-factor, and every supporting performance rings true.I will NEVER grow tired of watching this every year, and am really looking forward to seeing the old version again when this is rereleased in the new, somewhat overkill 5-dvd version.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A12MH8JE1C0ZGI	larry	I preferred then original ending to directors cut ending but didn't hate it either. The movie has some very memorable scenes. Things you will want to remember. I first saw the movie when it originally came out in the 80's. Seeing it again was even better, got more out of it this time. If you like existential themes then you should really like Blade Runner. If you look deep, you will see the dichotomy of man in this movie and biblical themes throughout. The only drawback is the time setting of 2019, back in the 80's one could imagine a blade runner world in 2019, but not five years from now, 2014. But that also give thought to the falasy of predicting a debase terrible earth because of corporate greed and unbridled profit. The truth in life  is usually much more upbeat and positive than many want to believe and the ending of Blade runner (especially the original ending) leaves the viewer with such a hope.	5.0	I'd watch it again!	2014-01-07	0	0	0

The money maker for this film will be a new release with both adaptations and in widescreen format with enhanced sound.  Some say the new version more closely resembles the original Dick story.  If, by saying that some of the names are the same creates a resemblance, then I suppose that is true.

I bought an imitation sound track, (well done), at first, because  the real thing was not available.  Later on, when Vangelis released his  version, with great satisfaction, I purchased that on CD.  In my opinion,  this is, by far, the best movie and sound track for enjoying a well put  together entertainment system.  The movie is an intense, involving science  fiction film noir romantic detective story.  There are quite a few  &quot;cult classics&quot;.  This is one.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	Someday he'll be Sir Ridley, no doubt, but now he's just Tony Scott's big brother. Blade Runner is one of better movies made either of the science fiction genre or of the noir mystery genre, or both. I imagine of the science fiction-mystery noir genre it may be the only one.It is a thinking persons movie because it doesn't leave all the questions answered. Is Sean Young a Replicant? Is Harrison Ford a Replicant? Is there a secondary or tertiary meaning in Rutger Hauer's escaped Replicant that is not dissimilar to Pierre Boulle's &quot;Planet of the Apes?&quot;That Ford argued with Scott on the emphasis of &quot;to be or not to be&quot; regarding his role as a/the 'blade runner' along with the silly voiceover about which art regrettably had to bow to money has given the story of the movie almost as much interest as the story.All characters are well played; the movie is stark and surreal; highly recommended.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AKQM58BHRSXC7	LastRanger	The first time I saw this film my reaction was rather Ho-Hum!  An exciting Harrison Ford movie, kind of a Science Fiction meets Film Noir with a somewhat happy ending, but nothing to write home about.  Yet there was something about it that struck a cord in me, something that wouldn't let go.  A year or so latter when director Ridley Scott released his &#34;director's cut&#34; I went to see it again and was electrified!  Gone was Ford's voice-over narration and the &#34;uplifting&#34; (?) flight to freedom that closed the original release.  Gone also was the Film Noir overtones that marred the the first go-around, in its place was one of the finest science fiction films that I've ever seen.  Filled with relentless tension the &#34;new&#34; Blade Runner was a completely different movie that explored the human condition and what it means to be human.  The directors cut was graced with a kind of cliff-hanger ending that questions Deckard's and Rachael's long term survival.  Deckard's dream was also added back into the film and that few seconds of footage is what radically changed the movie.  At last I could answer some of the questions I had.  What did Gaff's last origami mean to Deckard? What was Gaff referring to in his last speech to Deckard?  &#34;It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?&#34;.  But even now there are some unanswered questions for me, and possibly, for you too.  How did Roy Batty know Deckard's name?  Why was Batty mocking Deckard's humanity in their final confrontation?  And lastly: is Deckard a Replicant?  The stunning music by Vangelis and harpist Gail Laughton set the mood for the film with an eerie, other worldly, feel.  Dick Morrisey's bluesy saxophone solo for the &#34;Love Theme&#34; is legendary on the Jazz circuit.  These people are joined by a host of other musicians and singers that bring it all together in a seamless ode to the art of movie making. The ethics of using non-human robots or some sort of half-human android to replace humans in dangerous environments has been the subject many works of fiction over the years.  The one that comes to mind for me is an episode of ST:TNG where Data is put on trial for his &#34;life&#34; to determine if &#34;he&#34; is a sentient being or if &#34;it&#34;  is just a toaster.  The same holds true for Replicants.  A woman I know once said, upon viewing the film for the first time: &#34;This is so sad, they just want to live!&#34;.  My friend had, unknowingly, gone straight to the heart of Blade Runner.  This is one of those movies that people either hate of love.  I think that what you take out of this film depends on what you want to put back into it.  It's either a complicated pot-boiler with an incomprehensible plot or it's a subtle reminder of who we are and where we come from.  Note: this 4 disk set is the way to go if you can swing it.  It offers 4 different versions of the movie for you to compare.  Check it out and see what your favorite version is.  I know what mine is!LastRanger	5.0	The Measure Of A Man.	2013-12-20	0	0	0

Ford plays a semi-retired Blade Runner in LA in 2019. Blade Runners are police officers whose sole job is to chase down and ""retire"" (a synonym for kill) replicants. Replicants are humanoids that are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, created by the Tyrell Corporation, but which have been banned from Earth due a violent uprising that occurred in the years before the events in this film. They are now limited to off world colonies, doing dangerous work that humans can't or won't do. At the beginning of Blade Runner, we learn that a group of 4, cunning replicants have returned to Earth and are going on a rampage.  Ford's character - Rick Deckard - is a retired Blade Runner who is called back into service to help track down and retire these out of control replicants. During his quest, Ford comes across Rachel, a replicant that is employed by Tyrell company as the CEO's personal assistant, that is somewhat of an anomaly - she's called ""an experiment"" - because, unlike the other replicants that Tyrell has produced, Rachel actually has memories, albeit ones that come from Tyrell's niece. As the movie progresses, Ford develops feelings for Rachel that he struggles with periodically during his quest.I had never seen this movie before, ever, even though we have the DVD at my home and my husband absolutely adores the movie.  It apparently also has a cult following - now not so much a cult following as a mainstream following.  And I can see why - it's a pretty good movie. What shocked me is that people agreed that when this film was released in the theaters in the early 80's, it was a complete and utter flop. People hated it.  No clue why because Scott created a really good movie with Harrison Ford as his lead man. Thematically, the movie was attractive because it dealt with themes of memory and identity and how they are intertwined: are they intertwined, how much does one impact the other if at all, etc. I really enjoyed how the scenes were shot and the sets themselves. The darkness, with some brief interludes of light, fit in very well together and added to the overall feel."	5.0	Run TOWARDS Blade Runner	2010-05-03	1	0	1

I expected it to be priced out of my reach, so on seeing it at this surprisingly affordable pricepoint I had to jump.When I received the package, it didn't take me long to realise that I should probably have bought theBlade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] instead.Why's that?Unless you a HUGE fan of BladeRunner, you are unlikely to get much real value out of the other items included in this package.The complete collectors edition contains the same 5 discs of content, the only difference is the briefcase and the accessories within it.Do I regret buying this? only insofar as I spent money that I didn't need to. I'm a fan of BladeRunner, and having these 5 discs of content is great for me. But I am not so much of a fan that I feel that the extra expense was justified.The video is amazing, but you can get that in the complete collection set.The extra items included in this set will be justified by some people, but for me it's probably just gonna sit on a shelf.	5.0	are you a HUGE fan?	2008-03-03	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A12OTDIWIG841L	Leslie Thompson	"Really enjoyed the setting, atmosphere of this movie. A dark, dirty city overcrowded with people and trash (although I thought there would be more flying cars), and huge electronic billboards, such as the Asian woman in the makeup of a geisha that we see repeatedly. It's kind of eerie when the billboards travel over the city on those slow-moving vehicles, invading peoples' homes with their light.  The rundown mansion-type house in the final scenes kind of reminded me of the castle from ""Beauty and the Beast"", strangely enough.A great sci-fi movie that is more thoughtful than just fantasy.  You'll end up thinking about it afterwards. And it seems that it could possibly happen in the future.  But I wish they would have shown some of the Off-World with all the other replicants as slaves.Towards the end of the movie, when Deckard (Harrison Ford) is trying to pull himself up on top of the building, there is a point when the camera focuses only on his hands as they come up over the ledge.  Watching his hands grip that ledge reminded me of Harrison Ford's character in ""What Lies Beneath"" - when he pulls himself up from the bathroom floor by gripping the edge of the bathtub.Didn't care much for the ""love"" scene."	4.0	"""I just do eyes!"""	2006-09-03	5	3	2

There is one review on this site that says the movie isn't particularly good, and this review received 26 negatives and no positives.  That is the biggest flaw in the Amazon system of rating the reviews.  If you didn't like a film, any film, you are going to get negatives, because the people who are checking out the reviews are people who like the film.I rented the movie because it appeared on Time's top 100 movies of all time.  I thought it was all right, but not great.  It didn't move me the way it moved other reviewers.  I suppose that means that my own review will be slammed.  But I'm just being honest here.  The movie didn't move me much at all.  The only saving grace is that another of the reviewers said you need to see it more than once to get the impact.  The problem is, I don't want to see it again.One point I'm confused about.  Is Deckard a robot?  I'm not sure.  Are they leaving it to us to decide?  I don't like that.  Tell us.  It's your movie, so tell us.The problem goes a bit deeper than that.  I don't really care much if Deckard is a robot.  Deckard didn't involve me enough to care.  The only character I found myself giving a damn about was the robot who didn't know she was one, the one Deckard kissed.I think viewers are looking for different things out of movies.  I want a movie to reach me, to make me feel something.  Harrison Ford was dry as a martini.  The replicant robots that he was hunting were lukewarm as well.If this is your favorite movie, good for you.  The simple fact is that it didn't do much for me.  That's my honest reaction.  The only time you are appreciated for criticizing a movie, any movie, is if you are criticizing the picture quality or something, not the movie itself.	3.0	I don't see what the rest of you are seeing	2005-06-01	11	5	6
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A12LHIUPPAJ803	lgaskins@wvu.edu	After seeing the Original release and then the Director Cut, I was a little disappointed.  The DC lacks the original voice-over by Ford that (imo) adds some sort of connection between the scenes.  The DC does have some extra footage that makes in worth viewing but not that much and the ending of the DC is different.  I believe that Blade Runner is still a great movie but I would have rather seen much more of the cut footage (like Decker visiting Holden in the hospital - a scene that is not in any released version) with the voice-over (narration by Ford).  Still it is worth watching and maybe adding to your collection.  END	4.0	interesting but...	1997-10-23	4	3	1

I've been a little apprehensive about films from the 70's and 80's on Blu-Ray because sometime the special effects look way to fake and you can see make up on actor's faces etc.Blade Runner looks so good though! It could have been made in the last decade. I was astounded by how much tiny set detail was visible on Blu-Ray.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A25OFSANE9VJCT	"Linda Oliver ""Alflover"""	I am buying this mainly for the &#34;Dangerous Days&#34; extra.  This is one of my favorite movies, and I prefer the version with the narration; that underscores the &#34;filme noire&#34; aspect, as well as the 40's detective vibe underscored by the art deco architecture, clothing and hair style of Rachel.  I don't like the hinting at Deckard being a replicant, I think it's more poignant and lends more pathos with Decard finding love with a replicant.  It underscores the theme of just what it means to be human.  In sparing Deckard's life, Roy Batty becomes a &#34;real boy&#34;, even releasing his &#34;spirit&#34; (the dove) at the end with his final loss of function/quasi-death.  For Deckard to have killed him, an unarmed man, would have been murder.  Also rather churlish what with Roy having just spared his life and saved him.  Findiing the origami unicorn at Deckard's place said Gaff had the chance to kill Rachel and let her live, a sort of balance for Roy's act of mercy.  Turning it into a &#34;hint of replicanthood&#34; for Decard just seems coy and prescious.  Ok, so the driving off into the sunshine is a bit startlling, but the romantic in me wants them to have a fresh start, darn it, sue me.	5.0	The importance of being human	2014-01-19	0	0	0

Oddly it is not the main characters that make the movie so memorable.  They are underdeveloped and the acting of Harrison Ford and Sean Young is barely adequate.  Ford's voice-over narrative is deadpan.  What makes the movie memorable is the atmosphere, sets, cinematography, secondary characters, script...and hauntingly sensual soundtrack.  Together they evoke a bleak, lonely and desperate world that is essentially destructive to the human soul.  People are existing more than living.  Yet they desperately hang on to their anonymous, dronish and apparently meaningless lives in a technologized world that distracts without giving solace.  Deckard longs for the comfort and escape of companionship (if not love) all the while knowing it too is fleeting and maybe futile.  The replicants are a kind of metaphor for man whose purpose may be as illusory as their implanted ""memories.""  While trying to kill each other Deckard and Roy grow in appreciation of the briefness and fragility of life all the while plagued by questions as to what it ultimately means.  The story appears to be more about man's yearning for transcendance in an existence that seems indifferent to if not a denial of it."	4.0	Of Androids and Men	2005-06-24	2	2	0

This is the last great ANALOG FX film and just look at the incredible detail of the miniatures work that was done vs. digital visual effects that are so common today.  The sound quality alone is worth the purchase, it will make your subwoofer work like no other film.  BTW, there is a great story, dark and detailed that stands up for multiple viewings.  Revel in a dark, steamy, crowded and multicultural version of the future with high tech and the medieval marketplace superimposed.  It looks just like parts of New York, LA or Hong Kong today.  It makes you wonder how Ridley got so close and another reason to look back to 1982 to see a vision from the future.  The documentaries show how there is still no agreement about the best version of the film and it's meaning.  I hope by now everyone has made some coin on this one who took the great risks to get this thing done.	4.0	Sets the standard	2008-01-01	1	1	0

"Based on a story by Philip K Dick, Blade Runner won acclaim for its gorgeous cinematography and its dark, film noir atmosphere.  It traces Harrison Ford as a cop that is on the trail of murdering human-like robots. The robots are so close to human that they can try to pass themsleves off as human beings.As in most of Philip K Dick's stories, the plot has many layers, twists and turns.

Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer co-star as two of the replicants, trying to stay ""alive"" in a world that does not accept them.The original movie came out in 1982, and because the brass in the studio felt it was too complex for theatergoers, things like narrations and a happy ending were added to make it more marketable. In 1993, director Ridley Scott finally got to put out the version he wanted all along, with a more realistic approach.

Slaughter ""silvanus"""	Ridley Scott got away - finally - with sneaking the most expensive art films ever made past the gates of a major studio.  Nevermind the bean counters originally deformed his vision with a silly voiceover and a copout ending, the Director's Cut restores his original vision.As one reviewer has already pointed out, BLADE RUNNER addresses the nature of consciousness, the future of cities, and man's moral obligations to non-human life-forms in a lyrical and understated manner.  It's also a great love story about the Feminine Principle surfacing in a beautiful android to seduce a jaded, numbed human back into his humanity (and there is a yet another twist to this at the end).BLADE RUNNER has aged very well. Scott's and futurist Syd Mead's vision of 2010 LA is still way ahead of time, and the film dates as well as, say, Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA (1960), which was so original IT looks ahead of OUR time.  Top it off with stunning production design (oh, the rain, the rain... the wonderful textured surfaces), remarkable acting (Sean Young, beautiful beyond words; Rutger Hauer, waxing eloquent as he fades) great sound design, and Vangelis' sublime score alternately twinkling and sizzling with faded hope and sexuality, and what we have is one of the finest speculative dramas ever produced.	5.0	A Great Love Story - An Astonishing Vision	2001-05-15	8	7	1

I would like propose a personal reading.I start from afar : who is the most famous and loved Don Juan? That by Tirso da Molina? Not, he is often quoted but less known. That by Moliere? Not, he is acute too.On!, that by Mozart and Da Ponte! Here really, through ""the  most beautiful music in the world"" and a libretto etched on our memory, we understand Don Juan became a modern hero, he is not the complacent cavalier and the philanderer, but the competing of prissiness and of the foregone life. And women? They are the battlefield of Don Juan!Sure, but attention, please: in the Mozart's opera Don Juan can't manage one performance. We cannot understand what has happened with Anna, and she will be anyway his fall; Elvira hates him; Zerlina, after an engagement, at last dodges...we ca know all the skill of Don Juan only by means of the Leporello's explanations, for the rest we see a hero even on the point of being dominated.2019 in Los Angeles, captain Bryant explains us Deckard is the best hunter of androids: really he is  a magician! But after who can we see? A tired hero, with the perplexed look of Harrison Ford; this character is in the movie less old and bruise than in the Dick's book, but in the movie he is more inconclusive and unawares vulnerable  than in the book.Deckard has to erase six androids: Zora is on the point of strangling him but she is diverted by others; Leon is killing him, but Rachel saves Deckard; Pris has already won, but she want to kill him trough her favourite blow, the somersault , and let him the time to save himself; Roy ridicules him and with greatness pardons him. Deckard falls in love with Rachel (the wonderful SeanYoung), the fifth android, and so he solves the problem.  (Yes , the androids have to be six...but this is the mystery of the movie: who is the sixth?)Both Don Juan the Cavalier had to hide himself, to flee, to disguise himself, and above all was so inept with women....and Deckard the Hunter takes hails of punches, loses his teeth, has two broken fingers...Both do not hunt, but they are hunted and have to run off. One goes at hell by choice, other change his life by love.The very simple story, the visions, the colours, the music and the last words (""tears in the rain"")  produces this movie one of the best in the world.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AEFL7I22BB41J	Luciano Lupini	"To put in perspective some negative reviews about this picture,one has to remember how sci-fi movies were made and ambiented, their colours and the stories canned in them, before this one. Only then one can truly understand the importance and historical impact of this masterpiece by Ridley Scott. This is a movie to be seen by all, including those not really into sci-fi. No serious pictures about the future of mankind made after this one, can escape the influence of the dark city portraited in Blade Runner. Not only some very original effects for the time, but also the mood that Vangelis provokes through his musical score, set the rigth place and time to unfold a moving tale about human and nonhuman misery and redemption. This is a place and time were humans kill replicants that were created by them to serve, but not to live on earth or live in full. Replicants that are not supposed to feel, love or despair. But they do, and how.I can hardly think of a more stirring and moving scene in a picture, than the one in which the last standing ""bad"" replicant (portraited by Hauer)does not do what humans thinks a replicant would do (kill Harrison, the hunter that has just liquidated his beloved one) but instead teaches us all a lesson about the value of life and compassion. If the final speechthat he makes doesn't represent poetry in motion to you, then maybe you didn't deserve to see this wonderful art act."	5.0	A  CLASSIC MASTERPIECE	2002-09-27	4	2	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2YLEDHCOYDP7G	Lucy Kelly	This is one of the greatest films ever!  Using the science fiction genre very effectively, it is really about 'man's inhumanity to man'.  The rich and powerful, Capitalists once again, have 'created' 'androids', which they call 'replicants', which are human beings made bit by bit by genetecists, rather than in one go by natural means, and they have 'denied' them their humanity, and thus their human rights.  In this way, they have created, effectively, a 'slave' 'race'/ people, whom they 'may' exploit as they will.  Some, for example, they have made as 'pleasure models', 'used' for for sexual purposes, and psychologically shaped to fit the role, and others are 'used' for warfare, created solely to fight the battles of their 'creators', suffering in their places all of the horrors of the wars which their 'creators' chose be fought.  Some of these 'androids'/human-made humans reach earth, intending to revenge themselves upon their 'makers' for creating them for exploitation, suffering, and an early death.  One of them survives long enough to kill one of these 'people', but he dies soon afterwards, his lifespan having been determined by his genes at precisely thirty years.  His victory feels empty, in a world where noone cares about it, except him.  As he dies, he mourns the loss, so early at thiry years of age, and with noone to pass them on to , of his memories of the amazing cosmic sights which he saw in the heavenly battlefields where he was forced to fight.  This film is very heartfelt, and its poignancy is all the more unmistakeable because of the selfish, survival-oriented, 'social' setting in which it is placed.  It also contains a romance of the central character, bringing to the viewer an understanding of the humanity of the 'andoids', and an identification with their plight, as the central character finds himslef to be an android, and needs must flee his human pursuers with his android mate, in order to survive for however long he has been genetically programmed to.A 'tip' for 'genetic' 'creators'/Capitalists/abusers: If you want to abuse ORGANIC material, do not make it look human!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AZRJH4JFB59VC	Lynwood E. Hines	The directors cut is head and shoulders above the original movie.  In the original, the narration eliminated any need to work out for yourself what the movie is about (which is most of the fun of watching a good movie), and  the ending was insipid and obviously did not fit.  It was clear to me when  I saw the movie for the first time that the &quot;happy&quot; ending had  been tacked onto the end with no thought given to consistancy.  I was not  surpised at all to find out that the &quot;executives&quot; had tacked it  on to try to make the film gross higher by appealing to the lowest common  denominator.  In the tug of war between art and profit, the original was  clearly compromised by the desire for profit.  Interestingly, this is  precisely what happened with the TV version of &quot;Brazil&quot;, which  was pathetic (the director's cut of Brazil was brilliant).The DVD leaves  a lot to be desired.  The audio is only sterio; there's no excuse for that.  There are virtually no extras included either.  No commentaries, no  deleted scenes, no &quot;making of&quot; featurette; just some production  notes.  Whoopie.But I bought it because I love the movie.  If I had it  to do over again, I would have waited for a more full featured DVD.	3.0	Excellent film, mediocre DVD	2000-06-07	9	9	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A369NBW6OP14QL	Mabuse	I really could not believe it, when I watched the first 20 minutes of the film - the best HD transfer ever. The picture quality beats IMO 'The Matrix collection' and '2001' which means something.The effect scenes were digitized, using 8k instead of 4k and man, you can see this. Remember the huge high-rise buidlings the cars are flying by? I thought that the space ships and the moon surface in '2001' was detailed. Please watch this, you haven't seen this kind of detail before. This is really breathtaking. Every detail from close to far away is in focus and landing the police car on top of the Tyrell building has never been sharper.  The exhaust flames shown over the Los Angeles of 2019 look like 3D.This is the best film transfer I have ever seen pressed on an optical disk!I was not disappointed from the content of the box. Very nice prints, a changing film piece, you can put on your desk, as well as a well made police car and the origami figure.As a fan of the movie, it is worth for me every dollar I spent for it. I am proud to possess this set.Highly recommended for the fans but for somebody who just want to watch the movie again, the normal single disk HD version might do.	5.0	High definition at it's best	2008-01-12	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY	MacheteJason	Wow! Three versions of the movie are included here along with a feature length documentary about the making of Blade Runner. Make no mistake, this is every fan's dream because it is loaded with extras. I have the 4-Disc Collector's Edition though many others have since been released on Blu-Ray and DVD. Harrison Ford was even included (but there was little mention of his dislike of Ridley Scott or the film though). It's one of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries I have ever watched (it reminded me of the excellent Never Sleep Again documentary on A Nightmare on Elm Street). Almost all of the main cast, crew and producers have returned to tell their stories. They talk about casting, shooting, editing, financing and everything else Blade Runner. If you were living in the dark ages with an old DVD or VHS copy of this you will love the deluxe treatment Blade Runner received with this upgrade.The movie itself is one of the greatest science fiction films of all-time. A police officer comes out of retirement to track down some illegal replicants (human cyborgs) who look like humans but are much stronger and at least as intelligent. Harrison Ford stars as Deckard who is trying to find his own humanity. It is stylistically similar to film noir (think 1940s) so that is not to everyone's taste (this is not Star Wars). I have shown this film to many people and few get it. Almost no one gets it the first time but this gets better with each repeat viewing. It also boasts an excellent original story from the legendary Hugo award winner, Philip K. Dick. Blade Runner was adapted from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by PKD.Blade Runner has 3 cuts, great video and audio transfers and plenty of featurettes and supplemental material.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I have to agree with the other critical comments here on this director's cut. The audio and video quality are no more than so-so, and although that is somewhat explainable because it was one of the first DVD transfers done, I wouldn't plunk your hard earned cash down for it yet. I'd wait until a better transfer is available.If you do, you'll still be rewarded with a great movie. Dick's vision L.A. is dark, dismal, and fraught with the perils of imperfect science in the shape of the homicidal androids. This future is interesting in that it invites comparison with H.G. Wells's great classic, The War of the Worlds. Few novels in the history of science fiction portray such a dire, dismal, hopeless, and pretty much depressing fate for mankind throughout the entire novel as Wells's book does. In many ways, the sci-fi genre was a literature of optimism as it was believed that science could solve all social problems and the future for humans and for society was bright. Wells's novel is almost unique in pointing out the risks of science and that the universe might be a bigger, more dangerous place than we had thought. Written at the end of the Gay Nineties, Wells's novel sounds an uncharacteristically cautious and sober note about mankind's possible future.In Bladerunner, Dick envisions a similarly dark, dismal, depressing, and in many ways, hopeless future. L.A. is even perpetually rainy, which adds to the film noir like atmosphere. We don't know if this is due to a climate shift or not in the movie, but maybe it's explained in the book. And like in War of the Worlds, science itself is shown to be a two-edged sword at it sometimes creates more problems than it solves in the imperfect androids, who serve well for a time, but then toward the end of their brief lives run amuck. Furthermore, science is unable to solve the problem and bounty hunters must be dispatched to terminate the androids when they do.Besides the androids, even the other humans are often shown as unprepossessing. The great scientist Tyrell is the ultimate nerd with literally coke-bottle lens glasses. And the dowdy technician, Sebastian, who takes the androids in, has some sort of skin disease that ages his face prematurely. He admires the andoids physical perfection since it contrasts with his own imperfection. And the psychologist who gets killed at the beginning of the movie when he gives the android the test seems smarmy and somewhat arrogant.One of the few positive characters, besides Harrison himself, is Sean Young, the beautiful, young android who doesn't even know she is an android. Her design is supposed to fix the problem, perhaps because she's ignorant of her own origins.Anyway, Dick's vision of the future reminded me of the great Wells classic from 1897 in its similarly dark, dismal, and depressing picture of the future.One final comment, if I remember right, Dick was married and divorced several times, and to the dismay of his former wives, there is often a shrewish woman in his stories that is no doubt intended to resemble his former spouse. I didn't see anyone like that in this movie, except perhaps for the Darryl Hannah android character perhaps, who isn't quite the same, but anyway, Dick was an interesting writer whose dyspeptic and dystopian visions of the future and on the dangers of science stood in contrast to much of the sci-fi genre.	2.0	A few comments	2005-08-02	3	1	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1R283L4SH4UP8	Magpie	"As Originally printed in Hi Def Digest in August:Responding to persistent questions from early adopters on both sides of the aisle, Warner has provided further details on the exact configuration of its upcoming high-def 'Blade Runner' releases.As officially announced late last month, Warner Home Entertainment will at last be debuting the definitive 'Blade Runner' in two editions apiece on Blu-ray and HD DVD. Set to street on December 18 are 'Blade Runner: The Complete Collector's Edition' and the even more elaborately-packaged 'Blade Runner: The Ultimate Collector's Edition,' each a five-disc set boasting several different versions of the film and hours of newly-produced bonus content.Since that announcement, speculation has run rampant over just how much of the material on these mammoth sets would be presented in full high-definition. (Warner famously released the HD DVD edition of 'The Ultimate Matrix Collection' last May with the final two discs presented in standard-def, a fact that wasn't revealed until just days before that disc's release.)This time around, the studio apparently going the full disclosure route, revealing to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits that while all five versions of the film included on the next-gen releases are being mastered in actual 1080p video, all of supplementary materials (including the new documentary ""Dangerous Days,"" and the deleted scenes) will be presented in 480p standard definition only.According to Hunt, Warner says the reason for this has nothing to do with disc space on either format, but rather the compressed time schedule in which the various extras are being produced.Warner has set a $39.95 list price for the five-disc 'Complete Collector's Edition' of 'Blade Runner,' while the deluxe 'Ultimate Collector's Edition' (featuring the same disc configurations but with special ""Deckard Briefcase"" packaging and other collectibles) will list for $99.95.We've added these latest details to our disc details pages for each of the four next-gen editions of 'Blade Runner', which you'll linked from our Blu-ray Release Schedule and our HD DVD Release Schedule, under December 18.You can also discuss the various editions of 'Blade Runner' in our Forums area -- click the following links to visit our dedicated threads for the 'Blade Runner' Blu-ray releases or the 'Blade Runner' HD DVD releases."	5.0	ALL FIVE VERSIONS ARE HI-DEF!!!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A254QJ5BTEUH85	Magus	"This sci fi movie takes place in Los Angeles in 2019. We have flying cars and can still drive on the ground. The earth at this time looks more like a wasteland and not healthy. Even the animals are scarce. Rick Deckard played by Harrison Ford is a retired hunter of robots called a Blade Runner. 4 cyborgs called replicants have escaped from a space colony. They're very dangerous models types, and it's illegal for them to even be on earth. They look human. Deckard is called in to resume his job as a Blade Runner and destroy them.Deckard sees it as a job he wants to get over with. But something in him changes as he goes after these replicants. The main creator of them named Tyrel of the Tyrel Corporation's motto is, ""More human than human."" These latest escaped models are nexus 6's, they can even be smarter than most humans. The leader of the escaped group is Roy played by Rutger Hauer and the other three are Prise, Zhora, and Leon. They have a purpose as to why they have left for earth. Which is tragic yet shows one of the reasons they can be so hostile and angry.Deckard does alot of investigation throughout the movie to track the replicants down. There are a few good action scenes, but there are a number of dialogue scenes that carry alot of dramatic themes in them. These dramatic themes are what really made Blade Runner very different from many other sci fi movies.Rachael played by Sean Young has an influence on Deckard's life, whether she realizes it or not. She is a new model of replicant, who has something the escaped ones do not have. She is allowed to stay on earth through Tyrel's permission. Deckard is a pretty cold guy and straight to business, we see him transform throughout the movie as he meets all these characters.The scenery is very dark, and it rains alot. Riddley Scott's films are usualy like that. This is the same man who did Alien. It does fit in with the seriousness tone of the movie. Everywhere you see are endless buildings. The special effects still hold up, they had to spend alot of time on models and lighting to do alot of their scenes. This was before CG came in to help with that. This is all in the behind the scenes disc.There are 4 discs. Disc 1 is the final cut, Disc 2 has the making of Blade Runner, Disc 3 has the theatrical, international, and the director's cut. Disc 4 has all the bonuses with deleted and alternate scenes, image galleries, screen tests, and featurettes. All of these different versions of the movie together and for the price makes it a great buy.The movie is still poplular today. You won't find many sci fi movies like this one."	5.0	Replicants Escape	2010-02-07	1	0	1

It's a futuristic detective story with great visuals, incredible atmosphere, and a interesting plot and characters.  What the directors cut has however is a lack of narraration  and the cheesy happy ending that was tacked on to please test audeiences.  I think that while the film is a bit more confusing without the narraration  it is far better.  This movie is a masterpiece in every sense of the word  and should not be missed(even 18 years later).	5.0	One of the Best Sci Fi films ever.	2000-04-07	2	1	1

The commentary by Harrison Ford makes the movie more then just a special effects movie. It gave the movie a heart and soul that most flicks just  don't have. More so, having read the book, I find the commentary put more  of what the author wanted it to be. I find the ending was cut short. I miss  his comment on the Officer in charge, I think it leaves the movie naked.  Understand that I have the movie and I like it. Just not as well as the one  that I saw at the show.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A31LKZG8UC6C0L	Mal Tempo	Like Walt Whitman who revised Leaves of Grass until he reached the last page on his deathbed, Ridley Scott has been tinkering with his classic Blade Runner.After various &#8220;Director&#8217;s Cuts,&#8221; Scott has gone the butcher shop by coming up with chopped liver and Salisbury steaks. He has swept up the bits from the cutting room floor and installed them in the butcher&#8217;s window.We finally got around to seeing the 2007 Blade Runner: The Final Cut.If we settle upon this one as the cut above the rest, we&#8217;d be rejecting all those versions that made 1982&#8217;s Blade Runner one of the most mind-boggling and influential movies of its time.Two movies changed the sci-fi landscape forever: Mad Max and Blade Runner. They made the future ugly and dirty, crowded and unpleasant. Throw in Alien (also by Scott) and you have a futuristic mess.No, Ridley has not cleaned up the set. He now revels in the messiness. Gone is the wonderful narrative voice of Harrison Ford, explaining to us what was going on. It&#8217;s not necessary because we&#8217;ve all seen the film before.Adding a few moments amplifies the characters without a narrative megaphone. The film is striking&#8212;especially from Sean Young&#8217;s Joan Crawford look to the smoky offices in the skyscrapers, and we still love Ford&#8217;s fey impersonation that loses nothing on Bogart&#8217;s fey impersonator scene in The Big Sleep.This 1940s detective film set in the 21st century lacks only Dooley Wilson, leaving Ridley Scott to play it again and again.We wanted to see again if Deckard is really another &#8216;replicant&#8217; sent to retire other replicants. We have wondered about this for 30 years.The Final Cut is brilliant. It&#8217;s hard to do more than polish a diamond, even if you want to cut it into smaller segments to add more jewel facets.In the meantime we wait for Ridley&#8217;s deathbed version.	5.0	Blade Runner: the Unkindest Cut of All	2014-07-07	0	0	0

The movie is slow without much plot and character development, and contains entirely too little action for a movie of it's theme. The music I think is terrible - I wished someone would've rescored the whole movie. The art direction is very good although some special effects are less than par (too often you see cars suspended from cables). The dvd is about as bare as you can get, containing basically no extras - even the &quot;jump to a scene&quot; option only gives about 9 &quot;jumping in&quot; places, about every 3-6 chapters. It should at least have the theatrical trailer which is standard on nearly all dvds. I find the fact that the dvd contained both the standard and widescreen versions to be a plus though. Even if you like the movie, you will find much lacking from the dvd.	2.0	Not Impressed	2001-01-18	6	3	3

Then recently went back to view the original. And there is definitely a difference in getting some insight on the humanity of the lead. No spoilers but wow. Not that something is said directly, but with what's presented, you can use your imagination or assumption that something is true.Now, time to set aside a day off from work to watch the extras.

What would you do when he tells  you that he is unable to fix you, and more than that, he's just a mortal  himself?  In Blade Runner, the real hero is Roy Batty.  He's done  &quot;questionable things,&quot; yet he reveals a humanity no other  character in the movie has.  He, like all the other replicants, (it doesn't  even matter if Deckard is a replicant) is truly &quot;more human than  human.&quot;  If nothing else, the one truth that you should take away from  this film is that all life, like memory, is precious, fragile, and  fleeting.	5.0	A Tear in the Rain is Forgotten	2000-08-01	2	2	0

I will say that everything in Ultimate Edition--and yes, it is available in standard def as well as HD and Blu-Ray--just blew me away.  From the 3+ hour documentary about the making of BLADE RUNNER to the various featurettes to the five--count 'em, five--versions of the movie, this set should be the last word for anyone who loves this film (or who loves movies in general).

As for the complaints about the ""Final Cut"" messing stuff up...c'mon people, Ridley Scott himself supervised the thing!  If the director cannot go back and fix his film that he made then what's the point?BLADE RUNNER is still as powerful for me today as it was when I saw it twenty-three years ago on VHS (ah, the years...).

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1J9QVXM9NLQNL	Margaret Smith	"After Antonioni's Blow-Up, Blade Runner is my favorite film. The special effects are dated (no CGI) and the film editing is staid (compared to, say, ""Matrix"").  But compared to the Star War prequels, it does illustrate how to integrate the special effects into the movie instead of the movie into the special effects.  I mean the actors actually seem to know where they are standing.While Blade Runner, like Blow-Up, can be appreciated as a genre film, consider Blade Runner as a meditation on what it means to be fully human (first recognize that, if we are not born human, then we must become human through experience and/or empathy). Art conceals art here.Film as an art form fascinates me because it alone marries the visual image moving through time with musical notes moving through time (if you mention opera here I'm going to mention all the options provided by film editing and music editing and not even bother to mention the fat lady). Few directors have understood this as thoroughly or exploited this as effectively as Ridley Scott. Films are, for me, a sensory and therefore sensual medium. If a film does not please my eyes and ears, intellectual gimmicks remain just gimmicks (think Memento here). A film, like a painting, must have a presence (forget Heidegger and just think of presence as charisma) that attracts and holds my attention by its appeal to my senses. Possibly because Scott started out in commercials, he is an expert at attracting and holding attention, at creating a film with presence. (Hey, if it looks good and sounds good and transcends itself with story and theme, maybe it is good. Lose the critical theory like Dogme 95.  Do I care if it is a hot or cold camera?  No, I only care that it works as a film.)It surprises me that few reviewers here have mentioned the innovative Vangelis score and the years it took before it was released as a CD."	5.0	If Blade Runner isn't five stars, what is?	2002-02-12	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AL2Q8YF4HB33	"MarianaP ""marianap"""	"The movie bares hardly any resemblance to the book on which it's supposed to be based upon, which is not too bad, because  I didn't like the book (""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"").Also, I saw the director's cut when it came on the screen and I like the studio's cut better. Once you see ""Blade Runner"" and naturally admire the director's achievement, it's tempting to take his side on this issue and on any other he likes, but this is what I felt after having seen both versions. The unicorn scene is a lovely piece of visual poetry, but it adds nothing to the film. It just seems out of place and de trop.Harrison Ford's narration did add a great deal, though, and it's a waste to see the movie without it. I don't care if Harrison tried to botch it up: the jaded, tough Phillip Marlowe rendition works. In Humphrey Bogart's detective movies (my all time absolute favorite actor) you can see how the two characters share the same tough but secretly vulnerable persona. There's even a scene when Ford pretends he's a nerdy, sexually neutered jerk to get informations, that makes me wonder if it might not have been inspired by a scene from ""The Big Sleep"" - a twist, by the way, that was invented by Bogart himself.I think here one sees Harrison Ford at his best. I'm sorry to see his acting skills deteriorating more and more with age, and it adds to the melancholic experience of watching this film to know that he's never been in such a great movie, or ever acted that wonderfully again, except in ""Frenetic"", by Roman Polanski.Another spoiler was an interview with Sean Young that I once read, where she denounced how badly she and Harrison Ford got along on the set. The love scene, that I always thought was so electrifying, does nothing for me now, thanks to her. She said Harrison actually did throw her violently against the window for real, and that those tears one sees her cry aren't the tears of the cracks in her character's armor showing, but of her real and actual physical pain.Nevertheless, it's still a mind-blowing experience. I'm not objective enough about this work to be able to tell if it's dated or not - I hope it isn't. I suppose one could say ""Casablanca""'s dated, but it's beyond that thanks to its timeless quality. The same, I hope, could be said of this work.The beauty of the movie (the sets, the clothes, the lighting, the make-up, the music by Vangelis of course) is unbeatable.There are so many details I love about it: the city, the geisha add, Sean Young's entrance, Harrison Ford's character remembering how his wife used to call him sushi (cold fish), Daryl Hannah's acrobatics and eye make-up, Rutger Hauer's coolness, the hunger for life only the dying can experience, its slick dirtiness and tragedy."	5.0	One of the greatest movies ever made	2003-11-15	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A25VPSCNL3TTFZ	Mark A. Cauble	"The ""Final Cut"" represents the end of the longest post-production in movie history-twenty-five years. This is how the film should have been released back in 1982. However, A lack of time and money kept it from being finished. Also, the film's backers added a horrible voice-over and a ridiculous happy ending, and they deleted the unicorn scene. The fans are responsible for this film finally being completed. There were enough of them to make it profitable for the owners of the film to put-up the money to bring director Ridley Scott back to apply the final polish to his masterwork. This is a real improvement over the so-called ""Director's Cut""-technical mistakes have been corrected, dialogue has been added and or changed and additional editing has tightened the film. The print, sound and music have also been up-dated. Overall, we now have a smoothed-out narrative and this is the shortest of all the many versions of the movie. This is now a perfect film! When ""Blade Runner"" first came out as a butchered and unfinished movie, it was generally dismissed. The release of the improved ( the voice-over and stupid happy ending were removed and the unicorn scene was added), but still rough ""Director's Cut"" led to a favorable critical re-appraisal and eventually placed the film among the 100 greatest films of all time. Its reputation will soar to even greater heights with ""The Final Cut."" Look for ""Blade Runner"" to move-up on the list of the greatest films of all time."	5.0	twenty-five years of post-production	2008-01-17	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A23U3IKN7CWO3Y	Mark A Jamison	I was a bit dissappointed in the DVD version, it was actually not much better than what I had on video, and there are not features to speak of.The movie is a classic. I would put it up with the _Maltese Falcon_,  and _The Big Sleep_. In fact of all the Humphrey Bogart style movies that  Harrison Ford has tried out, this is the only one he does as well as Mr  Bogart might have done with similiar material.The director's cut is  infinitely superior to the original movie. Gone are the cheesy voice overs  and instead you are left wondering if perhaps Dekkard himself is not what  he seems.Had the DVD contained more features I would have instantly  given this a five, but the lack of effort in putting the DVD together drops  it down a notch.	4.0	DVD version needs more.	2000-05-25	5	4	1

This version (which will probably be even more stunning in the HD-DVD and BluRay formats) is quite simply an experience in and of itself. If anything, this movie really rocked my world and then some. It literally made my Winter Solstice holiday the most memorable in a lifetime. And knowing of this film's history just adds to the overall experience.Too damn cool. If there's something that can help affirm one's life by providing much food for thought then you certainly can't go wrong with this. I'm simply amazed.A lot of love and care went into this edition.

For the life of me, however, I cannot understand why the director eliminated the narration from this film.Many of you may not know this, but there once was a movie genre called FILM NOIRE.  These movies usually involved a really good, loner type detective, like ""Sam Spade"" or the like.  He would walk you though the film using narration that highlighted what he was thinking while you watched him perform his investigative duties with a featureless ""poker face"" to fool the bad guys.Periodically, and most often impersonated, the detective would ""step out"" of a scene he was in and talk to the audience instead of narrating over the action.  Perhaps you've seen old Bogart films where he'd stand under a light pole in the rain and recite a monologue to the audience about how he felt the case was going or to highlight another character's actions, behaviors or personalities according to him.  THAT is E X A C T L Y what Blade Runner was meant to depict in a futuristic setting.  It worked WELL, and it is sorely missed from the director's cut.Honestly, and many will agree, unless you've seen the original cut of this film, you lose a LOT of information that helps you understand the story to the fullest.  If I'm ""whining"" or ""don't understand the `new school' "" and you DISAGREE blindly, then don't you EVER use the CAST/CREW COMMENTARY feature on you DVDs again.  Yeah...I THOUGHT so!!!So-perhaps those with the ""power"" can do what many of us are asking:  Give us our movie back...the way it was MEANT to be seen...the way WE remember it."	2.0	Wasn't FILM NOIRE the WHOLE point of this film?	2005-02-27	12	11	1

I first saw it by accident, I was going through my parents video collection, while my babysitter was listening to madonna, and chewing gum dressed in lace and lycra leggins, the video cover looked like it was going to be cool, I was 10, it had 15 certificate, so I  watched it! It had such a profound effect on me, I mean OK I didn't fully  understand the narrative, I hadn't the fogyest why Han Solo was now a cop  chasing a naked man who stuck nails in his hand, but visually it was  absorbing! The Directors cut is by far the best way to see the film, mostly  because it gives youthe choice as a viewer to enjoy the film without  hearing an arsey Harrison Ford doing a lame voiceover. It also brings in  key storyline features, that I don't want to give away. The film still  looks gorgeous, the special effects stand the test of time. It is one of  the type of films that you can watch over and over again, and find  something new each time. I like that fact..... oh and that you get daryl  Hannah in a lycra suit..always a bonus.

The voiceover added just the right touch to fill the empty parts. And as I didn't know at the time- echoed the idea that this was a futuristic film noir. The unicorn thing is stupid- Period. Deckard is not a replicant.The whole point of the story was he was more dangerous than any replicant, and that it took a replicant for him to become a human again. The original ending is the best as well- what the hell is wrong with having an element of hope?? That is part of what makes of human. What is wrong with Deckard actually finding true love-- Just like Luca$ don't screw with the magic- because then it isn't magic anymore- Ridley Scott doesn't get to decide that Deckard is a replicant- the writers never intended that- and if he is one- why we would he get his butt handed to him throughout the whole movie??	5.0	Original theatrical version is the best- hands down!!	2007-11-22	21	10	11
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AI97HSVGM378S	Mark	"5+ stars easily.  A great sci-fi book by P K Dick was turned into a great movie directed by the talented Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, ...)  Harrison Ford is perfect and there are a number of other well-known actors in this such as Rutger Hauer, who is amazing in his role.  I think I read that he came up with part of his closing monologue. The music is by Vangelis.The tempestuous story of its filming has been documented in books.  I really think that this is a sci-fi movie that can be put on the level of, say, Metropolis in terms of its influence, themes, and being ahead of the curve.  This isn't Wookies or Jar-Jar (Lucas' closest film to this was THX 1138).  This is a man who is starting to wonder what separates him from the humanoids he is supposed to ""retire"".About the book vs the movie-- I think Dick's writing can be very uneven  but this novel is first class.  While remaining largely faithful to the book, the movie does simplify things a bit by leaving off some of the book's religious/psychological themes.  There's a religion called Mercerism in the book that is based on empathy, and people have a fetish about owning live animals although mostly only replicants are available.  (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?)  People also frequently use a Mood Organ to give themselves synthetic happiness - in the novel, Decker's  wife is in a haze."	5.0	Best Sci-Fi Film	2007-09-20	26	20	6

The theatrical Blade Runner version, w/ narration is a great way to see this film the first time (and yes, I also have the book on my shelf). When I show some of my friends the DVD director's cut (?), some thing's are asked about. My veiwing pleasure is interuped by questions. Shoot, if they'd seen the original version first on my laserdisc player with the narrated explanations, then there'd be no questions. I liked the first version better, including the alternate ending. I rate this new 4 disc releaase on RUMORS, but they seem to be SOLID RUMORs, and as I stated, I own both versions. In some ways Laserdiscs are better than DVDs.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1QTNBUD2UT0PX	Mark L. Malaby	I've always been taken with this film visually, but on this last viewing...  Well, IMHO this is a true work of art.  First, remember this was only 3-4 years after the first Star Wars breathed life back into the  genre.  Blade Runner is light years (ahem) ahead in terms of visuals,  acting, camera work - the basic criteria for film evaluation.  Then, due to  the conceptually pregnant &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;  it is also a film about Ideas.  Ridley Scott (who came out of British  Television commercial work) is the master of mood, and this film proves it,  suprisingly with pacing as good as the best of Wenders or Ozu.  All this  adds up to what Schrader would call a trancendent expression - a film that  trancends its normative bounds (and, honestly the &quot;happy&quot; ending  would be a classic Schrader break in visual style.  Typically, Film is  considered more emotional, more visceral, able to tap into our gut directly  through the eyes (I only do eyes, you nexus 6? I make you eyes).  By  holding the camera, moving the light, pausing between lines, focusing on  reaction rather than action (Decker after Rachels 100th question,  St.Sebastian after Roy steps in, Pris' growling no), Scott gives us a  meditation on existance, (More Human than Human is our motto) and a  cautionary look at the future.

I bought the Director's Cut on letterboxed video sometime after 1993 and it made more sense than the original film.  Because of the unicorn scene, Harrison Ford's character could be an Android and doesn't know it.  I shall wonder about Rachel and Deckard after this story.

I bought the Director's Cut DVD several years ago because it was the only economical choice available. Like with some other DVD releases it was basic. Just the movie, and some cast/crew notes, plus the trailer. I wanted the commentary for it so badly. Maybe some extras.I had heard some discussion a few years ago about the idea of coming out with another release, with commentary and extras, but there were doubts whether it would come together. There were particular doubts about Harrison Ford's participation, since the lore was there was some real bad blood between him and Ridley Scott, because of what happened during the production of Blade Runner. Well, Harrison chose not to disappoint. He's interviewed in the extras. I'm glad to see that! This release is just about everything I wanted.The first disc has the ""final cut"" version of the movie. It turns out Ridley Scott actually shot a little footage in 2007 to fix it up! It has Scott's commentary, along with two other commentary tracks: production/writers, and design/special effects crew. The latter includes commentary by ""Visual Futurist"" Syd Mead.The second disc has ""Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner"", a 3.5-hour documentary on all aspects of the film, from when it was just Hampton Fancher's idea, to the final release. Among those interviewed are the director Ridley Scott, the writers Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, actors Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, Morgan Paull, Daryl Hannah, Joe Turkel, Joanna Cassidy, James Hong, the producers, the financiers, and the special effects crew (including Syd Mead). It was more than I could ever want in a ""making of"" extra. Great job. Interspersed throughout this documentary are clips of bloopers and deleted scenes. This was the only thing I wish they had separated out.This 2-disc set does not contain a ""deleted scenes"" feature. The most significant deleted scene that I've seen in crappy online video is where Deckard comes to visit Holden in the hospital after he was shot by Leon. Clips of this deleted scene are in the documentary, but it's not available on its own.I like seeing deleted scenes because sometimes they can provide insights into the story. Even so I can't be disappointed with this release. Like I said, it's more than what I hoped for in my wildest dreams. It's wonderful!"	5.0	Always hoped this would come out	2008-06-22	0	0	0

Apparently it was shot using slow film, and this renders the most impressive of transfers to HD.  The original film still holding much more detail than we get on HD.  The colour and light was a revelation - compared to those dark and dull DVDs.  The Final Cut, has some interesting additions, ""I want more life, f..ker"" is now changed to ""I want more life, father"".  And the dove shot at the end, is now in keeping with the dark city background.  Some of the gore is unnecessarily lengthened imho.  It's surprising what just a few more frames does, and here I think it cheapens the overall effect of the film."	4.0	A classic - but maybe time to move on	2008-06-27	5	4	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A328B2C7LTKCG8	Mark T. Matranga	Blade Runner is the name of the police task force responsible for retiring (another word for terminating) artificial life forms (called Replicants) who get loose on Earth, where they are illegal because of their erratic and sometimes murderous behavior. Decker (Harrison Ford) is a retired Blade Runner, called back into service by his captain (M. Emmit Walsh) when five Replicants get loose in the futuristic Los Angeles area.As Decker becomes acquainted with the newest Replicant models (Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Darryl Hannah) and the genetic engineers that manufacture them (William Sanderson), he begins to realize that nothing, including himself, is as it appears.Ridley Scott has created the greatest science fiction masterpiece of all time. A brilliant screenplay, amazing set designs and special effects, and an unforgettable soundtrack by Vangelis combine to create a richly textured future world, and the film immediately transports the viewer into this world. It's the kind of film that never grows tiresome upon repeat viewings.Many reviews complain about the lack of DVD special features. This is indeed sad, but don't wait for the new release to add this masterpiece to your collection. The more times you watch this film, the more you'll appreciate the new release when it finally does come out !	5.0	Science Fiction as a Work of Art	2005-01-29	3	2	1

I know this movie is all deep and layered with subtext and philosophical context on the human condition... but to me it was just boring.  I dont watch Sci-Fi movies to be deep, I watch them to be entertained.To be fair, I didn't watch this in the 80's even though I was a teenager during that time. I didn't actually watch this until just last month so it probably suffered some in my rating as it is very dated.  But I simply couldn't find myself invested in any of the characters in this movie.  I didn't care if Decker was a replicant, because I didn't care about Decker.  You never see anything about him that makes you want to care.The best role in this movie was Rutger Hauer and he was in like 3 scenes.  I literally fell asleep on my couch watching this movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1OTOUQ5YJZMY5	Martin Hollis	Blade Runner, based on the Novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by Phillip K Dick, is an insightful tale for those of us who have ever felt that the marvellous creation we call life is over far too  soon.The story involves a certain Rick Deckard, played innocently by  Harrison Ford who manages to fit in perfectly in tune with the Noirish  theme of the movie.He has been assigned to &quot;retire&quot; dangerous  Nexus 6 replicants, Off-world colonists who are seeking to increase their 4  year life span. Rutger Hauer is magnificent as Roy Batty, leader of this  group.There is also Daryl Hannah, who portrays Pris. Quite what made  Ridley Scott decide to choose her must have been a mystery to WB, but she  remains the gem in this movie, neither outdoing nor detracting from the  main characters.Blade Runner remains my favourite movie of all time,  however, I am a stalwart and the original still seems slightly better...  Nevertheless, I feel that once you have seen the movie, you will want both  versions.A monumental movie, and as such, deserves never to slip into  obscurity, for it is the greatest Film Noir of all time.	5.0	A classic in the genre.	1999-05-29	1	0	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A8TZ88OM8YOLW	MartyHansen	"What if, as a person, you came into this world fully-grown, fully aware, experiencing life to its fullest -- but were to die in just a few years?  In that time there could be no family, no grandchildren, and no debilitating diseases to signal the pending of one's demise.  The curtain would close - at the height of one's existence.What if, as a woman, you were also thrusted into the world fully developed -- mature physically, but an emotional novice - and that you allowed yourself to be molded to the satisfaction of your man's desires?It takes a while to get there, but that is what the movie `Blade Runner' - based upon the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by that classic sci-fi writer, Phillip K. Dick - is all about.The film, made in 1982, pictures life in Los Angeles in 2018.  (Even though we're halfway there, we're not even close to achieving the technological advancements depicted.)  Harrison Ford, much younger, is the hero.  He is a ""blade runner,"" someone who kills the replicants (fake humans relegated to other worlds) when they trespass on Earth.  The special effects, although dated and looking like something out of `Battlestar Galactica', are still excellent.  The look of the movie is dark and brooding, like  `Alien', another of Ridley Scott's works.Three replicants come to Earth and Harrison goes to meet them.  He kills a few, and falls in love with another.  There's some erotically gruesome slow motion death scenes of beautiful, scantily-clad women (Daryl Hannah one of them) being shot in the back and in the gut, oozing innards a la Sam Peckinpah-style, which is ok since they're replicants.  Rutger Hauer, who looks like Paul Newman, gives the most touching performance as he struggles to come to grips with the end.The movie is futuristic - but actually much deeper -- which is probably why it's achieved an almost cult-like status.  This is a great feature if one wishes to ponder - the meaning of life itself.  Don't miss it!"	5.0	Pondering Life	2003-05-03	4	1	3

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1OEQP3GWNG263	Matt Dunphy	This is a five star movie--a classic, featured prominently in every film class I've ever taken--and my review score is downgraded only at the quality of the DVD, which is possibly the worst I've ever seen. Picture  quality is just fine, but sound, which is advertised on the box as Dolby  Digital, is not. You'll only get at most Pro Logic Surround with the right  equipment off this disc, as it hasn't been newly remastered for this  release and Dolby Digital didn't exist when it was made.There aren't any  new goodies on this DVD, and the generic interface/menu screens absolutely  suck.You can argue that this is no big deal, but when you see the loving  care that's been put into the extras and menus of DVD's like Alien and  Aliens, and see how much it adds, you can compare and see what a terrible  disservice has been done to this classic film. It doesn't even come in a  durable box (not many do, but the ones that do are appreciated).Unfortunately, it's the only game in town if you want to own this  landmark work. It's too bad that the studio won't remaster the sound and  rerelease this DVD as it should be, with both Director's Cut and Theatrical  Release on the same disc, complete with proper menus and extras. THAT would  get a five star review from me, without doubt.	2.0	Great movie: Terrible example of a DVD, though.	1999-12-29	45	38	7

It was a large batch.Third almost 2 years later, this problem is STILL happening.I just bought this set from Target for $29.99. Disc 1 labeled ""Final Cut"" is actually the Workprint Disc 5. I called Warner and a new BRD will arrive in 1-2 weeks, no charge and I dont have to return anything.ONLY THE MOST HARDCORE FANS should endevour this task. You're 50/50 on getting the correct discs in the set. And with gas being ~$4 a gallon, can you afford driving back and forth 1-4x? If you are a completist like I am, you want ALL the cuts, so you have to invest 1-2 weeks getting the Final Cut (it's worth it BTW) or you can just buy the 2-disc Final Cut Blu-Ray if you just want the final version (and best version).I gave this 3 stars since the movie and quality is great.

"This is one of my favorite movies ever, and certainly the best film Harrison Ford was ever involved with. Ditto Rutger Hauer. No, on second thought I'd like to edit that to read 'ESPECIALLY Rutger Hauer.'""Say there, Roger Ramjet!"" you're probably thinking. ""What kind of banana oil are you peddlin', bucaroo? Cuz you're in the wrong shop if you're shoppin' fer a sucker!"" Allow me to explain. Everything about this movie worked. The sets, the cast, the music--everything. This film looks as fresh and evocative as it did when it first aired in the early 80s, and easily gets my vote for 'Most Atmospheric Movie Ever Award'. I can't think of another film that drags you so quickly into it's Reality with the exception of  Star Wars, whose opening scenes gave the audience it's first glimpse at the overwhelming might of the Empire.I think everyone takes something a little different from Blade Runner. For some it may be a question as to what it is that truly makes us Human, others may see it as a Space Opera romance, others still may find it a chilling warning on current societal trends. The point is that it stimulates thought in almost everyone who sees it, and I find that a wonderful quality given the pre-digested pap we tend to get nowadays. I don't know a great deal about Phillip K. Dick's personal life. He strikes me as being a bit paranoid with an unhealthy fear of the passage of time, but for all I know to the contrary he may have been frequently found with a lamp shade on his head, entertaining the neighbors with comic songs and tap dancing. Hard to say, but either way the man had a tremendous imagination, and this story is among his best.Blade Runner can be clinically shown to be the only legitimate example in history of a film that is slightly better than the book it was based on. I give Ridley Scott the credit for that; it was the director who created this convincingly sinister alien landscape for us. I never tire of this movie, and seem to catch new and quirky details each time I see it. The dialogue is wonderfully surreal in parts, and it's a treasure trove of quotable lines for you and like-minded friends.The only criticism I could bring would be on the version available on DVD. I did not see Blade Runner in a theatre; my introduction to this classic came by way of the ancient VHS tape. That version contained the commercially released voice-over by Harrison Ford, deleted and seemingly unavailable on any DVD version I can find. I may be in a very small minority here, but I think it was a terrible mistake to cut the VO. Not only did it splash an indispensable aura of Noir chic over the landscape, it was a handy tool for rendering a complex plot into a form more easily grasped by the casual viewer. I sincerely hope that one day a proper DVD will be made available featuring both versions, theatrical release and Directors' Cut. Please allow your fans to also enjoy it in the form they remember it, Mr. Scott!"	5.0	"""Do You Like Our Owl?"""	2007-04-10	10	7	3

In the original it was painfully obvious when they cut to the stunt woman, bad wig, wrong face easy to see because it was slow motion.  In the Final Cut they have gone back and digitally replaced the stunt woman's head with Madam Cassidy's.  Quite cool.  Plus the horrible voice over is still gone.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1XL7LTSBGD74Z	Matthew Morse	Blade Runner is an absolute must for the Sci-Fi cinema connoisseur. I waited to purchase the wide screen directors cut on VHS before I'd have anything to do with watching this masterful film at home on some overrun  rental copy. However, what this film needed was remastering for DVD quality  and features. A remarkable film in itself, however, doesn't always mean a  good viewing experience is guaranteed. The transfer to DVD from film showed  major signs of film shake, dust, and overall poor mastering. The titles and  text were poor; losing their crisp edges, showing that not taking care of  color balance and using good analog-to-digital mastering can really ruin a  good viewing experience. Then to top it off, the exquisite Vagellis  soundtrack wasn't reproduced in the Dolby Digital surround sound I was  expecting from DVD. My SVHS played the soundtrack better than the DVD! A  real disappointment. Of course, some may say I am being picky, but with the  tempo of the film -- seeing the room shake like the camera needed to be put  on a steady cam is not acceptable, period! For reference, the playback was  reproduced on Sony's reference model DVD-7700 using component video on both  a Mitsubishi HDTV and a Sony VEGA-36XBR flat screen TV. The sound was  passed digitally to a BOSE 5.1 home theatre balanced for the room.	3.0	Blade Runner	2000-01-10	32	28	4

Well, maybe I'm just biased towards this film, but I have to say this is really one of the best, if not the best Collector's sets out there.Everything that kept this film from being as perfect as can be has now been corrected in the ""Final Cut"" version of the film. Ridley Scott did not take a page from George Lucas and butchered this amazing film. He just corrected the flaws in this film that he couldn't fix at the time, because of budget and time restrictions.Though, do not worry, all corrections are seamless. This is what truly makes these corrections really great, is that unless you have already seen the previous versions, you wouldn't even know what was corrected. This is the sole reason why I'm not even going to mention what corrections were made, just so for those who have never seen this movie can see for themselves if they can spot them. I'm confident to say I doubt they will be able to.What you will notice right away is how amazing the PQ/SQ is of this film (Final Cut). This movie looks like it could have been shot yesterday, and I'm not exaggerating. I own the Blu-ray set, so I can't speak for the SD-DVD set, but I'm sure it's amazing in it's own right as well.Though, if you want the best experience and you own an HDTV, then I recommend you get yourself a Blu-ray player and buy the Blu-ray 5-Disk Collector's Edition Set. It's expensive, but worth every dollar.So, what do you get in this 5-disk collector's set?5 versions/cuts of the film, which includes the rare workprint version.3 hour+ documentary that will pretty much give you all the information you want and more about the making of the film.Deleted Scenes, Casting Auditions, etc....SD-DVD, or Blu-ray you will not be dissapointed."	5.0	Blade Runner perfected.	2008-04-06	4	2	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A315ZC2RCGQRDV	M. Bower	Cyberpunk dystopia, existential splendor, postmodern alienation! The final cut of Blade Runner revitalizes a vivid portrayal of urban decay, racial subjugation, and technology at its worst.  Although it may lack the traditional themes of film noir, the mood and atmosphere is there. There is an unsettling resemblance between the world we currently live in, over two decades after the movie's release, and Ridley Scott's dark vision of a future where technology, capitalism, and genetic engineering go awry.  I rank this as one of the greats of science fiction, next to Solyaris, Metropolis, and 2001.	5.0	One of the greatest scifi films of all time	2008-04-01	0	0	0

I love everything about it. The story is interesting and the cast fill their roles superbly. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer in particular stand out. The only downbeat for me on this front was Leon, but that wasn't a big deal.The world itself looks great on blu-ray and is still a visual treat. The future world feels authentic and the details pull you in, the opening shot of the city is simply wonderful. All through the film there are little details that add style and interest. It also blends high tech future, with grim reality that is still full of life.The film's soundtrack is amazing, it suits the film perfectly, it's worth picking up for that alone.I think it's safe to say that I love this film and if you haven't seen it yet then you owe it to yourself to do so.	5.0	Science fiction at its finest	2013-09-24	6	3	3

Cronenworth	I'm too young to have seen this movie when it was originally released in theaters, but I have seen the directors cut on DVD and enjoyed it the first time I watched it. I had to rewatch it dozens of times to understand this movie and I thought it was already a great movie. After watching the Final Cut on Blu-ray with my 56 inch Samsung DLP, I can easily say that Blade Runner is now my favorite film. It fixed many of the little errors and added extra depth to a super deep film. Congratulations Ridley Scott, as you put together a great piece of art. George Lucas could learn a thing or two from you on remakes and recuts.

Especially near the end of the movie.The actual director's cut is a little too slow at times. Without the commentary, parts of the movie are a little boring as people do stuff you don't care about.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1TK6A0AIX9UA6	Meanwhile	I was mesmerized by this film when I saw it in its original theatrical release.  The visuals -- though not &quot;spectacular&quot; by today's standards -- are still immensely impactful in their tone.  The story is very intelligent and still compelling.After hearing much about the director's cut, I was momentarily persuaded into thinking that Harrison Ford's voiceover was indeed corny and superfluous.  Well, I saw the movie again a few days ago (in the Director's Cut), and I have to disagree.  The voiceover narration that's present in the original version helps move the pace along.  A lot.  And there are specific key scenes where the narration adds a lot more depth than if it wasn't there.  To me the wisdom of the pivotal climactic scene, and how it is comprehended by Deckart is what sets this film apart from anything like it.  As it is now, he just gets a funny, knowing look, and then it cuts to the conclusion.  The full meaning of Roy Batty's actions are quickly overlooked, given the momentum of the scenes that preceded his speech.  You need that bit of self reflection along with the smirk, Harrison.Yes, I know it's still film noir without the voiceover, but this movie needs it.  I want the original version on DVD, too.  And this makes it the second movie I've seen where the Director's Cut hasn't lived up to the hype.  3 stars for this version.  5 stars for the movie in general.	3.0	Bring Back the Voiceover Narration.

The picture is sharper than a blade, with many details and nice colors. Even the 640 kb/s DD track is deep and includes lots of elements creating a surrounding experience quite impressive for 25-year-old movie.Then, the 5-disc edition builds a ""complete dossier"", including all the different cuts of the film in a nice quality (if you only knew the power of preserving all cuts from the dark side...): even the workprint version, with the poorest picture, remains viewable. A large amount of bonus material is provided, including ""Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner"" which last longer than the film itself!All this allows to become a full ""Blade Runner""-geek! Anyway, even after the release of the ""Final Cut"" (which bring interesting elements), the major cut changes faced by the movie are still the voice over and the ending opposing the 1982 releases to the workprint/1992-false-dir's-cut/final-cut family.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1Z484GQB9IRD5	"M. Garland ""mgarland16"""	"Blade Runner: The Final Cut [Blu-ray] is a top-notch movie transfer from the masters to Blu-ray, as I can not see any artifacts or grain except in extremely rare places in this movie. I want to say I can also see some ""problems"" at the beginning in the opening sequence with all the special effects in Los Angeles' futuristic landscape, but the detail is so amazing and the transfer so crisp, that I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with it. All colors, lines, detail and special effects were pretty much immaculate and very crisp. No annoying blocky dark patches, no fuzzy effects overlaid over the film's original background, nothing. Like I said: I was really trying hard to see any visual problems and I think I just ""convinced"" myself I could see some in very few places.Whew! The Final Cut is finally here, and I have to say, of all the versions I've seen, this is my favorite. I have owned this movie on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray, and I am completely amazed at how good this movie looks on the Blu-ray transfer.I was hesitant to get it. I get tired of all the various versions that keep coming out for movies (and I just see it as a money-making excuse for the production companies to cash-in on a movie, rather than provide anything substantial for fans; yeah, I know, I'm cynical that way).But, I'm a huge Harrison Ford fan...Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Hunt for Red October, Regarding Henry...he's made a lot, but those are my favorites...and I had to have Blade Runner on Blu-ray.  I've not seen the other Blu-ray versions, so I can't really comment on their qualities, but I have to say this version of the movie is my favorite. It had been awhile since I'd seen it, and this Blu-ray version and transfer are proud members of my collection now.You want a review of the movie? It's good. Not great, but it's good. It's a dark and brooding glimpse of the underbelly of the future, although I can't see (and hope it doesn't) look like this in the future, 8 years from now. Harrison Ford's job is to terminate (""retire"") synthetic human-looking robots that are too human and have been deemed illegal on Earth. Rutger Hauer is in true form as the deranged, psychopathic leader of the replicants that come back to Earth to meet their creator face-to-face and demand that they be given a chance to LIVE! They've been preprogrammed and hardwired for a 4 year lifespan, and they don't like it. Harrison Ford finds himself coming out of pseudo-retirement to bring down these highly dangerous, very lifelike enemies, and soon realizes he has feelings for another replicant...and things get ""complicated"".This movie is stylistically and artistically a visual treat to watch. Every scene just drips with detail and dark ambiance, whether it's the gorgeous futurerealistic cityscapes, or the dark underbelly of the city in even its rundown environs...it just has a visual style that is interesting to watch."	5.0	Blade Runner: The Final Cut [Blu-ray] is the definitive version -- FINALLY!!	2011-08-04	11	10	1

Yes, yes, of course my own choice would probably differ a tiny bit from the five versions Ive seen - still its a great movie.Extra thanks to Ridley Scott, amazing how many good movies he made so far.(note: there was a technical problem with the 1st disc, called final cut, but Amazon solved that in a really professional manner and sent me a new disc really quick)	5.0	A journey into the future, from the past	2009-01-11	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AD5GULP4S8TKL	"Michael Anderson ""A Fan"""	"Harrison Ford stars in the dystopian noir set several years into the future. Blade Runner is one of the few movies that has managed to withstand the test of time on a visual level as well as a remain one of the most, dare I say, innovative title's that have ever graced my audio/visual senses. The movie itself is one of exploration into futuristic themes such as identity and love in a world where artificial beings called ""Replicants,"" being banned on Earth, are virtually identical to human beings. Rick Deckard (Ford) is a retired detective, or as the title suggests ""Blade Runner"" who is hired once again to hunt down several rampant Replicants. The movie stands as a character study of both Deckard and several replicants as they struggle to grasp the concept of life and its value.It's not so much about being futuristic as it is about creating a noir-esque atmosphere for which the characters can develop in, it just so happens that it does this in such an efficient manner that it comes off as wholly believable on every level. Looking at the film you can definitely see the 80's influence, though this film does not struggle to go above and beyond film's of it's genre even today, as it surpasses most recent sci-fi flicks. I found the subtle 80's feel to be very delightful, especially as it shines through in Vangelis' absolutely amazing soundtrack, which without, the movie would only be a shell of what it is.The Blu-Ray five disc Complete Collector's Edition has enough extras to keep your Blade Runner hunger at bay as it features every version of the film released including both narrated and non narrated versions with deleted scenes that escalate the Blade Runner atmosphere ever so much higher.Blade Runner stands as one of the few films, if not the only film, that I have ever seen that turned out to be more than one hundred percent satisfactory on every possible detail that could be reviewed.

A fan of Minority Report, the Adjustment Bureau, and Total Recall, I was sure this film (which was also famous for its time) would have been mind bending and take me to new imaginative places. Instead, it was very boring. Admittedly, the film was made in 1982 and my loss of interest may simply be that the effects and imagined future is 30 years old; still, I expected to find the same quality of suspense and newness in this film as in others based on Dick's writings. After the first 30 minutes, it was hard to keep interested. I hope newer dramatizations of Dick's stories will be more entertaining.	1.0	It's based on a Philip K.

We all know that.  I know there is a great addition coming in 2007 but i couldn't wait to see Blade Runner remastered. I'm not going to go on and on about the movie because all of you Blade Runner fans out there know what's up.  My main reason for writing this review was to dicuss the transfer.The transfer is definitely better than the one you are all used to.  I'm pretty picky and to be honest, i was not 100% impressed.  I guess since it took so long I was expecting more.  From the beginning you can spot all that grain and noise we are all used to.  i guess i was just expecting a tranfer like Alien or Apocalypse now.  The picture is definitely clearer and the colors are more vibrant.  I have a feeling that they could have done a little bit better though.  Just wanted to voice my opinion to all the blade runner fans out there who can't wait to see the tranfer.

Career peaks for Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Brion James. Great music by Vangelis throughout. Phillip K. Dick's work always seems better, or at least more entertaining, on screen.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2IFN66ESADGXZ	"Michael Fix ""music & book junkie"""	I have been waiting for years to purchase the definitive edition of this movie and it has finally arrived. No, I didn't go crazy and buy the super deluxe, suitcase, with the wings from the dove bonus collectible, etc... sure one or two of the extras on that version sound cool but for me this is just the right amount of material.What can I say, the film looks and sounds amazing - I was fortunate to have seen it re-released at The Ziegfeld in NYC but being able to watch it again and again is wonderful. I must say I was a bit disappointed with Ridley's commentary as he rambles quite a bit and does not seem to be watching the movie after a while as his comments often do not relate to what is on screen. He just doesn't seem that focused or enthusiastic about the process.However the 'making of' segments are phenomenal - a filmmaker or film lovers dream! Tons of development information, behind the scenes decisions, fights, etc. Very educational, informative and engaging and worth the price just for these segments alone.	5.0	FINALLY!	2008-04-11	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3F3B1JPACN215	Michael G. Lustig	I like this movie as much now as I did when it came out in 1983.  If you've never watched the movie then you should probably start with the US Theatrical Release since it explains the story line in more detail.  If you've seen the movie, watch the Final Directors Cut by Ridley Scott.  Remember that prior to Blade Runner every futuristic Sci-Fi movie had people in white jumpsuits living in a sterile hospital-like environments.  This was the first film to show the future the way is will unfortunately be: acid rain, polution, advertising everywhere and just plain dirty.  If you only buy one movie, this should be the one.	5.0	A classic that never gets old	2008-01-12	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AZI0O32W4ZYGH	"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon"""	"Perhaps I am ignorant of the sci-fi world, but I fail to see how one could state that this is the all-time best ""sci-fi"" film of all time, especially when, approximately 10 years after Blade Runner was made, there was a far more compelling movie made, ""Back to the Future,"" which has generated a much larger fan base as well.The book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" was far better than Blade Runner.  It's hard to imagine that Phillip Dick would have approved of such a poor rendition of his masterpiece.One thing bears noting, though:  one of the key film locations in this movie, Ennis House, is one of the most endangered properties in the world.  It literally is facing the risk of extinction, and I do hope that the fans of Blade Runner, along with the cast and crew, will do something to save it."	3.0	Blade Runner Was Okay.

It would have been great to have had an option to turn it on or off... but to not include it...

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1FDRRQGPIIA5U	Michael Iannacone	In my not so humble opinion, this film made by the master director Sir Ridley Scott, is the most perfect piece of cinema ever put together. Every aspect of the production brought their A+++ game. From set design, to costumes, to lighting, to model work and special effects, to the acting, to the score, to the direction... perfection. Even thirty years later it remains an undated masterpiece. My all time favorite film. And I have a lot of favorite films. In the Final Cut of Blade Runner Ridley fixed the only shot that took me out of the amazing experience, a dove flying up towards a bright blue sky, intercut in the middle of a pouring rain at nighttime end scene. Problem fixed = Perfect film. Perfect I says.	5.0	Best. Film. Ever.	2012-05-31	17	13	4

It was very nice to have the Narrated version, which Riddly didn't like, but most fans prefer. (Harrison Ford's Narration was excellent.)My main complaint about this product, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I purchased the HD DVD version and I expected HD quality.  Though it was in HD format, the picture was as grainy as an average quality normal DVD formated movie...in fact I've seen less grainy normal DVD movies.  If you're going to port something over to HD format, enhance the qualtiy to take advantage of the improved resolution.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A7FJVRLMG5BF9	Michael JR Jose	Set in a grim Los Angeles of the future, many of earth's inhabitants have migrated to other planets. Roy, the replicant leader has returned to earth, but he, like the other replicants, is scheduled to die. His four years are almost up, for him soon it will be `time to die'. The greater part of his tragedy is that he lives life hyper-aware of his death. A death which is decreed to the day by his maker. He is made by the Tyrell Corporation as a product, a being who looks human but having extra-human powers, but with sub-human emotions as he will not live long enough to build up a soul of true humanity. The Tyrell replicants are too powerful to be allowed to run loose---on earth or elsewhere---so they have a fail-safe built into them: they are designed to fail after four short years of life.Roy is the most dangerous of all replicants, a warrior class officer, a combat model. And having fought for his owners in space battles, he has now escaped and returned to earth with a few other replicant model types to somehow extend their artificially limited lives. The police have the Blade Runners out, death squad cops who specialise in hunting renegade replicants. The replicants are hard to spot, they are tougher, smarter, and more determined than any designed before. There is even the worry that they will develop fully human emotional responses, and so become too similar to humans to tell apart.The whole film is replete with religious signs and symbols and quotes. Lines from the bible and scriptural imagery are woven throughout. One of female replicants performs onstage with the snake `which tempted Eve'. Tyrell, the heartless genius who is the chief replicant designer, calls Roy `the prodigal son' [prodigal - a waster who returned home]. Roy says to Tyrell `It's not an easy thing to meet your maker', and in a confessional tone, `I've done questionable things'. When Roy meets Chou, the eye designer, he quotes `Fiery the angels fell, deep thunder rolled around the shores, burning with the fires of Orc' (a replicant who has read Blake's prophetic poem, `America', he deliberately misquotes). Pris, the pleasure model, says to Sebastian the geneticist, `I think Sebastian, therefore I am'. The question is, with all the human beings so flawed, so unlovely, so downright unpleasant, what is the difference between the replicant products and them? Maybe just a few more years on earth.Mortality, humanity, time, finitude, purpose, salavation, redemption: all these and more are here. Roy is the only replicant left. He fights Dekkard, the best of the Blade Runners, fights for his life although he knows he has minutes left of his deathday. He was created to fight, so in fighting he fulfils the purpose for which he was created. He wins a few more minutes of life by stabbing his hand through with a large nail. It is impossible to ignore the symbolism. The pain clears his mind and focuses his will. The tables are turned, Dekkard is going to fall to his death. But the hand with nail is the hand he uses to grab Dekkard before he falls. He saves his life. But now for him it is indeed `time to die'. He has always known that this moment would come. The crisis is upon him: he is created to kill, but at the last he preserved life. He does not want to die alone. He last words to Dekkard are of the all beauty he has seen in his short, violent life, which are now to be lost as he passes from this world. It seems that he has won his humanity at the last. Being created to kill, at the last he found he could choose not to. The dove he holds in his hands flies up free as he loses consciousness, the last symbol impossible to miss. But Dekkard the professional killer has to live on, he has demons of his own to fight. He is still looking for happiness, and he needs a relationship above all to make his life worthwhile. There is all too little beauty, goodness, and love in his life. He knows he is still searching, but who cares?The Frankenstein theme is unmistakable. When God created, He created a Man who was `very good', not yet complete, not yet perfect, but without errors or flaws. The Man chose his own path, wanted to make it on his own. The world he goes on to create is so very flawed. Above all, when Man creates in his own image, he makes in his own flawed image, with the weaknesses inevitably magnified in his sub-creation. He is no substitute god, he is a tyrant and exploiter, and his creation turns angrily on his maker. So who can redeem him?	5.0	"""IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO MEET YOUR MAKER"""	2006-08-31	17	16	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A30CULRZ756V0G	Michael Kramer	The 5-star rating I gave is for the original theatrical release.  The directors' cut, rates only 3 1/2 stars.  First of all the DVD should have a flip-side, one side for the orginal theatrical release (with the voice-over narration of Deckard), and the other with the directors cut.  I believe the narration set the whole tone of the film; its deletion from the DVD took away a lot of the atmosphere of the film.  This is a very dark and moody film, and those of us who grew up in the 80's and 90's can identify with the bleak outlook it portrays for future Earth.  The &quot;uplifting&quot; ending (if you could call it that) in the orginal is the only positive message we see in this future.  The sound on the DVD is very disappointing, but the video is excellent.  This disappointed me for one main reason:  When I bought the DVD I expected to be surrounded with not only the sights but also the sounds of future Los Angeles.  I wanted to be absolutely taken to Deckard's world and unfortunately, I wasnt.  About the only thing I noticed in surround was the music, and the police vehicles as they flew by.  To the guy who complained about Rutger Hauer's final scene being chopped:  I agree 100%.  I personally think Harrison Ford fit the part of Deckard perfectly, but no one (absolutely no one) couldve protrayed Roy Batty except Rutger Hauer.  His final death scene was very convincing, and although it is only a movie, and I am a grown man, that scene still literally will move me to the verge of tears.  For those who havent experienced Bladerunner, please do so. Its not the most action packed film around, but this movie is so good, it doesnt need a lot of action to sustain it.  I personally thank all those involved with this film for bringing it to vibrant life for all of us fans.

I mean the original version was one of the best sci-fi flicks I'd ever seen.  This version was definately NOT needed.  Too many nuances that there was just no way you are going to pick up were omitted when the voice overs were cut, that is unless you were a mind reader.  The ending is so radically different, I was left wondering what Scott had in mind with this.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2M2A3K6SD9X09	Michael M	The very fact that people still debate the removal of the narration, extra violence, and the happy ending, and the addition of the extra second unit footage and the dream sequence in the Director's Cut, is a testament to how  well this film holds up after nearly 20 years.  Personally, I prefer the  Director's Cut because we know that the motivation for the changes came  from the commercial process, not the artistic one, but I certainly  understand that the voiceovers make this film much more accessible.  The  details and the density of the material make Blade Runner (in any version)  a fascinating film; one can watch it a dozen times and continue to find new  things.  This is truly a movie-lover's movie and, in any incarnation, the  film itself deserves FIVE STARS.On the other hand, the DVD was mastered  poorly in both respects, video and audio.  Put simply, the video transfer  looks &quot;dull&quot;, the colours seem washed out and the colour  separation and contrast are sub-optimal.  There is some artifacting, which  is particularly noticeable during the scenes which are filmed inside the  Bradbury Bldg. where the sets are very dark (well okay, the whole movie is  very dark!).  Comparatively, the audio is even worse.  The dynamic range is  strangely exaggerated whilst the EQ is poor and it seems that whoever  mastered it to surround didn't have the time and/or attention to really  pull out the little aural details that can make a Dolby Digital mix truly  shine; one would think that the spectacular sounds and music in Blade  Runner would have deserved a careful and thorough cleanup and remaster to a  5.1/7.1 mix.  Also, the reference level seems quite low.I'm not trying  to sound too analytical; I just wish that the folks who mastered 'Fifth  Element' (my FIVE STARS on pure audio/video quality) could have worked  their magic on Blade Runner.  In any case, this film is one of my absolute  favourites.	3.0	Incomparably great film deserves a better DVD transfer	1998-12-04	10	9	1

Some of the questions: &quot;How long do I have to live?&quot; &quot;How do you know whats real (memories)?&quot;  &quot;Does anyone care about how I feel (why did you do this to us)?&quot;Playing god, as the company finds, does have its dangers.

Superimpose this philosophical jungle over a noir detective story and an assassin who hates killing with the lushly dark, ever raining decline of the world, and sit back for some real fun.The FX are cutting edge for 1982 and do not detract from contemporary viewing. But the real gem is basic storytelling; You, me, and how we relate. Worlds of possibility open with just a superbly uttered line (&#34;Ever try that test on yourself, Mr..

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L	Michael Valdivielso	Blade Runner, based on the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep? by Philip K. Dick, is a mixture of many things.  First off the novel was written by one of the genuine visionaries of our time, not just science fiction as much as a future of where mankind might be going.  Then it was turned into a movie directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) who had his own vision and ideas to add to the mix.  Then you add such greats as Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos who really made their characters shine.  Sprinkle in a future which is both amazingly bright and nightmarishly dark, and poof, you have Blade Runner.Is it about a dark future?  Is it about a realistic future?  Is it about slavery?  Is it about the dangers of DNA?  It depends on how you look at it.While my case said there were production notes these turned out just to be a few screens about the crew and not worth very much.  Also, it turned out to be one of those double sided discs, which while giving you the choice to pick either wide-screen or standard, seems to be a waste of space.

If you need a more thorough review, you can check elsewhere as there are many others.As for this boxed set, this is simply the best-ever printing of Blade Runner yet made. The primary things you get:-All prints of the movie. From the original theatrical release (with the narration), to the new ""Final Cut"", you get every major take on the movie ever released. Each print also has an introduction from Ridley Scott, where he spends a couple minutes talking about what's unique to the specific print, and what that print happened.-A ton of special features. From the original featurettes made decades ago to the new ""Dangerous Days""- a massive look at every aspect of the film that fills an entire DVD on its own, and is well worth watching if you're a deep enough fan to wade though it all.-The film (the ""Final Cut"" version) has 3 commentaries of varying natures, from Ridley Scott who talks mostly about budgets and his craft, to the special effects people who talk more about fellowship on the set and go light on technical bits. All of the commentaries are worth hearing for various reasons.On the ""Final Cut""- Love it or hate it, this is the version of the film Ridley Scott had always wanted to make but that studios never allowed him to. There is no narration, there is the more melancholoy ending instead of the happy ending from the theatrical release, and best of all a few scenes that before had some technical errors have been remastered. Unlike other recent revisits, the director hasn't added in CG dewbacks or replaced puppets with computerized monstrocities- real technical errors like overly obvious stunt doubles were corrected as they should have been.If you're a fan of this movie, this set contains everything you've ever wanted. It contains your favorite print of the film (regardless of what print that ends up being- they're all here). It contains so much behind the scenes material that they had to split it between several DVDs. There are even details down to screen tests included- this set has everything.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	When I first saw &quot;Blade Runner&quot; in 1982, I was literally blown away by the film's amazing production design, dazzling visual effects, and suprisingly human story. Quite simply, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is the best dystopian vision ever put on film, and raises questions about the true meaning of humanity.The director's cut of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; simply improves on a classic with a bit more character background and the elimination of Harrison Ford's horrid faux-noir narration. Best yet, the silly &quot;drive in the country&quot; happy ending, mandated by studio bosses, also ends up in the trash can, replaced by a much neater ending in which Decker the hunter becomes the hunted.When I heard that Harrison Ford's narration (such as it is) was being removed for the director's cut, I wondered how the film's wandering narrative would work, but after viewing the revised version, I find it just as easy to follow as the original.The visual effects also hold up extremely well 18 years later, even when compared to today's computer-generated graphics, a real testament to the skill and vision of their creators.One of the main criticisms of this film is that it portrays a dark, dank Los Angeles that could never really exist, but that's why they call it &quot;science fiction,&quot; folks. Go with it. And before you dismiss this film's vision of a future Los Angeles so easily, look at the ethnic mix in this film - a mismash of white people, Asians, Hispanics and other groups. Is that really so far removed from the real Los Angeles of today?I do wish Warner Brothers would have done more in the way of special features on this disc, but overall this film is an unqualified success, and belongs in every movie lover's collection.	5.0	Classic film, made better in the Director's Cut	2000-12-06	8	7	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1JT2YZ14HX4KO	Mike	"Finally, the version I've been waiting for and many others as well. For years Blade Runner fans have been subject to the insane number of versions of Blade Runner and even the 5 disc Blu Ray copy that really is not worth the price you pay. The Final Cut is the version to have if you truly love the Blade Runner experience and have always hated the annoying voiceover by Harrison Ford that has plagued various copies of the film. Ridley Scott himself was able to have full artistic license with this film and you will not be disappointed. What you will be greeted with is a very clean, crisp HD version of the film and just the best single copy out there without all the extra discs of fluff and crappier versions. This version has the omitted voiceover, alternate ending without the ""happy resolution"" and the inclusion of the Unicorn dream. Any other reviews that knock the film are most likely fans of the voiceover which spoon feeds you information and takes away the lonely rainy feeling you get when watching the film for the first time. Plus in my opinion without the added commentary you are able to judge the film for yourself and not be guided through every single little plot detail. The acting is spot on and perhaps my personal favorite Ford role to date. If you are going to have any science fiction film on your shelf please get this version you will not be disappointed. 5 stars on audio, visual effects, crisp colors and picture quality."	5.0	Blade Runner: The Final Cut. ~ Blu Ray Review	2011-01-25	137	123	14

It was sold out or pulled before I could purchase it, but I am happy I didn't miss out again. I recently watched this classic science fiction piece of work, well the Final Cut version... so far. My impressions are mind blowing. Every version of the film I watched prior always looks grainy (might not be the best descriptive), dark (crushing so), and a movie that simply showed its age. Not so anymore. The Final Cut is a blazing transfer. As so many well done transfers do, it looks like a new movie with deep blacks and bright pops (where appropriate). Some scene have been enhanced but nothing to get bent out of shape over. This is, as Ridley himself states, the version of the film he likes best. I agree whole heartily. Surround sound is also excellent, and I believe a new mix (probably new from the older BD release).This is a MUST OWN in anybodies collection. Don't let this movie pass you by, unless you already own it on blu-ray.	5.0	MUST OWN For Any Collectoin	2012-11-06	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A396A6KE37FAC4	MLBar	Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)This is primarily a warning to those who have seen the original studio-cut version of Blade Runner (VHS, TV, or theatrical release):  you may be disappointed by these new two-disk Final Cut or the earlier Dierector's Cut versions of Blade Runner because the running Harrison Ford narration has been removed. Despite that, these are still very good films.I believe the original studio version of Blade Runner is one of the best science fiction movies ever produced.However, it appears that the Harrison Ford background narration of the original release is still missing from the DVD versions.  I believe this could have been easily included as an alternate audio feature selection.I have read that this extra narration was added over the artistic objections of original director and now all the new basic DVD versions are being made as he had first intended.In my opinion, the original studio version was a much superior film.  The background narration lets us better identify with the secretive main character of this film and understand his strange world to an extent not possible with the natural dialog and visuals of the story.Again, I do not dis-recommend these revised versions of the film.  But those familiar with the original version may be disappointed by the missing narration -- especially as they may not realize that reviews of expensive four and five-disk sets are also lumped into this same review-stream.  These reviews indicate inclusion of otherwise unobtainable, theatrical-release Blade Runner DVDs in those sets.When I first bought the similar Director's Cut version, I felt cheated.  That film seemed to be an incomplete pre-release version of the original film that I was expecting.  I bought this Final Cut version because I was misled by comments in this review stream which I had assumed to be limited to the two-disk Final Cut version.I think the narration does add entertainment value to the film, but it may also sugar-coat the director and author's intended warning of the consequences a polluted world of wall-to-wall people and run-away genetic engineering.I do agree that the extra green-field, escapist ending of the studio version is not required to make this film work.Some people have complained that the narration seems dead and unemotional.  I think the tone of that narration was exactly in character for a man called out of retirement to do one more dangerous and dirty job -- tracking down a group of murderous, short-lived biological androids.  If Harrison Ford had no heart for adding this extra narration, then this might be a good example of the principle of method acting.MLB	3.0	Harrison Ford's Narration is still missing ...	2008-05-20	5	1	4

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"To be completely honest, I have never seen the original version of ""Blade Runner,"" with Harrison Ford's voice-overs and ""happy"" ending.  However, I was intrigued to see the directors' cut, to see if the story really needed explaining and, more importantly, if it does live up to  its reputation of a visionary cult classic.  And I am happy to say it does.  Set in Los Angeles in the year 2019, overpopulation has forced many to live on space colonies rather than on earth.  Androids called replicants were made to aid in the construction and mining projects off-world.  But a few revolt, and they are banned on earth.  Special police officers called Blade Runners are created to destroy any replicant on earth.  One Balde Runner in particular, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is at the center of the film, tracking down five rouge replicants (led by a superb Rutger Hauer) who are trying to find a way to their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkell).What makes the film so memorable, is not only the visual flair of Ridley Scott, but its shrewd discussion on the moral issues surrounding the replicants.  Taking the themes from the Philip Dick story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" one squarely in the foreground is if the replicnts have the capacity to feel emotion, are they really just machines?  Rick Deckard has a hard time with the concept, as will you, considering the impassioned search embarked on by Rutger Hauer and his comrades.  And there is Ridley Scott.  The style and and look of ""Blade Runner"" is vintage Scott, with meticulous, atmospheric direction and sleek cinematography to paint a noir Los Angeles in the near future.  Also, the production design and set decoration are impressive.  Dark, gritty and so utterly believable.When ""Blade Runner"" was originally released, it was so with a voice-over.  When you watch the director's cut, you wonder why Warner Brothers thought it was needed in the first place.  The story is quite able to tell itself, without Harrison Ford explaining it to you.  It is true that you need to pay attention to the film when you watch it, but unless its the new ""Charlies' Angels"" or someting like it, you need to pay attention to the movie to get it anyway.  And ""Blade Runner"" has enough dark visual brilliance to make you way to pay attention to it in the first place."	4.0	A Cult Classic that Lives Well Today	2003-07-08	0	0	0

I was 2 years old when the movie was released and... throughout life... i've heard about this movie but... never had the chance to watch it.While watching this movie, i tried to keep in mind that this movie was made in 82...Movie: For the most part, the movie was really good. F*&king; weird at the end... but it was pretty good. And i'm sure it was a great movie back in the days. but... i watched it with an open mind and i found that the movie was worth the buy.Video: Man, i was totally amazed by the video quality of this movie. I've always thought that some of the movies remade on blu-ray didn't look as good because it was such an old film but i was proved wrong by this movie. It's definately a 5.Audio: Holy Moly. I truly-truly, enjoyed the sound quality of this movie. I felt like my surround sound was truly being used throughout the movie and that it was being used well. The movie has alot of flying cars flying around you and you can really feel it because of the surround sound makes sure of it!Extras: I put N/A because i haven't looked into it as much and i feel like i wont have the opportunity anytime soon. All i know is that there are 4 extra disk.All in all, i'm guessing this flick was ahead of its time in 1982...  and watching it now wasn't so bad either.. and the blu-ray version is amazingly awesome.	5.0	Excellently done.	2007-12-19	6	4	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A122AZRRD6Q1M6	MN-seller	To be honest, a price tag of $60 is pretty steep for the items included. Especially if you already own the 2007 final cut on blu ray. This is because the special features included on the discs are the same; no difference. If you're like me though, and don't have Blade Runner on blu ray, this is an alright deal. It all depends on how much you want the lenticular, art/archive book and the miniature Spinner, and also how big of a die hard Blade Runner fan you are. I had some amazon gift cards, so I got this for $35. I feel that that is a fair value. I probably would not have purchased this if I had to cash out $60. I would have just sticked to the Director's Cut. Luckily that's not that case though I guess!Also, the digital copy is not an iTunes copy. As far as I'm aware, there is no way to import the digital copy into iTunes. It does say though that you can put it on your iPhone, so I don't really know how that works out. Oh, and The DVD copy is only of the final cut, not the original theatrical, international theatrical, or the director's cut.Hope this helped in some fashion...	5.0	A little light on physical content maybe	2012-10-28	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJJQM44W4DPU6	Mobi	Finally, I have the complete Bladerunner collection. The first movie I bought was the final cut on dvd a couple of years ago. Since then I allways wanted to have the original movie version on dvd, but in Belgium it was only available on vhs. Then came the announcement of the final cut and ever since I wanted to have it on Blueray Disc. After calling with several stores I knew that the 5-disc BR version would only be released via the US. Luckily for me it is zonefree so I immediately ordered it via Amazon. The good thing about this is that I payed as much for the 5-disc collection as I would pay if I bought the final cut here in Belgium. (the final cut version on blueray costs as much due to the dollar vs euro)So after a couple of weeks I finally received the 5-disc collection and I must say it is great and exceeds what I expected. Especially the 2 bonus discs are great. (1 of the discs is over 3 hours of making of!)It was great finally seeing the original movie version with the voiceover. (there are 2 movie versions on it, US and International ones) Then theres the final cut version which looks great on blueray. As another extra you get the workprint version which I haven't looked at.So this is the disc setup:disc1: final cutdisc2: movie versions (2) + director's cutdisc3: making ofdisc4: another disc of extra'sdisc5: workprintOverall a great box and well worth the money. I would recommend this Blueray box to any Bladerunner fan.Maybe one remark though: No subtitling with the 2 bonus discs, so I needed to turn up the volume for the 2 bonus discs to be able to hear everything on the bonus discs.

Unless the theatrical release has all the extras that are criminally missing from this DVD DO NOT purchase it in preference to the ditrectors cut.

It is interesting as a one-time view but after that has little relevance.  If needed rent the 5-disc set and watch it once.

Its superior premise, production design and talent would all lead one to expect a masterpiece, a worthy follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, Alien.  Even the movie poster artwork promises a dangerous, thought-provoking, and exciting dystopia film.  But Blade Runner doesn't capitalize on its many assets; it stagnates, rather than reaching its full potential.Simply put, it doesn't go anywhere.  Harrison Ford himself recognized this when he commented that the film's plot was centered around a man's relationship with his toaster.  The script doesn't climax; it travels in a straight line.  When Roy Batty delivers his excellent ""tears in rain"" monologue at the end, the effect is not what it ought to be because the story has not meant anything up to that point.  There are many excellent scenes that have beauty and meaning throughout the film.  Some of them are very successful on a primal level, such as the love scene between Harrison Ford and Sean Young.  Others are effective at evoking a specific mood, such as the nightclub scene near the middle of the picture, and the many shots of Deckard walking through the dark, nightmarish city.  The point is that a string of scenes in row can all be individually brilliant, but they are meaningless as a whole unless they have something to tie them together beyond actors, cinematography, and basic premise.  Blade Runner needs a real story, a compelling story.  And that is the one component that this film lacks.Blade Runner, however, remains an enjoyable film after multiple viewings.  Many viewers have reported hating the film the first time that they watched it, but as they watch it again and again, it begins to grow upon them until they finally begin to love it.  I, perhaps, can count myself in this category.  I was supremely disappointed after the first viewing, but after seeing the movie multiple times, I knew where the plot was going and rather than feeling disappointed, I was free to concentrate on the assets of the film: the beautiful cinematography, the production design, the music, and the overall mood that has been evoked.  In fact, Blade Runner has so many assets and so much potential that it is all the more painful that something as fundamental as the script held it back from becoming a masterpiece of the genre.  Nonetheless, Blade Runner remains an important film, and its influence in the science-fiction genre is indisputable."	3.0	BR: A great premise with a script that goes nowhere	2012-07-05	7	2	5

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1F00Y1V0ZH33Z	"Mr. C.

The contents are all securely incased in foam packaging within the case, which was a pleasant surprise.  The different versions of the movie are as good as you would expect them to be, although I am still no clearer to understanding the significance of the unicorn.  I ordered this from the UK because it was actually cheaper, at the time, than ordering the UK version of this special edition, which was basically just the DVD's.  Having said that, and to be objective, my wife doesn't understand why I wanted all of the extra bits when the DVD box set was the only important thing...but it's fun to feed your inner child periodically!	5.0	Blade Runner Collectors Edition Review	2008-02-08	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AN1F6H7BNHSNU	Mr. D. M. Stead	I've always loved Blade Runner. It's one of my favourite films and so the chance to own a perfected, high resolution version on Blu Ray was not to be missed.Being in the UK, I searched Amazon.co.uk and found that a two disc Blu Ray offering was available, but, according to the reviews, it seemed that it wasn't good value when compared with a 5 disc version available from Amazon.com in the states.I was delighted to find that the main feature was as good as I'd hoped and that the other 4 discs contained extensive background features about the concept and making of the film. There was even an interview with Philip K Dick discussing the omissions from the film with respect to his Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep novel.If you loved the film Blade Runner and though that it is a classic sci-fi based on a great novel then you MUST get this box set.If you're just looking for the latest action film then this isn't for you.	5.0	Blade Runner Blu Ray 5 disc set	2008-02-13	0	0	0

I had watched the Original Cut (1982) of the Film, I can't tell you how much times, during the 10 years before the release of the Director's Cut (1992). For me, all my friends and other Blade Runner Fans I have talked over the years, there is something missing......Deckard's wonderful narrative throughout the movie.......which we love so much!The Director's Cut is probably great for people who have never watched the film before. However, it's time that loyal fans like myself are given a chance after 25 years, to be able to watch a FULL RE-MASTERED DVD version of the Original Blade Runner film. Then we will be waiting for the release of a Blu-Ray/HD version......ha, ha.Whatever the controversy over the Original/Director's cut, it has nothing to do with Blade Runner Fans. So why are the Original Fans still waiting?It is time for whoever, to realise just how let down we feel about their decision-making and to use the New Definitive Cut as a golden opportunity to make amends.	5.0	It is Time Blade Runner Fans are given a Choice!	2007-05-20	15	6	9

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2DU35QK0QCYY7	Mr. Ian J.

It's nightmare vision of a sprewling metropolis gone crazy, with a fusion of Americana and Japanese, will infulence generations of film makers. But to see the DVD edition, after suffering years of the VHS version, is akin to being given the gift of sight after being blind from birth. From the opening sequence of the cityscape, to the closing shot of the realeased dove, this is a joy. With the classic ensoble cast, and Harrison Ford, given a sript and a character with hidden depth, this is a film that triumphs on every level. All this, then coupled with Ridley Scott's direction, now split from the hideous voiceover, makes this a MUST OWN disc. I have to say also, that a film of this quality deserves a better disc with features, and I hear that one is coming out in the new year. Lets hope that is does the film justice. Channel 4 tv, here in England did a great documentry, and as has been said in other reviews the two versions on the one disc would be great.	5.0	a vision of the future	2001-08-31	1	1	0

Then one day I find out that this film is coming to Blu Ray and after release, I order off Amazon and a week later sit down in front of my 42inch Full HD 1080P LCD TV to watch the awesome Blade Runner!!With years of people nagging at me to watch this great film, I sit ready to be blown away for what I presume will be the most epic film ever!Then the film starts, EPIC EPIC EPIC is all I see, reminding myself how old this film is, every scene is garnished in fine quality and art. My jaw still on the floor, realising that this film was made years ago yet feels that is was done last year.When the film was over, I felt something that I really did not want to feel, I was disappointed. Do not get me wrong, this film is a beautiful and will be in my honoured collection of films but it would fall under my arty category. The best way I can describe this to you would be that for such an epic feel, the story was claustrophobic. I am sure the idea was ahead of its time but let's just say. My expectation was put so high that I expected something else.My best advice for the readers is, if you're into artistic, futuristic worlds then this film is defiantly for you! 4 out 5!I gave it 3 out of 5, for personal feeling of the film. I just wish maybe I could have experienced this film when it was first released, in a time where films liken this would have blown my mind.Hope that review makes sense!

Profits over people, and intelligent lifeforms as commodities for our whims. While not always sticking to the focus of the replicants as ""emerging humans"" --not unlike children learning the mores of social interaction-- Blade Runner soars for its examination of the question, ""Once we can create life on the human level, what seperates us from them? Why do we deserve to live, given that the replicants ultimately want to understand what it is to be human?"" This film posits serious questions and morals that are more relevant today than ever, now that we are at the dawn of the age of biotechnology.""

Blade Runner works on all levels and includes some mindblowing imagery of the future. The film was even further enhanced by Scott's director's cut.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3P7ZJD1YTG4IZ	M. Smitherman	I only saw Blade Runner because it's my dad's favorite movie, and I got it for him for Father's Day.  Anyhow, we ordered pizza and sat down to watch the Director's Cut of Blade Runner.  As the movie started, I was like &quot;okay, this isn't so bad after all,&quot; but I quickly took back my optimistic thought process.  It was a depressing 2-dimensional action/sci fi flick about... well, what was it about?  I don't know if anybody's sure about it.  Another mystery.Anyway, Rachael, the replicant object of Deckard's affection, has no personality whatsoever.  I seriously wonder how he fell in love with her.  Maybe he's a replicant too... and, miraculously, that's the amazing question the movie is asking.  There is some deep meaning in this film.  Is it that Deckard is perhaps a replicant too?  Wow.  Too hard to handle, for me at any rate.Most of the film I didn't get, including the white-haired replicant guy who ran around howling with a nail through his hand.  He was extremely creepy, if not completely repulsive.  The only part in the movie that I enjoyed was the 10-second-long vision of the unicorn.  At least I think it was a vision.  It was neat, but I'm not sure how it fit into the story.  I also liked the end, because it was not really an ending at all, and because that meant the torture was over.  But I suppose this all has to do with some mind impediment that I suffer from.  After all, I'm just a moron with no taste for sci fi flicks, except of course for the coolest movie ever, Star Wars.  Well, I guess if you're like my dad, you'll enjoy Blade Runner.  And if you appreciate real plots and characters with emotions, then you won't like this movie at all.	1.0	Would have been good if I wasn't a weirdo	2001-06-24	12	1	11

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A212JJ54R560UT	mxs533@psu.edu	Everyone who misses the voice-over narration, listen up. Number one, Harrison Ford sounded bored, stiff, and uninterested in what he was describing, which is pretty curious, all things considered. Number two, it  was redundant, and reminded me of what happens in comic books, when the  superhero has a thought balloon that describes what he's doing as he's  doing it (&quot;And now I'll use my x-ray vision to reveal the location of  Lex Luthor's hidden base.&quot;) Nobody thinks (or talks) that way. The  idea that Deckard might be a replicant is, I think, hinted at strongly in  this one, more strongly than in the original. Why would Edward James Olmos'  character leave a unicorn origami except if he knew that Deckard had memory  implants that would produce a unicorn dream? He wanted to let Deckard know  what he is. How does Batty know Deckard's name? And why, near the very  beginning, does Deckard insist on ordering the usual at the sushi bar (or  whatever) and the guy is like, &quot;Who are you? What usual?&quot; My  theory is that Deckard is that replicant who got &quot;caught in an  electrified field&quot; at the Tyrell corporation. They took him,  &quot;reprogrammed&quot; him (or whatever) and turned him loose. That's why  his boss is so... creepy. &quot;I need you, Deckard. I need the old Blade  Runner magic.&quot; Does that ring true in any way? The only problem, as I  see it, with the idea that he's a replicant is why is he so physically  inferior? He can't jump far, or run very fast, he's not particularly  strong, and Pris (a &quot;pleasure model&quot;) beats the stuffing out of  him. I can't really reconcile that.	4.0	Better than the original, no doubt about it	1999-06-10	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1X910WAOVYV8M	"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum"""	Unlike the countless films which have adopted this film's look and feel, Blade Runner was crafted with more tension and more dark human nature than any other sci-fi film could even attempt.  Director Ridley Scott creates a vision of Los Angeles, circa 2020, which is one of the most original and memorable future worlds ever put to celluloid.  Unimaginable skyscrapers tower over streets that are clotted with humanity; around the skirts of the billion-dollar towers, the city at ground level looks like a third-world bazaar.  Amidst this backdrop, a quiet masterpiece unfolds casting Harrison Ford as a blade runner -- a cop assigned to track down and kill &quot;replicants,&quot; who are artificial humans, built through genetic engineering.  After an uprising on an outworld, six replicants have returned secretly to Earth, where their deaths have been ordered by the Tyrell Corporation.  Ford ends up falling in love with Racheal, played by Sean Young, in probably her best performance ever, a beautiful replicant, who just wants to live the life she believes she's been given.  Director Scott never allows too much sympathy or emotion to arise in this steel-and-microchip 21st Century Los Angeles but rather allows the viewer to make up their minds about how strong their compassion is without being led on.  The bleak rain-slick streets that Ford walks on, though seemingly far-removed from our own, are, in reality, the exact same streets that we ourselves walk on.  And the corrupt and dehumanized state of the totalitarian law isn't so far removed from our own questionable ethics and justice system.  It poses several questions: Is it a crime to want to be human?  Is it moral to play God and give and take life as we please?  These all seem to be racing through Ford's mind as the film goes on, and his icy and distant demeanor is exactly what the role calls for.  He is, in essence, the prototypical cold and disillusioned lead character, whose conscience over what he knows he must do torments him throughout the film.  While this version does seem to be somewhat overwrought with self-indulgence (as is the case in most director's cuts), and while the abscence of the original narration makes it somewhat confusing, especially to a firsttime viewer, this is still a masterpiece.  Truly a landmark of science fiction as well as modern film noir.  The movie's Los Angeles, with its permanent dark cloud of smog, its billboards hundreds of feet high, its street poverty living side by side with incredible wealth, is so prophetic it's frightening.  Without a doubt one of the best sci-fi films of the '80s, and a must-have for fans of Harrison Ford and director Ridley Scott.	4.0	A superior, yet intimate portrait of a bleak future	2001-06-18	4	3	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Ridley Scott's chilling vision of the future has become so revered and so inspiring over the years that it is a crying shame that Blade Runner can only be found on a lackluster DVD like this.  The only saving grace for the Blade Runner DVD itself is that it is Scott's original cut of the film minus the happy ending and Harrison Ford's over explanatory voice over.  Any sci-fi fan knows the impact Blade Runner made since it's release over 20 years ago, but for God's sake this film is in desperate need of a re-release.  Warner Bros. has a dubious track record for first releasing some of their best films on lackluster extra-less DVD's, and then years later re-releasing them on 2 disc mostly extra filled sets.  Just look at One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, True Romance, and Unforgiven to see what I mean.  If Blade Runner ever does get re-released (and we all know eventually it will be) it should come with a much better picture resolution (the picture on this DVD is terrible), commentaries from Scott, Ford, and Rutger Hauer, the theatrical version and the director's version of the film, full production notes, behind the scenes footage, trailers, and everything else that this film deserves.  All in all, Blade Runner is a sci-fi classic, but if you want to buy I would wait a while for it to be re-released.	5.0	A sci-fi classic on a terrible DVD	2003-10-01	5	4	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A11S26M1MUM7O7	Neil Ford	"My previous theory was that Mr Scott changed his movie because he wants to be taken seriously as an Artist, (hence the over-blown, bombastic style that made Hannibal a lesser film). I was heartened to read below that this ""director's"" cut was actually assembled by the studio, and that there may be a more developed version that retains much of the narration. As good as this cut is, THAT'S the version I'd like to see...I think people like the version without the voiceover because it's more mysterious and arty, and it disguises that fact that Blade Runner is basically a sci-fi version of a 40's detective movie. Sure, the voiceover grates a few times, but cut that out and you STILL get the police chief saying ""Talk about beauty and the beast - she's both,"" which is probably the worst line in the movie, and you still get the superfluous and awful dubbed dialogue in the snake shop.You also get one important piece of new footage: the unicorn dream. The problem with this insertion is (1) it is stuck seemingly at random into the middle of what was originally a smooth tracking shot with continuous soundtrack, and (2) the insert makes no sense in context and has nothing at all to do with the rest of the film...This scene would have been originally been excluded from the film because it doesn't fit the overall structure - sure, the added meaning makes some people feel deep, but on the other hand it invalidates what would otherwise be the main problem of the movie, which is Deckard's grappling with his feelings about killing creatures who might be ""human"". Instead it's a trick ending: ""Turns out he was a robot all along!"" which has nothing to do with the rest of the film.As you can tell, I have mixed feelings about this version, but of course it's still a great movie - it's Blade Runner, for God's sake!

Before there ever was Star Wars, there came a maverick, anachronistic director Ridley Scott who made this film. The movie received little recognition by the snobs of Hollywood, but over the past two decades the movie has far surpassed all expectations and grew into a cult status. In a way, the movie and Mr. Scott proved to be much ahead of their time.Engrossing, philosophical, metaphorical, and with endearing love theme set in a world of futuristic time, Blade Runner will pull you into a movie experience like none other.There are two versions to this movie: the theatrically released version with Harrison Ford's voice narration, and the current DVD version without the voice narration (director's cut). Although only the latter version is currently available it shouldn't be shunned, for it makes no real difference to the enjoyment of the movie. The movie is a towering, cinematic and artistic achievement by perhaps the greatest director and cinematic artist of our time, Ridley Scott.	5.0	A towering achievement of cinematic art.	2001-06-12	3	0	3

It arises very deep questions that apply to the human condition, as the struggle with our own mortality, the search for our Creator, and of the  meaning to things such as soul, memory, and morality. The visual part of  the movie is incredibly well accomplished for a film this old, and still  today most of the science fiction films pale to the aesthetical approach of  Ridley Scott in this movie. The plot and details don't fall into  exaggeration or caricature, something way too common this days, and if I  can think of a movie that portrays a credible vision of the near future  (Los Angeles, 2019), this is it. The casting is great, my favourite always  being Rachel (Sean Young). Why this actress didn't reach higher in her  career is still a mistery. Go for it if you like good science fiction  thrillers, and if you like to give a thought to the deeper questions that  any human being sooner or later has to confront.	5.0	Visually superb, deep down a masterpiece	1999-12-12	0	0	0

SKIP the director commentary-Scott likes to pat himself on the back about how great he is, and talks non-stop about Alien.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3NQI2JLNPFOF8	"nico_laos ""nico"""	Nobody likes the theatrical release, so get over it.  Ridley Scott couldn't ever get over how the studio treated this film, and 11 years later, he finally got his wish.  Every allusion to Deckard being a replicant was removed in the theatrical release, and the ridiculous voice-over narration was added to help the flow that Scott worked so hard to craft himself.  The happy ending was replaced with one of the best endings I've ever seen.  Thing is, the movie is so subtle, that most people don't ever really realize that Deckard is a replicant until someone else tells them.  Then they become obsessed with how and why they missed it.  They go back and watch it over and over looking for all the clues Ridley Scott left for them.  That's one of the things that's so brilliant about this film, it places you as the detective.The clues:1-Listen closely to Deckard's debriefing near the beginning.  He was told that six replicants hijacked the cargo ship.  Four escaped and one was killed.  The fate of number six was never explained.2-The photo from Leon's apartment that Deckard analyzes contains a blurred image of a man that is sitting in the same position that Deckard is at that very moment.  Possibly hinting that Deckard was an associate of Leon's.3-Speaking of photos, we know that replicants collect photos to confirm their existence....Deckard had an incredible amount of antique photos scattered about his apartment.4-Deckard dreams of an unicorn while slumped over his piano.  Possibly a memory....at the end of the movie, Detective Gaff leaves Deckard an origami unicorn.  How did he know of the unicorn dream?  Because he's aware of all of Deckard's implanted memories.  This also shows that not only was Gaff there as Rachel slept (he was supposed to kill her) but he reveals to Deckard that he's aware of his true nature.  And Gaff, of course, let's them both go.There are still some people that reject these clues, claiming that it's the wishful thinking of movie geeks.  But Ridley Scott himself confirmed that Deckard is a replicant.  In an interview with the BBC while promoting Blade Runner- Director's Cut, Scott explained all the details behind Deckard's true nature, and explained the studio execs that removed most of the clues did so because they couldn't follow the story.  Even though it was his biggest box office failure, Ridley Scott still considers his Director's Cut edition of Blade Runner his greatest film.  I'd have to agree.	5.0	In my opinion....the best sci-fi movie of all time.	2004-06-23	12	7	5

The visual effects broke new ground for futuristic films, name a sci-fi film since that hasn't borrowed from Blade Runner in story, appearance and style. Harrison Ford delivers a nuanced and restrained performance and is fully believable. The questions this film raises are the questions that have been asked since the dawn of time and they are handled with much respect and consideration here, far better than any film since, what makes us human? What is the essence of life and what is it's purpose? This film is visually astounding and thought provoking. Every performance in this film is perfect. The ending is mind blowing when Ford's character faces down the films central villian, an android who dreams of being human. Films rarely reach this level of greatness, but when they do it is the cinematic equivalent puppy love, it may not last long but you'll always remember it.	5.0	Best Film of All Time	2005-08-03	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is an apocalyptic postmodernist vision of the future. The story involves a bounty hunter, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is assigned to kill three replicants - android style robots that look identical to humans, but who have come to earth to seek revenge on their creator - Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Sean Young costars as Rachel, the latest model of replicant who is so incredibly life like that not even she knows that she?s not human. Also in the cast are Rutgar Hauer as Roy Batty ? the ultimate killing machine, Edward Olmos as a drugged out police detective, Gaff, and Darryl Hannah, as the psychotic replicant, Pris. Flawed in its narrative, but visually stunning, ?Blade Runner? has developed a cult following - and it is easy to see why. The production is layered with multi-references to the steady moral and social demise of our own society that stir the mind into rethinking this movie as much more than a sci-fi adventure. This version of the film is the re-edited director?s cut that audiences were never shown in 1982. The subtle tweaking of story and plot elements really doesn?t enhance one?s viewing experience so much as it just alters the story in a different direction.But what a shame about the transfer! Though the general color balancing and attention to fine details, even in the darkest scenes, is adequate, there is simply NO EXCUSE for leaving the chips, scratches and in some cases, tears in this DVD transfer. Pixelization crops up now and them, but the most disturbing part of the transfer is that it fails to pay attention to the dirt and (in some cases) hair, stuck to the film negative. The result is a dirty looking picture that, while perhaps in keeping with Ridley Scott's vision of a dank, hard universe of the future, is most definitely not what the director had in mind. Saving grace: the transfer is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions. The sonic characteristic of the 5.1 audio is rich, though dated. Strong bass and reasonably well balanced dialogue and effects, though there are a few perceived occasions where dubbing in of dialogue sounds possible. And one final insult from Warner Brothers, this disc has NO extras ? not even a theatrical trailer!	3.0	THE FUTURE IS DISMAL - SO IS THE TRANSFER!	2003-09-15	4	3	1

My husband and I have owned, and watched/rewatched, most of the releases.  The audio has always kept up with the times.  However, the film transfer quality has not.  The Laser Disc was the best transfer, but when the technology became obsolete we decided to move on.  The first (and only for many, many years) DVD release was the worst.

My biggest gripe with the DVD version is that it's not in letterbox format.  It seems like a complete blunder to me.  Anyway it's still worth checking out.	3.0	A classic sci-fi flick with one major flaw	2001-07-10	6	2	4

From the first time I saw this film, it became the frame of reference for my world view. It was really the first film that I deeply identified with it's themes, what is it to be a human? Is it the genetic heritage or is it the human virtue? The film's production values stunned me like no other film that I've ever watched. I was seduced by Vangelis' hypnotic and moody soundtrack.  It can be argued as one of the best film scores of all time.  Deckard and I, we are simpatico. Thank you Phil, Hampton, David, Michael and the rest--anyone who helped bring this vision into our consciousness--especially Ridley-you guys are my heros.  Thank you for this final cut, it is a gorgeous version. The extras in this collector's edition are full of great information on how the film came about and what it was like for those involved. This film has always left me with a thirst for more.	5.0	I Dream in Blade Runner--My Favorite Film of All Time	2007-12-31	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A6Y2KI6FUXY0F	Noxious	"*Spoiler Alert*I got this four DVD set of Blade Runner just so I could get the original 1982 version, the only version I like. The Director in the intro dismisses this version as the one ""with Harrison Ford's narration throughout the film"" and ""with the improbable ending""... But the narration fits with the 1940's detective feel of the movie, and the ending I take as a metaphor for escape from moral ambiguity. Ford's character chooses to see the replicants as human, and he shows this by loving one and leaving the old world he knew behind... And, yes, I like a happy ending..."	5.0	Blade Runner: Good Stuff	2009-06-11	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A363QRXP83K8ZE	"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155"""	You can Blade Runner yourself to death with this impressive DVD box, a suitcase-shaped case containing no less than 25 DVDs, 431 versions of the film, 97 hours of extras, and a lock of Harrison Ford's hair.Actually, this has five DVDs, numerous versions of the film, plenty of hours of extras and featurettes, and a few cool touches like a plastic model spinner toy.  (You've been waiting for that baby for years).  Bear in mind, only the 'Final Cut' of this film is 'improved' with tweaks to the effects and audio (very minor and nothing like the Lucas Star Wars fixes).But finally, we have all of the known Blade Runner cuts that obsessists are familiar with: the Theatrical Version ('82 US), the International Version, the Director's Cut, and new 'Final Cut', and most rare, the Workprint Version, by far the most different from the rest.  There's also deleted footage, a feature documentary, featurettes, and trailer and TV spots and all that good stuff.For the Blade Runner fan, and there are now legions, this is a must.  They've released the 'Final Cut' in a number of different versions (four and five disc), but this is the most obsessive, geekiest, and best of the them.  I mean, you get a model spinner and even notes in a mock folder police folder.  And you can carry the mock 'Voight Kampff' test briefcase around the house with you until Ridley Scott realizes he has some other changes to make.Highly recommended, of course, if only for the little unicorn (forget to mention that).	5.0	Blade Runner fanatics' heads explode	2008-02-03	2	1	1

The original gives  a touch of the stylistic film noir, with a traditional detective voiceover,  in an incredible, though dismal, futuristic setting: Huxley meets Orwell.  The rainy, steamy environment reminded me of city life in Japan, complete with  misty, summer fog reflecting the glow of neon.I like the voiceover similar to appreciating Martin Sheen's voiceover in Apocalypse Now.  It's like visiting a foreign country and having a guide taking you through the unfamiliar streets.The ending?  Well, let's not talk about the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it.Either version is worth seeing, but I still prefer the original.

His new assignment is to track down several replicants on a killing spree against certain Tyrell Corp. employees.  What's their motive?  Can they be stopped?  What will Decker find out when he does stop them?This is a great film with various themes.  The plot is more along the lines of your standard detective film.  The acting talents of Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh, are complemented by the great directing skills of Ridley Scott.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	One of the few science fiction films in the last 20 years to rival Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is Steven Spielberg's 2003 effort Minority Report. Guess what: they're both adaptations of stories by Phillip K Dick.I think Minority Report is in large part homage to Blade Runner (as is the Matrix, actually): the futuristic city, transport and all pervasive advertising is all there, but Spielberg (whilst making an undeniably wonderful film) hasn't mustered anything like the design, style or brooding atmosphere of Blade Runner: Scott's use of backlight (used to great effect in picking out the retinas of the replicants and - ha - Deckard) and constantly swishing spotlights, invading and infusing ones privacy through venetian blinds and grilles, holes and apretures, creates a real sense of resigned paranoia.It's hardly a case of substance over style, though: the material, being Phillip K. Dick, is first rate - Dick's interest in exploring the irony of the human condition is well tapped, to leave you with a great deal to ponder as you leave the theatre. Is Deckard a replicant, then?Performances are exemplarary throughout, particularly Sean Young and Rutger Hauer as superhumans with a real achilles heel. Even the Vangelis soundtrack, which no doubt went through a period in the early nineties of sounding horribly dated, has come back into fashion, and suits the mood of the film admirably.Classic cinema.	5.0	Still state of the art	2003-10-31	4	2	2

Pretty cool.If only Emperor Lucas would come down from his ivory tower and give us the original Star Wars movies in an HD format.The visual quality of the HD version is unbelievable.  I endured this movie on VHS.  It looked like it was filmed in fog.  It was obviously way ahead of the current technology.

While Harrison Ford's narration has its weaknesses, it clarifies the story and keeps the viewer ""tuned in."" Without it, I think the movie gets a bit confusing without repeated viewing and without the knowledge the original narration communicated.I believe the editorial review to be incorrect.  At the time of the Director's Cut release, Ridley Scott acknowledged that the original release of the movie had his approval and that he had added the narration because he felt moviegoers would not understand the movie very well.

Blade Runner is MY all time favorite.  The music is haunting and the plot.... although a bit un-nerving.... is believable.  Will we end up like the Earth portrayed in the movie?  Certainly we are heading that way with the extermination of animals in the wild.  Will there come a time when what we call &quot;robots&quot; will be as human-like as those in the movie?  Who knows.  Will the climate on earth become as rotten as seen in the movie?  Will people leave Earth to find a better life?  SO many questions were raised in this movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Blade Runner: The Final Cut is an absolute must for fans who know all to well that this cult classic gem has gone through more cuts than a unmentioned well known pop star has had plastic surgery. One might prematurely cringe, having invested in the Director's Cut, thinking that its possible that the studios are trying to milk us for more money. This is far from the case. Blade Runner looks and sounds like a state of the art film. The entire print was digitized and special effects footage was scanned in at 8000 lines per frame. The new sound production quality is quite simply an Oscar worthy effort and the images are as clean as a whistle and sharpened to a razor.The story revolves around Blade Runners, which means they are licensed to kill androids, who are given assignments to retire these illegal skin-jobs if they try to escape captivity from off-world colonies and integrate themselves in with society. Four replicants are on the loose and Blade Runner Deckard must hunt them down through a dystopian city.Ridley Scott's art direction is probably the best the big screen has ever seen which is startling considering that the film is over 25 years old. The film achieved cult status on video after being panned by the critics (many of whom have reversed their position since). The SF author Philip K. Dick died before he could see his book come to life and since then other directors such as Steven Spielberg have filmed his material.So what's new in Blade Runner: The Final Cut?(1) The first meeting between Gaff and Deckard is shorter.(2) Bryant mentions four skin jobs and not five.(3) Some extra crowd shots.(4) The unicorn dream sequence is extended.(5) The snake seller scene has been correctly synced.(6) Deckard meets a policeman before the Snake Pit.(7) Two exotic dancers.(8) Zhora's display case crash has been completely redone.(9) Swear words have been removed from the Tyrell Batty meeting.(10) The Tyrell murder sequence is uncut. You see the gouge.(11) Pris's death sequence is extended.(12) The dove at the end is released into the night sky, not daylight sky.Blade Runner usually makes the top 20 films of all time. Once you have tasted the running you will be back for more. Every collection should have this movie and the final cut is no exception.This is the way Blade Runner is meant to be seen.

IMHO probably the best performance of Harrison Ford's career.  Rutger Hauer, et  al also put in excellent performances.  No slouches to be found.  Some may find it slightly visually dated, but remember how long ago they shot this masterpiece!  One of the few films that simultaneously succeeds in being both visually stunning, yet also gritty.

Several ""replicants"" (robots) have been unleashed in L.A., and detective Ford is assigned to track down and kill them.

Absolutely outstanding.I have always been a fan of the original theatrical version and unfortunately was only released on the laserdisc format under the criterion collection prior for the North American market.The visuals are stunning. The first sequence on a blu-ray player and a 1080p television will simply take your breath away.Just one glitch: they did not remove the awful cables taking the car up when it is raining; in this digital time, it would have been easy to remove; especialy that they re-shot the scene of the snake lady being shot (you were able to make out quite easily it was a man in a 'lady suit'); they should have done this one too.But hey, that's me...

The original Blade Runner, with voiceover, creates an incredible vision of a future world in a classic Gumshoe format. The Director's cut creates a much blacker and, unfortunately, incomprehensible future where people stumble from scene to scene with little explainable detail for the viewer to pin a story to. Try watching it as if you have never seen the movie before, and then try to work out whats going on, you probably won't. It's not often that movie studios are right about artistic content, but boy did they get it right with the original Blade Runner. The Directors ending and extra scenes are better suited to the movie, it should not have had a happy ending, but the look and feel of the original have gone to be replaced by brooding silence. Unless the studio releases the original in DVD, however, this great work will be lost forever, &quot;like tears in the rain&quot;, what a waste! If you are a Rutger fan you should also watch &quot;Salute Of the Jugger&quot;, another apocalyptic Sci-Fi classic with a black story-line, the best game scenes since Rollerball and absolutely NO Director's Cut.	1.0	how to ruin a classic	2001-08-01	7	5	2

To say that I was literallyblown away by this movie (as I was by THE ROAD WARRIOR and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK) is anunderstatement! The dark presentations of our society/world in a not-so-distant future in these filmsreally hit home for me.Remember... this was the early period of the ""Reagan Years"". The ""Cold War"" was still a reality, ""1984""was just a stones throw away on the calander, the 21st Century still seemed far over the horrizon, andrespected scientists such as Carl Sagan constantly reminded us that ""it is not inconceivable that wecould destroy ourselves... in a moment of unforgivable negelect... tomorrow.""Okay... back to the movie! LOLWhy do I prefer the ""theatrical"" release over the ""Director's Cut""? My answer is simple. BLADE RUNNER, asoriginally released... just ""feels correct"". The voice-overs give the film that 1940's detective movie ""feel"".The ending is one of HOPE... for humanity, the future, doing the ""right"" thing, and yes... for LOVE.When I purchased the ""Director's Cut"" on VHS some years later (1993?), what I watched left me feelingempty, cold, and most definitely feeling like SOMETHING was ""missing""! I have watched this version twice,to make sure my first impressions were not misplaced.So SORRY...but if this is what the makers of this film originally intended us to feel...then give me the ""theatrical"" offering...ANYtime!........................................................................UPDATE: 2008I recently purchased the ""Four-Disk Collector's Edition"" of BLADERUNNER.And may I say it is simply worth EVERY penny!!!

Ford heads the cast as Rick Deckard, a futuristic cop -- the film is set in 2019 Los Angeles -- who needs to kill four errant human clones who hijack a spaceship back to Earth after escaping from exile in an off-world colony.The film opened in theaters in summer 1982, and while it grossed only $26.2 million, it quickly became a cult classic.

Heffernan	Since I only have this movie on the Criterion laser disc, I have been waiting for the International version to be released ever since DVDs first appeared. I have no interest in any other cuts, second thoughts or pandering to fashionistas. I was thrilled to read about the many digital 'fixes' to both sound and picture that were supposed to be coming in the final versions to be released on DVD. Imagine my shock and surprise after purchasing this set when I discovered that I had been ripped off by Ridley Scott, Charles de Lauzirika et al in that the International version has not been improved one iota! It is hardly better than the version on laser disc. The advertising was and is dishonest and misleading. If possible, I would have liked to buy just the one version that I first saw in 1982 and haved loved ever since but crass commercialism has obviously triumphed and I feel comprehensively ripped off.I have experienced only honesty and professionalism since I first began dealing with amazon well over fifteen years ago. I suggest that you should make it clear to potential purchaser's of this package that they will only get an improved version of Ridley Scott's current thinking which will not necessarily include an improved version of the movie they really expect and want. I have read Phillip Dick's novel and none of the filmed releases adheres to his novel in any respect so I do not want to enter into any arguments as to which version is 'correct', I just love the version I first saw even though I did try to watch the first attempt at a Director's cut and was unmoved by it.	1.0	This release is a rip-off!	2008-02-02	31	9	22

I worried unnecessarily as the theatrical, international, director's, and final cut are all included.What's the 4th disc on the super-deluxe version, then? It's the DVD of the final cut, so unless you're a slow adopter you're getting everything in the 3 disc option.

But the DVD version is actually, and inconceivably, worse than the VHS. I'm not engaging in hyperbole, I don't think, when I say that the DVD comes across as if someone snuck a handheld video camera into a local movie theater, filmed Blade Runner, and then pressed the image onto a DVD.  (I should note I'm strictly speaking of the Region 1 DVD release for North America.  But other regions may fare better.  For instance, I've heard the Region 2 transfer, for Europe, is actually quite good.  Not sure if this is indeed true, or if so, why, but you can perhaps google around for more info if you're interested.)In fact, in my opinion, it's not even worth the currently reduced Amazon price of $9.99. If you must have the movie right this minute, perhaps if you need it for a gift, I'd recommend purchasing the VHS instead. The VHS version is not anything outstanding, but it's not by any means ""bad"" either, and it's certainly better than the DVD in picture quality.Morever the DVD is essentially a bare bones, movie-only version; it does not include additional special features.Thankfully, however, Blade Runner fans are not left at an impasse. The latest, and yes, official news -- not rumor! -- is that Warner Bros. Studios will be releasing a new limited DVD edition of the 1992 Director's Cut of Blade Runner in Sept. 2006! This edition will only be offered for a few months, until the end of the year, I believe, or possibly until the beginning of next year, 2007. Then it will be followed by a theatrical release of an updated, ""ultimate"" Director's Cut of the film, which is basically everything that Ridley Scott has ever wanted to do with the film (no word on specifics, though, at least that I know), to celebrate Blade Runner's 25th anniversary. And then the biggest news is that all this will eventually be followed with a colossal multi-disc DVD edition of Blade Runner, which should include every version of Blade Runner ever released, including the latest theatrical run.HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions are also in the works, but I don't think there are any set dates for these.So, if you can wait, there's much for Blade Runner fans to look forward to! :-)"	3.0	Wait for the Blade Runner DVD release in Sept. 2006!	2006-05-27	14	11	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2ENNVJOBVSWG6	P. Broyles	"I had heard so much about this film for so many years that when I finally had an opportunity to rent it, I pounced on the opportunity.  I vaguely recall having played the computer game many years ago, but didn't remember any of the premise.  All I really knew of the film was that I have been told repeatedly that it is an important science fiction movie that set trends that continue to this day, and that as a fan of film, I ought to see it.  So I did.The film was immediately dark, which I expected, and slow, which I didn't.  Indeed, where I had simply been expecting a standard Harrison Ford action film, I found a deeply emotional film that made me think a little bit.  The subplot about whether or not Deckard is a human is wonderfully done, as it gives the viewer room to draw his own conclusions.  The scene near the end when the final replicant shows himself to be more human than all the humans in the film is tragic, and very well carried off.  And that ending...  I understand that the theatrical version had an additional ending tacked on.  That's a shame; stopping the film where they do is perfect.  I love cliffhangers, and it brings a smile to my face as the screen suddenly goes black and the credits roll.The special effects are splended, especially for the mid-eighties.  If it were made today, it couldn't be carried off too much better.  The overhead views of Los Angeles; the police cars flying through the air - it's all put together very well.  And the sets...  They're so gorgeous.  I mean, they're dirty, dark, and gritty, but the look of the city is so immersive it's hard to believe it was filmed on a studio backlot.  It's suddenly blatantly obvious where George Lucas got his idea for the seedier section of Coruscant seen in ""Attack of the Clones.""All in all, the film was better than I had hoped or dreamed.  Sometimes it seems almost poetic, which is unusual for an action movie.  It made me think.  It's chock full of symbolism.  And at the same time, it's the exciting movie it's billed as.  And so dark...  Oooh!  I love it!Why, then, did I only give it three stars?  Well, the DVD is the main culprit.  I understand that this was released on DVD in 1997, a bit before DVD really caught on, and so I was not expecting great things where menus and special features are concerned.  Indeed, both scores are practically nonexistant (they're there, but you needn't bother with them).  However, the rest of the package also leaves something to be desired.  Now, I've only seen the widescreen side of the disc, as I can't be bothered with losing half the image when it can be helped.  But the transder is not very good.  The picture is grainy and full of noise.  And the very sides of the image have some weird warping effect going on.  It looks as though the image was projected onto a screen and then videotaped to be converted into DVD format instead of transferred digitally.  And though the surround sound is very well done for two-channel, the general sound quality left something to be desired.  So the technical aspects of the disc itself prevent it from receiving a higher score.The bottom line is that this is a splendid movie that everyone should see.  Now, ever though the disc has problems, I think the film is a worthy addition to my library.  It is definitely worth buying if you don't mind putting up with the quality.  If you do, there is word that perhaps there is a special edition DVD in the works.  It could even include the theatrical version of the film in addition to the director's cut (though why you would want to see another version, I'm not sure).  But copies of this disc can be had fairly cheaply, and I for one am going to go ahead and buy it."	3.0	A Wonderful Film - A Bad DVD	2002-08-16	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2DVBXBGQWCFAF	"P. C. Cook ""movilvr"""	I read the book it's based on in the seventies and loved it. I saw the movie when it came out and my first thought; after the eye candy wore off, was that it just did not do justice to the book.The making of disc shows that the film makers didn't like the book. The final screenwriter says it's short on narrative. It's Scott's vision.It perpetuates the myth that humans come first. That isn't true in the book. In the book, being human doesn't make one a better human. In the movie the bots are just vicious killers. They should be wiped out.Having said that, it is still one of the best examples of set decoration and production values ever filmed.

I've been a fan of this movie since its initial release, and have been hoping to someday see the level of detail visible in the theatrical version-a level that standard DVD did not deliver.I just purchased a new HDTV and Blu-Ray player, and this was the first Blu-Ray movie I watched on it.The level of detail is simply astonishing.

I was drawn in to this movie like no other. People say it is a dark movie which is true, but not completely. There are scenes that show love and redemption, which stand out. The scene before the last is absolutely spectacular. If you think star wars is good you will be in for a surprise when you see blade runner which blows away star wars in depth and real human dialog. The most unique thing about this movie is that it doesn't seem the people are acting. The movie is a classic and I would recommend it to anyone.	5.0	Best Scifi movie of the century	2011-07-14	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A29GSTSR0IUYAM	Pete B	I gave up buying DVDs four years ago, and switched to renting as I got sick of all the messing about from the studios. I bought my original BladeRunner dvd back in 1999 and it is a truly terrible transfer. I viewed it once and has sat on my shelf, and continued to use my 20 year old vhs copy.I was looking forward to bluray releases in the hope the studios would get their act together. Have ordered the 5 disk collectors edition, and waiting for it to arrive. Before I get hold of the disks, I discover the special features are standard dvds, not bluray disks.It is not clear on the sleeve, or on the details on the web sites. Sure, Bluray players will play standard dvds, but all the hidef tvs are terrible at playing standard def footage.So not doubt Warner wanted to get this release out of the door, and skimped on coverting the extras; more likely just padded the release with dvds as they are cheaper to produce. I hate this messing about, only to see a year or two from now, they re-release the set with what should have been there in the first place.I really don't see any point in buying this stuff anymore, much better to rent with all the re-release of material all the time.	1.0	My FIRST Blu-Ray purchase will be my LAST	2008-06-21	25	4	21
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A14KYZ72S9LQJ6	Pete	Other reviewers have described what a wonderful production of the latest Director's cut is included with this package - I can only echo that - you have to see this movie in High Definition to really appreciate it.  For me though, the purchase is justified by the lengthy (several hours long) documentary included, which describes the history of the movie from inception to eventual commercial success.  This is an astonishing story of the last, great non-CGI special effects movie ever made, and includes generous contributions from virtually everyone involved from producers and director down to extras.  I'm no film buff, and don't normally watch such extras, but I was spellbound by the story of how this remarkable film was made (and very nearly not made!) and amazed at the wonderful little facts and stories peppered thoughout (who would have thought that the film almost starred Dustin Hoffman rather than Harrison Ford!).Also included are a wealth of other materials, including amazing offcuts and extra scenes which give an insight into the fuller story of Blade Runner.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AVZ3F3PSZSU26	Peter Gerlach	"I'm a Harrison Ford fan, and was dissapointed in and depressed by this film. The plot, doalog, and action were glacial. The ceaseless rain, 2019 LA smog, gloom, hyper-stimulation, and overcrowding were depressing; and I didnt care much whether Ford found the ""Replicants"" or not. The Hollywood formula guaranteed he would, with suitable travail. The film's special visual effects were well done for the time, and added to my depression. I wondered if the directors / produceers meant this to be a visual morality play about our current overpopulation / media overstimulation / and ecological shifts in California. If so, it didnt make much impression on our society.I wound up skipping ahead on the downloaded CD to see what happened. I will not watch this film again or buy the CD.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AV8Y3PN82ZAP5	Peter Krausche	Yup, I'm one of those dummies! I actually liked the original better. Personally, I feel the original focuses more on racial issues. Are we really capable of judging what is human and what is not? If a being comes  so close to the human original, do we have the right to retire  &quot;it&quot; if it's no longer convenient for us to have it around?  Reminds me a bit of the slave issue. The movie &quot;DARYL&quot; (remember  that one?) poses a similar question. And is most likely the reason Deckard  got so tired of his job the first time around, which leads to the logical  conclusion of the film's ending (I'm not giving this away although I can't  believe anybody hasn't seen this film yet).Because of questions such as  this, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; has always been one of my favourite  Sci-Fi's. There's a lot of food for thought here, a great movie to discuss  with friends. The atmosphere which Ridley Scott creates with this  sinisterly dark film is absolutely fascinating. Would we want to live in a  world like that? I am glad for that bit of light at the end of the  original. Maybe WB will release it some day.

His director's cut also seems to linger on the murky and maudlin, though it  is clear he feels it is the romantic and poetic.

You noticed the background and the lighting is 100% better that previous versions.  Then you'll also notice some of the colors are brighter or different.  I believe most will appreciate the visual aspect of the film.  It will blow your mind if you have a HiDef. TV.Ok the bad side is for those who have high end stereo equipment.  The audio format is just plain old regular stereo.  I wish that it was in a DTS format or at least 5.0 digital.  It would be more complete if they upgraded the sound.For those who never seen this movie, it IS a classic for you DVD collection. It's a movie that you will watch again and again. Because the more you watch it, the deeper the story get.  This is a movie that has a lot of color as far as the picture.  The story however was not intended to be a clear black and white story.  It falls into different shades of grey.  I can say I have a different opinion about the story in 1982 that I do now.	4.0	I like the DVD version but.....	2006-09-14	7	6	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2K3UTNW0783U6	Phillip Kay	I've just watched the new edition of Blade Runner and feel like saying a few words on the film. Why review a 25 year old film? For the same reason it's been reissued. It's a pretty important film.What I have to say fits under three headings.1. PlotYou know the story. Dangerous criminals are on the streets of LA and only one man can stop them. Several chase scenes and a few fights later, he does, rescuing a beautiful girl in the process. It's a basic thriller plot, used in hundreds of films for a very good reason. It works. It's got very little to do with the Philip K Dick book the script is ostensibly based on. The only thing worth saying about this aspect of the film is that it's very well done and makes for great entertainment. Think 'Total Recall'. Remember it's the plot I'm talking about here. Score 8/10.2. The SettingEverything to do with the look of the film: sets, costumes, artifacts, design, lighting and camera are incredibly well done and make this film one of the most influential ever made. Not necessarily original, but influential nevertheless. Here we get a taste of the world Dick made, where technology has developed fangs and claws and makes life difficult for the people it's supposed to help. It's a believable future and we're half fascinated, half repelled by its depiction. The detail is astonishing and the production interacts very effectively. This is why we remember the film. It's Armageddon with a cobra stare we can't turn away from.  Score 10/10.3. The ThemesThe film is loosely based on the Philip K Dick book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. Dick is a major novelist with a lot of very important things to tell us if only we could forget he was a science fiction writer and listen. Dick's world is consistently one in which machines have demonstrated they have no humanity even should they be simulacra. The book is full of astonishing concepts that the film has ditched to make room for the chase scenes and perhaps that's unavoidable. But considerable play is made in the film on the nature of the android/replicant characters. Much ink has been spilt determining who is or is not an android/replicant among the major characters. Ridley Scott has emphasised Deckard's replicant nature when he remade the film (Director's Cut). But the physical nature of these characters is relatively unimportant. Dick's theme, carried over to the film, is: what is human? In a world where a replicant can only be discovered by means of an intricate psychological test, and real humans are behaving more and more like machines, the meaning and value of 'human' becomes important to define. Humans are not automatically humane, just as replicants are not automatically automata. The film emphasises this by showing the  only characters who act with humanity to be replicants. It's not profound but it's moving. Score 9/10 (loses a point for leaving out so much of the book).The EditionThe choice is a 5 disc, 4 disc, Final Cut or Director's cut edition. If you're a fan you've already got the 5 disc edition. If you're studying film you'll buy the 5 disc edition for the workprint and the rare chance to see how the film was shaped and adapted through the production process. In my view the Final Cut, though beautiful to look at, was not worth the effort. My choice was the 4 disc edition, which contains all the fabulous extras and my preferred edition, the original theatrical release, which stays a tad closer to Dick's vision than the Director's Cut. And it's the best value for money as well.There's so much more to say but I'll just go and watch the film again.	5.0	The reality dysfunction we can remember for you	2008-04-06	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2KRW20O0I7NI8	Phil Worfel	First of all, everything you have heard about the director's cut being the better version is TRUE! The folks that view the older version as anything more than a curiosity, are the same people that hate widescreen movies because they cut off the top and bottom of the picture.Scott did the film world a favor in going back to re-cut a once flawed masterpiece. Excising the atrocious &quot;let's explain everything to the audience&quot; voice-over, and the tagged on audience pleaser ending (culled from Kubrick's unused helicopter footage from &quot;The Shining&quot;), brings the true majesty of the film to the forefront.Every frame is filled with eye candy, back when eye candy required ingenuity to be realistic, and is staged with such precision that one cannot be unimpressed with an imagination that has been copied and emulated but never surpassed.	5.0	One of the Grandest of the Genre	2003-01-23	9	3	6

Team that with some beautiful jazzy background music and I am a goner.  BLADE RUNNER has a mother lode of these mood inducers, and all of the silhouettey, shadowy sci-fi special effects a person could want.  I have also always been a sucker for 1940s pompadour hairdos especially when worn by Replicants in the Future.  This movie is a feast for the senses.  Harrison Ford and Sean Young are Young and Ford and young and beautiful--more perfection to add to the futuristic landscape.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A33XHXRTRZOQ12	"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man"""	"This was the very impressive follow-up to his ""Alien"" after a four year hiatus. The story centers around an ex-cop, Harrison Ford, in the year 2019, called back in by his ex-boss to help locate and terminate a gaggle of renegade humanoid clones, called ""replicants"" before they do any more damage. This movie was supposed to be THE sci-fi film of 1983, and almost was, but some people didn't think so, initially.You may note a pattern here of me having a lot of favorites among the films that, for some ODD reason, critics haven't been kind to, despite the fact that they were obviously exceptional. Such was the case here, too, as this movie, for a good decade after it was released, garnered only two star reviews on a scale of four or five in most of the reviews I've read, along with ""Legend"", another Scott masterpiece.What size pine cones are stuck up the kiesters of these professional couch potatoes, anyway? For art direction alone, Blade Runner should have praised heaped on it! The visuals in this movie even surpass ""Star Wars"" and nip at the heels of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for sheer jaw-dropping impressiveness. It had few equals among non-blockbusters of the period!The acting, again, as it is in MOST good sci-fi, is actually, in ways, better than it would be in a normal drama. Professional psycho-actor, Rutger Hauer, as Roy Batty, gives the performance of his life here, (before going on to ""The Hitcher"" where he REALLY gets scary!) as do Sean Young as a replicant that doesn't realize she IS one initially, Joanna Cassidy, as a replicant that was used in a murder squad and Daryl Hannah, as Rutger Hauer's last partner in crime. William Sanderson, (he of ""Newhart"" fame,) is suitably creepy and meek as a HUMAN Tyrell Corporation grunt named J. M. Sebastian, who actually helps engineer these things.Poor Joanna Cassidy, (this woman has GOT to get a better agent!) as Zora, is here as one of the first replicants to die...this started an unfortunate sequence of roles for this poor woman where it seemed like the ONLY purpose in her films was to be murdered: Next, as far as I know, came ""The Fourth Protocol"", where Pierce Brosnan sliced her to ribbons and ""The Perfect Family"", where Bruce BOXLEITNER {{strangled}} her! (That's right...good old, clean-living Captain Sherdan, Scarecrow and Tron himself!) The only major role I can think of her NOT getting killed in was Delores in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"". She better not make a Woody Allen movie!!A few semi-well known character actors are in here too, like M. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, the aforementioned Sanderson, and they round out the major cast of what had to be one of the better non-Lucas sci-fi movies of the early eighties and a classic for all time. It's obvious that, so far, one can't make a bad movie from a Philip K. Dick story, since ""Total Recall"" was also excellent, however, BOTH films are incredibly violent! ""Recall"" much more than ""Runner"". So much so, that it almost takes on a theater of the absurd quality for its excess of it.I wonder...I WONDER...which one of Dick's stories will be next!""Apocalypse Tomorrow""? ""Kaboom! Said the Tick Tock Man""?.....""The Legion of Decency, Mine Enemies!""??? (g)"	5.0	Ridley's second great one!	2003-07-15	2	1	1

I do not care that the content, the making of documentary, is in standard def, but see no reason why it still could not and should not have been put on a Blu-Ray disc.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2O6KLIFWEKL51	P. Krug	After having read some other reviews of this DVD, I'm glad at least that I'm not the only person on the planet who wishes the 1982 version of BLADE RUNNER, with the narration and origonal ending, were made available on DVD. I don't know if for every one BLADE RUNNER fan like me who feels this way there's at least a million fans who feel that the director's cut is unquestionably superior and can't imagine why anyone would perfer the origonal cut, but let me assure you, I am not suggesting we get rid of the directors cut, (I do respect the fact that there are people who like that version better,) just that they make the BLADE RUNNER DVD with the option of being able to watch either the 1982 version or director's cut. I know Ridley Scott always wanted a film with no narration and a bleak/ uncertain ending, but I'd like him to know there are those of us who liked the film just fine the way it was first released and would very much like to still be able to watch it that way.Also, regarding the changes, sometimes the narration does help clear things up a bit. Otherwise what WAS that weird language Gaff was speaking to Deckard the first time he met him? And as for the director's cut, how about that unicorn dream? What was THAT all about? (If it was supposed to mean anything, it went completly over my head.) Finally, the back of the case for the director's cut states that this new version provides evidence that Deckard just might be a replicant himself and not know it. If that really is true, I missed that completly when watching the director's cut as well. I noticed no evidence that Deckard just might be a replicant.	4.0	A classic sci/fi film, but why can't we see the 1982 vesion?	2005-04-05	10	9	1

The transfer to Blu Ray was wonderful for all the versions of the film and Edward James Olmos' character is annoying as he is really creepy. One can't help but feel sympathy for the replicants and Rutger Hauer's last scene was poignant and touching. Less reassuring was Scott's future conception of the earth as a polluted wasteland devasted by greenhouse gases.

It had an entirely different feel to the move. The voice over explained many of the things that perhaps the director thought should have been self-explanitory. I think that Harrison Ford's flat delivery of the voice-over emphasizeed the idea the he was a burned out cop. I really did not get that in the non-voiced-over version. One man's trash is another man's treasure.Although, I was not extremely interested in the other versons of the movie, I think that it is important to include them as part of the whole Blade Runner saga.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2DXLDNRW1MCF7	P. Mukherjee	"(the review below was originally written on Yahoo! movies on Apr 17th, 2005)I came to know about this movie from the track 'Love theme' (by Vangelis) that I randomly heard on an internet radio station not too long ago. It was a really great composition and made me interested in the movie. I read some reviews on imdb and almost all of them were very positive. So when I got hold of the Director's Cut DVD yesterday and started watching, my expectations were pretty high. In most of my past experiences in such cases, I hadn't been totally satisfied at the end. But surprisingly, that wasn't the case with this movie. It's amazing.. surely one of the best movies ever made. It's a sci-fi, but obviously not one of those movies that don't go beyond laser gun firing and strange looking creatures. It has a very touching human side to it, something which most movies of this genre lack. It is most definitely a cult movie and a milestone in the art of movie making.I'm particularly impressed by the direction. Ridley Scott did such an excellent job of portraying a future LA. Nothing seems far-fetched, rather I can't help but wonder about how immaculate his vision was even about twenty five years ago. The movie is dark, bleak and atmospheric. All the main characters are depicted beautifully. Their inner conflicts, vulnerability, pride, fear, love, hatred - seems like a canvas painted with human emotions. Not often do we find such depth in character development, especially in sci-fi's. It's not just a movie, it's more like a poetry in motion. Who can forget that quote of Roy before he dies: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."" And the music by Vangelis is exquisite.This is most probably my favorite movie of all time. Definitely a masterpiece, in all sense of the term.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AB1UMC7SB9D7Z	"PolarisDiB ""dibness"""	Three genres are traced back to Expressionism: film noir, science fiction, and horror.  All three are represented to some effect (well, maybe not so much horror, though a few moments are spine-tingling) to create the dirty, sulky atmosphere of 2019 Los Angeles, where the rich have gone to live on the off-world colonies and the rest of humanity bubbles and ferments in a disgusting world of industrial sludge and ever-pouring rain, a world now penetrated by four replicants (androids) escaped from the off-world colonies and who must be hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner.Such is the overview of the richly articulated and darkly felt exploration into humanity and creation, where humans have created humans and those humans are aggressors against their creators.  Man, beast, and robot are mixed and only divided by social taboos and product numbers, only that doesn't necessarily make the humans much different either considering how literally crushed they are by industry and advertising ever flashing through the streets in neon signs.The story arch follows Deckard as he is forced unwillingly into hunting down the escaped replicants and slowly finds all roles reversed, both of the hunt and of the status.  As he falls in love with the replicant Rachel, Deckard is forced to hide her from the very people he works for just as much as he's forced to pass their judgement on people whose only crime is the desire to live.  Such poetic exposition is not realized through the human characters; their actions are too mechanic and bland that they nearly seem invisible.  It's realized in the replicants, who desire, love, feel, and hurt.This is an awesome and powerful look into what it means to be human and God.  Both the stylistic elements and the craftsmanship of this film work together perfectly to create an atmosphere often attempted but never as fully realized in this distinct and important film.  It's a must for all lovers of cinema to experience at least once, and hopefully see again and again and again.--PolarisDiB	5.0	Humanity and God	2005-10-25	4	4	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AXV9GS0TMSVW	Poor Napoleon	A few years ago, George Lucas appealed to fans by reluctantly releasing the original theatrical versions of his Star Wars films.  Needless to say, they were released as bonus features to the special editions without upgraded audio and a non anamorphic transfer.  This wasn't really a set for the fans; rather, it was a cash in.So it was a pleasant surprise to see Ridley Scott introduce the old theatrical version of Blade Runner stating that it was cleaned up and remastered so the viewer could watch Blade Runner whichever way he or she preferred.  It's a pit of the fan touch that makes this collection so wonderful.There are a load of special features in this collection that make it worthwhile.  Most notably is the direct involvement of those originally behind the film - especially Ridley Scott who provides commentary on the final cut and is present throughout the Dangerous Days documentary.The Dangerous Days documentary has to be one of the most thorough accounts of any one film, tracking the film's origins through its present cult status.  There is one feature that highlights one of the film's age old questions: is Deckard a replicant.  Amusingly, Frank Darabont, director of Shawshank Redemption, is interviewed, making a case against him being a replicant.Then there are a slew of deleted scenes and promotional materials.  There's even a featurette about the posters.  How detailed can you get?  Probably the jewel in this set for fans is the work print version.  It's a curiosity piece, and while its inclusion is mandatory, it'll probably only get a couple spins on my dvd player.  The final cut is so beautiful, you really don't need any other version except maybe for nostalgia.The final extra is the package itself, a plastic briefcase, featuring a plastic shiny origami unicorn (great at parties for making your friends think THEY'RE replicants) and a replica of the car driven in the film.  There are also a nifty lenticular picture encased in glass featuring Harrison Ford and some cards detailing some of the production art.As for the film itself, after 25 years, Blade Runner doesn't show its age, celebrating a time when special effects were a true art form.  There is no CGI here.  Instead  Ridley Scott provides a visually arresting film depicting a dark, souless future.  You can spend hours detailing the metaphors found in the film as Deckard searches for replicants in a very dehumanized world, ultimately questioning his own humanity.  There are characters who have such depth that they are some of the most memorable scifi characters ever.  The somewhat manic Roy Batty, violent, poetic, and tragic, is still amazing to watch and listen to as he is so beautifully portrayed by Rutger Hauer.  The quest for humanity by all the characters is a universal theme that has inspired films both in and out of the realm of science fiction films for years and has made this film a classic.  If you are a real fan - you need to pick up this package - it's indespensible.	5.0	Perfect set - for every Blade Runner fan	2007-12-26	10	9	1

Being a fan of his music, I regard him as one-third of the central triumvirate of what drives this film (the other two being Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford). Aside from that, I can't complain about this latest incarnation of the movie. I'm not that much of a fan of sci-fi as I regard it as extremely far fetched and obtuse. As was mentioned in one of the feature DVD's in this set, science fiction was often cloaked in a cheerful, glossy setting where technology would see man through his problems. Blade Runner, on the other hand, practically indicts technology as fomenting them. There had been some like-plotted movies prior to Blade Runner's release (i.e., Soylent Green, Silent Running, etc). However, I, like the general audience of the day, was seeing science fiction through that cheerful prism, which explains its initial failure at the box office and subsequent popularity after we digested it. Take the opening titles: no grand crescendo orchestrated by John Williams against a galactic background, but the ominous drum-of-doom beat against a blacker-than-black background. In stark contrast to the background, is the date of November, 2019. When you see something like that as a teenager, you think, ""Oh my God, this is what the world is going to be like when I'm in my fifties"". Granted, the time span between 1982 and 2019 is too short for the technological innovations and the additional skyscrapers that we see in the film. I doubt we'll see these things until at least 2150. However, such chronological proximity only adds to the movie's shock value and goads the audience into thinking. The only indication that it takes place in Los Angeles is in the front credits. It's not its sun-drenched self, but a dark, rainy, mega city that's as cheerful as Detroit in winter and as garishly, phony as Las Vegas. There are no light speed transports, no cute or ugly alien life forms, no heroes, no villains, but rather a high tech extension of our industrialized society and dehumanized pop culture."	5.0	Just One Thing Missing...	2007-12-25	7	7	0

I also thought they would do a segment comparing all the different versions of this movie, but they didn't. In one segment, they showed the Millennium Falcon building they put in the cityscape, but no one mentioned it verbally, which seemed odd.It would also had been nice if they showed the deleted scenes seperately that they talked about in the featurette.

Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) it was slammed by the critics and public so much that it was yanked from theaters quickly.The film did get to the public when released on video years ago and has been going strong ever since. It is the film that would not go away. Retrospectives and internet dicussions are still giving this film endless reavaluatios and critisism.This version is excellent the transfers are very clean with no visible defects and sound is some of the best I have ever heard.If you have never seen this film I recommend it just for the visual style and wonderful noir atmosphere created for this future Earth.

I saw it three times in a single day: The first time to &quot;hear&quot; the story Deckard was telling me. The second time, to &quot;hear&quot; the  dialogues. And the third one was to savor the imagery of it. I wanted to  see it once more that day but there was no other run then. Deckard  narrating the story was what made this movie unique: it was not a mere  science fiction, it was a story someone from a (probable ?) future was  telling me, citizen of the past (his past), warning me about loosing the  faith or trusting too much in Science. There should be a place for humanity  as shown by the last replicant while in his &quot;time to die&quot;. I felt  like I was inside Deckard's heart and soul while he was narrating his  story, trying to explain why he killed and why he did not feel good  killing, but doing it. And now, Ridley Scott just &quot;killed&quot; that  aura the voiced over version had. Scott killed the soul of this movie (if  you saw Babylon 5, which uses the same &quot;narrating&quot; approach, you  will understand why B5 is so special). No matter he goes deeper in his  version (who indeed wanted him to go deeper ? Not me, for sure), he missed  completely the point. I am trying to find the voiced over version. And if  you are considering buying this: see it first, see both versions, then buy  it if you like. I doubt you would not end up wanting to buy the voiced over  version. And if Harrison Ford made it really bad for he didn't want to have  the movie voiced over, well, he should watch carefully the scene where the  last replicant is &quot;loosing his moments like tears in the rain...&quot;  :^)	1.0	Ridley Scott has just demolished what was best	2000-07-29	10	7	3

Maybe not as good as Scott's previous Alien, but still one of those film classics that you only experience maybe a dozen times in your life.

It still holds up to the test of time, but not quite as well as a few other films I can think of that are considered sci-fi classics. There was a time when I would have argued the opinion that this movie was an undeniable masterpiece, and maybe it was then, now I am still convinced it is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Maybe not quite a masterpiece, but it still get's very close to that. I think anyone who see's this movie and hates it doesn't know what good classic cinema is really all about. And it can be argued that this movie is one of the best science fiction movies ever made and the impression would be greatly resonated by millions of fans. I think the final cut is the best cut. It looked and sounded splendid, so I agree with Ridley Scott on this point. If you love sci-fi or even classic hollywood blockbusters, you'd be hard pressed to find a better and more engaging film to pass the time with. It's a great, great film!!	4.0	The old days, you know...when movies were still good?	2013-05-04	1	1	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A4RTL4PBUA1D5	Quentin Xavier	Altough upon first viewing of this film, I had been more than frustrated. I had been furious at the film's complete lack of direction and motivation for narrative. After viewing it another four times, trying to break into  the story as much as possible, I realized that trying to do so was futile.  It is not the kind of movie you need to totally understand to appreciate.  Ridley Scott has created some of the most ground-breaking and all out  arresting images in the history of film. It is so very dark, gloomy, and  colorful. Mixing the rainy weather with the bright flourescent lights give  it a unique, nightmarish touch. It has a slower, more restrained tone in  its approach, but when the movie is over, it was very effective. The movie  was advertised all wrong. The director's cut is a movie for the eyes and  for the experience. It is not an all out adventure. I don't think that  there is a bit of action until the very end, with a view jolts here or  there that are scattered throughout the movie. I think that is why I was  initially dissapointed. I was hoping to see an action movie with thrills at  every corner. This is definitly not that movie. This movie is hard for me  to reccomend, because I know alot of people out there will not appreciate  it. This movie is for sci-fi or art house fans. It is a movie that requires  extreme patience and concentration. To alot of people, it will be one giant  mystery. To others, it will be pure magic.	5.0	Beautiful	2000-06-26	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A16BZH9IALK4ZR	R A	"I'll be honest, I got this collection purely for the fact that it had the original 1984 release mixed in with it.Ridley Scott pulled a George Lucas and fiddled with the film. The ""Final Cut"" content-wise is NOT better than the ""Directors Cut."" It added nothing to the story.I do appreciate that they cleaned the film up but I wish they had done it to the original 1984 Version. Most people who are fans of this film are fans because of that cut. Scott should realize that fans have been waiting for a good version of that 1984 cut and restored it as well. The film wouldn't be what it is today without that version. I missed having the narration by by Harrison Ford. I was so very happy that I could get that version on DVD instead of having to drag out the old VHS version.I could have gotten a cheaper edition of this film to be sure but I like these specially boxed anniversary type collections. I haven't had time to watch the special features yet, so I can't review that part. All I can tell you is I like the fact that they're there.If all you want is the 1984 version, I would recommend you find one of the 4-Disc sets or maybe a used set.Hope this helps.Update January 18, 2009: I have finally watched the special features. The ""making of"" disc is a pretty in-depth look at what went into making this film. Very enjoyable. Had they had it available, i would have bought a collect that was just the original cut and the making of disc. Even so, I'm very happy with my purchase. Though Now that Blue-Ray has finally won the HD Wars, it may be one of the few DVDs I'm going to replace including Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Firefly/Serenity, Transformers, and a few others."	4.0	cool enough	2008-05-03	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2S2JD2JHXXONJ	rahul_tam@hotmail.com	To tell you the truth , i had never heard of this movie till i saw it for the first time a couple of days back(18 years after its release! ). I was gripped by the movie as soon as it started and was completely satisfied at  the time it ended. This could be one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever  seen .After seeing the movie, I have done some reading about it and i  gather that the director's cut has excluded the explanatory narrative and  the happy ending of the original and added the unicorn scene into it . Each  of these alterations seem to have been done for the good . I did not think  any explanation was required although the story is not immideately obvious  but then thats what intellegent viewing is all about . The director leaves  clues along the movie which the viewer needs to pick up .The unicorn  scene is the highlight of the movie. Only for a few seconds, the scene  holds the key to the identity of the the hero.I strongly recommend this  film to all lovers of the futuristic noir genre .	5.0	Excellent fare	2000-04-24	0	0	0

I have been talking to my 20 year-old son about it for years, as a fellow science fiction fan.  He keeps talking about the Fifth Element etc - which is but a shadow of Blade Runner in my opinion.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1MRFTBJODLRJW	Raj	I've always thought that the narrative was weak. Right from the start with the cornball dialogue between the police captain and Harrison Ford.But that's not why I've seen this movie a dozen times. I keep watching Blade Runner over and over again for the way Ridley Scott, along with others, constructed such a believable vision of a future LA, filled with people, lights, junk, and noise.For that, this is the best version of the movie I've seen. The re-mastered blu-ray looks amazing. Every scene has so much more detail. The scene in which Sean Young shows up at Harrison Ford's apartment, you can see the RCA sign blinking red out of the window behind her. And the smoke! There's smoke everywhere in this movie. Where in previous releases it obscures everything else in the frame, in this version you can see the smoke wafting around and above everything else on the screen.So, if you're not a fan of Blade Runner, you're still not going to like it. But if you are, you have to get one of the HD versions of this movie. And like other reviewers have mentioned, I'm just bummed that the other versions, especially the workprint, weren't also remastered in HD (but that's a quibble).	5.0	The story is still weak, but this is the best looking version I've ever seen	2007-12-29	3	1	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AGI5KR03HIF2R	ralfwolf	"I first saw this film on video in the mid '80s, a few years after the theatrical release and was immediately a fan.  Then in the early '90s, the Director's Cut was released.  Here is where my opinion differs with the other reviews so far.  The voice-over is a distraction and completely unnecessary.  With the voice-over this film was reduced to a Dick Tracy detective story with a very Hollywood ending.  The directors cut has a darker less certain ending with suggestions that Decker is a replicant.If the SciFi genre can be defined in a single statement, I think it would be ""an exploration of possibilities"".  Many of the SF movies put out by Hollywood are just the same old stories in an unusual setting.  Blade Runner is a dark story where much is conveyed though the setting and visual elements.  Notice that the only place that the sun shines is when Decker goes to the world of the replicants.  The Replicant world is more ""human"" than earth.  This switch in context is a common aspect many SF stories and makes you question your own frame of reference.  These elements come through much better without the voice-over because the voice-over attempts to force the viewer to associate with the human aspect of Decker.  In the original theatrical version, all hints of the possibility of Decker being a replicant is removed.  To me, this negates the core meaning of the film.The original theatrical version is a good Hollywood movie with a sugar coated ending.  The director's cut is a deeply complex film with film-nior elements.  The ending of the director's cut alone raises questions of existence and reality that the theatrical version does not."	5.0	A different view	2003-02-24	6	2	4

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3FOSBM4MMUFER	Randal J. Batty	"Some impressions.  ""Blade Runner"" was a decade or two before it's time, yet being nearly a perfect film, it remains a timeless classic.  My preference remains with the theatrical version.  The voice-over by Ford is well-written and adds another layer/dimension, as well as some much-needed explanation.  The director's cut (without the narrative) seems vacuous.  Whichever version, the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film are tedious.  How many times do we see Leon's dialog with the Tyrell rep and the shooting?  Leon was not my favorite character and his hesitant answers to the rep are not really suspenseful or entertaining.  Within a few seconds you get the idea that Leon is a dim wit, a nervous dim wit, but the scene goes on and on.  This is followed with Deckard and the precinct head detective -- again watching Leon's less than spectacularly surprising shooting.  The same scene is thrown at us again as Deckard is driving/flying around.  Once I get past the basically crappy beginning, I'm glued in.  Harrison Ford is very good in this film but is eclipsed by Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Baty (the IMDB shows the character as Roy Batty but this is incorrect -- as displayed in the novel and in the movie.  Given my last name, this was something I couldn't help but notice.)  Hauer's performance is mesmerizing.  A tremendous amount of credit also goes to Sean Young's performance as Rachel.  An amazingly beautiful woman (in my humble estimation), Ridley Scott's framing/lighting, etc., emphasize her femininity/fragility and an odd combination of near angelic innocence mixed with astute intelligence and keen perception.  Replicant or not Sean Young convincingly plays the type of woman that any man (well, almost any man, I suppose) would die for.  She's not just a ""pleasure unit."" Rachel is sophisticated, complex, sensual.  Probably, she is conceived to be an idealized woman, a kind of ""Stepford Wife"" minus the zombie attributes.  Not only is Sean Young stunning in appearance, she also has the most feminine, soft, gentle-sounding voice I've ever heard.  I could listen to her recite ""The Iliad"" (or anything else) ad infinitum and remain transfixed.  The addition of Rachel in the story is imperative.  ""She is the business.""  The selection of Sean Young to play this role was a masterstroke.  Sean Young had a few halfway decent roles after ""Blade Runner,"" but this will remain her crowning jewel.  Last news I remember of Sean Young is her going after the role of Catwoman in Tim Burton's second entree in the early Batman franchise.  I think she came to the audition in a full-on Catwoman costume of some kind.  Somehow this incident (if true) translated into Young being a wacko.  That's Hollywood for you.  Her role in David Lynch's strange interpretation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" was also right on the mark.  I think all actors are a little bit ""nutty.""  I think they have to be in order to subsume their own identity and fall into character.  I simply wish that Sean Young had been given greater opportunities.  Like so many other truly beautiful actresses, she seems to have vanished.  Unless an actress is able to ascend to the Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett level, they are evidently excreted from the biz once the bloom of youth fades.  Compare this with the longevity of male actors -- both highly talented and semi-talented."	5.0	Minority Opinion?	2011-04-19	4	1	3

Actually this was the international theatrical release, but it's close enough to what I saw originally in the theater (if it has something different in there I'm not sure what).  I have to say:  The theatrical release was SO MUCH better in my opinion than the Director's Cut.  The narration added a world of depth to the character which was just lost without it.  Also, the beautiful daylight scene at the end is haunting.  The whole mood of the movie is different.  I'd give the theatrical release 5 stars without any hesitation whatsoever.  I'd give the Director's Cut 3 at best and maybe not even that.  The director is not always right!!!I hope the theatrical version will be widely available soon.  There's a whole new generation who will miss much of the depth of this wonderful movie.	3.0	Just saw the theatrical release again...	2007-01-15	9	7	2

A Rubin	After his Alien success and it was a 1979 revelation in movie special effects, Ridley Scott turns it up another notch to show us what 2019 LA might look like. The art direction is spectacular all right. The concept, which influenced every sci-fi after: mix futuristic fantasy with retro 1930's Fascist architecture, and turn on the strobe lights and fog machine. Give the actors a bag lady wardrobe and a flying car with DeLorean gull wing doors: That's the future kids, well, sort off. The 1979 take on future communications, a phone booth with a TV screen, ha ha - no cell phones envisioned.Harrison Ford could give a Sam Spade Futurama performance back then. Today he sleepwalks through his lines. I have never seen a cocky actor disintegrate over time as Ford has declined.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A24JOL1ZRO0BNZ	Ravenlore	One of the greatest (if not the greatest) science fiction films of all time, Blade Runner is a film to behold - Still just as powerful and  visionary today as it was back then and that in itself speaks volumes about  this film. Set in 21st century Los Angeles, Blade  Runner  creates a totally convincing world of neon-lit cityscapes  peopled by strangely-clad urbanites, who seem more robot than  human, and then pits Harrison Ford against a  group of renegade  replicants (androids that are almost  indistinguishable from  humans), who have escaped from an  off-world colony. On its  initial release the film's main attraction  were the astounding  visual effects, the complex themes contained  within the  narrative alienating the vast majority who saw it. Over  the  years, however, a cult has grown around Blade Runner, where  it  seems to have satisfied a need for &quot;harder&quot;, more intellectual  science fiction in the wake of Star Wars and its seemingly  endless  hybrids. Looking back, it is clear that Scott's film  was years ahead  of its time.Culminating in a monstrous,  violent, affecting and magnificent finale, Blade Runner stands shoulder to  shoulder with the most ambiguous and visionary of films. An incredible  experience on every level, though the impact is undeniably diminished on  video, Scott's scarily prophetic tale appreciates substantially with repeat  viewing. Even for those who ordinarily shy from science fiction, this is a  must-see movie.	5.0	Science Fiction Masterpiece	2000-08-17	2	1	1

Ridley Scott says this is his favorite version of the film, and that they did a 4k transfer to digital, then transcoded to Blu Ray.  This means they transferred it at 4 times the resolution of your HD TV.  And it shows.  This may be, especially for us old timers - you know, born before Y2k - the best possible movie format:  film digitally beautified/restored and transferred to digital.  It's wonderful to behold.  One can see the graininess and warmth that film brings.  But with zero distortion and loss that comes from copying film to other media, like VHS.  It's some of the most spectacular film footage you will behold.  Watch it for this reason alone.  I really still cannot believe how utterly beautiful to behold this version is.As for the ""Final Cut"" version of the film, it's been a long time since I've seen the theatrical and director's cut versions, but this version seems really good and close to the director's cut I think.  I'm pretty sure there are some new digital FX images put into the film - and though they are technically amazing I thought they were a bit too different from the original film footage.  Not a big deal, but to me feels less organic (can one use that phrase for a sci-fi film?).Kudos to Ridley Scott and whatever powers that be that had the fortitude to make this release."	4.0	Wow.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3QML7QP8FOQVZ	R. Boyer	"Firstly the film is great and having the choice to see all 5 versions is a treat.  I like them all a lot BUT prefer the 1982 theatrical with the noirish narration.  It adds a shade of humanity to the film which makes it even more powerful.  It's a great film.BUT LETS GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY.  Deckard is human despite what Scott has to say and any name calling he childishly wants to use.  Let me run through some reasons why:The original source--Dick's novel--plays with the ambiguity of human/android and with Deckard BUT still CLEARLY Deckard is human not an android in there.  Hence a theme in the novel dehumanization of man and how close they were to the machines.  This theme would be senseless if Deckard was an android--and in the novel Deckard was human...it's just a fact.  The screenwriter is on record as saying Deckard was written as human in his script.  Harrison Ford is on record as playing Deckard as human.  Rutger Hauer in his bio says he and the other actors played it as was clearly understood on the set--that Deckard was human.  Hauer goes on to explain Scott's LATER claim of Deckard being an android by saying that's just like Scott--that he likes to mind ""F"" with people.Okay now in the film--Deckard supposedly an android to retire other androids is a wimp.  He is physically weaker by far than the androids he hunts--including the pleasure unit Pris where needs a gun to even it up.  And with the male androids the disparity is even more ridiculous.  They throw him around like a rag doll, they bust through walls, barely feel pain through great physical distress and can jump great distances between high rise buildings easily.  None of this Deckard can do and he's not even close--all this supposedly from an android made to hunt.  Give me a break.  Batty's last speech to Deckard speaks to him as a human who doesn't understand them...you can say Batty didn't know but clearly to him Deckard was a weak human--it's so clear.  Yes Scott does make it ambiguous which is what the novel does but the great preponderance of evidence on and off the screen shows Deckard is human despite the ambiguity.  Yes Scott may have had it in his mind Deckard may be an android but it's clear as it was filmed in 1982 he was NOT.  Even the later added unicorn scene is NOT definitive--just another ambiguous sign.  It could have been a dream he had before and talked about, perhaps to fellow police or a police pyschologist(he certainly had enough problems to need to go to one!).  And it could therefore be in his file and Olmos at the end could just be messing with him.  THE POINT IS--THE UNICORN SCENE IS NOT DEFINITIVE.  Just another sign of ambiguity in the film that goes with theme of the movie the dehumanization of man and the resemblance between man and machine.So after the fact, many years later(definitely not in 1982) Scott now wants to take away the ambiguity(just like Hauer saying Scott likes to mind ""F"") and flat out say Deckard is an android.  This is in opposition in how he actually filmed the movie originally, how the novel and scriptwriter wrote it, how the actors understood it and the logic of the film.  Scott now even says he had the idea of the narration in 1982(because film wasn't working originally) and that narration also is clear in showing Deckard is human with no late recognition of being an android and no unicorn shown...THIS SHOWS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SCOTT AND THE FILM IN 1982.  The theme of the ambiguity/similiarity between man and android is clear--it would not work as android against android.  The film would be weaker then(having very little humanity) and fortunately it is not weaker since the clear signs show Deckard is human."	5.0	Deckard is human, film is out of this world	2007-12-24	0	0	0

Still large corporations wield an enormous amount of power. The focus though is on the characters and what it means to have a shortened life and always live in fear of being hunted. Besides the characters the mood and bleak futuristic world are the stars.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJRFZ0VZ0LD26	"Reader ""Eugenia"""	"If you are Sci-Fi fan, this is a must see film.  Based on the story by a science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, this story is about human androids who have 4 year life span.  They are almost identical to humans except that they do not have the same emotions.  Due to defect that they have, government has arranged that they are put into permanent ""retirement"".  Hunters of these androids are known as Blade Runners.  We get to know a few of them and we get to understand their rage of being created by men, enslaved by men and forced to die too quick.  They are fine specimens, beautiful, athletic, willing to submit to the purpose they are created for with no resistance.  But they also want to live and are ready to do whatever it takes to fight for their own survival.  It is no wonder that by the end of the movie we get to like them in spite of their brutality because we get to realize that real humans would react the same way in similar circumstances.  Also, the fact that the hunter (Harrison Ford) becomes the hunted is what makes this film great."	5.0	Great Sci-Fi anniversary edition	2008-03-17	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AUDW8J8GH0IDO	"ReAgent 6 ""Mixed media: movies, music and wha..."	"Harrison Ford (Star Wars Han Solo and Indiana Jones) plays Deckard; a burnt-out detective on a mission to hunt down and eliminate a dangerous group of androids (called Replicants) in a futuristic society that's rendered in a hauntingly realistic way. I assume you've seen this movie by now, so expect spoilers to be found throughout this review. Don't say I didn't warn you.Whenever I talk to my friends about movies, the question always comes up, what's your favorite movie? -or at least what's on your top ten list? Blade Runner has held a top position for many years, along with movies like 2001, Excalibur, Alien and of course Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. I can pick many technical reasons for Blade Runner to hold the top position, from the way the special effects hold up decades later, the classic story or even the total believability of the world the characters inhabit.Creating a story is more than developing characters or building tension to a satisfying climax. Those elements are important, but we cannot overlook the importance of creating a living and breathing universe for the story to evolve in. Mad Max and its sequel The Road Warrior gave us a post-apocalyptic world that would influence countless films and honestly speaking, let many writers off the hook from the responsibility of creating any kind of world to surround their stage. You see the dessert, a few junked cars and you know what happened before the first day of the story. It's accepted that we'll all wear rags and sport Mohawk haircuts.Blade Runner did the same but in the opposite direction. Director Ridley Scott took the Phillip K Dick story and created a technically advanced society that was shiny at the top corporate level and yet dirty and depraved at the bottom. It feels like a proper translation of the 80s and it still feels right 30 years later. It's real to us because we can imagine ourselves living and operating in that world. It's real to us because we feel like if we live long enough we will live in that world.Sci-fi as a genre tends to be crippled by the weight of its gadgets, gimmicks and gizmos. Many writers rely on the tech/hardware to draw us in instead of our human flaws, emotions and inner drives. Most of these heroes did, well, nothing before the first day of filming. Blade Runner has many props- from the flying police car, zeppelin-sized flying billboards to androids that can pass themselves off as human-better than Arnuuld the Terminator. All of this nerd-candy does not take the place of good story-telling and characters that change and evolve as the story progresses.The music and soundtrack are flawless as Vangelis uses his synth-wizardry to merge the music and sound effects into a wonderful backdrop that never resorts to laser zaps to let us know we're in the future. The musical score reflects and reacts with each scene perfectly and always matches the on-screen tone.Romance works in movies when we all want the couple together by the end of the flick. Most movies simply throw them together enough and boom, you assume after all that adventuring, they just have to hook up. Cue the big kiss and roll the credits. Chemistry is easy to create when there is only one hot chick and one hero in the movie. Star Wars was faced with a crisis as fans were split between Luke and Han for Leia. Lucas chickened out and reached way too far and suddenly decided to make Luke and Leia brother and sister ->add another yuck for the kiss in Empire. When Deckard (Ford) meets Rachael, she is stunning and also way above his level of sophistication. When he sees her next, she is vulnerable and he blows it. Later, he reaches out to her and she blows him off. Boy loses girl. BUT! She comes to the rescue and now you can't imagine them NOT together. The chemistry works for me. I would want Rachael. Hell, I want Sean Young. While all of this is happening, you are not aware that their relationship is developing, no, you are too busy worrying about robots, guns and how this whole mess will get fixed.Bad guys are important too. Blade Runner uses the tried and true formula of a super-smart boss surrounded by not-so-smart henchmen. Certainly as simple as some of these extra characters are concerned, there are hints of additional history and relationships. If you note that Replicants are given false memories to create a cushion, Leon is carrying pictures of Zhora. Deckard found Zhora's snake's skin cell clue in the shower of  Leon's apartment. What does that tell you about the relationship between Leon and Zhora? And during her show, right before Deckard meets Zhora, you hear the host say ""Watch her take the pleasure from the snake."" Which explains why she's tickled when Deckard questions if she's even been asked to do anything offensive by the management. Very funny. Rutger Hauer is at his best playing the leader and supremely dangerous Roy Batty. It adds more tension when you believe the bad guy can beat the good guy. He is also given the wonderful privilege of delivering the best lines/monologue in the entire movie.Is Dekard a robot too?Ridley Scott assured Harrison Ford that he would not be playing an android since Ford thought a robot chasing a robot wouldn't be interesting to him. In subsequent versions of the movie, deleted scenes (the infamous unicorn running in the forest dream sequence) were added that left that question a mystery and open to debate.In conclusion, this is my favorite movie because it works for me on every level. It's a fine story wrapped in the fabric of Science Fiction."	5.0	Blade Runner 1982 Movie Review	2012-04-12	3	1	2

Prasuhn	Having never seen Blade Runner, and after hearing so many good things about it, I just had to see what the fuss was about. So, credit card in hand, I bought the Director's Cut DVD. I slipped it into my DVD player with  a little tingle going up and down my spine. Then I watched it, all the way  through, twice.Well, was it what i expected? Yes and no. It looked  amazing, with effects that couldn't be topped today. The look of Los  Angeles was stunning and gothic and oh so pretty. The symbolic nature of  many of the shots added to the atmosphere. The music was effective in its  oppressiveness and spare style. The acting was incrediable. But . . . . . .  . .As I said above, it was kinda pointless. I never really  connected to Deckard's character. I felt for him, but never really got  involved. The plot meanered, sometimes confusingly, from here to there, and  while it needed to do that to bring some plotpoints home, there really  wasn't any energy for the most part in it (with the exception of the times  when the replicants were killed, and the battle at the end). And, my God,  was it depressing; dark, rainy, showing the decay of society from the  opening frame to the closing shot of the elevator doors.It wasn't a  bad movie; it looked and sounded as good or better than the movies today.  But . . . kinda pointless. I know it had a message to tell about what it  means to be human, and it told that message.Anyway, 3 stars. Should be  watched at least once, but as to whether you like it, I guess that varies  from person to person.	3.0	Elaboratly Pointless Movie	2000-03-18	2	2	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1DSXGDSIFVA8I	"Reid M. Wilson ""scifi memories"""	"I always liked the general concept of Blade Runner of a policeman tracking down superhuman business creations.  The various elements of detailed realistic cityscape models, brooding pulsing electronic music, and interesting future city technology are all excellent.  There are, however, things that don't make sense.  First, the introduction describes ""robot evolution"" for the Replicants, but later on, the creator scientist is talking about cells and a ""newly-formed DNA strand""; robots don't have cells and DNA strands, and biological beings cannot put their hands in extremely-hot water and punch their arms and heads through walls and glass and be completely unaffected by such actions; while the movie presents the Replicants' rigid actions in the manner of a robot, the current promotion of the film now describes them as biological beings; the lack of meaningful definition for the Replicants' essence is an important conceptual void in the movie.  Second, after having a calm, meditative conversation with his creator about the possibility of extending life, the Replicant Batty whimsically kills his creator and another man who had helped him; this violent action makes no sense and apparently was put in the film for shock effect and to show the Replicants as a menace to society.  Third, Sean Young's character's stiffened hair and fashion appears to be that of a 1930s-1940s actress that is very incongruent with the futuristic vision of city society.In this Four-Disc Collector's Edition of Blade Runner, the Final Cut (2007) is about the same as the Director's Cut (1992), which was disappointing to me.  I liked the 1982 U.S. and International versions on Disc 3, because they have Harrison Ford's narration, which gave a meaningful spirit to the movie.  On Disc 4: Enhancement Archive, I especially liked watching the many Deleted And Alternate scenes, which add interesting depth to the movie.Blade Runner has many excellent elements, but there is no meaningful foundation for the Replicants and their amazing actions."	4.0	Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)	2010-06-28	5	0	5
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ABUWMS5VA9CC8	Reid Stapleton	Blade Runner is an absolutely mesmerizing film. This is not only my favorite sci-fi film, this is my favorite film ever. Harrison Ford gives a fantastic performance as a hardened detective in 2019 LA hired one last time to track and kill four rogue synthetic androids called replicants. I love the atmosphere, the special effects are some of the best ever and seeing that this was made in 1982 makes the effects even more astounding. The story is also great as it has great themes of what it means to be human and Deckard wondering if what he is doing is right. It sticks with you for a while and makes for great discussions. The film looks absolutely amazing on Blu Ray and has a ton of features. I haven't watched any of the other cuts other than the Final Cut, but I will eventually. I'm glad it is starting to get the respect it deserves and I don't care if people find it boring or suffering from too many versions, that's what makes the movie unique.

Warning: I'm giving something away here if you haven't seen it yet, so continue to the next paragraph if you don't want to know. Anyway, in particular, seeing Zhora running from Deckard without the obvious stunt woman wig was a great fix. That scene used to completely rip me out of my suspension of disbelief as my eyes rolled to the back of my head.I know some people like the voice-over, and I know it's quite controversial. I would just say that voice-overs, used carefully, can work. Personally, I like the additional information provided by the narrative. However, in the original version, I think it was over-used. The movie Dune, for example, seemed to be told completely inside people's heads, which ruined the film for me.Next, the behind-the-scenes documentary was fabulous. I had no idea what a challenge it was to put together one of my favorite films. For fans of the movie, this edition provides a ton of interesting information and stories. I was blown away.

So nice that Ridley Scott has had so many opportunities to undo the damage done by the moronic studio executives who mauled the theatrical edition.For those youngsters who don't remember the ""American"" version, here's the background. Hollywood execs underestimated the intelligence of American audiences (never an easy thing to do), and thought they wouldn't be able to follow the story line without help. So they superimposed a Harrison Ford voiceover, with him narrating what was happening, as if for kindergartners.Ridley, being British, was used to dealing with more sophisticated audiences. For instance, at the end, when Ford picks up the foil unicorn, he assumed viewers would understand that Edward James Olmo's character was telling him: ""I was here. I could have killed her, but I didn't. Go for some happiness, dude!""If an American director had done the movie (like Spielberg, who always appeals to the lowest common denominator, which is why he's so rich), they would have Ford say ""thank you"", to help audiences understand the significance of the origami.Blade Runner bears the distinction of being the only movie that the presence of the incomparably incompetent Sean Young didn't ruin. Scott was smart enough to see that her wooden, robotic style was perfect for an android. Too bad later directors didn't understand that ""robot"" was her only mode.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi. Not to the point where I can tell you the name of the chick's aunt who played Cordelia's third stake in Episode 4,000,258 B of Buffy, but I like the genre just the same, and some of my all-time favourite flicks (Star Wars, Alien, The Fifth Element) are true-blue Science Fiction.Imagine my disappointment, then, upon renting this Director's cut version of Blade Runner, and discovering that not only is it one of the most boring Sci-Fi movies ever made, it's also pretentious and overstated to the point where you really don't care if you never see the end.With a potentially excellent premise - the plot, on paper, is exciting and detailed) and a decent ensemble cast (with Sean Young doing what she seems to do best, playing emotionless characters), Ridley Scott and Vangelis manage to totally negate any character sympathy we might feel through over-the-top panorama shots, long, drawn-out cityscape sequences, and the most awfully Eighties-Fantastic soundtrack ever.  Cliches like the Bar sequence abound, and are we really expected to believe Daryl Hannah in her role as the grating, whiney Pris? At least Splash was mute for a part of that movie...One of the most annoying features of this film is the performance given by the usually excellent Harrison Ford. I can imagine Ridley Scott telling Ford to play the role as Indiana Jones-without-Humanity, and that's exactly how he comes across. Boring and wooden, as the central character in a movie whose basic premise is the conflict between humanity and machines, his character is the major flaw in a film full of boring, OTT cliches and unengaging dialogue.One for the Vaults, may it languish there forever more. There are far, far superior examples of Science Fiction available.	1.0	Bilge-Tripe	2004-02-04	27	0	27

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3V7X6H19H60U4	rexinia@aol.com	This film is one of the biggest sleep inducers I've seen so far. I rented it, hearing it was a sci-fi classic of some sort, and found myself constantly wondering why. I first must admit that I really loved the  visuals. The special effects and excellent photography are a delight. This  film  demostrates Scott's trademark gloomy photography and snail pace. The  film is shot almost entirely at night, and everything looks as gothic as  you can get in a 21st century setting. This is all arresting at first, but  as the movie settles down for it's overlong, confusing, feckless, and  totally BORING story, not even the visuals are able to save it. I had read  once that Ridley Scott had originally planned to direct TOTAL RECALL,  another short story by Philip K. Dick, when the screenplay was still in the  works. I felt relieved that he hadden't. It also made me wonder what Paul  Verhoven would have done with this movie. That thought leaves a lot to be  desired.	2.0	Somewhere between hypnotic and immensley boring	1999-10-21	9	2	7

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A226K48CBG9AHY	rgibbons@adelphia.net	&quot;One of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  Doesn't possess the same themes as the original novel (aka my 'Jurasic Park' theory of book adaptations) by author Philip K. Dick, 'Do Androids dream of Electronic  Sheep?' but it is great all the same.  Theme of: 'What is it that truely  makes us human?' is timeless.  Great art design and futuristic vision of  the heights and depths of what humanity is possible of achieving (space  exploration vs. the creation of a slave race).  Original version with  voice-over narration is better.  Why?  Because the character speaks with  his own voice (HELLO SHAKESPEAREIAN DEVICES--Yeah William I think it ***** that we get a glimps into Hamlet's psyche)!  I wish they would bring the  original back on video for sale because I missed buying it while it was out  in stores (stupidity on my part)!  One of Rutger Hauer's best roles in a  sci-fi movie ('The Blood of Heroes' is a great one too) as the  android-replicant 'Batty.'

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A191ZQLBJ1L3BO	Rhyl Donnelly	This is such a triumph for a science fiction film.  Such imagination that started the wave of other science fiction knock-offs.  This is the type of film that you could watch over and over again and always notice something new.  The future world that was created here is almost scary in how realistic it may be.  The grittyness, the commercialism and of course the super humans.  I did not enjoy this only because of it's visual feats but the story and acting were superb. I've always been a fan of Harrison Ford and this is propably a more physical role than for him than Indiana Jones was.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1781J6FHG6YED	"Richard A Schauer ""Jack Shadow"""	If you enjoy science fiction or film noir or both and are contemplting buying this film you have probably already seen it. If you haven't: It is a Phillip K. Dick story about androids doing the risky or unwanted jobs in society and what to do with them when their job is done. The answer is to use a type of cop called a Blade Runner to destroy them. Harrison Ford, in a nice but somewhat misunderstood role, is the Blade Runner.I have three versions of this film on laser disc. The first is the theatrical version, the second was an extended version with about twenty minutes added, and the third is the shorter directors cut. This DVD version is the director's cut.The directors cut is a tightened version with the voice over and the extended ending removed; the theatrical and the extended version are the versions with voice over by Harrison Ford and with the added ending that some call happy. It is the voice over and the so called happy ending that some find objectionable. My favorite of the three is the extended version with the voice over. The happy ending I did not see as especially happy and could take or leave. But all versions a superior science fiction and all are worth your time. A boxed set of all versions would have been nice and perhaps some day we will see that boxed set available. In the meantime enjoy Ridley Scott's favorite cut and maybe someday pick up the voice over version. And forget the fantasy about Harrison Ford purposely doing a bad job on the voice over; no actor is going to do a crappy job on purpose any more than an auto mechanic is going to do a crappy job on your car because he doesn't like the brand.	5.0	3 versions	2004-04-13	10	9	1

The dripping rain which accompanied most of the outside scenes made my skin crawl!  The scenes which parody earlier Dashiel Hammett / Raymond Chandler classics (like ""Murder, My Sweet"" and ""The Lady in the Lake"") remain some of my favorite film memories.  All of those movies had a voice over, and perhaps younger viewers would not realize the significance of the voice over in this film.  To my way of thinking, it is essential to the look and feel of the film, and the mood it created for me.  The gadgets and gizmos are almost standard Sci-fi fare for Ridley, but the feel of this movie is unique in that regard.I looked forward to the Director's cut to answer two questions --which remain unanswered.1. Does the ""heroine:"" have an expire date?2. Is the bladerunner a replicant and does HE have an expire date?The director's cut, altho it changes the ending, does nothing to answer these questions.  It does eliminate the voice-over, which was one of my fondest aspects of the film.

Yet,I'm a fan of this film, and after 25 years, expected a lot more. It looks to me as if the ""money men"" still have their say as to what the public is willing to digest when it comes to studio releases. Either that or Ridley has lost his vision after so many years.What I am referencing here is what was undoubtedly left on the cutting room floor. It's a fact that Ridley battled the bean counters many times during the course of production. So where in this ""definitive set"" are the scenes which were scrapped?? They're still on the cutting room floor (as far as I can tell).Camerons ""The Abyss"" added nearly 40 minutes in it's directors cut and made a huge difference.Even ""Aliens"" had quite a few minutes added which made that version much more plausible.Lynchs' ""Dune"" left hours on the cutting room floor which might have made that story what it should have been.I guess the bean counters decided our attention spans were just too short to do this film the justice it deserved, and Ridley went along with the ride."	4.0	Where's the film Ridley was TRYING to make????????	2007-12-29	5	1	4

I am that much of a Blade Runner fan and watch it at least yearly since it came out. The price was fair enouugh and the shipping was fast. Both HD-DVD and Blu-Ray look better than the director's cut although that looks very good with a good up-rezzing chip. The scenes portray the bleak raining Los Angeles but now the eye candy is crisp and more attractive. The basic story is 5 stars even if you are watching on VCR so the Blu-Ray is just icing on the cake. Get Blade Runner and watch it on your device. If you can wacth it at 1080p, that's great but it is a great flick regardless of whether it's on Blu-Ray HD-DVD or regular 480i DVD. The alternative versions give more hints as to whether Deckard is a replicant but it leaves it vague enough so that the viewer must still make that decision and that contributed to the mystique. Plus Harrison Ford (aka Hans Solo and Indiana Jones) is just perfect as the Blade Runner.	5.0	Sci-Fi classic 10 stars	2009-04-12	1	1	0

I would give this DVD a zero star if I could.  The soul of the movie is gone.  I'm a believer that androids with this level of ability have as much right to live as humans.  The fact that we think they are our slaves and property with no rights is outragous.  Equal rights for machines are coming in the near future and a man-machine war for equal rights is ahead (see Terminator I/II).

I am a fan of Ridley Scott's,and definitely am in favor of a the director being the sole source of what the final cut of a feature should be. But,that being said,I am vehemently in disagreement with Ridley Scott's vision of what this movie &quot;should have been&quot;. When I saw the original release of Bladerunner,I felt that the voiceover narration was needed and added much clarity to the film. I saw Harrison Ford's character as a &quot;Mickey Spillane&quot; type of detective,what with his tough,grizzled,and unshavened look. The narration reminded me of the old,50's movies like &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, and &quot;The Big Easy&quot;. It created a film noirish feel to the film that set it apart from other science fiction films. And,regarding the &quot;happy ending&quot;,...so what?!I feel it was necessary to provide some type of closure to the story.Sorry,Mr.Scott,but you blew it this time! You should have left it as it was. Now, I can't even find the original theatrical release of Bladerunner-on VHS or DVD!It's as if it has been totally replaced by the director's cut.	1.0	Leave it like it was!	2002-03-22	8	6	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A35W02MUVYH1RF	Richard Schulman	I initially saw this movie when it came out. I was transfixed. Visually LA had been transformed into a scifi  future of new gas filled streets, flying cars, and the disturbing unknown. The future was here and I had been lucky, well sort of, to be immersed into the future. The movie had me almost hyperventilating. Over the years I have watched Blade Runner numerous times. Though all acted superbly, and the visuals and the special affects were superb it was Rutger Hauer's role as Roy Batty that made the film catch fire. There is plenty of symbolic characters to go around but it is clear that Hauer's character is the new Christ figure. Besides putting the nail in his hand and being called savior, he saves Deckart, (Harrison Fords) Judas character. The importance of the new philosophy is in Hauer's killing the creator. There is a mistake in the cosmos you die. Everyone dies.	5.0	Time To Die	2011-11-21	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1W1Q6806OG8L0	Richard Squires	Back in the day when DVD was in it's infancy one of the very first films I purchased was Blade Runner. I told myself that I would not buy it again till a High Definition version appeared. And here it is in all it's 5 disc glory.  Anybody who has a remote interest in film can't help but have this movie in their collection. It really is a true classic that helped define a genre, and is the bench mark to which many films seem to aspire. It's art direction characters and story are second to none and yet for a time it seemed we would never see the film that Ridley Scott intended. The production was fraught from the outset with script changes, the production losing its backers and studio meddling that led to a compromised film being shown in cinemas the first time round. Time however and hind sight has seen fit to bless Blade Runner and it's visionary director with cult status and we now have the final cut of the film approved by Ridley Scott himself.Apart from the Final Cut of the movie this box set features all versions of the film that you could possibly want including the fabled and rarely seen Workprint. So for completists this box set is a must. I found the documentary Dangerous Days fascinating and it's a real eye opener to see how far ahead of it's time this film was. Indeed when you look at the budget this film had and what went on screen it's hard to see how todays movies cost the millions they do.It goes without saying that the picture and audio quality of this movie are reference. When you have seen this movie on free to air ,dvd or even vhs it's like your getting a mere glimpse of the beauty this film has to offer. And if ever there was a movie that was worth the revisionist treatment then this one is it. Some people bemoan the fact that directors are now going back and digitally altering their movies and I have my reservations. Here the alterations are for the most part subtle and are there to enhance the quality of the presentation, to bring it up to date, and to fix stuff that just wasn't able to be fixed at the time it was made. But who cares with this 5 disc set you can have whichever movie you prefer. Who knows you might get to like a different version.They just don't make them like this anymore, so you owe it to yourself to go get it.	5.0	The Blade Runner you have been waiting for	2008-08-30	2	2	0

I like getting into Deckard's mind, and the original version does just that.This is classic Science-Fiction meets Cop and Baddies.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3BJDFGSLXFB36	R. Legendre	"I'm not going to rate the movie itself. I have already done that months ago. The five stars that I am giving are for the sheer presentation and production value of this collector's set.Since the director's cut in 1992, there has been a bone of contention among fans of the film, and that was; which version is better? The one with the voiceover or the one without?It doesn't matter because you get to choose which version you want to watch, PLUS one version that no one has ever seen before (the Final Cut) and one version that has not been seen by most (the workprint). You also get the 1992 director's cut, the original 1982 US theatrical release, and the 1982 international release. Five, count 'em, FIVE versions of the film to please everyone's tastes. You want voiceover and a happy ending? You got it. You want no voiceover and a gloomy ending? You got it. You want Deckard's unicorn dream sequence or do you prefer a half-drunk Deckard plinking away on the piano and staring at old family photos? Either way, you got it. NOW, STOP COMPLAINING!!!!!!!!!!There are also numerous documentaries and behind-the-scenes featurettes from the past as well as some recorded for this new DVD edition. They are all VERY insightful and give you a whole new appreciation for what everyone went through to make Blade Runner a reality. How everyone managed NOT to kill one another during the film's production is beyond me. There are also a few really nice deleted scenes that give a bit more depth to the world that Ridley Scott had created.With that out of the way, this masterpiece of sci-fi celluloid has finally been given a proper home video treatment after 25 years. Let's start with the case.VERY nice. It's made of sturdy plastic, but painted to look like it's made of brushed aluminum. It resembles Deckard's Voight-Kampf case, but a slightly smaller version. The Blade Runner title logo and Harrison Ford's name is printed with raised lettering on the top cover.When the case is opened, the first thing you seem to notice is the shiny origami unicorn replica (also made of plastic) and the spinner replica. Both are very detailed, not some cheap piece of junk that I was originally expecting. The ""toys"" are packed inside form-fitting foam (say THAT fast 3 times!) next to the DVD box which contains 5 discs. The DVD box itself is very nicely done with conceptual art and screen shots from the film on the inside covers. Each disc has different screenshots from the movie on them as well and are nicely presented.On the inside top cover is a dossier-like folder containing conceptual art by Syd Mead on one side, and an actual screenshot of the corresponding artwork brought to life in the film itself on the other. There is also a ""holographic motion art"" mini-plaque that shows Deckard drawing his blaster just before entering his apartment to find a sleeping Rachael.There is a clear piece of plastic that separates the top cover from the bottom, and a letter from Ridley Scott is printed on it telling you a little bit about what the set contains.This product deserves 5 stars just for it's production value alone. A lot of thought, consideration, and love went into this limited edition DVD set. THIS is what Blade Runner fans (like me) have been waiting for for a LONG time!If you are just a casual fan of Blade Runner, or if you've never seen it and would like to, there is a less-expensive version of this release out there that does not have the case or any of the ""toys"" or conceptual art. It is just a bare-bones case containing the same 5 discs you get with this limited edition set. There is also a version that has only the ""Final Cut"" and the ""Dangerous Days"" documentary dics that is even less expensive than that.Again, there is something for everyone and something within everyone's price range to celebrate the 25th anniversary of such a landmark film."	5.0	Something for everyone	2007-12-20	11	11	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3T0I6KH0K5RSU	"R. Lines ""Alucard"""	Blade Runner is a five star movie.  So why have I given this box-set only 4 stars?  I won't go on about the merits of Ridley Scott's landmark movie as it's a classic, pure and simple.  Instead this review is based purely on the Blu-Ray presentation.Now I had this set (the tin box version) on Standard DVD at Christmas and fell in love with it.  Everything about it was breathtaking.  From the box design right through to the actual content on the 5 discs.However when we come to this Blu-Ray release there are problems.Firstly the Final Cut has a fair amount of noise throughout the film.  The most apparent artifacting is seen early on during the scene when Deckard is interviewing Rachel: Tyrell's head completely breaks up into tiny white pixels!!!!!!!  Considering Warner's spent a fortune on a 4K digital clean up this is unacceptable.Next Disc 3 (the other 3 versions Blade Runner) - Apart from the brilliant and seamless branching, this has even more noise, especially on the FX shots which now look horrid.Disc 5: The Workprint - by far the worst picture quality you will ever see on a Blu-Ray release.  Imagine a filthy battered old VHS tape dragged though a desert dipped in oil and then transferred to a HD disc, that will give you some idea as to what you'll be looking at.  You've been warned.Finally Disc's 2 & 4.  The only problem I have with these special features is that they are presented in Standard DVD.  This is a big issue I have.  If a studio isn't prepared to upscale special features to HD then forget it, I'd rather stick with the normal DVD release, it's far cheaper too.  Sure the content on these two discs are amazing, superb deleted scenes, featurette's and the best documentary you will ever see.So a disappointing release on the new format.My advice is to stick with the Standard DVD set as this is a real mixed bag and any problem with the prints are only highlighted on HD.	4.0	BLADE RUNNER BLU-RAY BLUES	2008-03-01	2	0	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AR161O5QUAGAR	Robert Ajemian	The DVD version of this film is definitely worth seeing; details and images which were not discernable in the videotape version are clear as a bell here. The sound is also very clear and projects well, even on a purely stereo system. My only caveat is that the original version has not been made available; I may be swimming upstream on this one, but I enjoy the narration. First, the fact that it's a bit corny just places the film squarely in the film noire tradition, where the private detective hero frequently provides a cliche-laden voiceover. Second, it adds to our understanding of the character. Ridley Scott's contention at the time the director's cut was released that the voiceover didn't add anything to the film is simply not true and must be attributed to pre-release hype; without the voiceover, for example, we wouldn't know that Deckerd had a failed marriage in his past caused by his emotional coldness (he was as cold as sushi), which adds to our understanding of the emotional toll caused from his job as a Bladerunner. However, the director's cut does restore the original, haunting ending and provides a useful service by deleting the tacked-on and awkward sunny ending added to the film originally. All in all, a great release and a classic film.	4.0	A True Classic, But Is the Director's Cut Worth It?	2002-06-02	14	14	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	Blade Runner(released June/82-has it been that long?)has been re-released onto DVD and this time around Ridley Scott himself has supervised the remastering,tweaking several scenes and boosting the background sound/music.The movie has never looked as good as this....ever.This release's major drawback however is the removal of Ford's background narration throughout,which certainly detracts from Scott's original vision but,like Spielberg,Lucas,et al,they can and do do what they want with their product.I must admit that even with the loss of the voice track,this version IS quite compelling and makes for an excellent comparison between the original cut and this one.The story is well known by now.It is 2019 and Deckard(Harrison Ford)is a cop dedicated to the elimination of Replicants.These androids,built by the Tyrell Corporation,are on an equal par in many respects with humans and as a result have been banned to the outer worlds as workers.However a group of Replicants rebelled and some made their way back to Earth and into Deckards path.One by one Deckard hunts them down.Deckard even meets with the great Tyrell himself and falls in love with one of his personal Replicants who doesn't know she is one until Deckard reveals the truth to her(Sean Young).The rogue Replicants are paired down eventually to two(played by Darryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer) who visit one of Tyrell's valuable assistants,who in turn persuade him to take them to the inventor.The inventor projects a kind of a cautious fatherly attitude towards his inventions,whose main objective is to find out how long they have to live(they have a built in safeguard life span of about four years into them)and to stop the process.It seems there isn't a way to reverse the dying process in the Replicants and Tyrell is summarily killed.Two Replicants are whittled to one and Deckard tracks him down,but it becomes a chase to live for Deckard,as he becomes the prey instead of the hunter.The Replicant at times plays with Deckard knowing his own inevitable end is near and before he can make the coup de gras he indeed dies.Deckard returns to his apartment where he and Tyrells Replicant leave the city forever.This film moves along very well,telling its story in measured increments,never losing ground at any time.The entire look of the city from the flying cars to the giant advertising boards to the rainy and grungy streets have been more than a huge influence to countless films and filmmakers since its release.Scott was on a definite hot streak at this time as his Alien film was and has been a terribly big influence also.The acting from everyone involved is fantastic and was a break through film for many of its participants.Technically the film looks absolutely gorgeous and it is in its widescreen a/r.Other than extensive commentaries by Scott and several production crew members,that is all the extras there is.All in all a highly recommended release.If the  Deckard commentary had have been there I would have given this film a BIG five stars all the way.However despite its' deletion,the film is still excellent in this form,and through Scott's tweaking,it has come through as a close second to the original.	4.0	Completely remastered and tweaked by Scott himself!	2011-07-13	0	0	0

It would be nice if they'd just put out the disks without the other stuff.  (2) The only way to get any of the older versions is in either the 4-disk or 5-disk sets.

Like many other reviewers I actually prefer the version with the voice over as well.  I makes Deckard just a tad more believable as a guy who is just a little fed up with the status quo.  The narration really communicates Deckard's attitude.  The ""Final Cut"" version has a much terser finish and gives up the happy ending of the original release.  Both are pretty good but gives the viewer two completely different feelings at the end of the movie.Blade Runner was the first movie Ridely Scott released after the super successful Alien in 1979.  In fact, fans of Alien will recognize some of the same sound effects in Blade Runner.  Anyway, I think one of the reasons Scott compromised with the studios on the final cut for the 1982 release was that he wanted another hit.  Instead, Blade Runner really was a bit of a flop at the box office.  Whether ""the Final Cut"" would have been more successful from a financial perspective in 1982 is purely speculation.  Of course, we see it now for the profoundly insightful movie that it really is.This four disc version of Blade Runner has it all.  I"	5.0	This is the version to get....	2008-01-07	2	1	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A255E1L105V4MU	Robert Carlberg	"""Blade Runner"" immediately stood out as a movie with incredible depth -- you BELIEVED in the world Ridley Scott created, it made sense, and it all fit together.  The 2nd disc of this set contains a long documentary (actually several of them) which show how this world was constructed, what went into it, who contributed what and how it all came together to create something that was somehow more than the sum of its parts.This ""making of"" disc is far-and-away the best such documentary I've ever seen.  It has, of course, contemporary interviews from almost everybody involved with the production (actors, director, production designers, visual effects artists, gaffers on down to the financiers) but also scads and scads of footage to illustrate the points being made -- and almost ALL of this footage never made it to the movie!  It's like a whole 2nd Blade Runner movie, looking at the Blade Runner universe from new angles inside the Blade Runner universe.  Sheer bliss for the fan.Among the interviewees is Paul Sammon, who wrote the great, great book on the ""making of.""  Nice to see attention paid to someone who, while not a part of the production crew per se, was very much a part of the machinery which advanced the legend of ""Blade Runner.""All these years later -- my goodness, 25 now? -- the pain of making the movie, under very difficult conditions with a very demanding director and incredible forces vying with each other for control, all these years later everybody involved has learned to be gracious.  Even Sean Young and Harrison Ford speak affectionately of each other.  It must be true that in the end the work stands on its own, and those who had a hand in it can finally see that what they created is, indeed, more than the sum of its parts."	5.0	Great Dissection of a Great Movie	2007-12-28	5	4	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3E4EZF2GAK0K4	Robert Dalton	I was blown away by Bladerunner when it was in theaters and when it came out on video it was one of my first ever purchases of a videotape.  Naturally, that tape was the original version with the voiceover and happy  ending and without the unicorn sequence.  Somehow that copy disappeared and  I replaced it with the Directors Cut. I thought of the original as a  five-star movie and I have to remove one for this version.  I think the  voiceover is a neutral factor, the uncertainty of the revised ending is  slightly superior, but the unicorn sequence is a jarring disturbance.  I  had heard and read about the dream sequence for years before I saw it and I  have to admit that if I had not been told that it was supposed to raise the  question of Decker's  humanity, it would have totally perplexed me.  I am a  reasonably intelligent person with a college degree and I just do not see  how a fleeting glimpse of a unicorn suggests that Decker is a Replicant.  Left on my own, I would have interpreted it to mean he wanted out of his  &quot;real&quot; world and wondered why he had not gone offworld.  Not only  does the unicorn sequence seem out of place and unclear, it was  unnecessary.  All these years later, I can still remember debating the  possiblity that Decker was not human with friends on the trip home from the  theater  based only on what we saw in the original version.  Ridley Scott  should have quit tinkering while he was ahead.  However, buy this version  if you do not have the original because it is still superior to the vast  majority of what is labeled science fiction.  Oh, by the way, buy the  soundtrack too - it has some of Vangelis' most moving work.	4.0	This version is worthwhile but not superior to original.	1999-10-16	5	4	1

No surprise, it was totally changed from the original version except that a few of the names were the same as in the book.  In the book, the setting was San Francisco, movie - Los Angeles. What I found to be most confusing is that it rained continuously, the characters dressed in 1940 styles and the buildings were hideous, over sized Mayan style structures which gave the set design anything but a futuristic appearance.There was no reference to Androids, Mercer, electric sheep, Isodore & the Specials or any of the other significant characters from the book. The movie put great emphasis on a set design that did not match the story line, shallow character development and a style that is a replica of the 1940's Sam Spade movies.If I had seen the movie first, I would not have bothered reading the book.  As usual, the story, characters and scenes created by a great author like Philip K. Dick far exceeds the interpretation in a movie. I was not surprised but I certainly was disappointed. I can understand why some other reviewers rated it as a great movie because of the usual mix of sex & violence portrayed in an impressive cinematic production. As far as a movie is concerned, I could have rated it higher but regarding the adherence to the original story, I probably rated it too high with a 3-star rating."	3.0	'Loosely' based on novel	2013-10-26	1	0	1

Life, love and class struggle are  all set in motion against a tremendously cruel world that has been created  out of corporate greed and necessity.  The father of the replicants does  receive justice which is usually not the case.  Daunting in its execution  this movie should be cherished by sci-fi fans as well as film noir buffs.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	BLADE RUNNER is one of the truly great Sci-fi films ever made.  Seeing it again over twenty years after it first appeared, it seems as fresh and as vital as ever.  Despite having been made before the predominance of CGI special effects, it feels convincing in a way that today's Sci-fi films frequently do not.There are several reasons this film works so magnificently.  First, there is the extraordinary set design, among the greatest in cinema history.  For me personally, the set design on this film is as exciting and as visionary as that for Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS.  It is one of the few films ever made in which the set design is as important as any other element in the film.  Second, there is the great central theme of what it means to be human.  In the novel that was the basis for this film, Philip K. Dick's great DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?, there is great doubt that the main character is human.  This is muted in the film, but the question of whether Harrison Ford is also a replicant is very much in doubt (Dick in interviews just before his death claimed that he was a replicant).  Third, the cast is truly great.  Harrison Ford is tremendous as Deckard in one of the best roles of his career.  He evokes the perfect balance of world weariness, existential self-doubt, dedication to his job, and love for someone who may or may not be as human as he is (or is not).  Sean Young, who suffered a premature end to her career through self-implosion a few years later, is remarkably compelling as the near perfect replicant who isn't aware that she is. Edward James Olmos plays a small but crucial role as Gaff, the cop who occupies his time with origami (which leads to one of the great moments in the film).  And a host of other actors and actresses perfectly round out the cast.  But the actor who nearly steals the entire picture is Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the charismatic leader of the replicants.This was one of the first, if not the first, film to come out in a Director's Cut.  Not all films benefit from such handling, but this one does.  The endings, depending upon which version one sees, are quite different.  Few films demand a DVD format as much as this, with the degree of visual detail it requires, as well as the widescreen.	5.0	Remains one of the great Sci-fi films of all time	2003-03-07	6	4	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1BRXLFWILNICE	Robin McDonald	Its a mixed blessing to have this title.  Its better than not having the movie out at all on DVD.  However this Bladerunner DVD version is in much need of an overhaul.  I am sure it is one of the first DVDs ever released.  So I do not fault it greatly for not having any extras...but they would be nice.  And as I am a big fan of the directors cut, I don't miss the original narrated version...but having both versions on a newer DVD would be nice for the fans. The really important reason for a new version of the DVD is the print and video mixing are just barely tolerable.  The contrast is blown out making the city effects sequences in particular look ugly harsh and grainy. That's really a shame as this film is all about creating an awe inspiring vision of a bleak future Los Angeles. And secondly, the widescreen version has a very thick black border surrounding the entire image cutting down on the already reduced size of the image making it all the smaller for people wanting to watch the film in widescreen.  No doubt this smaller territory for the image causes the film to look less sharp, and more grainy. If you buy DVDs for the enhanced picture quality. Don't look for this DVD to deliver for you.  Whether you love it or think it is slow and boring, Bladerunner is considered a classic in its genre and merits a better treatment.  Unfortunately, I am sure the studios are making money on this staple title, so I think a revised version is a long time coming.	4.0	Just about the DVD itself	2001-06-10	10	9	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	"Is Deckard a replicant?  Ridley Scott at the helm again, this time directing from a screenplay inspired by a Philip K. Dick story that asks: ""What does it mean to be alive?""  This extraordinarily prescient film did poor business and did not connect with an audience when it was first released.  Now it has a huge fan base who recognize it as the visionary and philosophical masterpiece it is.  The 5-disc Collector's Edition showcases Scott's sublime final cut along with various earlier versions (it went through various mutations) including a rarely seen preview print.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AVMAHVWDGNOKK	Rock~N~Rolla	"In the future, scientists create ""Replicants"", genetically engineered biological slaves pretty much, that are described as being ""More human than human"" (Remember that cool Rob Zombie song from Astro Creep 2000 titled ""More Human Than Human""? A great song that was heavily inspired by this movie.). That is the main premise of the movie ""Blade Runner"". Replicants are used to fight wars, do offworld mining, and all kinds of other mundane, dirty and dangerous jobs that most people wish not to do. The Tyrell Corporation is one of the biggest manufacturers of Replicants on the planet.Well it seems that a group of 4 Replicants no longer wish to be slaves to humans, and especially do not like the 4 year lifespan that they have been genetically programmed with in order to keep them from becoming too smart and emotionally experienced. After all, how else could you control an advanced genetically engineered slave and keep them in line with your directives if not to limit their ways and means of knowledge and experience? So Roy Batty, played by the menacing Rutger Hauer, and his team of rebel replicants kill a bunch of offworld people and head to planet Earth in order to meet their maker and have a little talk with him. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a ""Blade Runner"". A guy whose speciality is ""retiring"" rogue replicants (A fancy way of saying 'killing'.)In order to get more information about this certain group of rebel replicants that he is assigned to terminate, Deckard heads to the Tyrell corporation where he meets Rachael, played by Sean Young, a secretary of the Tyrell corporation and also a new generation replicant who does not realize that she is a replicant. Soon enough Deckard falls madly in love with Rachael.Anyway, can Deckard stop the evil replicants lead by the wily and determined Roy Batty from performing their mission on Earth, and also find true love and happiness with Rachael? You will just have to watch the movie to find that out.I first saw Blade Runner in the theater way back in 1982 when it was first released and I enjoyed it pretty much. It was a nice little noirish sci fi thriller that had a grim view of how the future (2019) would look like such as constant acid rain falling from the sky, and all the other depressing things that go along with it that we have seen in many other countless dystopian films since this movie's release.I owned Blade Runner on VHS and watched it every now and then over the years. It was an interesting movie to watch, especially for the performances of Harrison Ford, and the most excellent and menacing Rutger Hauer, and the superb special effects of futuristic buildings and flying cars of the supposed future (Yet no cell phones or laptop computers are present in this movie, ironically? Something that other futuristic movies, most notably the Star Trek films happened to get right.)Anyway, this review is for the DVD ""The Final Cut"" version that I watched, and the picture and sound of it all was simply stunning, and it also features extended scenes and previously unseen footage that previous versions of the film lacked. If you are one of the few people who has not seen Blade Runner yet, then I highly recommend that you give this film a view. It's a really good thought-provoking film that is worth at least one viewing. It is also the final cut of the film that is most-endorsed by the director Ridley Scott."	5.0	More Human than Human	2011-08-03	6	4	2

I prefer the theatrical version, with the voice-over and the flight scenes at the end. The longer version feels more complete and more rounded somehow. The so-called director's cut seems thin after seeing the other. This is always a great movie, in any version. This seems like a good collection, but I have not gotten around to watching all the versions."	5.0	GREAT MOVIE	2013-06-21	2	0	2

The gritty reality is one of the best parts, as befits a film in the classic noir style. This is more than simply a movie, just made for the heck of it, it  is a world unto itself, along the lines of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.  It is vastly different from those two, but deserves a place along side  them. The stunning cinementography and the lush characters keep one  entertained and thinking for hours after a viewing. Of course it has  wonderful special effects, but unlike most modern movies does not allow the  effects to take over and obscure the story and the characters. The ending,  while much less happy than that of the original, is powerful and contains  striking imagery remenicent in some ways of The Third Man. This is truly  one of the great movies, and will go down as such. If you have not seen it  or do not own it, do both soon, it is well worth it. ( And for heavens sake  don't buy or watch the 5th element, it is just a Blade Runner wannabe with  an uplifting finale and a dumb plot.)	5.0	A Classic Sci-Fi Flick.	1999-12-12	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A4C0PJKW2XWW6	"""rojowal"""	I saw Blade Runner when it first came out in the theaters and I was very disappointed. This Directors Cut of the film really makes up for a lot of mistakes made in the original. Getting rid of the narrative and changing the ending where two changes I thought made the DVD much better then the original movie. The few special effects that were in the film were spectacular, especially for the time it was made. I still thought the movie was slow, but the last 30 minutes of the film almost makes up for it. The DVD looks and sounds excellent and Blade Runner is a great DVD to own if you are a hard core sci-fi fan and don't mind a slower paced intellectual movie.	3.0	Good changes to a otherwise slow movie	2000-11-24	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1UJYD8VTPGETJ	Ronald	"The Film:In my opinion, one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made.  It was released in 1982 and to this day nothing comes close; visually, aurally, and maybe even emotionally.  The cast and crew put their blood, sweat, and tears into this and it shows in every frame.  In spite of all this, you'll either love it or hate it, but give it at least two viewings before you decide, there are a lot of subtleties to pick up on.  This is not an action film, it's a noir and also a bit on the artsy side (and it pains me to use this word, I don't consider myself to be an artsy person).  The first time I watched it my thoughts were along the line of ""...Okay?"", I went back to it a year later and it all just suddenly clicked.  I now place it among my top favorite films and I've seen it at least six times in the few years since.  Everything about it is just flawless, the writing, the acting, the sets and lighting, the music etc. all come together to create a stunning whole (I could praise the sets and music until I'm blue in the face, amazing).  When you watch it, be sure and do it right; watch it late at night, lights out, without any distractions (in fact, this is one of the few movies that I prefer to watch alone), it's the only way to do it.  This is not a daytime, friends over and chatting movie, you'll ruin it for yourself. Again, give it at least two tries before you make up your mind on it.  Many, many people dislike it at first glance (probably in part because it's so different from the mainstream and what we are accustomed to) but it often grows on them upon subsequent viewings.The Final Cut Edition:Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player or the latest greatest television, but even on DVD on my 32"" 720p LCD it looks fantastic.  Beautifully remastered picture and sound, and the scene extensions, while all short, are a welcome addition.  They also did a really great job digitally adding Zhora's real face back in, to where it no longer looks like a stuntwoman with an afro-wig.  It truly is seamless now.  Fear not however, this is not a George Lucas style re-release and it is not wildly altered, it is absolutely the original Blade Runner film that everyone knows and loves, only it has now been brought to perfection.  The big issue that will divide some viewers is the voice-over narration, or rather, the lack thereof.  Personally, I prefer it without the narration (I just thought it sounded really cheesy and poorly done and detracted from the greatness of the film), the lack of narration only makes me enjoy the Final Cut even more, but I know that some people prefer it with the narration and if you really have to have it then look elsewhere, it is entirely absent here.  The cheesy tacked-on ending (the one that included landscape footage from the shooting of ""The Shining"") was also axed and now we get a good one that better fits the nature of the film (again, my opinion).  There is also a few hours worth of documentary on the second disc that I enjoyed.All-in-all, a must-own.  Yes, it's true, you might not like it, but you owe it to yourself to give it a chance (two chances).  It may just end up becoming a favorite and drawing you deep into its beautifully bleak world as it did with me.  Highly, highly recommended, this is a masterpiece in every sense."	5.0	Sweet solitude	2010-11-30	8	8	0

It depicts a future both technically sophisticated but, at the same time, a morally degraded freak show.  After so many great reviews I'll make no effort to condense this great film.  The action revolves around the fact that technology has evolved to the point that it can produce artificial humans, or 'Skin Jobs', as they are contemptuously known.  These individuals are basically biological robots but, instead of machinery, they are composed totally of human tissue.  They have been produced with different purposes in mind and, in the film, we see...in the several 'Skin Jobs' depicted...advancing levels of technology.  The most advanced model is 'Roy', blonde, powerful, beautiful and deadly [here we see a reflection of Nazi superman theory].Unfortunately, all models, because of their perceived danger to the human race, have an inbuilt defect--they are limited to a very short life.  They are sentient enough to resent it and active enough to do something about it.  Four escape to earth to try to gain the secret of longer life.  It's a desperate ploy, especially because Harrison as the 'Bladerunner' has been commissioned to destroy them.  Great stuff really and better yet because no one has yet been wrong enough to try to serialize this great film.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"	5.0	Imperfect Future	2008-11-21	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"Harrison Ford is Deckard, a police detective specially assigned hunt down rogue androids called replicants. Consequential innovations of a distant future (actually 2019, and we're past the halfway point between that date and this flick's initial release), replicants are so apparently human, only the detectives called Blade Runners can spot and retire them. Deckard actually hs a lot in common with his victims - after years of chasing androids down, Deckard has become something colder than human (his wife, Deckard told us in the original studio cut, compared him to sushi - a cold fish) and is a retiree himself when first asked to take one more case. Long disillusioned, Deckard allows his ex-boss, a bloated bigot named Bryant (Emmet Walsh) to bad-cop him into hunting down a batch of especially dangerous military replicants called Nexus-6 and led by android Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). Though few replicants even attempt to return to Earth where they are anyway outlawed the band led by Batty return not only to Earth, but attempt to break into the factory that developed them. (A fellow Blade Runner is critically wounded when crossing paths with one of the band disguised as a factory worker.) Though long disenchanted with a job that had him killing the human-like machines, Deckard outwardly maintains that replicants really are machines either a benefit or a hazard. Only Deckard's love for the sad Rachel (Sean Young), an android who is slowly realizing that she is not human, forces him to change his perspective. (Most of the film has Deckard falling for Rachel, keeping him one step behind the androids themselves). Batty closes in on a meeting with his maker - the founding engineer of Tyrell corporation, a sort of aloof and godlike character who lives in a room looking like one in the Vatican apartments and set inside of a building looking like a huge Aztec pyramid. Meanwhile, Deckard works to catch-up with Batty while staying one-step ahead of another Blade Runner, Gaff (Edward James Olmos) who is gunning for Rachel. The Androids are programmed to die after 4 years a measure designed, less to protect humans from the replicants violent streak than merely prevent the machines from attaining human-like emotional states. One-by-one, Deckard tracks down each of the replicants and, after withstanding a bruising to his body and soul, kills them. With the death of Batty, Deckard's conversion is complete he can never hunt again, nor can he remain in the dark and doomed city that was his hunting ground.WHY THIS MOVIE IS OVERBLOWN. Blade Runner was an early attempt at sci-fi high concept the crossing over of two genres, in this case, sci-fi with 1940's film noir, but it opened in 1982 alongside the film-noir spoof ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" both films featuring voice-overs by stars with similar sounding voices (Steve Martin and Harrison Ford). The city-scape of the Los Angeles of the future looks fully-realized, complete with flying cars, industrial smoke stacks, giant bill-boards and gouges of flame, but much of the drama is personal the elaborate special effects seldom becoming little more than eye-candy (though sumptuous). Down-to-Earth exteriors, while frenetic and crowded, never look more than incredibly detailed soundstages. (The billboards hawking Pan-Am and Atari as well as a general atmosphere that presumes a modern culture stemming from the economic dominance of Pacific-rim industrial power are amusingly dated). The smoky interior effects and junk-technology in movies like this and Alien, though elaborate, gave rise to the now prevailing futurism which simply relies on cheesy camera-work and second-hand set design. (In classic sci-fi, the future is the clean, orderly and largely tax-free result of human pluck that survived some vaguely catastrophic event occurring shortly after whatever book or film its set in.)  The Director's cut is better in some spots than the '82 wide release version, but falls in others.  The voice overs of the 82' cut were weak (though the ""sushi"" line was priceless), but eliminating them here only exposes the weak narrative of original.  The new version also jettisons the optimism-tinged ending (complete with aerial shots ripped from ""The Shining""), but adds in dream sequences filled with unicorns, suggesting the fairy tale ""Legend"".  (The interior sets, atmosphere and Vangelis score also suggest that film, making it hard to remember that that movie actually followed ""Runner"" rathern than preceding it).WHY YOU MUST STILL SEE IT: Besides its larger warning of a future as being a bleak era scarred by evils prevalent today (corporate governance, ecological disintegration and dehumanizing technology) ""Runner"" is also a film with unforgettable characters. While Deckard is remote, your heart will be broken by Rachel and the even the murderous Batty. Despite the death he inflicts or hints at in almost every scene he's in, the script wisely keeps Batty soft-spoken to the point of being a child (Gosh, you've... really got some nice toys here), rewarding him with a christ-like death scene sure to tug at your heartstrings. I still don't know what C-Beams are, but it's a moment in Batty's life which will die with him, and that's the painful thing.  The flick tanked largely (cultists claimed) because of a studio-ordered cut adding an upbeat ending and the off-camera narration by Harrison Ford. Those studio-execs never get respect. Catching the Director's Cut in 92, I realized that those studio execs took the fall for a film with an irreparably poor narrative, one so limited, that fans can debate such nonsensical ideas like whether Deckard himself is an android. If that were true, the moral of the film (warning of machines becoming more human than those who build and use them) would be pointless. Instead, Deckards story is of a man once forced to become something like a machine, and now given a last chance to find his way back. You should also catch Runner because of its dated vision, catching those aspects of the film that weren't ahead of their time, but are rooted to a more innocent age flying cars, Pan-Am and early 80's synthesized score courtesy of Vangelis."	4.0	Man and Replicant	2002-02-26	1	1	0

Perhaps the film reviewers in Los Angeles are so used to their dry climate that the mere thought of a LA where the rain is constantly falling is science fiction to the max.  With that said, the issues that keep this movie from moving into the classic category are many.  How does a genetically engineered replicant decide to go from the Outer Colonies to be a snake dancer in a sleazy strip club?  Programming?  The others sure seem to have rejected their programming, especially the ""First Law of Robotics.""  Note the hint of an abundant fossil fuel economy, lack of vision for cell phones, excessive drinking and smoking (really reminded me of Casablanca, but Casablanca wasn't mimicking the future), and two-tiered society (""If you are not police, you are one of the little people.""One the positive side, I can see there were a number of interesting and cutting edge directing issues of this story for the time (1982, I believe).

It really makes the films dark atmosphere shine. The special features are outstanding too, and I really appreciate the time and energy that must have been spent correlating all these interviews and fascinating facts.However - and I feel bad making even one complaint about this release - but in all the 9 HOURS of special features there is HARLDY a mention on Vangelis's stunning score for Blade Runner. His work on this film was truly exceptional and I think the film would be a much less enjoyable experience without it. He really captured the brooding dystopia in his score. It really is a masterpiece of a score and I just find it such an oversight that there was NO focus on this within the myriad of special features. I understand that he's not one for interviews, but even a 10 min piece on the development and importance of his masterwork would have been much appreciated by fans... After all, he played such a massive roll in the emotion of this film.I think scores in films are too often overlooked, which is a shame considering they add such a subliminally important roll in the emotion of film.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1XHV2SO8YH8SU	Rudolf Schmidt	"This is of course an all-time classic film, but when you think about it, the plot is fundamentally flawed. The story concerns a policeman whose job is to identify and retire fugitive androids. These androids -- ""replicants"" -- are so like real humans that the only way to identify them is, basically, by asking them questions that would make most humans blush and measuring their physiological reactions with sophisticated electronic equipment. This is the so-called ""Voight-Kampf test"". This much Ridley Scott took from the original novel by Philip K. Dick. But then Scott made his replicants superhuman: they are much stronger than humans, and capable of withstanding extremes of heat and cold. When one of them is shot, she jerks spastically like a malfunctioning machine.Now, it stands to reason that a replicant who can casually plunge her hand into a flask of boiling water without being burned must be physiologically much different than a real human. Therefore, there must surely be easier and surer ways of identifying replicants than the complex 'Voight-Kampf' test.I've always assumed that Scott intended to make his audiences think about the similarities between the humans and the replicants, and the (im)morality of the former arbitrarily terminating the existences of the latter. But this story would have been much, much more powerful if the replicants were not superhuman but rather were indistinguishable from 'real' humans, so that when one of them is shot down in cold blood, we had only the results of the cop's dubious Voight-Kampf test to assure us that an escaped android has just been retired rather than a innocent woman been murdered. Instead, Scott has spared our consciences by providing the reassuring spectacle of Pris' robotic, mechanical, decidely inhuman death throes. We never have any doubt that these are artificially constructed robots and therefore we don't need to trouble ourselves much about the morality of killing them."	4.0	Classic film, tragically flawed plot.	2005-07-12	8	7	1

After all, the original - uncut - version is better because of (amongst other reasons or opinions) the consistency in the storyline. Nevertheless, this version is one for the people that have a weak spot for some movie titles and want a complete collection. 2) The great image quality, no doubt about that.

This movie drops down a notch because the cynics miss the movie's point. I will try to explain. The most powerful scene in the movie is when Rutger's replicant-killer gains self-awareness on the rooftop battling Harrison Ford. In the rain, he remarks how as an expendable entity he has gone to the ends of the universe on suicide missions with noone caring or remembering, and then when its all said and done, he will cease to exist. Then, as the rain drops fall, HE CHOOSES to rescue Harrison Ford, anyway. If that is not by definition, HUMANITY, heroism, and LOVE, then what is it? He CHOSE to be alive, to care. By so doing he exceeds the humanity of some of us. If you don't shed a tear for him and wish he were human, then maybe YOU are a replicant. This is where the cynics miss the point.The natural response of a human would be to as soon as the crisis was over to CHOSE LIFE--to grab the girl, get away and LIVE while you can and be thankful for what you have, which is what Ford does in the original movie but not the avante garde &quot;director's cut&quot;. The studio executives are right on this one. The point of this movie is to remain HUMAN no matter what the inhumanity that science and technology directed by the heartless creates. To remember the dark days on some forgotten planet and the &quot;expendibles&quot;--in other words DON'T LET OUR WORLD BECOME THE WORLD OF BLADE RUNNER.	4.0	Original is better, humanity triumphs	2000-10-14	7	6	1

Everything about the set, from the bonus items such as the Spinner toy replica to the actual DVD set itself, seems to have been created with great care. In the past I have seen other sets claiming to have special bonus items included and usually they were cheaply made and carelessly thrown in. Bait to lure in unsuspecting collectors. The bonus items in this set went beyond my expectations and are great conversation pieces I would be proud to have on display. The discs themselves are beautiful to behold and provide a fascinating insight into the making of the film as well as all five versions each with it's own introduction by Ridley Scott. If you're a movie collector, film buff, or you just plain love Blade Runner, don't miss out on this limited set. It will not disappoint.	5.0	Perfection	2007-12-29	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3CYFDQZH4H5GL	SandmanVI	The most influential sci-fi Noir ever made. Bladerunner is heavy on atmosphere and nuance leaving much to the viewer's imagination (as a classic should). Though sparse on action and dialogue this movie is a must for anyone who likes thinking man's sci-fi and especially those who appreciate the film's role in sci-fi history. The movie may not work for the under-20 crowd who are accustomed to faster paced, more obvious modern thrillers.	5.0	Intelligent Sci-fi Masterpiece	2004-04-01	4	3	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N	Sandy Kay	"This is for people who haven't watched all the versions (or any version).  If you are a long-time fan of the movie in one version or another, just skip this review because you'll probably hate it.I heard about Blade Runner for many years but never got around to seeing it.  The final cut was my first exposure to the movie.  If you are like me, these are things you should know:1.  It's dark.  Visually as well as plotwise.  I like noir films but have difficulty seeing dark & shadowy scenes, which in this case is most of the movie.  I think the larger & clearer you can see it, the better off you'll be.  If you've got a 20-year-old 26"" TV, bring the movie to watch with friends who have new, big TVs because you can't understand what you can't see.2.  It's dark (again).  Deckard is the closest thing to a hero in this movie and he isn't exactly warm and fuzzy.  He doesn't express any more emotion than Rachel, the replicant with whom he falls in love (contributing to the ""is Deckard a replicant or human"" debate).  I think the reason they needed special tests to identify replicants wasn't because the replicants were so human but because all the humans were so robotic.  Ridley Scott portrays a future I hope we never see.  Very grim.  And it rained all the time in LA -- huh?3.  It can be confusing.  As I understand, the original release had a Deckard voiceover added after screening audiences didn't like the movie.  I think the movie is stylistically better without a voiceover, but it can be hard for new viewers like me to catch all the details.  One scene in particular confused me:  Deckard was looking at a photo in his apartment that he kept enlarging and enhancing to find small details.  What was that about?  And then the added unicorn scene that followed (more fuel for the Deckard as replicant position) confused me more.  Again because of the visual darkness & my old TV, I had to go online to realize that the last object Deckard picked up was an origami unicorn (presumably left by the cop who made origami).  If you like movies all spelled out for you, you probably won't like this movie.4.  No happy ending.  The original Deckard & Rachel escape to lovely woodsy places would be more ""feel good"" but make no sense if the Earth is so miserable people want to move off world.  The ending in this final cut is a bit abrupt for me.  They get into an elevator and all of a sudden the credits start, leaving me wondering what happened.  If you like happy endings, you'll be disappointed.5.  Hard characters to like.  It may be that I missed something, but I didn't find anything in the replicants to make me empathize with them.  Roy has one moment of goodness after a violent and murderous swath through the movie.  If the goal of the movie was to make me think about what makes an organism a person who deserve rights to life, liberty, etc., I missed it.  I had no problem with Deckard killing the escapees.  Even Rachel, who was benign, gave me no reason to feel she should be treated as a human.  On the other hand, I didn't like any of the human characters much either.I gave this movie 3 stars because I still don't know whether I liked it or not.  But I was intrigued enough that I might read the Philip Dick story or watch a version with voiceover narration and then come back to this version hoping to understand it better."	3.0	A review for the clueless, from the clueless	2008-01-06	8	5	3

This version has a few more violent scenes than the theatrical version.  It also has the narration by Harrison FOrd, which I personally liked b/c it gave the film a friendlier feel, made Deckard almost certainly ""human"", and has the so-called ""happy ending"".The Final Cut is great technically b/c the audio & video are enhanced & updated with modern technology that makes it a pleasure to watch & hear.  However, this version makes fairly clear that Deckard was indeed a replicant, which is a notion I initially scoffed at & rejected.  However, when director Ridley Scott says, in the commentary track & elsewhere in the DVD set, that his intention was to have Deckard be a replicant, then that's the way it is.  If you can accept this fact, then you will LOVE the Final Cut version of BR.If you still prefer Deckard be a human, then you can still enjoy the 1982 International Version.The other discs are excellent, discussing the making of BR, the cult status it has achieved, etc.  Nothing but great background & interviews throughout this DVD set.The 5th disc gives you a 5th version of BR which, although of poor visual quality, has some different scenes in it & different dialogue.You also get a silver unicorn replica & police spinner car replica for buying the 5-disc set."	5.0	excllent set for en excellent movie	2008-08-21	1	1	0

The story is interesting, but not totally intriguing though, and the acting is fine.  The aspects of the movie that really stand out would be the cinematography,  special effects, and the music.  The cinematography is very good and no  doubt some of the best that I've seen.  The music is also very good and  really grabs me--I've always been aware of who Vangelis was, but have never  owned any of his music (it really adds something to the film).  Overall, I  think that Blade Runner no doubt is a good movie, and the plot isn't that  difficult to understand.  Worth a watch.	3.0	A good film overall.	1999-12-05	9	8	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A155KXFRZCA7C	"scherf.com ""scherf.com"""	I liked that movie ever since its release in the early 80s. I've seen it many times. Before the Director's Cut, there was the original theatrical version which had the voiceover narration of the main character, Rick Deckard (Harrsion Ford), which I personally liked a lot better. It's a dark movie about replicants with human appearance, but a short life span, who are eager to find a way to extend their existence. Rutger Hauer plays one of these robots and its one of his best roles ever. Needless to say, Harrison Ford plays superbly. Blade Runner really reinvented the Sci-Fi thriller genre and brought it back to life. While this movie was already made some two decades ago, it's as fresh as it can be and a lot of contemporary Sci-Fi flicks continue to borrow from this motion picture. The scenery, a futuristic L.A., the concept of humanoids or replicants, flying automobiles, and so forth. The soundtrack is also unique. Sean Young looks pretty good and stylish in this movie, too. And we consider Blade runner to be the ultimate Sci-Fi thriller, which has no match so far.	5.0	The classic Sci-Fi thriller	2000-10-16	5	4	1

One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever, hence 4 stars, but...I decided to watch this for the first time with someone who had never seen it before, thinking that he would enjoy it greatly.  He usually likes the sci-fi programs like StarGate, FarScape, BattleStar, and any Sci-Fi movie, but this director's cut is really for the die hard Blade Runner fans that know what is going on.  Although I watched it liking it myself, I realized that it would be dragging if I hadn't seen it before.  Even I would have rather been watching the original theatrical release by the end.  My companion thought it was OK.  Not the review I would have expected except that I had seen what he saw and realized that it just isn't as good a story as the theatrical version.Some people complain about the voice over that Harrison Ford did to explain and get the story moving.  They say that the voice is monotone and lifeless. I though that it spoke words about the situation in which the city and world had become, all melancholy and gloomy.I would still have bought this version, just so I could see the difference, but I'll get the theatrical release when it comes out.

In 2019, the Earth is being infiltrated by a small band of replicants - Identical to Humans in virtually every way, but developed to be used as slave labor off world.The only thing that distinguishes replicants from actual people is that they are activated without any emotions of their own (although their creators believe that they will develop them on their own), and a built in fail safe in case something goes wrong with the replicant &#62;&#62;  They only have a four year lifespan.  One thing is sure...  judging by the behavior of 'Roy', the murderous replicant played by Rutger Hauer, it's possible for them to go insane, and it's up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to hunt them down.The visual effects are state of the art for the time - no CGI here boys and girls - but they look great and hold up well.	4.0	CLASSIC!

Considering how much time I spend  criticizing multiple releases, I don't know why I would either.  Except for this one.  ""Blade Runner"" was an enigma during its first U.S. run.  It created a gritty, dysfunctional, and totally real future.  It was difficult in the extreme to watch and understand, with the many layers of story, graphics, and complex characterizations.  It created the last great ""film noir"" in the most unlikely of settings.  And it was bleak.  My Lord, it was bleak.  This was a Los Angeles that no one in their right mind would want to live in, even if given a chance of a happy ending that Deckard seemed to get.The dystopia as replacement to a bright and shining tomorrow was a touchstone idea, and drove the popularity of the ""Cyberpunk"" movement to follow.  The cinematic imagery would lay the foundation for much of the ""new breed"" of sci-fi film and television to follow.  The, true fans found out there was another version....The later cuts would demonstrate that even beyond the U.S. release, ""Blade Runner"" was a difficult movie to pidgeonhole, and that's what made the journey through each successive cut so damned exciting.  Even without  them, the original had riddles that demanded we solved them through the same painstaking detective worl Deckard used.  The acting was so top notch, we knew we had a new breed of heroes, lovers, villains, and chorus members worth getting to know and love.  The ultimate question of even Deckard's identity, so beautifully clawed out of Harrison Ford (proving that, if anything else, he CAN act and has the chops to play so charismatic and troubled a protagonist) is but one of a multitude of deep questions.Everyone in this movie has something to be proud of, and even with only ""Blade Runner"" as a successful project on their resume, they were a part of something special.  A few truly deserve to have their later careers reexamined for something beyond what audiences and their fellow creative types saw as ""failures.""The package itself is worthy of the complexity of the movie. Sure, there's the collector's goodies thrown in, which are fun for themselves.  What's finally done right for the movie is the sheer damn amount of video treasures included which demonstrates both to the longtime fan and those who want to get to know it why ""Blade Runner"" is worth all this time, attention, and, yeah, I'll admit it, obsessive love.Which is why its so influential in the first place."	5.0	"Truly A ""Definitive"" Release"	2008-01-03	3	3	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3EMO9N62CSFWD	Scott Scallion	It sort of makes me sad that this DVD was the way I was introduced to Blade Runner.  A DVD package such as this does not do the movie justice.  Watching the film, I could still realize that this was something great.  Blade Runner addresses the simple questions that have been on the minds and in the hearts of all people for all time...what is it that makes us human?  Do we have a higher purpose in life?  Is our existance the result of our personal choices or are we being moved along by forces beyond our control?  Seems sort of hokey when you're reading it off a screen, but when you experience it lived out on film, it is truly a beautiful sight.  From what I hear about the director's cut is that the film's narration has been omitted and the movie's ending has been altered.  I've read through Deckard's voice over from the theatrical release, and believe me, you don't need it.  The Director's Cut works much better to subtly convey the emotions and themes of the movie.  A quick comment on the ending without spoiling it... it works.  If you truly let the movie engross you, you'll understand why any other ending would be a disappointment.  It's powerful without being preachy.  Science fiction at it's best.A few warnings to DVD buffs and Blade Runner fans.  This isn't a good DVD.  The video and sound quality is nothing special.  The world Ridley Scott creates is amazing.  The DVD just doesn't do it justice.  No extras, no easter eggs, nothing.  Quite a disappointment.  The movie is based from the novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot;  Purists may be upset with some of the departures taken from the novel to make the film.  Then again, if you've read the book, you know that it just wouldn't have worked as a perfect transition into a movie.  Not in 1982, anyway, and I doubt today's world would be able to truly appreciate and accept it either.The greatness of Blade Runner does shine through in this DVD of the best version of the movie to date.  It's just lacking in so many ways that it's hard to recommend a purchase.  Sadly I fear this masterpiece will become lost in time.  Blade Runner truly deserves to be in a class with all the scifi classics.	2.0	Greatness still shines through	2003-11-29	5	5	0

To date, there has only been a handful of really value packed DVD titles, most notable were the Criterion collections 'Brazil' and Buckaroo Banzai adventures across the 8th dimension.  With all that space why only put the movie and maybe a trailer if your lucky?Well here we have Blade Runner The Ultimate Collector's Edition and I just have to say it again fellow fans and new comers alike.  It's mind blowing.  Simply the best Blade Runner release EVER.  Period!!This collection is worth 4 times the price.  In fact I probably paid that trying to hunt down the rare versions.  Oh how I wish I had simply waited for this.  Not only did I get better versions of all those poor quality bootleg releases I chowed down over the years, I got what I can only describe as 'bigger, better, more'.Now that I've ranted I'd better review the material briefly.  What you get is 5 amazing discs that I strongly feel will put many manufacturers to shame and bring a new age of decent DVD releases increasing the bonus material to previously undreamed of heights, like the magnificient 'Blade Runner' release here.The Final Cut, is simply stunning.  I'm going to make a point of emailing Ridley to thank him a million times over for going to great lengths in giving this unique film the treatment it so rightfully deserves.  The final cut is basically 'The Directors Cut' that came out in 1992, BUT with a few major additions.  There's an extra minute of footage but that's not what blew my mind.  It's the total touch up magic that has been pain stakingly carried out on the footage and the sound is FANTASTIC. I was always dissapointed with the Directors Cut sound, in that it was so stereo sounding.  The DVD release(of which I've given away upon aquiring this incredible treasure trove along with all my other dodgy versions), back in 1992 was also a major let down with next to nothing other than a trailer.  The Final Cut fixes all that with brilliant commentaries, a nice intro by Ridley Scott and did I mention the picture and sound are now positively top notch with not a single complaint from this hard core fan.  Oh and I should also mention your in for a treat with some nicely added affects and oh so perfect lighting.  Look I can't say anymore as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not yet seen this brilliant final cut.If the bonuses on the first disc were not enough, there's 4, YES '4' extra DVD's chock a block full of Blade Runner goodness.  2 of these give you the other 4 versions of the film (not just transferred on a whim, ALL fixed up as best as they could be and given 5.1 channel sound enhancment), you get the 1992 directors cut, the 1982 US Theatrical Cut, the 1982 International Cut and something I've never been able to obtain.  The rediculously mega rare until now PRE-RELEASE WORKPRINT version of the film(this was the initial viewing film that was post theatre release).  I had to read the cover 4 times just to convince myself it was actually there, not to mention sit in astonishment starring at a title screen (my flat mate thought I had lost it when I apparently sat there for half an hour just looking at the screen afraid to push the play button).  Needless to say this is a VERY good thing.If that wasn't fantastic enough, you get another 2 disc loaded to the brim with what I can only describe as a treasure trove of Blade Runner additions.  You get interviews with so many of the cast, you'll have to write down the names to keep track of them all, you get documentaries the likes of which rarely grace a film in such majestic splendor, stacks of footage highlighting the costuming, artwork, prop creations, Syd Mead's own spotlights and then....Massive drum roll....  You get approximately(I still havn't counted them as I've only seen the first 5 and will need a viewing time just to view them),  about 20+ deleted scenes, so far all of them featuring amazing valuable footage I'd never seen nor heard of until now.  For example there's a scene were Deckard talks with Howard after his 'little' encounter with Leon.  I'll not describe it, if your a fan and you must be to have kept reading my ranting review, it's a must see, along with all  the other great pieces of footage which have now expanded the movie even further for me.In a nutshell this collection is overpowering for the discs alone, combined with a trendy collectors brief case, replica polymer chromed Unicorn, art folder, motion film cell and a replica scaled police spinner car with vertically opening doors just like in the film that I can fly around with in my living room(YOU ROCK SYD!!!), it's simply beyond amazing value, quality and any other '...ity' you care to mention.FLAWLESS DVD RELEASE (5 OUT OF 5), no problems what soever and anyone who whinges at this is either not a Blade Runner fan or a ludicrous individual who's either close to death or in fact a replicant.Grab it while you can or you'll deffinately be left behind and forgotten like 'tears in rain'.	5.0	Finally It's ALL here.	2008-01-06	3	3	0

Ridley Scott can make a hell of a movie (alien, gladiator...) but he should stick with the epics and thankfully he seems to be going in that direction because he is making 3 more historical epics that i know of (kingdom of heaven, hannibal, not lector, the conqueror dude, and gladiator 2, also he is planning on a movie called metropoli which i think stars russel crowe and is also a hist epic) and alien was a great sci fi horror film, but this sci fi so called action movie (even though it has no real or half decent action in it at all) sucks terrbily.  It is boring, weird, the is no fathomable plot, no drama or likeable character esspecially that nexus 6 guy (what the hell was he doin in a ridley scott film, hes a worse actor the steven seagal almost), no action, pointless nudity, an the supposed unhappy ending in this directors cut is basically happy, they are together at the end whats so unhappy, its pointless because there is an attempt at a love story (which suck anyway) but this is just ridiculous.

I loved the original in the theaters, I do like this newest version with the narration edited out, and the inconsistent happy ending edited out, but still, it's impossible to relive the wonderful experience of seeing the first run of Bladerunner back then, for many reasons.  But at the same time, there's no real fair comparison between this movie, and the thought provoking, prescient, brilliant literary quality novels of Phillip K. Dick, and ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" was one of his best.  A big hole in the logic of the movie should have been, given a future with an overpopulation and urban poverty problem, why would big, powerful, monopolistic corporations need to invest time, money, and other expenses into android technology?  People in such a future, indeed, in our present, are available to be the proverbial cannon fodder, and so would not have to ""see what"" Rutger Hauer's character saw with his genetically engineered synthetic eyes.  In the novel, the future human and animal populations were decimated by postindustrial pollution, warfare, and enviromental irresponsibility (and remember, Phillip K. Dick was writing a generation ago!).  So lonely, depopulated humans invented talking doors, ovens, and so forth, and artificial animals for those who couldn't afford real ones.  Artificial humans a logical outcome of such a future.  Now the movie worked so well visually, and the story line was so consistent with the older established film-noire detective genre, that this big difference with the book isn't a fatal flaw in the movie, but I give you all this background to note a real hypocrisy in the artistic differences between the director and the studio that resulted in these different movie versions.  In an interview on NPR, the director, the very same director still miffed that the studio changed his ideas for the first run of the movie, laughs off the interviewers question about how irritated Phillip K. Dick was with Bladerunner veering so far from the original important fundmental premises and situations laid out in the novel.  Ridley Scott than candidly admits that he ""never actually read the book,"" because he didn't have the attention span for it!  The NPR interviewer responds by stating that she can understand why the author might not have liked the movie then."	4.0	Irony in the director-studio battle over artistic integrity	2008-06-02	1	1	0

Comprised of 4 versions of the cult sci-fi classic (including director Ridley Scott's phenomenal newFinal Cut) this 4-disc (single-sided) box set promises something for every Blade Runner fan, regardless of preference. Though all three complete archival versions: 1982 U.S. Theatrical Cut, 1982 International Theatrical Cut and 1992 Director's Cut are digitally restored and remastered for enhanced picture and audio, they pale in comparison to the 2007 Final Cut which incorporates New Footage and never before seen Special Effects and boasts 3 filmmaker Commentaries. All 4 versions include introduction by director Ridley Scott and feature English Dolby Surround 5.1 audio plus the following additional audio features: English & French Dolby Surround Stereo audio (Archival Versions on Disc 3) and French Dolby Surround 5.1 audio (Final Cut on Disc 1). Special Features include the outstanding documentary ""Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner"" and Enchancement Archive.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2U4O4I6V0WLM7	SFR Bowen	I was 16 when I saw BR for the first time in 1982 and I still enjoy to watch it every now and then. Loved to see Rutger Hauer with dyed hair and a weird accent. The punch line of the story (Dick's artificial intelligence and the question about human rights) and the very darkness of the shooting, in my opinion, gives this motion picture his unique style which is still standing after 27 years and I hope there will never be a remake! The props and dressing are very much 80's, but thats gives BR a cult film status.I ordered this package because I wanted to see the different editions of BR from the past 25 years: the original, the directors cut, the final cut and the workprint AND the deleted scenes. This gives you an idea how Scott struggled with the story and I how he was forced to make certain decissions in regards of the demands of the studio. Is Deckard a replicant or not, you want a happy end or a more dark end, what happens with Rachel and the voice over from Ford. Maybe in the future this box come with a editor selector: you can make your own version of the BR story by selecting your own favourite scenes!Very enjoyable item with loads of backstage material. Haven't watched all of it (saved some for a rainy day!). Blu Ray is absolutely fantastic and the upscaling of DVD-material to Blu Ray standard works pretty smood. This is the ultimate gift for BR fans. I ordered this package from Europe and I received it within a week!

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2Y71C8QYT9JOP	Shade Black	I look at this film with both a postive and a negative eye. Usually, I wouldn't say a bad thing about this movie, but when writting a review, I must look at both sides. Lets start with somthing simple, like pros and cons.Pros: Effects that still hold water today. Great acting. Deep and emotional plot. Very intense. Artistic value is unsurpassed.Cons: Hard to follow sometimes. Some of the scenes are a little slow paced at times. Overall it's just a little to wierd.Now that were passed that let's review the plot:Sometime in the not so distant future, we created Replicants or &quot;Skin Jobs&quot; to fight our wars, preform covert operations, and due our laundry(just kidding!). kind of like drones, to do our dirty work. of course, we created these miracle machines with far greated strength and acrobatic talents than we have. But replicants were made to copy humans in every way, exept their emotions, you see we made these machines to form their own emotions. But the scientist who created them feared these robot/clones would at some point rebel, So the they decided to creat and expiration date for all replicants, spanning a mear 4 years. Just as the scientist feared, these mechanical saviors turned into mechanical nightmares. The goverment decided to outlaw all replicants, skin jobs were offically outlawed and were shot on sight. We were able to contain most of them but quit a few still romed free, and they even created more. These robots blended quit nicely with the public. Remeber they were made to copy the human race in virtually every way.....................exept their emotions. We began having alot of trouble hunting these renagade bots down. Thus, an alite group of law enforcement officers call Blade Runner units were formed. And to go along with that, we created a test desinged to trick a replicant into giving his identity away by toying with it's emotions. Enter Deckard, a retired Blade Runner unit. Time passed, we got rid of all but four of the menacing clones. Deckards old chief offers him the assingment of killing these four in turn for......nothing? Dust though sense a plot hole? The movie centers on these four reps, and Deckards love interest, who may be a rep herself! Deckard searches, Deckard finds, Deckard shoots, happy ending right? Wrong, The ending is dark and depressing. I wont give it away to you! Do you think im a blabber mouth who doesent know when to shut up?! If you have read all this seemingly endless review.....your right!Overall: A great sci-fi classic, worth not only renting but investing 17 bucks to this fine website to own this masterpiece.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3NODHO20FFLT9	Shane	For people who haven't seen the original the Director's cut is frankly unwatchable.  The pace is glacial and the lack of dialog and explanation make the plot confusing and tedious.  The narration in the original is  cheesy and overplayed but lends some humanity to an otherwise drab role and  keeps the movie on track.  With regard to the 'central theme' mentioned in  previous reviews, anyone who has been paying attention in the original will  get it (give us ignorant masses some credit), and if anything the narration  and imagery at the time of Roy's death underscores it.  As for the ending,  I prefer the original though I agree it was a little heavy-handed.  The  sunlight creates a stark contrast to the darkness that saturates the  remainder of the film...I guess it boils down to whether you're the type of  person who likes a happy ending or a melancholy one.  The Director's cut is  worth a watch if you're a Blade Runner fan but I strongly recommend the  original, at least for starters.n.b., I admit I'm biased, I saw the film  in the theaters when it came out, loved it then and think they should have  left well enough alone, but then again I'm not the director...	3.0	Director's cut vs. original	1999-12-12	72	48	24
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1J1163Q56YIVZ	Shaun Anderson	BLADE RUNNER has been a film that has suffered over the years. Misinterpreted and critically attacked at the time of its initial release, it cultivated something of a cult following throughout the 1980s, which culminated in a complete critical about turn when the Directors Cut emerged in 1992. Opinion on the film is now the polar opposite to what it was in the early 1980's. Lauded by academics and film students, many books and articles have dissected the film from all angles, but mostly as the ultimate embodiment of a post-modern culture. The problem with this, is that a lot BLADE RUNNER'S magic has been lost in reams and reams of literature that have reduced the film to an academic exercise in cultural studies.I think too be fair BLADE RUNNER  exists in between these two polar oppositions. It is neither the masterpiece so many claim it too be, nor the unmitigated disaster many critics thought on its original release. Where BLADE RUNNER really succeeds is in its grimy and grungy realisation of a future Los Angeles, a space overrun by people of all ethnic groups, a frightening dystopia where one is not even sure if the person next to you in the crowded street is human. This is a vision of the future that Kubrick had hinted at in 2001, one totally reliant on technology, apathetic, lazy and bored, simply going through the motions. A world in which the class divide is even harsher than ever, as the rich enjoy life on the outer worlds, with the lower classes and criminals left to rot under the torrential and permanent acid rain. The narrative mysteries are intriguing enough, as is the eternal question as to Deckard's true origins, but I have always found BLADE RUNNER to be most enjoyed as a purely visual experience. Like 2001 it is a film of spectacle, which begins to falter when it is embroiled in narrative exposition. This is the simplest of films and one which embodies the ideology of cinema from the silent era, the wonder of illusion.Unfortunately Warner's DVD is dreadful, with no special features to speak of, not even a single trailer. I understand that this film was released at the infancy of DVD, but there is no excuse for having not released a special edition since.  The star rating is purely for the film.	3.0	The Rutger Hauer Show!	2006-06-23	2	2	0

For me, I was torn between the director's cut and the theatrical version of the film. The theatrical version features an after-the-fact narration, which neither director Ridley Scott nor Harrison Ford wanted. The studio felt the audience wouldn't be able to understand what was going on and needed it explained. I disliked most of the narration, although it did add a nice touch at the end of one character's life (trying to avoid spoilers). In this version, a happily-ever-after scene was also added, which I felt wasn't necessary but again seemed more satisfying for viewing audiences.Having said all that -- the additional footage in the director's cut, too me, was unnecessary. There is some extra blood and gore. I was surprised to hear one of my favorite lines changed from &#34;I want more life, &#34;F-er&#34; (Amazon needs me to say that instead of the actual word), to &#34;I want more life, FATHER.&#34; Wha...? I watched it with my teenage son, and while he did have a couple of &#34;why&#34; questions, he had no trouble following the storyline or figuring out what was happening. Some of the build up to action seemed slower.So I remain on the fence. Both versions are beautifully directed, with wonderful actors, great story, memorable lines, gorgeous images. Just excellent. I intend to buy the other version to compare and try to decide which I like best.	5.0	The eternal question - which version of Blade Runner is better? This is the director's cut	2013-12-23	0	0	0

However, Blade Runner is a great movie. more than being about what makes us human it transmits a feeling of intense urban alienation similar to Taxi Driver. everyone has left for the colony planets...and deckard has the thankless job of killing androids. the city bleeds noir- and the sets are so well done as to seem like a location shoot with the sheer density of information. the atmosphere is heavy with the minimal synth music. Ford underplays his role as usual, to good effect. Blatty, in search of immortality- or humanity- finds it by letting Deckard go- it is then we realize Deckard is less than human- the existential struggle plays out- and he's on the run towards a new life. The ending has great resonance, and Ford turns his head to the side...a display of relentless purpose.	5.0	then again...	2004-03-16	1	1	0

It is a great movie and anyone who hasn't seen it is doing themselves a disservice.  Granted if you aren't a fan of anything having to do with stories set in the future or sci-fi in general then you probably aren't going to give this film much of a chance.

The subtle inclusions from the cutting room floor really added to what can only be considered a work of art. The only small complaint is that they left off the scenes that made you wonder if our favourite anti-hero was himself a replicant (leaving this out made all those scenes showing the red glass like eyes of the artifical lifeforms a bit pointless).

She directed me to write on the classic--at least she and I agreed on this--Dr. Strangeloveinstead (and I still got an A--nyah)!Synopsis: a retired cop-cum-assassin is compelled to return to the job to hunt down and kill a group of manufactured people who have boldly returned to Earth to have their factory-set four-year lifetimes extended.Well, this film, while truly great, just isn't the best film ever made.  Sorry.  It's fun to watch, and is a cornucopia for filmies, but it's noGodfather,Triumph of the Will, or evenSwept Away.  It is a modern classic, no doubt, and it has been massively influential, which is plain to see inOutland,The Fifth Element,Dark City, and so many others.This film is so much more than sci-fi meets film noir.  Its beauty lies in the fact that you can take it as a simple cop-chases-bad-guy flick, complete with intrigue, fights, shooting, and a confused woman with a mysterious past.  Or you can take it as tale of doomed romance.  Or, it's a terrestrial sci-fi adventure, a meditation on the wages of off-world conscript warfare coming home.  It's all of these, and more.  The sci-fi context is a thoroughly realistic and accessible near-future, yet the movie is grounded in a climate-shattered L.A. where the global economy we know now is right in your face, and living in the streets.I absolutely love this film, and have from that autumn night in 1982 when I was one of the few to see it in a theater.  I've seen this film more than 400 times in the past 27 years, I know it all by heart, and still am not tired of watching it; I see something new every time.  From its visually stunning and aurally scintillating opening to the end titles, in all of its various cuts, its soundtracks, its groundbreaking and still-awesome F/X and intricate production values, its feel--more than anything the questions it raises about life, and living a life--the film continues to enthrall me.  As we get ever closer to the day when a ""manufactured person"" of real flesh, blood and bone is a reality, the film asks the simple question: what exactly constitutes being human?So, what is human?  How is it defined, and who gets to make the definition?  Simply a creature born of another human?  Or is it the individuality and (for want of a better term) ""soul"" living inside an easily replicable biological frame?  Is the concept of a ""soul,"" in the context of growing--and selling--fully grown humans for corporate profit, even worth discussing any longer? Can a living thing created in a laboratory, for purely commercial purposes, be considered a human?  Yes, they are faster, stronger, in many ways better than we ""normal"" humans, but who wouldn't take those options at birth, if they could be given?  Our almost-protagonist replicants are impetuous, capricious, immature, and then unflinchingly brutal, but then again, that describes anyone we know, or read about in the newspaper every day.  They are self-aware, and fully cognizant of their own mortality, and set about in deliberate fashion to defeat death, and more than anything, this seems to show how truly human they are.  When this film was made, almost 30 years ago, this was far-reaching stuff, real science fiction.  Now, with gene therapy, artificial tissues, experimental replacement organs both synthetic and organic, the opening of public debate about building sex robots and dating and even marrying automata, theGattacafuture of genetic options unfolding rapidly, these questions aren't farfetched fiction, they're contemporary.The music: Massive thanks to Vangelis for finally delivering ushis original sountrack.  It is a masterful rendering of the inspired work that helped make this movie the milestone that it is.  Yes, I'll go on record: I do enjoy the 1982New American Orchestra recordingthat came out in the 80s.  Despite what the purists say, these are satisfying symphony orchestra covers of Vangelis' unmistakable soundtrack originals, softened and de-electronified, somewhat more commercially accessible.If you've read Philip K. Dick's original novel, then you will know that this is the very basic story, but little else of that translates here.  If you love the movie, you might like the book, but be warned that Dick's writing style, while full of imagination and observations on issues of humanity in the face of scientific advancement--he wrote the originals that became Total Recall, Minority Report, and Paycheck, after all--can be, well, slow.If you love this film, you must read Paul Sammon's Future Noir.  It is the definitive saga of the making of this film, and is full of incredible trivia, like how Robert Mitchum was the original vision of Deckard, and how Dustin Hoffman interviewed/auditioned for the role for months.  Or the fact that in some of the cityscapes, old Star Wars Millennium Falcon models were used in the background.Bottom line: This is a classic, enduring American film, right up there with On the Waterfront, Taxi Driver, The Wizard of Oz, etc.  Its vision is breathtaking, and its single-minded attention to detail makes it come flawlessly together.  Whether or not you enjoy science fiction, this film will touch some part of you."	5.0	"A Modern Classic Asks, ""What is ""Human?"""	2010-08-19	3	2	1

Guess what, its still in the package and will never be opened in my house. The original Theatrical Release is the one and only Blade Runner.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2W53B0MT61VVX	Sir Truth	This movie just isn't the same with out Harrison Ford's hard-boiled narration. In my opinion that made this film's gritty Noir-Feel just that much better. Secondly, The ending is completely different, and completely  drab. What happened to one of the coolest endings with Harrion Ford saying,  &quot;I don't know how much time we have...but then again who does?&quot;  and he drives off in a beautiful serene view with Sean Young. Instead we  simply see Ford entering an elevator with Sean Young and slamming the  door...WEAK!  Save your money. This version isn't even worth renting.  Without the narration, this movie feels 3 hours long. The ending leaves you  feeling like...what? I'm not even going to mention the Unicorn. Ridley  Scott should be ashamed of himself to force this version out to the people.  The least the movie company could do was give you the option on the DVD to  see BOTH versions....now there's an idea.	1.0	No voice over. No cool ending. No options. No purchase.	2000-02-16	21	14	7

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A10GX907SGNOFW	Skotzenn	Blade Runner is a ground-breaking sci-fi noire thriller by director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Prometheus). The film features stunning visuals depicting a futuristic city-scape, along with moody synth music, which creates a great atmosphere. Good performances all around from the cast though the script can be dry at times and the plot slow. I watched this film as a stream on this site and the quality was a pixelated mess, I've seen clearer VHS tapes, hence the lower score. If you're interested in seeing this movie I recommend it in an HD format.	3.0	Interesting and gorgeous film, quality of the stream is poor.	2013-02-24	1	0	1

Of course, the film itself is as crisp and brilliant as it has always been.  Gaff's spookiness is still eerie, the musical score is still chilling, Sean Young is still the beautiful embodiment of a wistful Pinnochio and the final 'Tears in the Rain' moment between Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford remains the most eloquent expression of humanity since Shakespeare's Shylock first uttered &#34;Do we not bleed?&#34;	5.0	"well worth the cost to have all ""versions"" of the cuts in one set"	2014-02-06	1	1	0

Along with many of you, I saw it in the theaters as a kid and remember being overwhelmed with conflicting emotions.  On that day my world was changed forever.  What a tragic, tragic Promethean tale. It will stand as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century, and possibly beyond.  It is easily in the same pantheon as Metropolis and 2001.If I were to offer any minor short comings, of this set not the movie, it would have been nice for them to have added the soundtrack.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"After the fanfare surrounding the 2007 Director's Cut release of Blade Runner, I said to myself, ""How could I have never seen this film?"" So I put it in my Netflix queue on Blu Ray at the end of last year and was informed of ""a very long wait."" So I added it to my Amazon wish list after seeing some of my Friends here praise the movie as classic.But I never ultimately purchased the movie. There was just something...something not compelling. I changed my Netflix request from the Blu Ray version to the standard DVD version and still got the long wait message. So I left it that way and forgot about it. Lo and behold, Blade Runner arrived after almost a 90 day wait from the time I requested it.Why that long-winded story above? Because it should speak volumes about how great this film is, right? Well, not really. What Blade Runner is...is a 'cult' classic. Which means there are a ton of fanatics that will want to crucify me for this review that suggests Blade Runner is a good movie...not a classic movie.Sure I saw the 'visionary' aspect of the film. I saw the effects that were way ahead of their time. I saw the great package that was offered for this release...one that included 5-disks worth of material! But, color me shallow, I'm in it for the movie and its quality. Even the movies that I collect as classics 'in my book' are in my collection not because of hours of extras (in fact I rarely watch extras...maybe a making-of here or there *if* it promises to be short). I usually only *buy* a movie for my collection that blew me away. Getting blown away by a movie is the definition of a classic to me; a movie that had great 'vision' for its time to me is a movie that had great vision for its time...not a classic.Blade Runner was a good movie. One that had an interesting visionary approach. The story was very cool. ""Replicant"", genetically engineered humans are man-made to perform menial tasks on ""off-worlds"" that ultimately revolt in an I, Robot kind of way. But Blade Runner had an odd pace, the action was reined in over dark, futuristic images, and the film seemed just discombobulated at times.So I'll stop whining like a 4 year old now, and wrap this up by saying--again--Blade Runner was a *good* movie. But, man, you'd have to be a real die-hard to buy some 5-disk edition and watch not one, but three versions of this movie with hours and hours of extras.Okay fans, you have three words for me, right?...""Time to die""."	3.0	Quit Acting Like a 4 Year Old	2008-03-25	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3IRBGMGTLBSJE	"slk54 ""Mark"""	"In reference to ""Blade Runner"" I found this remark in one of the customer reviews:""The only part I liked was when Blondy was killing the guy""My god, is this getting very common or what?  I first thought the person didn't like the film because he/she was bored with the story because it didn't have a bunch of mindless action adventure scenes in it.  But, then I came across that sentence that I have been seeing time and time again in other articles dealing with older films.It used to be, just 20 year ago, that mainly only men were killing evil men.  There were very few evil women and except for the victims of horror films women very seldom died in movies.  Sometimes I think ""Blade Runner"" got away with the good guy gunning down women because they were regarded as machines, computers or replicants.  Because, one thing you very rarely see is a good guy gunning down an evil female.So, here we have someone stating that the only good part of this film is a woman gunning down a man.  Now why is it so wrong to have it the other way around?  Ever since the 1980's all of sudden women were killing the bad men but at the same time women organizations were complaining about the horror films showing women being murdered.Well, the movie might make more since and wouldn't be as boring to these people if they could see the original version.  In the original version Deckard and Blondie (Rachael) are heading off together and Deckard states that he didn't know how much time they would have together because Rachael had unlimited time.  I do not know what is so horrible about that ending but who really does?"	5.0	The Original Version is 5 Stars	2005-02-22	3	2	1

Loftin	"I have wanted to get the Blade Runner movie on disc for several years, but never got around to doing it until recently when I found the 5-disc blu ray set on Amazon for a good price.  My wife and I watched the Director's Final Cut first since it was the first disc in the series.  (She had never seen the movie.) Later on we watched the theatrical release version.  To tell the truth, I liked the original theatrical release version better.  While both are dark and depressing, the original version is less so than the Final Cut version.  Also a bit less violent.  Although I have always admired Blade Runner as being the first of the genre of dark, depressing, dystopian science fiction movies - that has spawned dozens of derivatives and imitators - in the intervening 30 years since its first release my taste for dark and depressing has lessened.  Frankly, the original version is more satisfying to me than the Director's version.  There are three more discs in the set that I haven't watched yet.  My wife isn't interested in the ""Making of the Movie"" features that come with many discs, so it will have to wait until I have some spare time.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A24HM3XDFVHXIK	"S_McCrea ""s_mccrea"""	"...all time.  And a good private eye story to boot.  Like Spenser, Deckard gets way too involved with a case (see the novel, ""A Savage Place"") and pays for it.Secondly, much was made about this movie giving ""hints"" that Deckard was a replicant.  The only one, and it's a slender one at that, is when Rachael asks him if he's ever taken the replicant diagnostic ""test.""  He avoids the question.  THAT's supposed to be the hint he's a replicant?  Perhaps the rumored (and I notice the rumors are a year old and no three disk set has appeared; of course Ridley Scott's been busy...) three disk set will shed more light on this.The influence of this film's look is most easily found in the ""Matrix"" triology.  Unfortunately, the Wachowski brother's homage was a little too slavish and it's easy to confuse some of the exterior shots because of this.  (Especially Neo's first meeting with Morpheus; tell me that the exterior of the building couldn't have been cut from the exteriors of the J.F. Sebastian character's apt. building!)Digression aside...I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in 1983, when I was twelve.  I remember it having a huge effect on me as a science fiction fan and a movie lover.I don't buy that the ""original"" release had a happy ending.  Neither the ""noir"" nor the Private Eye genres (much as they overlap) demands an ""unhappy"" ending.All the original ending did was show you what would have logically happened when Deckard and Rachael left his apt--they would have escaped!  To call the priginal ending the ""happy"" one and this one whose ending is the movie with them in the elevator is the ""properly"" sad one, is both purile and irrelevant.What do you think he would have done with her?  Taken her to Bryant?Two things that this movie left incomplete: the original completed the hint given by Deckard regarding Rachael's ""expiration"" date in this one (it's in the ""narration"" eliminated for this version by Scott).  When she inquired, he evaded the question with, ""That's classified.""  That's the ""big"" hint?The removal of the narration was also jarring.  I thought I had screwed up burning my archive copy (perfectly legal as we all know) and missed an audio subchannel.  Nope.It somehow feels like something's missing.  I think the movie should get a B+, but since we can't give letter grades or -/+'s, I'll still leave at four stars.The outdoor scenes are still spectacular.  If the scare about America ""turning Japanese"" (those of you who are dry behind the ears will get the song reference) so prominently displayed in both versions seems dated, that's because it is.  It's American culture and power that dominates, not Japanese.  So, Scott got that completely wrong.Also removed is Philip K. Dick's credit; the movie's based on his short novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.""  Very odd.  I remember the ""novelization"" has his name and the old title prominently displayed.But all the basic things that made this an sf classic are still there.  It's still beautiful, the character of Deckard is still compellingly drawn and Shawn Young is still meltingly goregous  (second film crush after Lt. Saavik!).  I couldn't help but simply stare at her face.The criticism of both the audio and video transfers is wildly exaggerated.  I viewed this on both my TV, even with 2.0 Audio  the VanGelis soundtrack sounds awe-inspiring.  The transfer is decent.  (If it looks good with a 64MB video card, it'll look good on your high end TV--which doesn't have the resolution of my monitor anyway.) It could have been a lot worse and it's a lot better than some transfers of movies that have come out a lot more recently.It's too bad the original version is no longer available.  I may have it on an old VHS tape somewhere (let the critics of the transfer watch that and see if they still complain!).  I hope so.  The comparison would be interesting.To reiterate, the criticisms expressed by the editorial reviewer and several fans are silly and little import.  The core story is intact and the narration really wasn't needed.  We just expect to hear it (especially those of us who watched it a gazillion times as a teenager on HBO), so the absence of it is, as I said, jarring.Whether a ""newbie"" to the film or your first time seeing it on DVD, this movie, it's star (and, to clear things up, Mr. Ford is a ""star"" not an actor) and director achieved something unique; whose influence has echoed thru sf and film for over twenty years now.If for no other reason, kind of like listening to Hendrix even if acid rock ain't your thing, you should watch it to understand how Scott changed sf films and cinematography in general.Pro: same great story, etcCons: lack of any commentaries or extras of any kindBig Con: as one fan already noted, there was no reason not to have made a ""flipper"" (since dual layers weren't available when DVD first appeared but I may be wrong about that) with the original on one side and the DC on the other.But those are gentle bitches.  It still takes your breath away and still leaves you uncomfortable with Scott's dystopic nightmare.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2LICSQ2IFE3C5	"SPM ""scott_maykrantz"""	The original Blade Runner was a big hit because it was the first modern-day depiction of cyberpunk on the screen. Although there were plenty of urban sci-fi movies that came before, none of them had this kind of atmosphere. It helped that Harrison Ford was the world's biggest movie star at the time, fresh from Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.But as the years went by, the film didn't hold up. The set design is still great --- the atmosphere is still there --- but the acting is weak and the story is dull. The actors talk too slow. When the action begins, the tone suddenly switches. The sci-fi melodrama becomes a bad martial arts flick (in the scene with Daryl Hannah's gymnastic fight). The final fight is better, but not much.When the director's cut came out, a few of the problems were solved. The most creative was turning a poorly-edited line about the number of replicants into a surprise ending --- Deckard is sent out after five replicants but he only finds four. Who is the fifth replicant? Take a guess.But the original problems remain. The movie is still too slow, with a poor use of good actors. The visuals can't make up for the weak plot. Looking back at it, this film deserves all the praise simply because it was such a stunning new approach to sci-fi when it was released.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1MTPO0O59D94O	S. Rosenbaum	"Though the 1982 theatrical release was very influential to me, when I first saw it, I prefer the 1992 Director's Cut for two reasons:1. The scene in the middle of the film, where Rachel asks Deckard about her incept date, and the question upsets him, makes no sense in relation to the tacked on happy ending of the 1982 version, but makes perfect  sense in light of how the Director's Cut ends.2. With the voice over narration gone, you can hear all of the Vangelis music.I just saw the new Final Cut at the Uptown in Washington, DC, and, though it's not much different from the Director's Cut, I think it's marginally the best version.  Among the subtle changes to the dialogue is one that fixes a continuity error existing in all the previous versions.  Regarding the six Replicants that escaped from Off-World, ""One of them got fried running though an electrical field"" is changed to ""Two of them got fried running through an electrical field.""  There's also a small but meaningful change, of a single word, in the scene where Roy confronts Tyrell."	5.0	Final Cut is marginally the best	2007-10-28	13	12	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1PPD5TOR6VVYV	S Smyth	In comparison to the original version, complete with Harrison Ford's voiceover, the Director's Cut doesn't really cut it. This is because the film is based on a book in which there is little in the way of the overt action required for a Hollywood blockbuster that would be competitive with the likes of Alien or Star Wars, and any deeper meaning is too obscure to be successfully conveyed in anything other than an art-house film.Only the spectacular cinematography and the highly accomplished integration of its soundtrack has saved Blade Runner from the oblivion that it would otherwise have enjoyed, as has been the case for subsequent films such as Event Horizon, which rely too heavily on SFX to bolster a thin story line more suited to an episode of the Twilight Zone.Blade Runner, in its Director's Cut guise, is simply an indulgence for nerds with the inclusion of the unicorn dream sequence to reinforce the idea that Deckard was an android - like I could give a Shatner. The so called `upbeat ending' of the original is insignificantly different except as an exercise to harmonise the look of the film. And the dropping of the voiceover makes the longer interior scenes drag, as do those in Michael Mann's, Manhunter.The original fails by virtue of the slack closing sequence in which Deckard and Batty race about through the upper floors of Sebastian's apartment building. This might have been reconciled by judicious editing, but as it is, in both the original and the Director's Cut, it saps the film of necessary momentum, and is slightly pretentious.My feeling is that the original with a few editing tweaks would have been altogether a better move than what the Director's Cut tries to achieve; the modifications employed and their justification offensive and condescending to those, like myself, who enjoyed the film when it first came out.Re-release the original, guys, and quit being so precious.( One for the nerds: compare the closing scene where Batty plucks Deckard from the steel beam with the scene from Star Trek's `What are little girls made of' in which the android plucks Kirk from the edge of the bottomless chasm. Uncannily similar - huh? ).	3.0	The original was better.	2001-06-13	11	6	5

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1ZHPLEOZMXAY5	Stalvern	"So, yeah, in case the review title didn't make it clear enough, I love this movie.  How can a collaboration between Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford, Vangelis, Syd Mead, and Douglas Trumbull not be awesome?  The casting, acting, screenplay, music, and visual effects - especially the visual effects - are beyond compare in every way, and the atmosphere is miles ahead of anything else.That said, of the seven (!) official edits of the movie, none of them truly do it justice.  The Workprint has great pacing and some plot-critical lines (""Hello, Roy,"" and ""Pris or Zhora."") that are missing from other versions, but is rather noticeably unfinished.  The Final Cut has the advantage of complete digital restoration and some goof correction, but it moves too quickly (yes, I said too quickly - watch the Workprint if you want to see heavy, deliberate pacing done right) and has Scott's awful, revisionist, mood-killing ""unicorn dream"".  The less said about the theatrical version, the better.Thankfully, though, it's now possible to experience the strengths of all of these versions, and more, in crystal-clear HD resolution, along with loads of extra features and some great packaging.  (And, if you have the means, you can edit together your own cut with your favorite elements from each.)  After more than 25 years, Blade Runner has finally gotten the treatment that it deserves - and, believe me, it deserves quite a lot.  What are you waiting for?  BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!(By the way, this movie is NOT cyberpunk.  People who call it cyberpunk don't know what cyberpunk actually is.  Also, the replicants are synthetic humans, not robots.  It's like the difference between Number Six and Data.)"	5.0	The greatest science fiction movie ever finally gets its due!	2010-05-29	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM	Stanley Crowe	"Ridley Scott's moody dystopian epic has achieved ""cult classic"" status, and one can see how it would appeal to the special effects nerds -- not just because special effects are strikingly employed to visual ends in the movie but because the movie is ABOUT the special effects called ""replicants"" who have been created to do dirty work on the ""off world"" plantations for a major corporation and have now come home, not to roost but to raise some mayhem as they have come to realize the nature and extent of their programing.  So . . . this is a movie about a slave revolt, in a way (""Four Years a Slave,"" given the pre-programmed lives of the replicants) and about ""real"" people being forced to realize that the replicants are more ""human"" than they were intended to be.  They had been designed to be without feelings, but the movie shows that in their genetically programmed embodiments, they DO have feelings and they do have self-consciousness.  One assumes that the possession of a body and the experience in space-time in an embodied state is going to instantiate in such creatures the characteristics that we would call human.  And to drive that point home, it's the human characters who seem most affectless and soulless.Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a ""blade runner,"" or cop whose particular mission is to destroy rogue replicants, and he's very good at it -- a kind of killing machine, as his boss says.  I notice that some critics and reviewers assume that Deckard is himself a replicant, although he doesn't know it, but I don't think that makes thematic sense -- it seems better to consider him a soul-less human who learns to regain some of his humanity from his interactions with self-conscious replicants like Rachel (Sean Young) and Batty (Rutger Hauer).  That fine irony would be lost if Deckard himself is a replicant.  The movie's story is about how he tracks down and wipes out the group who have returned, mainly it seems with the motive of getting themselves humanized by further genetic tampering, but who are willing and able to use violence when threatened.  All of this takes place in a vividly imagined futuristic urban setting, with extremes of elegance and grime that have become familiar in movies as a visual style partly in response to the power of Scott's images here (think of Gotham City in the Batman movies).  So there are chases and fights -- and it is in the treatment of that action that the movie drags a bit, although not too damagingly -- the whole thing comes in just under two hours.The real power of the movie is its emotional force.  Apparently a lot of trouble was gone to in order to cast Deckard, and Harrison Ford does a fine job -- but the character isn't all that interesting or fully written.  The real stars are Rutger Hauer and Sean Young as the replicants with feelings and acute self-consciousness.  Hauer is marvelous, whether in full-out action anti-hero mode or in his more reflective moments.  He has two very powerful scenes -- one where he meets his maker (which I won't spoil for you), and one where he mourns the death of a replicant played by Daryl Hannah.  His own death scene is visually and emotionally powerful, as he has come to the end of his four year span just as he is being confronted by Deckard.  After a chase, during which he is getting the better of Deckard, his last act is to save the man who has been trying to kill him.  In his final speech he calls himself a slave, and as he dies he's like a puppet whose strings have been cut -- all of this on high rooftops in the rain, and quite spectacularly filmed.  Sean Young's character. Rachel, has been differently programmed -- for service in this world and not on some planet -- and physical violence seems not to be in her mix, so her melancholy expresses itself more in a desire for human connection, which, by the end of the movie, Deckard has become able to provide -- though what the temporal extent of their future together is, who knows?  There's a similarity here of course to the Frankenstein story -- the embodied creation of technology who wants to be human and who gains our sympathy more than the human characters do.  So in some ways, it's an old story, but it still has power."	4.0	a good movie, though a bit sluggish in places	2014-02-26	0	0	0

But, in my opinion, the 1982 version is better. The reason is that the narrator's voice (which comes out noticeably more convincing in the french version) adds a humanistic/literary/philosophical flavor to a wagnerian epic portraying a crushing and hopeless world, where the distinction between humans and humanoids has become blurred. Then images and words and music miraculously coalesce to create a stunning, operatic filmic experience, culminating in this crucial realization : the preciousness and undestructibility of individual (human/post-human?) consciousness.Regards,Stefano Manghi	3.0	balde runner original version	2002-05-17	6	6	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A10C5CJK1YKGV0	Steffan Piper	"Having seen this movie probably more time and in more different formats than most people, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of filmmaking. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for almost 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. That makes 5, but 6 if you count the Workprint version that comes with this box set. So, I would say that's one more than most.Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that `Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary `Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into filmmaking. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists.On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Movies like `The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. The novel almost reads like the narration and in latter years I find impossible to not hear Harrison Ford's voice as I read `The Big Sleep'.""Do you like my owl?""""Is it artificial?"""	5.0	More Human than Human, that's our motto ...	2007-12-26	11	10	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2R7UAKJ6OXBNY	stephen d huffman	The original Matrix was perhaps the finest science fiction movie made to date.  That is what makes the Director's cut so disappointing.  Although the changes were actually few - there is no narrative from Harrison Ford and the ending changes - it changes the whole picture.The director had done a superb job in creating his future world - it was dark, drear, and gave us a real feeling of hopelessness.  But the producers knew what they were doing, obviously, when they insisted on making a few subtle changes before releasing the original movie.The original was dark and pessimistic, but in the end, there was hope - not a storybook ending, but hope.NOrmally you get extra material in the director's cut.  Never have I been so disappointed in a movie as when I ordered the DVD widescreen version and got the Director's Cut and watched it.  I sent it back.  Those few changes turned what I thought was the greatest science fiction movie made into a bad movie.  Sure, the visuals were great - Ford and Hauer were excellent, as well as the rest of the cast, but too much was missing.Pass on this and wait for the original version to be re-released.Steve in Alexandria	1.0	Why can't I get the original version?	2001-07-13	5	2	3

Blade Runner is no exception. However as another reviewer had stated ""I thought is was a classic back in 1982"", I would strongly agree. The updated 25th version production crew did an excellent job regarding  correcting the flaws, but it is a totally different film than the original 1982 version. This is my list of complaints: 1) The digital scanned print made the 25th version look synthetic and digital not analog, 2) The colors were very saturated (1982 film stock does not look this way), 3) The interview production footage did not fit with the mood of the original film. It had a boring set design and to much emphasis was put on the cast and production crew members talking. I would have prefered voice overs with stills and actual production footage. Every extra on every DVD produced that I've seen uses the same interview format. Very unoriginal. The extra items in the case like the Spinner model, the Origami unicorn etc. were cheap and not worth the wait. I would have prefered a solid production book with quality stills of never before published production images. I think that what makes something a classic is the human component and ""flaws"" within the subject or object. The original should have been left alone.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS	Stephen M. Lerch	Blade Runner is a phenomenal Sci-Fi movie that has now gotten a definitive release and an HD upgrade, both of which the film sorely deserves.The movie follows Rick Deckard in a mostly one man fight against 4 escaped Replicants. It's not heavy on action, but it has enough to keep you waiting; it's actually the deeper story line that really keeps your eyes glued and your ears open.Is Rick a replicant, or isn't he? Watch the Final Cut and you should know without anyone holding your hand.The video transfer here is nothing short of astounding. Video is encoded using VC-1 and is 1080p as all Blu Ray releases should be.The part that will make your jaw drop is just how cleaned up and polished the video is. You'd be hard pressed to tell they superimposed Joanna Cassidy's current face over the poorly disguised stunt double who fell through the glass window. There are no blemishes on the movie and the amount of detail they were able to pull from the film source is phenomenal. As far as video is concerned, I think you would have issue finding anything to fault with this release.In terms of audio, you can't beat this release. Gone are the days of drowned out voices and low volume levels. Everything has been corrected and voices are now at the proper levels to not be lost in the sounds and music; in fact you can hear some background noises/voices without needing bionic ears or the volume up to max. There is no hissing, no whine; nothing is wrong with this audio. It sounds amazing. Deep bass (when needed) and absolutely flawless audio.The best part about this release is that it includes EVERY version of the movie ever made; and to top it off, they have ALL been restored and presented in full HD. The work print is a little iffier as to how much they cleaned it up, but according to the producers this was because they had a less than stellar master print to work from. The audio on all have been restored. Only the Final Cut uses DTS-HD for compressing the audio; the other releases are all Dolby Digital 5.1, however they aren't just simple rehashes of the original DVD release, they are instead completely restored and set to proper levels.The only issue here is with the extras. The extras are still in standard definition. It's not that big of a deal as they are at least animorphically encoded (so they are full screen on HD TVs). It should also be noted that the extras discs are also DVDs, not Blu Ray discs. All of the movie discs are Blu-Ray however.And the extras are ridiculously long. Even a true fan will struggle with watching all of the extras included here, though every one of them is well worth spending the time to watch if you are even remotely interested in the film.Warner Brothers and Ridley Scott have done justice to this film like never before.

The nexus replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them.Replicants were used off-world as slave labor on the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets.  After a bloody mutiny by a nexus combat team in an off-world colony, replicants were declared illegal on Earth-under penalty of death.Special police squads-Blade Runner units-had orders to shoot to kill upon detection, any trespassing replicant.This was not called execution.  It was called retirement.""These are the actual printed words that begin this classic science fiction movie (based on the 1968 novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip K. Dick).The plot of this movie is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a policeman or ""blade runner"" of Los Angeles (in the year 2019) who's after four criminal ""replicants"" named Roy Batty (Rutger Haur), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Leon (Brion James).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).Unlike ""The Director's Cut"" version of this movie, this original version has Deckard's voice-over narration.  I found this voice-over especially emotionally appealing when the Roy Batty replicant ""dies"" at the end of the movie.I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important for this movie:(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action.  (A friend of mine who watched ""The Director's Cut"" with me and who did not see the original release with Deckard's voice-over could not follow the story!!)(2) It provides the human touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually stunning special effects.(3) It adds a ""retro"" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies.The ending, unlike ""The Director's Cut,"" was not abrupt.  This ending gave a feeling of hope that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.All the acting in this movie is first-rate.  Special mention should go to Harrison Ford who as the blade runner Rick Deckard carries the movie and to Rutger Haur as the leader of the replicants, Roy Batty.  Also, Sean Young does a super job portraying the more sophisticated replicant, Rachael.The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music by Vangelis are fantastic and exhilarating.The only problem is that this original version of this movie is not available on DVD (as of the date of this review).  This is truly unfortunate.  (""The Director's Cut"" is available on DVD.)BOTTOM LINE:With its voice-over narration, this is a magnificent and classic science fiction movie with emotional impact.  It's easy to see why this movie won the L.A. Film Critics Award and three British Academy Awards.(1982;  2 hr;  fullscreen)+++++"	5.0	The Original Release of this Movie is BEST!!!	2005-08-09	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1WY90DNK3KWJA	Stephen R. Thompson	"I was always amazed that the studios didn't issue a remastered version of Blade Runner with all of the extras at the same time that the Matrix came out on DVD.  Alas, it has finally arrived!  I've always been a HUGE fan of Blade Runner and I loved the Director's Cut that excluded the voice over.  I must say, however, that after reading some of the other reviews, I now fully understand why many might like the voice over.  The great thing about this release is that it includes both, so everyone should be happy.  I'm going to assume you are intimately familiar with the plot and move on to my review of this particular 4 disk release of Blade Runner.The documentaries on the second and fourth disk are absolutely fabulous.  All of the cast members who are still alive are interviewed at length, as well as some who tried out for the roles of Rachel and Pris.  For those of you who are big fans of the movie and have been waiting for the story behind the movie, all of your questions are answered, and then some.The fourth disk goes into details surrounding the cinematography and lighting, as well as a brief biography of Philip K. Dick which is revealing.  It covers the topics of cinematography and lighting in a way that are interesting to the lay audience (like me), but I imagine it could be quite academic for someone in the film industry who wants to understand how it was done before the days of CGI.  One of the young film makers interviewed said that he watches Blade Runner often, just to try and figure out how Ridley did the lighting, or got a certain cinematic effect, or what focal length a certain shot was made, etc.The only problem I have is one of personal preference regarding an important change in dialogue in the Final Director's Cut in one particular scene.  What follows in the rest of this paragraph is a spoiler, so please skip this paragraph if you want all changes in the new version to be a surprise.  A key line near the end of the film between Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Tyrell (Joe Turkell), his ""maker,"" is changed in a way that I think dramatically changes the overall emotional impact of the film.  In the original, Tyrell asks Roy, ""What can he (your maker) do for you?"", and Roy responds, ""I want more life, f_ _ _ _ _!"" (insert expletive) In the new Final Director's Cut version, he says, ""I want more life, father.""  If you're only a casual fan, this probably won't bother you. In fact, you probably won't even notice it. But for those die-hard fans like me, it will come as a big shock.While I really appreciated some of the other subtle changes, such as fixing the scene where Zora crashes through the glass - which now actually looks like Zora (Joanna Cassidy) and not her stunt double with a cheap wig, or how at the end of the movie Roy's pigeon no longer flies away into a blue sky - this change in dialog between Roy Batty and Tyrell is not in keeping with the mood and direction of the film in my opinion and I really question why Ridley Scott would make this change.  The original dialog was much edgier and much more in keeping with the original, dark nature of the film.  This new line seems like it would appeal to a ""kinder/gentler"" Blade Runner fan, which isn't me.In spite of this one issue pertaining to the single line of dialogue between Roy Batty and Tyrell (strictly in my own opinion), I highly recommend this 4 disk release of Blade Runner for the absolutely fantastic interviews and documentaries, as well as the multiple versions of the film."	4.0	Fantastic Value, but...	2008-01-04	2	2	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	Much discussion of this historic and precedent setting film has already been written so I see no need for providing yet another summary or my opinions on performances, meanings etc, so, as I always do, I will focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.VIDEO&#8230;..The video transfer in my opinion is just excellent.  That Ridley Scott, the director, in a short 'extra' says that he supervised the remastering and reediting is good enough for me to settle on this 'final' version.  The Blu Ray was very clean for a film this old with no noticeable grain, artifacting or banding anywhere that I could see.  The color grading comes in as being very warm and, in parts, golden.  Much of the film takes place in dark surroundings yet details can easily be seen and even raindrops do not come as a blur but as individual drops.  I have no doubt that this final transfer was completely remastered and we reap the imaging reward.AUDIO&#8230;.The audio is a lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 that I wish were a 7.1 mix but I can't complain.  The re editing of the audio is absolutely excellent with a plethora of discreet directionality to all the surrounds on a very frequent basis.  Your LFE channel will get its share of work to do as well.  There are a number of rear stage to front stage and visa versa audio pans, the audio of rain fx will fully immerse you and other foley fx are plentiful enough.  They really did a great job on re mixing the audio for the home theater enthusiast.EXTRAS&#8230;Aside from the 37 second introduction to the film by Ridley Scott, the only other extras are a number of commentaries which I have not listened to as yet.Blade Runner: The Final Cut is definitely worthy of being in your collection and many parts are of the film are totally demo worthy as well for showing off your theater system.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.  All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.	5.0	Blade Runner-The Final Cut on Blu Ray	2013-12-24	6	5	1

The surround sound wasn't overdone and the effects were amazing.  It was great to see this again with these improvements.  I must say though, that I was disappointed with the version however.  The director, Ridley Scott chose to edit some scenes out and add others, so this was NOT the original theatrical release that I remembered so well and so fondly.  Although Scott claims on the Blu-Ray that this is his favorite version, I don't really care--I wanted the version I saw at the theater.  Perhaps I should have done more careful research to see if there is a re-mastered Blu-Ray of the original version before purchasing this version.	4.0	Wonderful Re-master, but not the Theatrical Version	2014-01-07	0	0	0

Attempts to make the film more artistically  and aesthetically pleasing by the exclusion of the &quot;Sam Spade&quot;  narrative results in the viewer wondering what is going on in a number  scenes.

The Director's cut isn't that substantially different from the theater release version. I didn't need the voice over but then again I saw the original  version and understood what was going on. This DVD would benefit by having  both versions available. The unicorn symbolism I didn't understand either.  This DVD is worth it only if you have seen it, like it and want it in DVD  format. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

It has been written and described that Harrison and the Director in particular disliked the narrated version.  I for one like that aspect in the right movies (see also Cannery Row or Last Man Standing) as it gives an added input to our viewing senses.  In Blade Runner the non-narrated versions It seems to me that there is not enough sound or dialogue to compensate for the lack of narration, or to support the story without the narration.  Who knows, I could have the opposite opinion had I seen the non-narrated version first.	3.0	One Vote for the Narrated Version	2013-06-25	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AVBVU5LKQCU06	Steven J Newman	Bear with me, this anecdote is relevant to the poor quality of this dvd. I admit it, I am a Blade Runner Geek. I have the original cut on laser disk. I saw the director's cut the second it hit the theatre years ago in a new state-of-the-art Sony theater in NYC. The projection booth was fully &quot;automated&quot; and it began rolling the film with audio only, the screen was totally black. Finally after 5 excruciating minutes, the picture belatedly came on and the theatre manager thought he could just keep the movie rolling  until a near-riot started in the theatre. This was a Blade Runner audience. We demanded to start again from the beginning, we weren't going to be deprived of seeing a pristine print of the breathtaking opening sequence. The manager explained to the angry crowd that he couldn't just back up the projector, that it would require the time-consuming chore of removing the reel and rewinding it on a bench and the mob shouted:&quot;do it now, we don't care how long it takes.&quot; And the contrite manager eventually started the film from the beginning 20 minutes later.Well, Warner Bros. has done a similarly bad job of presenting B.R. on dvd. Right from the first 5 seconds, squinting at aliasing blurred titles, it looks as though you're watching a vhs tape that has been rented 100 times rather than a brand new dvd of a restored film. Oddly, the letterbox doesn't fully extend to the left and right edge of the tv screen. A smallish rectangle view floats in the middle of the screen with ragged pulsing edges. Unable to stomach watching the whole movie looking like this I scanned ahead to see a poorly transferred picture complete with dust and even a curly hair making a guest appearance! Like that hapless theatre manager, Warner Studios has made a big mistake underestimating the Blade Runner audience--we demand a refund and a re-release done right!	1.0	VHS quality on a DVD.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A17639YIJLDS1G	still searching	There's not a lot else to say about this film that hasn't yet been said I imagine; but, hey ho!  Scott interpreted Dick's dystopian view of the future to produce, what at the time of first release, in 1982, must have seemed an astonishing view of what life might look like in 2019.  Now we are only a few years away it's hard to decide how accurate that vision was.  The action is set in the Los Angeles of the time and it rains a lot; so, from a meteorological viewpoint, I guess not very accurate!  Scott's 2019 L.A. looks a bit more like I might imagine a future New York to look or, perhaps, Chicago which, in some respects, it almost does.  But wherever, it still looks amazing visually echoing as it does the look of Fritz Lang's seminal `Metropolis': in terms of production design, Len Wiseman's Philip K. Dick adaptation, Total Recall, released only in 2012, seems hardly to have moved anything on.The casting is near perfect: M. Emmet Walsh brings a noirish feel to sleazy police captain Bryant and even though, incredibly, the film's screenwriter, Hampton Fancher, is reputed to have `seen' a 75 year old Robert Mitchum in the lead role, Harrison Ford is a perfect fit and gives a suitably laconic `Mitchum-like' performance as world weary cop Dekard.  Rutger Hauer as the ultra-violent but oddly sympathetic super Nexus-6 Replicant `boss' Roy Batty, also, seemed perfect casting and the beautiful Sean Young (whatever happened to her?) captures the insecurity and fragility of the `is she or isn't she a' Replicant, Rachael.Strange to think that a film which in 1982 didn't go down to well with the film going public is now commonly and quite rightly regarded as a cinematic masterpiece.	5.0	SiFi masterpiece!	2013-10-25	2	2	0

I was expecting a late 70s Alien or Arnold movie or a Tom Cruise Minority Report like movie. Nothing like those. It was boring. Harrison Ford narrates it like he is lying in bed while reading it. He seems disinterested. The plot really doesn't make much sense. The Replicants are supposed to be scary and yet intimidating in what-will-they-do-next moves. They just come across as Studio 54 weirdos. There really is no meaning to this movie that I can tell. Umm . . . the ending made no sense. And actually the beginning made no sense.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2F6IIBONO2V48	strangeitude	This is a review of the Final Cut, not the movie itself, which everyone knows is great.I am very glad that the producers did their job to restore, clean and enhance the video and sound quality, only for this, this DVD is a must to longtime Blade Runner fans, it does not matter at all if you own the previous DVD of the Director's Cut because at once the Final Cut begins you know you spent your money right. It's almost like the film was done last year in digital, it's amazing! The contrast between bright and dark is greater, and the picture quality and resolution is far better than in the original Director's Cut VHS and DVD. Moreover, the soundtrack sounds better than my Blade Runner original CD, it has great depth and you can listen clearer the twiks, beeps and sounds of the future. So, if you are hesitanting because you already own the Director's Cut DVD, my recomendation is: get the Final Cut now!About the other differences between the Director's and Final Cut: they are essentially the same film, Riddley Scott simply perfected the Director's Cut (which was rushed in 1992 because the Workprint version leaked as Scott's 'true' vision): Some minor CGI adjustments in the fantastic 2019 LA cityscape; Zhora's death scene is improved, now you can really tell is Zhora who is shot, not just some stunt woman; the unicorn sequence is slightly longer and trippier; Tyrell's death is blodier (and in general the movie is more violent, just like the International version); some additional shots of LA streets and dialogue; finally, the only CGI 'major' addition is the dove flying at the end towards the 2019 LA polluted skies.In a nutshell, this is Blade Runner as it should be, and how it was meant to be: perfect image quality and excellent sound quality. I really do not care now for the theatrical version (yes, I saw it first of all versions, many years ago and I did like it) with that unnecesary voiceover that ruins the music soundtrack in some parts - an essential aspect of the film, you see, I love the music; I saw the workprint a while ago and it is just an unfinished version, nothing less, nothing more. So if you are budget minded, can live without the other versions and some featurettes and simply love this movie, go for this Final Cut (and also there's an excellent 3 plus hour documental and three audio commentaries from Scott's and company that should more than satisfy your Blade Runner hunger!).	5.0	Awesome video and sound quality	2007-12-27	10	10	0

Dick's 'Do Andriods Dream of  Electric Sheep,' it is a story of a burnt out Bladerunner (special units  that track down and 'retire' rouge android/replicants) on the pursuit of  renegade replicants. as noted by many reviewers, this is a detective movie  -- a futuristic film noir.made in 1982 the look of this film still  impresses. set in the near future (latter 21st century) against a teeming,  oppressive, dark and ultra-urban Los Angeles, there is a real sense of a  believable world -- everything from the costumes to the shots of the city,  to even the advertisements are consistant.after all these years, the  special effects in this film are still good simply because Ridley Scott  didn't relied heavily on it. ultimately, and especially in the Director's  Cut version, the film centers around the internal issue concerning the  separation of man and machine (yeah, corny i know but it works here) and  challenging the validity of one's perception.i think all fans of science  fiction will easily enjoy this film but i also believe that many movie fans  will enjoy not only the story but the wonderful atmosphere of this film as  well.	4.0	... it's called retirement.	2000-08-13	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1PSFXEFA5TQ4V	SveXo	Riddly Scott is one of the best director of all time. He has made Some of the best films to grace movie screens. His attention to quality and detail is unsurpassed. Blade Runner is no different. This movie is an incredible glimpse into what would be our future. This updated version of the movie adds to what was already a visually magnificent movie. The story however is lacking, but thats okay because this is a flick not a drama. The acting and dialog  are both pretty good, but not amazing. Over all, it is easy to see why this film has earned suck a cult following, and is much diserving of it. The best part of this movie is its tremendous and extraordinary view of the future, as well as its is exploration into what makes us human.The 5-disk set includes every version of the film that was released. Ever. It is also packed with extra feature that are a must have for any Blade Runner fan. This is a VERY good deal and if you are even remotely interested in this movie I would recommend picking it up.	4.0	A Classic	2008-03-03	0	0	0

Ridley Scott, a former commercial director, finally got his chance to make movie history.  This film is the very first, the ultimate classic in the cyberpunk genre.  Needless to say, when this was made it was YEARS ahead of its time.  They had no access to real computer graphics back when this was made.  It is almost all done with light, shadow, and amazing photography effects.  And, strangely enough, that is why this film remains impressive - because most of the effects are natural and real, instead of being some kind of computer rendering.This was a cult favorite in America.  However, this film exploded when it hit the international market, becoming an absolute smash hit in Japan.  The influence of the American film, ""Blade Runner"" can be seen in countless Japanese films and animations.  So that, one could say that Ridley Scott gave birth not only to a great film and a new genre, but also to hundreds of Japanese animes inspired directly from ""Blade Runner.""  One need only look at something like ""Ghost In The Shell 2"" to see the direct inspiration.The most important and memorable thing about ""Blade Runner"" is the lush mood and atmosphere generated by the superb production crew.  The soundtrack from Vangelis also draws you into this deep work of art.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AJWZNBYZOLF3P	Tab L. Uno (tabuno@slc.quik.com)	Bladerunner, a highwater mark in science fiction film making, is updated by the director in this Director's Cut version with the elimination of the narration, the inclusion of the unicorn scene and deletion of the final scenes of the original version's ending.  Brilliant as well as controversial from its opening premiere, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; by director Ridley Scott who had only just come off of directing &quot;Alien&quot; folded the science fiction elements into a 50's detective film noir.  A minority of critics and audience members truly believed in the shadowy elements of darkness and the emphasis on detective work.  With the elimination of the narration (even though Harrison Ford apparently hated it himself and attempted to produce an awful narration), for me and a few others, the narration is a key component of what made this movie so unique in its combination of film elements.  Thus while this movie has become a cult classic, the Director's Cut without the na! rration apparently for a few of us diminishes somewhat what is truly one of the best science fiction movies made.  Also, the upbeat ending of the original American version, shouldn't be panned as overly mainstream or completely optimistic.  It's reference to the vague length of life of a replicant keeps the storyline intriguing because it only adds to the uncertainty of one's relationship with one another and uncertainty about the future.  However, all this is much better described in Paul M. Sammon's excellent reference guide entitled, &quot;Future Noir The Making of Blade Runner&quot; (1996).

I couldn't stand the 'Director's Cut' version of this wonderful movie, and I was quite angry that they didn't include the original version on the DVD when it was originally released.  Now we can finally see the film in it's original.  Mr. Emerson doesn't like Harrison Ford's voice over, but to me it added just the right touch of 'world-weary gumshoe detective' to the film.  That odd contrast of old-fashioned detective story with futuristic vision and spectacular music by Vangelis is what makes me love this movie so much.  Shame also on Vangelis for releasing the movie 'soundtrack' without including my favorite piece of music from the film - ""Prologue and Main Titles""."	5.0	Finally!	2007-10-25	21	15	6
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1AFXDFPOF3E0A	Taimur Mustafa	A splendid film: Powerful, hypnotic and transcending both the Noir and Sci Fi genres.  The visuals and the score by Vangelis are powerful, intense and sublime.  The opening scene depicting a dark, futuristic and decadent vista of LA in 2019 is expecially strong, and this effect lingers upon subsequent viewings. The title score resonates through my being as if acquiring a tangible presence, and could almost be sniffed or tasted. Aesthetics aside, the central theme in this film, and to a lessor extent Philip K Dick's &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;, is what defines human? The replicants in the film are treated like mere machinery, yet express a greater humanity than any &quot;human&quot; characters.

True eye candy in every sense of the word. And of course the story and acting is top notch; I found myself feeling like I rediscovered an old friend; It is so much fun to see so many talented people in here, many very early in their careers. The dialog and story are just as strong as they have ever been, and it was nothing less that a pure joy to see this movie done up the way it should be. I haven't watched all the different versions, but I will. Tons of great extras for the obsessive fan, too.This movie still packs a punch. Just brilliant across the board.

One screenwriter brought up an excellent point, that we've all heard the narration before, so our mind automatically fills in the blanks when we watch the movie without it. If it had never been present in the theatrical version, Blade Runner's opening would be boring, slow, and confusing to a great many patrons.For that reason, I prefer the Theatrical Version to the Director's Cut, just marginally, though both are pretty good.	3.0	Director's Cut - Good and Bad	2004-05-06	1	1	0

I first saw this movie with my father when I was 8 years old and was mesmerized by the visuals and story. Ridley Scott is a genius and visionary. I couldn't tell you how thrilled I was when I finally saw it on hi-definition. My jaw just dropped with every detail and sound. The blu-ray set had all versions of the movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A26517LL93VX07	T. C. Willson	If you want more dialog and more spacey visual effects, then this directors cuts, including the final cut, might be better than the original.  What you lose is a lot of the film-noir voice over and therefore the momentum and chameleon like nature of the original.  In this version the first half of the film is more like the second half of the original where it becomes about the applicants and their struggle for life an meaning, and not about a down on his luck retired blade runner / private eye.But I remember the noir opening and costuming as an effective counterpoint to the rest of the film.  I didn't think it was false - I thought it was more of a red herring.  You mind assumes this is going to be about bending the law, resisting the fem fatale, surviving and ultimately foiling the bag guys, and getting the girl - at least temporarily.  But then you find out that that pattern only partially applies, which I thought was kind of cool and transformational in the original.OTOH, if you see it for the 2nd, 3rd, etc time, you know the Noir voice over at the beginning is about where the character starts, his initial way of thinking and you know it isn't where he is going to end. It might seem a little gratuitous whereas the Directors and Final Cut versions don't put as much Noir spin on the character or the film so you have more time to reflect on the action as it actually unfolds, not as it either fits or breaks from the Film Noir mold.I have to agree with the reviewer that says you should own both versions.  I bought this primarily to introduce my children to the classic.  I probably should have bought the theatrical release for that (first time viewing) because without knowing where the movie is going, this version is a very slow developer and just ins't grabbing their interest.  I like it, but even I want to see the other version to make direct comparisons.	4.0	May not be better than the Theatrical version	2014-03-06	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1H8KSZZSSBETX	T. Dennis	First of all, I had to order this five disc version on Blu-ray from the abroad because Warner decided that ole Blighty need only have the five disc version on ordinary DVD. So criminally I bought this version from the U.S of A for less than the 2 disc Blu-ray version in England including delivery, No it didin't make sense to me either.Now the review, I have to say they have done a superb job on remastering the picture and the audio on the final cut. Ridley's vision is there on screen sharp and so detailed and through uncompressed PCM, wow does the whole soundscape hit you, especially Vangelis's electrifying score.Why only four out of five? Well, I was disapointed the two of the discs were ordinary dvd's, although both documentary / extra discs, I would have loved to seen them in hi def, especially the Dangerous Days doc, OK so it ran for three and a half hours but so does Kingdom of Heaven and it doesn't need to be the best compression rate ever.Besides from that all I can say is if you love Bladerunner, you already have bought it.if you like Bladerunner, then buy it and if you have never seen it then this is a grand place to start.Oh and if you don't like Bladerunner, then why are you reading this?	4.0	This IS Bladerunner as Ridley wanted it	2008-01-14	1	1	0

There have been some enhancements to the visuals but they fit right in to the original. That says a lot about the 1982 classic...you can add CGI and it fits perfectly.I argue that this is Harrison Ford's best role (yes geeks, I know he was Han Solo and Indiana Jones). His acting is great and he plays this kind of futuristic film noir detective/assassin perfectly.There is very little change to the story in this version from the directors cut but there are a couple dialog changes and a few extended shots.  All in all, this version is pretty much the same as the directors cut but with much better visuals.  The Tyrel Building looks absolutely amazing as the cars fly by.  It is noticeable and anyone who is a fan of this movie will notice it immediately.I don't buy a lot of Blue Rays, but this is one that belongs in any movie lover's collection.	5.0	An absolutely beautiful piece of Sci-Fi decades ahead of its time	2013-06-01	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT	"technoguy ""jack"""	"Blade Runner:Final Cut has seen Ridley Scott ditch the voice-over narrative by Ford and up-beat happy ending and added a dream sequence of Deckard's of a unicorn,thus proving he's a replicant too.The film adapted from Philip K Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a cult classic.In Dick's work on which this film is based, is an obsession with the blurring of reality, dreams and waking confused together, mechanical replicas indistinguishable from their originals,what is humanity?This hard-boiled SF noir set in a dystopian future with an impoverished nature and looming towers,balls of flame in the skies.The drifting ex-cop Deckard(Ford) is pulled back into the loop of bounty-hunting replicants,who have illegally returned from outer planets,where they are slaves,to find the secret to a longer life on earth.Dramatic action has replaced overt philosophising to good effect.Four androids are at large and Deckard must hunt them down.The ways they are tested is by answering a series of questions,the answers to which show whether they have humanity.Although they failed the test,their behaviour is empathetic.Deckard finds enough life and humanity in these entities to stimulate his own sense of empathy.Deckard discovers not unfeeling robots he supposed them to be,but creatures in search of warmth,affection and personal ties he and his fellow natural beings are losing. Boundaries blur from sociopathy to empathy,and humans increasingly lose their souls in dealing out death and destruction or in materialistic pursuits.The dehumanising effects of technology on human life are latent.Androids become more `life-like' over time,humans more robotic to meet society's needs.Androids' intelligence surpasses humans,what about their rights?Are androids entitled to share our life,are we grateful for our life?Can't androids dream of electric sheep?The Tyrell Corporation can do nothing to help,it has even programmed `memories' of childhood years,which is shown to deceive Rachel(Young)into thinking she is human.When Deckard forms an attachment to her (she also saves his life),he is forced to rethink what it is to be human and to be mortal.Although Deckard loves Rachel he is intent, while saving her, to kill all the other replicants.The human story,though somewhat subdued and thin,is overshadowed by the extraordinary sets and special effects,which are amazing.Are humans without emotions more valuable than machines with?Rutger Hauer's Roy gives a soliloquy prior to his own death (and after saving Deckard's life),about a replicant's dilemma:""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""This is a thoroughly moving speech by a time-fixed replicant aware of mortality who has transfixed Deckard with his emotions and desire to have him as witness.The rain-soaked ,decaying Los Angeles of 2019 is vividly realized. The film addresses the psychological aspects of the future,not the CGI effects,not the action,but the everyday lives of ordinary people under horrendous conditions.The slower rhythmns and pace of things brings this out.I believe the Final Cut is the best version, the one intended by the director and should be the one we settle down with,as it bypasses the studio's sabotage through fear of what the director intended.Ignore the 'directors' version.He had no hand in it."	5.0	On the humanity of  androids	2010-11-09	1	1	0

Yet I had no problem what so ever understanding  the movie minus the &quot;voice over narration.&quot; The truth is after 5  minutes I found myself fully emersed in the futuristic inuendo, and  automatically linked with Deckard's character.Now the Unicorn sequence  i did not understand untill the end when I realized, it was not symbolic so  dont waiste the energy trying to decode it. The truth is as long as you pay  attention to the oragami found at the end the Unicorn dream will all come  together and everything will make sense so you can get a better overall  picture of who Deckard is(replicant wise).I was to young to see this  when it was originally released(actually I wasn't born yet)but I know I  would have gone to seen it and I would have loved it. Its almost impossible  to believe it was released in 1982, the special effects are supurb and I  must give it up for mr.Scott for the visuals.

Neither is merely a sci-fi thriller.  The movie influenced fashions in both films and dress that persist; in fact I know of no movie of the last half-century that has so influenced clothing and style.  The steamy film-noir atmosphere is frequently imitated now, but remember this is THE original.  I recently watched then DVD (Directors Cut) and the film has aged not one bit.That said, it was NOT the directors cut that exerted these influences.  It was the original theatrical version with the loved/reviled voiceovers.  I recently tried to find a copy of the original version to replace my lost one and could not!  To let the 1982 version disappear would be a travesty.  I think the Directors Cut may be more watchable to the current generation.

The film, however, No.  When they finally gave Ridley Scott the chance at a &quot;director's cut&quot; edition he should have done the world a favor and put it through a shredder.  The sets and special effects: pretty enough.  The acting: uninspired (as if under heavy sedation.)  The screenplay: heinous!  For the life of me, I can't see how anyone ever let Scott make another film, let alone have a second shot at this one.	1.0	What a mess--even with the &quot;do over&quot;	2001-06-17	7	3	4
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2XRQB6CRJ4DHU	T. Fultz	"What I mean is that it was a true extended as filmed cut of that particular movie. By the supplemental materials own confessions there was a four hour version of Blade Runner. I know special effects cost alot to redo, but alot of the extra footage is usually fun, informative dialogue rich material. Also like spielberg (Close Encounter's 30th edit's) they give all supposed versions but the original ""assembly cut"" with all the stuff that's going to be in a deleted scenes portiuon of the disc. NOTE to film companys the next step in the 21st century, beyond the 5 minutes of extra scenes, deleted scenes sections,or multiple versions is the ""assembly"" or True as filmed extended versions (test audiences have a way of skewing hollywood to cut and recut there films). It's there films and vision, I don't say no. At some point of a classics umteenth re-release  how about a untainted cut free of all opinions and radical alteration's.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2VE35160256J8	tgas	I saw Blade Runner in the early 80's when if first came out.  This brought back a lot of memories.  Looks very good in Blue-ray.  I guess the only thing I didn't like about it was at the end in the original Deckard talks about how Rachael was special and did not have the 4 year life cycle of the other replicants.  It does not really take away from the film but I was trying to explain it to my 14 year old son who watched it with me.  He understood after I told him about it but it would have been better if he had heard it from Deckard himself.  Maybe the alternate ending leaves a little too much to the imagination.  Anyway, great movie.  Any BladeRunner fan will like it.Quick delivery; great service as usual.	4.0	Great classic movie	2011-12-08	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1JIW8GOSSGUQR	"T. Gore ""old_sckool"""	"Blade Runner has gotten so much praise since its debut in 1982, and when it was released then, it was a box office disaster. Many years later, it has become a cult favorite, and I can see why, but, I believe its only going to appeal to a ""certain type of audience"" The movie looks fantasic, and the visuals are well done for a film from the early 80's. The flim doesnt use action as its key, but tons of dialogue and there a tons of hidden meanings in the film (which I had to look up) which at times make it confusing and a bit to over-whelming for a sci-fi movie. This will appeal to certain types, but please dont think this is a sci-fi action film, because it isnt. The first  50 minutes have no action, and the movie as a whole is just to dark and to over-complex for someone like myself who is only an average sci-fi fan. This was my first viewing of the film, so I decided on the directors cut, which I dont know if this might have made things more confusing for me, since I have read there is a big difference between the DC and the theatrical version. I also hear there are many different cuts of the film. I still appricate somethings that are done here, and that is why I give the film credit.  This is the first time that I have praised a film so much that I hated (well most of it) This isnt some piece of trash,(once again why I couldnt give it one star) it has been praised by many film critics, but once again, there was nothing in this that tickled my fancy. Be warned that this is a complex movie you are getting yourself into, U might love it, but I think for an average fan of sci-fi with an over-complex plot, it is only a C-. For those that are really into deep thinking movies espcially SCI-Fi, then you will probely think its an A+ Masterpiece."	2.0	Its only going to appeal to a certain type of audience	2008-07-16	1	0	1

The giant briefcase edition is the ultimate collectors set, but this version cuts out a lot of the fat and strips Blade Runner down to everything that it needs to be. No Gimmicky packaging or toy cars.Here you have the versions of the film that really matter, featuring ""The Final Cut"" which is by far my favorite version of the film. The picture quality on this Blu Ray transfer is mind blowing. You would think this film was made within the last 5 years if you didn't know any better. The amount of content on these discs is perfect with out being overkill, plus tons of bonus material.Also, I finally feel that the film has gotten the packaging it deserves with this release. The artwork in the book is great, and I love the cover art of the origami unicorn....a beautiful image that hauntingly represents the movie. This is much better than those character montage covers.If you want a collection of the Blade Runner versions that strips everything down to all the good stuff...this is the perfect set. If you want everything possible that has been released in Blu Ray for this film get the briefcase version. But then you will be paying much more.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3OZXQ1YYJUS5X	The Dark Knight	This was so disappointing! I don't know if there's something wrong with Blu Ray 5 disc Bladerunner that I got, but the 'Final-Cut' disc (which I watched first); the 'time to die' scene i.e. with Batty releasing the dove etc; one of the flaws that the final cut was meant to correct was the blue, earling morning sky that the dove flies up into - which is in stark contrast to the smog laden, techno, industrial, retro-fitted builidngs / L.A. scenery in the rest of the film. However, in this final cut; it's exactly the same i.e. the dove flying up into the out of contrast, early morning clear blue sky i.e. exactly the same as in the original 1982 / voice-over, theatrical version and the 1992 Directors Cut!!! And the scene where Deckard's at Abdul Ben Hassan's investigating the snake; some of the dialogue's still out of sync, even after the final cut's makers went to the trouble of getting in Harrison Fords son, Ben Ford to do green screen shots so his lips could be composited to make it look Harrison Ford's lips / mouth etc. And the makers of the final cut went to the trouble of fixing the fact that, if you look closely enough at the earlier versions i.e. where Zhora's running out of Taffy Lewis's bar; she's apparently wearing stilleto's and then not wearing them in the next shot (where she bursts out on to the street), but this wasn't noticable to me anyway (and beleive me I've watched Bladerunner countless times). In other words; it was such a minor detail and yet in the final cut, they apparently fixed this and yet seem to neglect much more obvious flaws e.g. the dove flying up into the clear blue sky... even though they made a special, new landscape shot for this i.e. with the dove flying up into a rumbling, dark cloud / smog laden sky; past retro-fitted, futuristic, multi-layered, instrustrial, techno buildings (like it should've been), but for some reason, this wasn't in the Blu Ray final cut that I received!And the final cut omits the cool music at the opening credits roll and the other touch ups are barely noticeable anyway. Also, the final cut put's in this crappy, supposedly suspensful music at the showdown i.e. where Batty's chasing Deckard in the Bradbury apartments; I much prefered how it was in the theatrical and directors cuts. OK, the final cut's got some extra / additional footage which hardcore Bladerunner fans have known about, but never actually seen on screen i.e. in the downtown / 'fourth sector', L.A. street scenes e.g. the dancers in the tubes etc., but apart from that, the final cut's not that great. Also, the 'Workprint' i.e. disc 5, turned out to be just another copy of the final cut!	2.0	Blu Ray, Final Cut = Disappointing	2011-09-06	7	1	6
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3SHQO3R1H8D1S	The Desert Fox	&quot;Blade Runner&quot; is a hauntingly beautiful sci-fi film. I first saw the film on the Sci-Fi Channel about a month ago, and was so compelled by it, I bought the video. Harrison Ford is terrific as Rick Deckard, an ex-blade runner assigned to kill four rogue replicants. Replicants are artificial humans that were created by the Tyrell Corporation. When a bloody mutiny happened in the Off-world colonies, replicants were declared illegal on Earth, under penalty of death. Special police units, called blade runners, were assigned to kill any tresspassing replicant. This was not called execution, it was called retirement. Rutger Haur's performence as Roy Batty (the leader of the rogue replicants) sent shivers down my spine (&quot;4! 5!, How To Stay Alive!).

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2WEIAG1D05YV9	The Dude	Initially, I was glad this DVD was not the version of Blade Runner containing the Harrison Ford voice-over, which I feel ruined the film when it was originally released in theaters. I dislike the voice-over version, and the version minus the voice-over is one of my all time favorite films. Rumors were that the emotionless voice-over Ford gave, he gave intentionally because he disapproved of it. Done properly, it might have worked, but Ford's served only as a simplistic explanation of the storyline for the viewers, treating them as children, rather than giving the &quot;Marlowesque&quot; feel supposedly originally intended. This is probably due to the fact that the voice-over was finally added only after participants in test screenings complained of being confused by the storyline. The omission of the voice-over, leaving the events in the film to tell the story, allows the film to be the visual masterpiece it deserves to be. However, given Blade Runner's reputation for visuals, I purchased this DVD expecting to be able to view Blade Runner in widescreen or letterbox format. I never considered that someone would release this visual classic on DVD and not include a letterbox format for conventional TV monitors. But this DVD is only in &quot;anamorphic&quot; format. This apparently means you can't view the film in widescreen unless you own a widescreen TV, because the image or picture is stretched to fit your TV screen. For me, this makes the DVD a major disappointment.	3.0	Disappointing DVD of a Sci-Fi masterpiece	2001-12-08	4	2	2

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A20TJ5P97W5MS1	The Inquisitor	The million dollar question:Is Deckard a replicant? An even better question: Out of all the characters in the entire movie who's not a replicant? Blade Runner. The movie. The myth. The Legend. This film was directed by Ridley Scott. Volumes have been written detailing the amount of work and effort poured into making this film. The set, the screenplay, the acting, and the soundtrack. The effort is clear and evident in every frame. This is science fiction masterclass. At the core it accomplishes the true purpose of science fiction: to inspire contemplation of the future. It is futuristic, enlightening, terrifying, and ultra violent. Blade Runner has the look and feel of science fiction films that came out during this time period. This one really set the standard high and reveals once and ultimately for all that modern computerized CGI is no match for raw imagination, meticulous attention to detail, and genius set design. Blade Runner presents a futuristic vision of what urban sprawl may be like in the near future. Everything is very cramped and processed including the human beings or replicants. The plot is pretty simple and straight forward. The story is about an officer of the law (blade runner) that is in charge of hunting and eliminating a group of rouge androids in a futuristic Los Angels. The androids have evolved and started thinking for themselves. The lead android is played with ferocity by Rutger Hauer. The role of Deckard is also one of Harrison Ford strongest signature lead roles in league with Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Other notable roles are played by: Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, and Joe Turkel. The soundtrack to film was created by Vangelis and is equally as visionary and an amazing triumph on its own. Many forces came together to make this film possible. Above all else this film succeeds because of the source material the screenplay was drawn from. Blade Runner is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. In connection to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep the movie Blade Runner presents concepts concerning creation and the very evolution of the human mind. This is a timeless concept presented beautifully in this film.	5.0	The Empire 5 Star 500 - #61	2011-07-13	1	1	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1OBZOJLV38ZWU	"The Jacobean ""sci fi fan"""	Blade Runner is one of the best two or three films of the scifi genre.  It is listed in some compilations as one of top 100 greatest films of all time.  The role of this film in the scifi oeuvre is similar to that of Tom Sawyer in American literature - it has set the tone for all films in the genre since - that the future will have nicer toys but everything else - including us - will be just as dirty, gritty, and grimy as the present.This film does have some flaws.  Sean Young (Rachel) is the vision of beauty that she needs to be, but frankly her acting  abilities are embarassing.  Some of the scenes are almost too  hokey to watch.  Harrison Ford is merely adequate, but that's all he needs to be.  At least he wasn't as bad as he was in Star Wars.Despite the flaws, viewing this film in full surround sound with a large letter-box screen is an amazing experience.  The haunting soundtrack by Vangelis is a masterpiece - this film would be something completely different without it.It's a pity the producers had to cut Deckard's unicorn dream sequence from the original release.  They did, of course, for obvious commercial reasons.  However, the film loses a potentially vital clue without it - is it coincidence, or does  Gaff's origami unicorn reveal that he knows what's in Deckard's dreams, just as Deckard knew Rachel's?  We are left to wonder if Deckard is himself a replicant or a human - I would say the film intentionally leaves that question up to us.Violence in film nowadays is almost universally depicted in a gratuitous, cartoonish manner which renders it meaningless except as a plot device or an excuse for special effects.  In contrast, the nightmarish violence depicted in Blade Runner is used to good effect to reflect the essential brutality of life itself.Ultimately, I think at its highest level Blade Runner is a movie about life lived in the shadow of the awareness of mortality.  Throughout the film, eyes are used to symbolize the quest for self-knowledge as symbolized through the varying degrees of lightness, darkness, and pain.  Almost the entire film is shot in a polluted, rainy darkness, signifying the state of Deckard's soul, with the only glimpses of blue sky evident at the top of the Tyrell Corporation headquarters (where Deckard first meets Rachel), at the moment of Roy's death, and (in the theatrical release) when Deckard escapes with Rachel.The sequence between the death of Pris and the death of Roy is perhaps the most inspired piece of film-making I have ever seen.  The deeply symbolic nature of the final chase, with the fear of death (in the form of Roy Batty) forcing Deckard to the pinnacle of knowledge and self-awareness atop the Bradbury building, is  beautiful (religiophobes will have to excuse the crucifixion symbology).  Great stuff.	5.0	classic scifi combined with film noir	2005-06-09	6	3	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2MYUI8IT6UBUU	"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com"""	"25 years after the theatrical release of Ridley Scott's science fiction masterpiece Blade Runner, the film still retains every bit of its visual brilliance (made even more gorgeous with digitally remastered picture), but it's crystal clear that more than just the imagery makes Scott's 3rd film one of the most important and entertaining films of its genre.In futuristic Los Angeles, androids designed to be nearly indistinguishable from humans are banned from Earth after mutinous actions off-world. These Replicants that attempt to return are to be hunted down and ""retired"" by special police units known as Blade Runners. When one such enforcer, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to eliminate a group of extremely dangerous Nexus 6 Series Replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), he begins to acknowledge the thin line that defines humanity. In his eventual confrontation with Batty, and through encounters with an unknowing Replicant named Rachel (Sean Young), Deckard will learn what it means to be human.The steady build of each main character is truly flawless and the deliberate pacing allows for more powerful revelations into the intricacies of humanity. Harrison Ford perfectly captures the initially remorseless Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who terminates Replicants for a living and appears indifferent towards their existence - that is until he encounters Rachel. Slowly falling for the beautiful creation, who doesn't even realize what she is, Deckard begins to question what it means to be human (and many believe Deckard to be a Replicant himself, generating even more philosophical questions).Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty embodies the perfect antagonist to Deckard's antihero, a violent and ruthless killer who wants what he cannot have - an extension on life itself. A sporting terminator of sorts, Batty possesses many attributes that Deckard does not (and vice versa), and the two parallel and supplement the essence of each other's existence. Batty starts with a clear purpose and mission, yet ends meeting the inevitable fate so cruelly inherent to his kind. Deckard has a less focused existence and is forced into his unwanted assignment; he only begins to value life when he falls in love with Rachel and acquires a new purpose. He gains life and love as Batty loses both. Batty's poetic final words echo a loss of life, not the simple ""retiring"" of an android, and Gaff's portent closing admonition accords with Deckard's desire to cherish what time he has left with Rachel.The set designs and look of the film is nothing short of cinematically inspired. Turbid steam flows freely from every mechanical object hovering, gliding and scampering about; murky water plummets from the sky, drips from ceilings and skates across the trash-ridden streets of a futuristic Los Angeles. Styled to look like Tokyo if it had succumb to gross overpopulation, pollution and a totalitarian government, the streets of 2019 L.A. are covered in highly stylized denizens not that far removed from the cantina of Mos Eisley. A feeling of dread, alienation and claustrophobia lingers about every blackened, sordid street, and the various smattering of languages creates a further isolation from the comforts of familiar humanity.Enormous, uninviting skyscrapers tower above the dusky horizon, and blinking spaceships scurry around the bustling airways. Every bit of scenery is blanketed with smog, shadows and smoke, and shimmering neons and electric billboards peek through the dismal vapors. The atmosphere of Blade Runner is wholly unique, and it adds to the striking seriousness of every event, no matter how outlandish or (science) fictional, and gives it the distinct tone of uncertainty, dehumanization and fear surrounding mortality. Pulsing electronic rhythms by Vangelis permeate the grim events and narrate the moody film noir elements that frequent this seminal science fiction epic.Some say 2001: A Space Odyssey is the finest example of science fiction ever to grace the big screen, but we say Blade Runner. With suspenseful action, perfect acting, unbeatable character development and designs, beautifully foreboding sets, poetic dialogue, poignant themes, gripping violence, flawless storytelling and a love story to boot, Ridley Scott's broodingly dark foray into serious science fiction is the uncontested champion.- The Massie Twins"	5.0	Blade Runner Final Cut Movie Review	2007-12-29	3	1	2

The one-star review from the guy in Flagstaff has a point: we're reviewing something we haven't seen.  BUT the serious BLADE RUNNER fans aren't completely in the dark on this project.Just look through the other reviews: they have the entire history of the versions down!I remember watching BLADE RUNNER in Columbus, Ohio in the summer of 1982 to a mostly empty movie theatre.  There was me, my brother and a friend.  And we all loved it and couldn't figure out why more people weren't onboard for it.(Everyone else was at that other summer movie in '82: Spielberg's E.T.  Other complaints I'd heard was that BLADE RUNNER wasn't the kinetic thrill ride of Harrison Ford's previous movie, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK).When I went away to college, BLADE RUNNER was being screened in the Student Union in the mid-1980s.  When I went back to visit a few years ago, BLADE RUNNER was STILL being screened in the Student Union (talk about a time-warp: sitting there with an ex-girlfriend who still lived there 20-some years later with BLADE RUNNER playing nearby).I know I'll be first in line to get this 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition and will watch all the discs.  I've read the excellent ""Future Noir: The Making of BLADE RUNNER"" book and recommend it for the serious fan.  There have also been a series of excellent magazine articles this year since it's the 25-year anniversary of the film's release (you can probably google them).There were two movies in the summer of 1982 whose look and influence are still being felt in film: BLADE RUNNER and THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2)."	5.0	Yes, It's True, I Haven't Seen This Yet....	2007-10-02	7	1	6

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2W3HLHIA9UP4D	The Piper at the Gates	"The reputation of this film seems to precede the actual film itself. With that said, I bought this film having never really watched it before. I bought it based upon its critical acclaim and the talent involved. So after viewing this film for the very first time, I can't say I was absolutely blown away by it, but I will say that's a pretty good film. I enjoyed the basic plot of the film: The year is 2019, and a 21st Detective (Harrison Ford) is ordered to kill a small group of fugitive ""replicants"", or androids, that have come to Los Angeles. Of course, there is other sub-plots to the story, as well as a deeper meaning overall, but since this is such a popular movie, I wouldn't expect that there aren't as many under-privileged people out there as myself who would be reading or commenting about this film without knowing much about the story first! Anyway, I did enjoy the story to the film. Of course, the acting is good. With Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, especially, putting on great performances. The sequences between these two during the last 20 minutes or so the film are wonderful. But what I loved most about the film was the setting and atmosphere. There are some really elaborate sets in this film. The lighting, and lack of lighting at times, really sets the mood and tempo of the film. And the gritty feel of the streets of futuristic Los Angeles is done really well. However, there were a few little things that I was expecting to be better with this film. From reading the back of the DVD, it made is sound this film was packed with action, when in fact, there just isn't many true action sequences in the film. There's one chase scene and of course the climatic ending, but that's about it as far as any lengthy action scenes. With that said, I feel there are certain slow spots in the film where it kinda dragged a bit. But other than that, this film is good. Its definitely worth purchasing at this price. Especially when this DVD comes with 3 different commentaries and a 3 and a half hour ""Making Of"" documentary. No, this isn't as in depth as the 5-disc collection. but if you're not a hardcore fan of the film, and just want a more affordable packaging to the film, this one is for you."	4.0	"3.75 Stars: ""More human than human"" is our motto  - Tyrell"	2007-12-27	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director:  Ridley ScottCast:  Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, Brion Jones, Joe Turkel, Joanna Cassidy.Running Time:  117 minutesRated R for violence and language.""Blade Runner"", directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", is a science-fiction/noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"". The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.  Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant. It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil. Corruption is everywhere. The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his ""Chariots of Fire"" score), consisted mainly of jazz and blues. This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.  The special effects and cinematography are exceptional, with much of the set was pulled off using models. The sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worka, as well as the actors who gave voice to it. Harrison Ford is his usual self, doing a tremendous job down-playing the role. His voice-over narration helps the audience along, and was yet another feature conducive to the film noir of the 1940's.  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense and his lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical, while Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  There is more to this film than just pulp. It works on so many remarkable levels. The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live? Why do I have to die? What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care? Is this all merely an illusion? At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant. Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today. In a sense, the ambiguity of ""Blade Runner"" is the culprit of its success.  A great spectacle of a film that is much more than just its resounding effects, but an intriguing glance into a world that may not be so futuristic after all."	4.0	Blade Runner  (1982)	2005-12-29	14	13	1

I thought I'd look through to see what was being said about it, and I'm a little stupefied. Here are the reason's it's my favourite movie of all time, especially the director's cut.1 - Ambiguity and uncertainty are good. If you need a stupid voice-over to tell you what to think, go watch football.2 - If it turned out in the director's cut that Deckard was a &quot;replicant&quot; and you thought that takes away his &quot;humanity&quot; and makes him &quot;bad&quot; then you're a very stupid person and you missed the point of the entire movie. It's the homo sapiens that are the villains.3 - It is not a &quot;futuristic detective movie&quot;. It is a philosophical examination of the nature of humanity. Just because it looks noir-ish, it doesn't mean it's actually noir.4 - If you want a happy ending, why are you watching such a patently dark movie?5 - I love the book &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. This isn't the book, it doesn't even have the same name. It's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and it's a movie. Don't compare them, enjoy them separately. Incidentally, you literary pedants, Philip K. Dick himself said he was most impressed with what he saw of the movie before he died.Okay, I too want a better DVD. I don't NEED extras, or even any kind of 5.1 Surround (but bring it on!), but the audio balance is bizarre and fluctuates, and the ragged edges of the print are a little sub-standard. I DO want anamorphic widescreen, and I DO want the dirt gone fron the print.	5.0	Let me explain...	2002-01-05	13	6	7

Too young at the time, i did'nt quite realize what i was witnessing.  i do know this, it cast an  eternal spell on me and to this day it still remains my favorite movie of  all time.  When i viewed it again years later, i began to appreciate the  aestetics, the dreariness, the complexities, the intricicies, all set to a  haunting score that chills your soul.  While viewing it, i seem to be drawn  inward, examining my soul leaving me with an inexplicable feeling of  elation.  I love both versions.  i think a critic mentioned that the  voice-over narration was &quot;irratating&quot; or something so everyone  else had to jump on that bandwagon.  Come on all you Blade Runner junkies,  i never heard anyone else complaining about the movie before that. Put  quite simply, Blade Runner is an absolute masterpiece and is in my oppinion  the most UNDERRATED movie ever reviewed. Also check out some of Ridley  Scott's other absolute masterpieces:  Alien, Thelma and Louise to name a  few.	5.0	&quot;What's your favorite movie?&quot;....BLADE RUNNER.	1999-07-20	0	0	0

Ridley Scott's Science Fiction masterwork and possibly Harrison Ford's singular best acting job, four discs. and all three versions of the movie. The remastering is stunning, and makes it all the more stunning that ""Blade Runner"" was created before the CGI days.In the future, Androids are called replicants, but they also are smart and strong enough to go renegade. if they do, the Blade Runners shoot them down. Deckerd (Ford) is the best of the Blade Runners, and is called upon when an escaped group of Replicants returns to earth in search of immortality. Seems they have a built in 4 year expiration date. That is, except maybe for the one called Rachel, which Deckerd may be falling in love with. Played with smokey noir feminine wiles by Sean Young, she becomes the lynchpin in Deckerd's chase for the runaways.Noir is a major operative word here. Los Angeles in 2019 is covered in smoggy rainstorms and decaying buildings. Only the rich can afford to build themselves a place in the sun, and they're the ones making the killer bots. Which means everywhere else is darkness, shadows and slivers of light. This is easily one of the most exquisitely filmed Sci-Fi thrillers in history, which means the original cut didn't pass muster with the suits. That version (the happy ending voice-over version is included), along with the 1992 director's cut and the Ridley Scott final version.

There is a great deal here on how to make a movie.  The professionals' comments helped me appreciate just how many great innovations it took to take me into that future world.  Also, the resource disc is a valuable treat for Sci-Fi fans.  There is quite a bit on Philip K. Dick including interviews with him, his family, and other SF writers.  Brian Aldiss is one of the interviewees.  Dick's interviews are very interesting with him pulling no punches to save Hollywood's feelings.

I loved Alien and the second one (Aliens) even more although I am well aware Ridley Scott did not direct that one. This movie is perfect in one respect and that sleep disorder clinics could definitely use it as a cure for insomnia.

The plastic unicorn and the ""spinner"" car are more like kids' toys than objects of serious value, but they are fun none-the-less. And the folder of lobby-style cards are nice. The really strange item, namely the 3-D plastic film strip sandwiched between two clunky pieces of clear acetate seemed curiously out of place and overdone. One might easily decide it was included just to add weight. A thin, lightweight laminated version would have sufficed just fine. The suitcase is large enough to add some of your own stuff, which is what I did. The special three-CD Vangelis music album fits perfectly with a little rearrangement. And the CDs are (coincidentally?)printed with the same special logo that appears on the DVDs themselves, for anyone who cares to notice. All in all, the quality of the DVDs and the inclusion of the 5th disk, makes this limited edition of 103,000 units well worth the extra money."	4.0	Interesting Collectible, Good Price, Too Much Packaging For What You Get	2008-01-19	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A33BF8FLZBI59Z	"T.J. Hooker ""Spider"""	Finally everyone can be happy. I first saw Blade Runner back in the 80's. I really enjoyed the film. There is something different and engaging about the film. The look is also very original. I am a big fan of the original Theatrical cut that includes the narration and the upbeat ending. I am not sure why people like the version with no narration, adding a scene that might suggest Deckard is a replicant & cutting off the upbeat ending. The narration and the original ending make the film a classic. Without them I would take a star away. Anyway I will watch all five discs and enjoy them all for the most part. Finally there is some gore and partial nudity that make this an R rated film, but the profanity is minimal(which I enjoy). You don't need profanity to make a great film.	5.0	Blade Runner gets the A+ Treatment	2007-12-09	5	5	0

I'm not hip to the names of the various versions, but I had heard there was one with an annoying Decker narration... FYI - The version provided through unbox is, of course, that one. I think it was essentially added to the film to help those who like their films spoonfed - maybe for tv/cable release.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A74JXF3J5QUYO	Tloluvin	I give this a 1-star rating for Director's Cut.  The original version rated 5 stars.  The DC removed much vital information, like the background to the exchange when Decker is picked up to be forced back into work as a BR.  The DC also inserted an idiotic scene of a unicorn trapsing through a glade - looked like it was lifted directly from &quot;Legend.&quot;I would venture that some preponderance of the intelligentsia expressing preference for the DC saw the OV first, thus they have already been exposed to the background info before seeing the DC.  If you see the DC first, good luck.  I wouldn't recommend seeing the DC at all.  The OV is one of my favorite films.

On viewing it again however it is one of the reasonably rare science fiction films which have not dated. Its special affects are still impressive and the plot is totally original.The story is about four Androids who travel to earth in the search of a way to prolong their lives and the police officer who hunts them down. The picture of a polluted over populated Los Angles is a back drop to a film filled with noir elements.This release is different from the original cinema release in that it drops an annoying and tedious voice over and drops an artificially happy ending. The plot of the film is easy to pick up and the inclusion of the original voice over was due to film executives underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public.The chase towards the end is one of the most gripping sequences in any film let alone a science fiction film.

On THAT basis, it is certainly recommended for reviewing and/or repurchase.Director Ridley Scott refused to substitute CGI - but rather held to an extraordinary clean-up of the original material. Bravo.Apparently the five-disc box set from Warner Bros.

I came away feeling pretty much the same, but what is worse than not liking the movie is the DVD is such poor quality.

The DC version allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions regarding Dekard and whether he is a replicant or not, and allows you to develop your own insights into the characters.  The Theatrical version on the other hand pretty much holds your hand through the whole movie, which I personally don't mind, yet isn't really necessary, I like a movie which forces you to think about what is going on...and the DC version does just that.This DVD version falls short of 5 stars simply because they didn't digitally remaster the sound and picture quality.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A11H1H0NCSKP0M	"Turlock ""Steelkilt"""	Blade Runner was definitely a film before its time when it was released into theaters in 1982. Most folks wanted the glitzy special effects that films like the Star Wars trilogy had in abundance. They cared little for any amount of substance that caused you to think beyond the box of popcorn in front of you. Then came Blade Runner....Theatrically, it was a flop. The box office take was low. However, people weren't just ready for it yet. It proved a &quot;thinking&quot; person's film and to this day has become a standard of its genre. My only complaint is the unavailability of the original narrated version. I enjoy the directors cut but there DEFINITELY needs to be a box set with both the directors cut AND the original version. Despite the darker (and more potent) ending of the director's cut, the film noir style of Harrison Ford's narrative gave this film a totally unique feel for a science fiction movie. It is sorely missed!	4.0	Film Noir	2002-10-26	7	6	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A32W20KQFDEY2F	"Tyler Campbell ""Professor Rhyno"""	I love the film, both versions.  HOWEVER, one thing most reviewers seem to overlook regarding the Director's cut is that we already know the film and are familiar with the general film noire approach to the story, character interaction, development, and so on.Classic film noire often needs narration. Even if Ford initially narrated poorly on purpose, it kind of fits in with the character.  Besides which, the D Cut does nothing to replace the narration, so there are great gobs of panoramic dead air, with maybe a bit of background music.  It becomes a struggle to stay focused. I tested this with two of my Media Studies sections, and the narration kept the most audience attention hands down, not to mention a keener grasp of the film.I think a perfect marriage would be to include the extra footage, the D cut ending, and selected portions of the narration.	4.0	on the Director's Cut	2003-12-28	3	3	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2X9HB95SG0XWE	Tyler Parkford	Having only seen the director's cut of Blade Runner, I cannot confer whether the original cut proves more cinematically effective.  However, I enjoyed the director's cut for its thorough sensuality, which is very hard  to attain in science fiction.  Harrison Ford is &quot;one cool cat&quot;,  besides being tossed around a lot.  I loved how Rutger Hauer played a  rutheless yet convincing villain.  Daryl Hannah was a knock-out, as well as  Sean Young (both who played struggling humanoids).  But leaning off the  acting point of view, Blade Runner is more visual than it is action.  The  film conveys futuristic corruption with a shade of beauty rather than  disgust, which narration tends to eliminate (as seen in the original cut).  Blade Runner is a lot like Stanley Kubrick's 2001, except focuses more on  human emotion than human development.  The cinematography delivers pure  artistic excellence; with stunning visual effects and steady cammera  movement.  The action is moderate and the acting may appear slightly bland,  but more than appropriate.  I loved the director's cut of Blade Runner  because of its steady intrigue, that which cheap hollywood endings and  sappy dialogue could never come close to delivering. It's not a very  complex movie, but it does require deep, moral contemplation.  The sound is  ok, as well as the dialogue.  I suggest that anyone yerning for visual as  well as humanistic emmotion buy Blade Runner.  Just sit down, turn on the  VCR, and explore the possibilities.  Enjoy!	5.0	Well worth its hype	2000-06-28	3	1	2

The story didn't make any sense and it was just a bad movie, you shouldn't combine film noir with sc-fi, no Maltese Falcon with the Jetsons, or it just didn't work with this movie. Ridley Scott directs great films like Gladiator and Alien,then directs this wasteland of a flick that shouldn't be apart of the future with or without flying cars. any one who think this is better than Star Wars than get the hell off Amazon.

Dick story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".  I've waited for the theatrical-release version of this film on DVD forever to no avail and even VHS copies are becoming difficult to find.  When I saw the ""Director's Cut"", I was seriously disappointed.  The narrated version has a Film Noir feel that you just don't get in the later version.  Some find the narration cheesy and distracting, but for me it is what makes the film different and unique amongst others of the genre.  So my rating would be 5 stars for the original release and 3.5 stars for the later versions.  I'm glad they included the original film in this set, though it would be nice if there were a single-release DVD of it as well.  To spend so much for a five-disc set in order to get a high-quality copy of the first version is a shame.

I'm getting a little nervous about the gift that Vangelis gave to this incredible piece of art. Nothing given about a possible separate audio track for his music that he truly gave his heart and his soul to. Nothing listed in the documentaries/ alternate features of BR. Was he interviewed for it? Or was he ever interviewed about his luminous score over the 25 years since the films release? With the multitude of tracks available on dvd I'll be PISSED if the five different versions do not contain a single isolated Vangelis track. His score is equally as legend as the film itself.I'm a fan of both BR and Vangelis. The fans of the Greek Gods' compositions over the years since BR have had an undying will of force to track down anything remotely related to his blissful score layered in rich atmosphere. Like those mysterious alternate soundtracks that used to be found on Ebay until a few years ago. The Gongo release is the second best one other than the 12 year delayed original version by Vangelis, which was released by Warner music.Warner Bros. has been proudly proclaiming that they have all the rights issues handled to release this the way the filmmakers wanted it. Since they have the film and the score why haven't they included his participation in the upcoming notes? Maybe the fans STILL won't be able to enjoy All These Moments all in one place.	4.0	Where's info on Vangelis' magical score?	2007-08-14	21	13	8
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AAE27P93OEAHI	"Victor Mabry ""VCM"""	As a huge fan of this film I have to say this 'Ultimate Collection' is exactly that. With this set, real fans at last have all versions of the movie along with some great outtakes and deleted scenes (disc four) that have never been widely available until now. The documentary 'Dangerous Days' (disc two) will immerse you in the epic saga that was the making of Blade Runner and covers every aspect in great detail. It is also nice to have the original theatrical cut with the voice over (which I always liked) in addition to the '92 Directors cut and Ridley Scott's Final Cut. The Final Cut itself is at once immense and stunningly beautiful in picture and sound, and it's great that we finally have Scott's definitive vision of this landmark film. Also of interest will be the Workprint on disc five - a 'rough sketch' of the film, you might say, that also has not been widely seen. The commentaries are interesting and enlightening and you can see this was a labor of love for all involved. In all, we have all five versions of Blade Runner with a great collection of extras and the Collectors Edition is a real treat for true aficionados of this fine film.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A849KIXW419WD	video kid	I saw this movie for the first time a few months ago, and had mixed feelings about it. I thought the special effects were great, the acting was good, Rutger Hauer was creepy, thats all good. The first time I watched it I thought it was way too slow paced, but after watching it like a hundred times I got used to it. Then I figured out how many cuts of the movie there was, and I knew I had to see them all. The final cut was the first way I watched it, But the workprint is surprisingly my favorite version. Below I will review each cut of the movie and my own rating.Workprint; 9 out of 10This version has no credits, less violence than the final cut, but it does add in some dialougue, and alternate music. Since the production company made Ridley change the movie for american audiences going to see it in the theater. This has NO Deckard Narration (thank god) and no happy ending, which I think is awesome they cut out.Pros: It's the way it was originaly going to be shown so the releasing company didn't make them change it, Better music, alternate opening.Cons: there is only one, and thats the low quality. I know they did there best to make it look good but it still isn't great.US Theatrical Cut; 6 out of 10Even though this is still a great movie, the narration and happy ending I don't really like. Not much to say.Pros: Great BD quality, Less mind bending (no unicorn).Cons: Already listed them. (Narration-Happy ending)UK Theatrical Cut; 7 out of 10I'm not obsessed with the gore in movies like some kids are, but it's still nice to see more blood in this version.Pros: more bloodCons: same as US versionDirector's Cut; 8.5 out of 10This is the first to omit the narration and alter the ending. The only new scene is the dream sequence which is hard to completely understand but I think I've got it, plus that scene only lasts like less than a minute. There is also some new altered musical cues not in the other ones.Pros: AwesomeCons: Lack of new footageFinal Cut; 8.4 out of 10It's pretty much the director's cut with a lot of new enhanced footage. Some of the new footage is pointless. Why would we want to see harrison ford looking at news paper for 2 more seconds or stuff like that. But then there is stuff like changing a stunt doubles face, which is pretty cool.Pros: Great BD Quality, Enhanced picture, Fixed mistakes.Cons: Pointless new footage.Special Features; 10 out of 10Theres more than 9 hours of special features. They... Are... AWESOME!Pros: EverythingCons: NothingI love this movie, but I think it's sad that it has been forgotten by a lot of people over time... like tears in rain.Also, It's very hard to find any other 11 year olds who like and/or have even seen it.	5.0	Awesome 30th Anniversary Blu-Ray Set	2014-05-06	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3BMHUQHOSIP9	Vincent Steel	"I've now watched the final cut. It cleans up the audio in several places, and the color is better overall; though there is something to be said for the orange-brown dystopic color of the older versions. This would be the definitive cut if it wasn't for one grating change, and that's where Roy says ""I want more life ... Father."" In the older versions he says ""I want more life ... F--ker."" Now the impact of the scene has been reduced considerably. Roy saying ""F--ker"" had a lot of impact and intensity because it's the only swear word in the movie, and it's uttered by a replicant.Is Ridley Scott pulling a George Lucas here? He gets an A+ for all the other changes, but an F- for this one, for no F--ker. You can't make a change like this after 25 years has gone by.As far as the rest: good.  I didn't get the 5-disc version because I saw no point in having a workprint version (which I hear is very similar to the Director's Cut anyway).  I'm a fan of the movie, not a fanatic that requires all the droppings off the cutting room floor. A part of me regrets this decision though.Whoever put together the deleted and alternate scenes on the 4th disc did an excellent job of transitioning them.  It runs like a mini-Blade Runner movie.  One thing that annoys me about DVD releases is that they don't have an option to play all deleted scenes into the movie, or at least have the ability to play all scenes consecutively.There's a lot of material on the 4th disc and most of it is worth watching.  The documentary is good, though it kind of put me to sleep in parts."	4.0	No F--ker	2007-12-31	5	2	3
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A11PHD8IVAKTL7	"Vincent ""xaymaca@gmail.com"""	Let me state that this is the greatest science fiction movie ever made in my opinion. I am old enough to have actually seen the movie in a theatre. It had a large impact on my life. While many people prefer the sparse style of the director's cut, I would really love to see theatrical edition included in any blade runner boxed set for balance. A lot of newcomers to Blade Runner only see the Directors Cut and many of them end up hating the movie. Including Harrison Ford's voiceover answers one burning question: Why the heck did Roy save Decker's life?The Decker/android/unicorn theory is so contrived that it is not worth  adding it into the movie. If you have only seen the Director's cut, please don't judge it too harshly. Wait till  you have seen the theatrical version. Good luck finding a copy though.	3.0	Bring back the theatrical release of Blade Runner!	2002-05-04	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2ITPZOXVR7X6T	Vinny	"I have been waiting for years for the original version of this movie to be released and finally it has.  I prefer original cuts of movies to the do-over versions.  Unfortunately Mr. Scott has screwed this up.  The four disc version gives you his so called ""Final Cut"", Pink Floyd might want to talk to him about that title.  The behind the scenes gets its' own disc, the extra footage and effects gets its' own disc, ""The Final Cut"" gets its' own disc.  Here is where the problem comes in, the original version from 1982, the international version also from 1982, and the director's cut from 1992 are all squeezed onto one disc.  That is probably why it constantly freezes up when I try to play it.  All I wanted was the original 1982 version but Mr. Scott's ego forces us to buy either this set or the newer 5 disc set which includes a rough cut of the movie.  This is the only way to get the original version.  I will probably watch the other discs once then never again, how many times do you need to see the behind the scenes stuff.  Either way I feel I still don't have what I want because I am sure this freezing up problem is a disc problem and not a DVD player problem.  On this disc, disc #3, all versions have freezing problems on the same scenes.  Even though the price is priced for a single DVD why can't these directors stop being ball breakers and release single versions?  Mr. Scott does an intro for these films and when he talks about the 1982 theatrical version you get the feeling from his tone that it is here it is now choke on it.  You get the impression that he hates the movie and he will grudgingly, give you barbarians it crammed onto a disc with the other two films.  Why doesn't Warner Brothers take back control over their property?  I have enjoyed many of Mr. Scott's movies but what he is doing to the 1982 theatrical version is a shame.  I am glad I got Alien before he decides to screw with that classic.  I guess in a few years he will re-re-re-release another set of Blade Runner movies.

It essentially looks like an old VCR dub but on a DVD disc. You can almost consider BR a ""prototype"" DVD if you will. The kinks hadn't been worked out yet and the superb technology that companies like MGM, Kino, and Criterion have to restore and do beautiful digital transfers had not yet been mastered.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2EXMGQEFLW0LD	"""waymakerjim"""	In the future, the world has become a giant melting pot with all of humanity crushed together into a few megapolises, speaking a hybird language. Off-world has become a dream for some, a nightmare for others, suitable for a few, including androids and clones.These clones are no better than slaves, with a limited life span so they don't get any ideas about freedom. A ragtag rebel band escapes and returns to earth, only to be hunted down by Ford, a burned out cop who questions everything, including his own value.Hauer is fantastic as the leader of the clone group. He tries to discover his death date, yet dreads doing so and in the last moments of his life, saves Ford from falling. Life is precious for everyone.This film is terrific with a modern worning for researchers who want to clone humans, or anything, for medical purposes. When does a clone become human? Does a clone, one created and born in mechanical devices, qualify for the same rights and respect as we do? Troubling questions which aren't answered in this film because they can't be answered. And I hope they never need to be.	5.0	A warning for the cloning debate.	2002-04-12	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1GM4PCJDIZOP3	Wayne Eggleston	My VHS copy of Blade Runner is getting old, so I went ahead and bought the DVD of the &quot;Director's cut&quot; even though I had already seen it and was very dissapointed. I was suprised to get TWO versions of the film on the DVD: a standard version and a widescreen version. That's nice. The interactive menu, especially the scene access section, was pretty lame, however. It seems that not much thought was put into this. Also, the movie seems to play automatically and with subtitles, so you have to stop and turn off the subtitles then restart the movie!As for the movie itself, I have said I didn't like the director's cut very much and watching this DVD didn't help matters any. The omitted voice-over by Harrison Ford is the biggest problem. Those scenes where he had been talking are now uncomfortably long and silent. If Scott was so insistent on taking out the voice-over, why didn't he tighten up those scenes so it would be more watchable? As it is now, we see Harrison Ford just gazing off into space and we don't know what he's thinking or what purpose these long shots of him just sitting there are supposed to have.And another thing: the so-called unicorn dream. Part of Scott's original vision? I don't think so. Obviously, this was lifted from his film, Legend, and inserted into Blade Runner to connect with the foil unicorn Deckard finds at the end of the film. It doesn't fit with the rest of the film at all. It's an afterthought, hardly the director's &quot;original vision.&quot;Probably my biggest question with the whole movie is what happened to the last Replicant? We are told six &quot;skin-jobs&quot; jumped ship and came to Earth, but one got fried trying to break into the Tyrell corporation complex. Lets's count now. That leaves five. Rutger Hauer is one, Daryl Hannah is two, &quot;Leon&quot; is three, and &quot;Zorah(?)&quot; the snake dancer is four. What happened to the fifth one? This is never explained and if you start thinking that Harrison Ford is the fifth Replicant, then the entire storyline pretty much falls apart with &quot;then why didn't they...&quot; and &quot;then how come they didn't recognize...&quot; questions.All in all, a fair DVD of a messed up version of a good movie.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	There never will be a perfect version of this movie. The opportunity to create the original vision Ridley Scott had when he read Hampton Fancher's original script has been whittled away by time. So, this is as close as we  can get. There are aspects to both versions of Blade Runner that would make  for the &quot;perfect &quot; director's cut of the film. Although the  narration was delivered in a stilted drone by Ford, it did add to the noir  quality of the film. Without it, Blade Runner isn't quite the same film.  Still, this version(which isn't truly the &quot;director's cut&quot;--that  version is lost, or locked up in a warehouse on the Warners lot. See The  Making of Blade Runner for more details) is superior in many respects to  the theatrical version.  The narrative, always eliptical at best, is both  strengthened and made more ambigious with the inclusion of the fabled  unicorn scene(by the way, the shot of the unicorn is from Scott's Legend,  which is why the footage is so much grainer. The outtake was added to the  film because the original unicorn footage was lost after the first preview  when Scott had to recut the film). Is Deckkard a replicant? Scott thinks  so, but others closely associated with the making of the film aren't so  sure. This mystery gives the film a quality like that found in the best  literature; multiple and complex ways to reintrepet a film. This, in many  respects, is Scott's most complex film. Harrison Ford still hates it to  this date which is ironic considering Ford gives one of his best  &quot;unaffected&quot; performances. By the way, one of the remaining  Spinners from the film(the flying cars) can be seen on the studio tour at  Universal Studios Florida.	4.0	Flawed classic from Scott and Ford	1998-12-05	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3VOW473J03GOB	"Wayne ""waynesworld857"""	"The prologue begins, ""Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell Corp. advanced robot evolution into the Nexus phase-a being virtually identical to a human-known as a Replicant. The Nexus 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them"".They are used as slave labor for dangerous work in Off-world colonies. Their design does not include human emotions, however, it seems there's a glitch. After several years a Replicant may develop emotional responses which could lead to resentment of their slave status and rebellious behavior. So a fail-safe is built in; a 4 year life span. When a Nexus 6 combat team stages a bloody mutiny in an Off-world colony, Replicants are declared illegal on Earth - under penalty of death.  Harrison Ford stars as Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, the name given to police assigned to exterminate renegade Replicants.  He's coaxed out of retirement to hunt down an especially crafty and brutal group lead by Roy (Rutger Hauer), that has returned to Earth in search of their creator to demand longer life. During Deckard's investigation, he encounters Rachel (Sean Young), an experimental Replicant that's been given an entire past of artificial memories; parents, a childhood, etc. Rachel doesn't know she's a Replicant and Deckard finds himself emotionally drawn to her, even protective of her. He struggles to make sense of the feelings he has for this ""thing"". Clearly at issue are the moral implications of man's pursuit to manipulate the stuff of life, to become a sort of ""God of biomechanics"", and how that affects our concept of humanity.Director Scott has created a bizzare and visually stunning landscape that earned Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Art Direction.  In this sci-fi noir, the mood is perpetually dark, cold and damp.  Advanced technology contrasts with gothic architecture and urban decay. Ford is great as a burned out Philip Marlow type; Hauer is ultra-cool and menacing with his Aryan features, white hair and black leather. The Director's Cut DVD includes a less upbeat ending than the theatrical release, eliminates Deckard's voice-over and adds a sequence in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn.I greatly admire most of Ridley Scott's work and I own this DVD because it's one of my favorite sci-fi films. However, it's not without it's problems. It was adapted from the classic 1968 sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". Perhaps in the heat of the space race it seemed logical that we would explore and colonize other worlds by the early 21st century. But by the time this film was made, the screenwriter should have known that such a scenario was implausible. The unicorn dream is supposed to suggest that Deckard is questioning his own humanity and wondering whether he too may be a Replicant, but how is a viewer unfamiliar with the book supposed to know that? It's an intriguing element that I wish had been communicated and explored. Also, the nature of a Replicant is unclear. It obviously is not a robot in the conventional sense, since genetic engineering is involved. It's ""a being virtually identical to a human"", but it's not a genetically altered clone; a clone with a 4 year life span would die as a 4 yr. old child. That we would be creating living ""robots"" of flesh and blood in the early 21st century is an even more absurd prediction that space colonization. So, when I watch the film, I pretend the prologue says ""23rd century"", then I can just enjoy the director's artistic vision and the thought-provoking story. I eagerly await the new, remastered 5.1 Dolby version reportedly in the works."	4.0	Well crafted with awesome visual style, but shakey science.	2003-11-23	2	2	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1ZELPKV3DCCA8	"W. Gima ""wgima"""	It's really hard giving Blade Runner just one star. I know it deserves more...at least the movie I watched in the theater should. But this is what the Director's Cut deserves.I remember seeing it when it first came out.  I really didn't like it at all. I ended up seeing it again several months  later when it was the bottom part of a double feature (they still had them  in those days!) because I went with a friend who hadn't seen it. This time  around, even though I knew what was going to happen, I found myself  reveling in the little nuances in the movie, the performances, the strange  quirks of this sci-fi/romance. It then became one of my favorite  movies.When it came out in video, I got a copy. A few years later,  Ridley Scott came out with his &quot;director's cut.&quot; When I saw it,  it seemed so much deader than the original release. I didn't like it and  never bought the video or the DVD.One reviewer stated that Harrison  Ford, when called in to read the &quot;narrative&quot; did it very poorly  so the studio wouldn't use it. In my opinion, he was still trying to  develop his own style between Star Wars and Blade Runner. He had already  done two Star Wars and an Indiana Jones by this time, as well as Hanover  Street, Force 10 from Navaronne, Apocolypse Now and Frisco Kid. I haven't  seen the latter two but, other than the Indiana Jones movie, he seemed  really wooden and hadn't developed the ease in roles that began with Blade  Runner and became apparent with his next non-Lucas/Spielberg movie  &quot;Witness.&quot;I generally like buying &quot;director's cut&quot;  movies. I especially like the ones that add more but retain the flavor of  the original release. But this DC  really presents you with a clearly  different and drearier movie. It feels like listening to a re-recorded hit  song; it may have one or two of the original singers but it's certainly not  the hit that I remember even though the artist may feel that it's truer to  what he originally had in mind!It seems that the LE Collector's Edition  will also be the Director's Cut and I'm extremely disappointed. At the  least, they could have released both versions. If Scott is the reason that  the only version we have now is his DC, then he ought to be ashamed of  himself. It may not have been &quot;his movie&quot; that was released but  for many of us the original release WAS the movie. Would I have liked his  cut if that was the original release? It's hard to say but I really like  the melancholic edge of the original which was missing in the DC. I would  wager to say that it may NOT have taken on legendary status had the DC come  out instead.  I'm really disappointed that there is no version of the  original theatrical release out on DVD. I guess I'm destined never to own a  copy of one of my favorite movies...	1.0	Destined to never own one of my favorite movies on DVD!	2000-05-05	24	15	9

Defying movie goers expectations set at the time by the likes of Star Wars, Bladerunner is a dark, moody, sexy and cerebral science fiction fantasy set in a grim rundown future, where there are no clear Darth Vadars and Luke Skywalkers to scream a moral compass.Consequently it did not do well in dawn of the new patriotism / feel good Reagan era in which it was released. But as the years go by it sparkles as near visionary, and certainly mythic in proportions. Truly Ridley Scott (of ""Aliens"" fame and most recently, ""Gladitor"") delivers his first masterpiece.Enjoy the endless rain and darkness of a future Los Angeles, in the seedy future as Harrison Ford, putative hero is sent to track down a band of renegade androids who refuse to die as programmed.  The dark flame shot city is so realistic you would swear it was done with computers, but no, this was renedred the old fashioned way with models and has yet to be bested, in my view.Needlesss to say, the androids, although violent and confused finally develo more humanity than their creators in the ultimate Pinochio metaphor, and restore what is left of that in the bounty hunter Ford. Yet in the cruelest twist of all, Ford comes to question whether he is a human at all, or does  he? You decide.This director's cut does not add much to the original movie in footage length, indeed there are no new scenes. But it is what it loses that is key, the awful Harrison Ford voice over, meant to mimic the success of that found in ""Apocalypse Now"", is gone, trusting the viewer's intelligence to divine the plot and meaning.  The uneccessary tacked on ""flying away from the city"" ending spelling out the future of the possibly doomed heroes, and ""explaining"" what just happened, is also gone, as it was foisted on Scott by a baffled studio.(Interestingly, the Rockies type landscape that Ford was apparently flying over in the chopeed ending, was actually spare footage of the rockies from Kubrick's ""the Shining,"" Kubrick was a freind of Scott.)We recently learned from Scott that the final soliloquy of the Android leader, played by Rutger Hauer in his best role, was rewritten and reduced by Hauer at the last minute, as the studio goons waited to pull the plug on what they regarded as on over budget, doomed affair.  It was done in one take, and sounds like Shakespeare.Its a crisp, clean print and the wonderful Vangelis soundtrack glows in this restored version. A classic movie of all time, buy this, you will watch it over and over and see nuances you never saw before."	4.0	Doesnt add much to the original, but loses the voiceover	2002-10-29	6	2	4
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1PZI4LIHA6JM6	whitefire390	Bladerunner fans are divided in 2 camps: those who love Deckard's voice-over and those who hate it.  This fantastic set should satisfy everyone. The first disc is the 2007 'Final Cut' that seems to be a beefed-up version of the 1992 'Director's Cut', made for this DVD set. Great picture.  Great sound.  Definitely watch this one with the headphones on.  The soundtrack is as layered as the visuals are.  This version also has 3 different commentaries, including the 2 writers, Ridley and Doug Trumbull (special effects genius behind 2001 and Silent Running).The 3rd disc is the archival one with 3 versions of Bladerunner: the U.S. Theatrical release, the International Theatrical release and the 1992 Director's cut (no commentaries).  For voice-over lovers, watch the International one.  It's 10 seconds longer than the U.S. one because of the extended violence... Roy Batty gouging out the eyes of his maker and pushing a nail through his hand.  Apparently, Americans can't handle watching this kind of thing, so these scenes are shortened in the U.S. version.  The director's cuts, of course, have no happy ending, the inclusion of the unicorn scene (which somehow proves that Deckard's a replicant) and no voice-over.The 4th disc is a grab-bag of everything else.  More info about Philip K. Dick. The best thing on this disc is the tribute to Bladerunner's amazing D.O.P., Jordan Cronenweth, the Rembrandt of film-making. Jordan paints with light from a base of darkness.  People and shapes emerge beautifully from the murky blackness. There's some original 1982 featurettes, a walk through the set with Syn Mead, mini-docs on costume design, deleted scenes and the final word on the 'is Deckard a Nexus 12 or what?' question.  Personally, I think, since it's almost always pure luck that saves Deckard's hide all the way through the movie, I'd say that if he's a Replicant he definitely came from the Reject pile over at Tyrell Corp.My favorite disc is number 2 which is one long documentary of the making of Bladerunner, from Dick's novel through to this DVD set.  Excellent.I chose this set over the 5-disc set which costs twice as much because, as far as I could tell the only difference is the inclusion of one more version... the 1982 work print.  I figure I have enough here without it and I definitely didn't need the origami unicorn, the model flying cop car or Deckard's briefcase that it all comes in.  I figure, that's what you're paying the extra money for... the toys.The packaging of the 4-disc set is beautiful, subtle and elegant, designed for a true collector.  These qualities match the way I think of Ridley Scott's directing style, especially this movie... subtle and elegant.	5.0	Bladerunner 4 Disc DVD	2011-11-24	0	0	0

Blue plastic chips spilled everywhere, the case shattered at every corner.  Packed in a puny bubble wrap envelope.  Amazon, you can do better than this.

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1BT0S36OQMS39	"William Moomaw ""GIS Guy"""	"This is all that can be had of what may be the most important adaptation of Philip K. Dick science fiction.  Other authors have had their work explored in various forms of cinematic style, but none seem better suited to the original work than approach of Ridley Scott.  He had an understanding of this stuff!  From Dick's philosophical underpinnings to his use of imagery and metaphor, Scott managed to get it all into this film.  All of it comes through in the several versions, but you can view them all and decide which has what advantages.  From the first theatrical release to the foreign version, the storied work-print, and the enhanced Final Cut, it's all here.The originality of the production and the dedication to the work of the author hampered some of the commercial appeal of the first release, mostly due to the studio getting nervous about audiences being able to ""understand"" it and modifying it badly. But the director and fans have perservered to get all there exists of usable footage included in this set.  Finally, there can't be any moaning about what could have been because it's now been put together so that all of us can see what has only been rumored or in such limited release that we could hardly imagine what the discussion of ""better"" versions might have been like.The only thing that could have made this better would have been some candid commentary in a discussion between Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford about all of the versioning and hacking at the originally filmed material.  The infamous studio interference in this masterpiece and what it took to bring it around to where at least the director was satisfied with it should be a part of the history included in this set.  But not everyone wants to be frank."	5.0	All there is!	2008-01-28	1	1	0

I have to admit I like the directors cut better.  Nuff said about that.It is one of the very few films I watch frequently and it never loses it's edge. The casting was perfect. The music by Vangelis an integral and outstanding score. The visuals outstanding! Whoever the editor was, god bless you sir.Rutger Hauer as Roy--- Perfect!!Revalent then as today, the movie begs the question of what exactly defines &quot;life&quot; and from what perspective do we &quot;humans&quot; really understand it.  It's also a big a polk in our collective gut because at the end, it is the androids who draw our sympathy, not the humans!I can only tell you this:When it rains for days I put this movie on, and for some reason I can't wipe out the memory of &quot;Roy&quot; saying:&quot;...all these memories lost... forever, in time, like tears in the rain&quot;.	5.0	Blade Runner revisited(again)	2003-08-18	2	1	1

Back when it first appeared we had microwave signal transmissions for areas that were unable to get cable (early to mid 80's). I saw this as a premier on the movie channel and figure &#34;eh why not&#34;. Boy was I under-estimating one of the greatest sci-fi films ever! Not only was the cast in the infancy of most of their careers, pretty much everyone in this movie turned into a film superstar shortly afterwards.Decker (Harrison Ford) was so believable in his character it wasn't even funny. Amazing is all I can say. I've had this movie on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray DVD. And on VHS I wore out 2 copies.Not to besmirch the Star Wars fans but to me this film has a much better story line and the characters are closer to being believable. Even the concept of replicants is not that far away if you keep up with bio-engineering developments of today.Definitely worth the watch and worthy of 5 stars only because they didn't have 10 stars available!	5.0	Lifetime Fan!	2014-06-14	0	0	0

The lighting and film effects were enough that it didn't detract from the story of the movie as say a James Bond film does (IMO).The film was later even used to base a White Zombie song on ""More Human Than Human.I would have liked to have seen at least one follow up to this film but unfortunately the writer died I believe before the movie was even made? It's also one of the first films ever released on DVD also (The Original Voice over version).Captivating and star-studded it shows many at the very beginning of their careers.Not only is this Harrison Ford's best performance but one that will make him endure through the years in Hollywood as a genuinely great actor.The best part of the movie is it leaves you thinking about some of the pauses and unsaid things in the movie. One that's captured the attention of Bladerunner fans for many years was ""is Harrison Ford's character a Replicant""?

It stands well by itself, of course, but it also taps into a lot of movie-making history and brings it up to date.The plot is about a manhunter whose job is to take down escaped slaves, the factory made ""replicants"". A replicant is human in just about all ways except the serial number and a built-in expiration date of just a few years. This makes for lots of good chasing and shooting in the movie's bleak cityscape. The Tyrell Corporation, maker of the replicants, keeps improving their product line, up to experimental model Rachel. She, of course, is the romantic interest and puts the last edge on the moral issue at hand: how human is human enough?The setting is updated noir, with all the standard fixtures. Harrison Ford is the hard-boiled detective (or close enough), Rachel tends towards 40s fashions, and the vastly wealthy tycoon is at the center, above the law but not above justice. Ridley Scott has captured the real noir atmostphere, where everything is dirty. The extortionist police chief, with the bottle in his desk drawer, is dirty. The city is dirty. The slaving business is dirty, especially the ""entertainment"" slaves stocked like any other commodity at the military outposts. The air is dirty, always smoke or grey rain. Even the information environment is polluted. No matter where you go, ads, propaganda, automated voices, and flashing lights pound pointlessly into your awareness, following you indoors through the windows. Even more than in the ""Alien"" movies, Scott got the mood right this time.Most of all, there's the question: how human does a being have to be? ""Do you ever make a mistake? Have you taken the test yourself?"" Would an autistic child pass the test, or any other person on the edge of the bell curve? The situation, human bodies and minds built on a factory floor, is fiction. The fact, however, is that we really do have levels of technical control over life that were incomprehensible even ten or twenty years ago, and growing. Good SF, like this, examines the issues before they become physically real.//wiredweird"	5.0	The definitive Tech Noir	2005-02-02	3	1	2
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	Blade Runner is a glimpse of the future; a future where Replicants (genetically created life forms) are outlawed and banned. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner (a cop who hunts Replicants) who, while hunting 4 violents Replicants, falls in love with a new model Replicant played by Sean Young.Director Ridlet Scott does a wonderful job of delivering to viewers a new and fantastic future. Twenty years later, Blade Runner still shines and looks fresh.The acting is Blade Runner was wonderful, as could be expected. Harrison Ford, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson all put in brilliant performances, with the rest fo the cast putting in workman efforts as well.Possible spoiler below...Some may not like Blade Runner because of an ambiguous ending; an ending that leaves us wondering about a unicorn, and if it was a false memory. My main frustration with the ending is that I wanted the story to continue.Another frustration I had with the film was the end of the fight sequence between Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford. The reasons for Rutger not killing Ford were not fleshed out enough for my taste. If Ford was a Replicant, and I haven't read the book, it might have make some sense that Hauer spared Ford's life. Still, Ford killed many replicants, and it wasn't very believable that Hauer didn't kill him. The movie fails the viewer in this sense.Despite the flaws I loved Blade Runner, and will most likely purchase it on DVD and watch it again and again. It has too much good going for it to be called anything less than a great film.The only reason I give it 4 stars, and not 5, is because of the endless product placement scenes which begin to distract from the movie. We are flashed billboards and signs for Coca Cola, Atari, Budweiser, RCA, TDK, Bulova, and more. After the first scene with an advertisement, they get old and distracting fast. A movie of this caliber is weakened by product placement. I was constantly being pulled from my immersion in the movie back into reality, and that is a serious flaw.Despite this, please see Blade Runner. It is great, and a classic.Total Score (out of 100) = 8440 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.8 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?8 (out of 10).

The &quot;little people&quot; comment by Walsh was much more sinister without the dissertation/interpretation of the  narrator.

A look at the reviews here on Amazon would seem to uphold this opinion.  The ending of the director's cut IS a happy ending.  It is amazing how many people who liked the movie don't get that fact.Another subtle clue to what is really going on, (possibly a spoiler, but probably not noticed by most of those who have seen it) is that replicant's eyes glow red in some scenes.

When I saw Blade Runner, I was in awe. It was much better than I could ever had imagined. The storyline was original and addicting, and the characters were one of a kind. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is definitely my favorite character and he brings the whole DVD together, summing up the story with his line &quot;I want more life.&quot; He was able to say things that were meant to be creepy and menacing, but that actually made me laugh, particularly when he yelled &quot;That hurt!&quot; to Deckard, who hit Batty in the head twice with a metal beam.

I guess that you can say that either I'm extremely naive...or have lived a very 'sheltered' life.Before watching Blade Runner for the first time, I had the impression (based on countless reviews by critics and the general public) that it was one of the most underrated and greatest sci-fi movies of all time.  After having...'somehow' (*cough*) managed to force myself to watch the entire movie, my impression of the intelligence of mankind lowered exponentially -as it has many times in recent years, needless to say.Blade Runner starts out as an eery sci-fi flic showing potential that it may well, indeed, turn out to paint a very original, accurate and ominous portrayal of the future: The futuristically-rendered city-scapes are very well done (even for the present year, 2009, they still don't look very dated), the synthesizer palettes by Vangelis create an ominous atmosphere that goes well with the beginning of the the movie...and some of the first scenes seem to suggest that the movie will be very futuristic and intellectual in a number of ways.  Once the miscast droning dialogue from Harrison Ford (who plays Rick Deckard, a detective who's narrative dialogue is supposed to sound intelligent, but comes across as that of a dumb rogue more befitting of Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark) enters the movie...it goes downhill...very quickly...Rick Deckard's mission is to eliminate ""replicants.""  After the first half hour of the film (the only part of the film that has anything intellectual, thematic, or atmospheric going for it), the entire plot goes downhill very quickly and the remainder of the film focuses on Harrison Ford chasing replicants, being chased by replicants, and fighting replicants.  Instead of being awash with atmosphere, mystery, and futuristic city-renderings, the film is awash with sleazy '80s dance-fight choreography, dark-colored gothic make-up, and gore.  The dialogue and action from this point on is graphic, pointless, and pain-fully redundant...a pointless exercise in futility.  For THIS part of the movie (the majority of the film), Rutger Hauer is WONDERFULLY-CAST (as opposed to ""mis-cast"") as the proto-typical sleaze-gore '80s villain -something akin to a SUPER-rebellious Billy Idol...exept with MORE makeup and possessing decent fighting skills.  By the end of the movie, you're wondering why the heck did I spend two hours or so watching this sleaze-schlock nonsense...and what the hell was the purpose of it?How the general public AND critics (look at the PLETHORA of 5-star reviews on this website, alone!) overwhelmingly rate this movie as even ""marginally-good""...much less ""GREAT""...is way beyond me...(or is it ""below"" me?).  Is there something about the opening music and city renderings of this film...that creates an atmosphere that 'stays' with them throughout the remainder of the film?  Is it that most people watched Blade Runner when it came out in 1982 (I only saw it for the first time ever recently), times were different, and although the movie is NOW wonderfully-dated and overrated, they still have the same impression of the movie?In my opinion, Blade Runner isn't a ""terrible"" movie...but is certainly not good either, and a movie, which I believe can...and should be parodied...or at the very least submitted to Mystery Science Theater (for the take on Harrison Ford's 'dumb-sounding' dialogue narration, or Rutger Hauer's overtly-explicit sleaze antics, among others).  Based on the sheer number of high reviews that I've seen of this movie on nearly every major website, I would even go as far as to say that ""Blade Runner is the most overrated movie of all time."""	2.0	DUMB '80s schlock-fest	2009-08-10	22	4	18

When it promptly arrived (within a couple of weeks of my order) I ended up with one of the problem batches of the film, where disc 1 is a duplicate of the 'workprint' version on disc 5. Upon further searching on the internet I discovered that this was a common problem, and emailed Amazon. To my delight, they sent out another package for free, told me I could keep the existing discs to do with as I pleased and assured me the replacement would be perfect. A couple of weeks later it arrived and was indeed free from any duplicate issues.It goes without saying that the Final Cut print on Blu-ray looks and sounds absoultely stunning (I managed to catch it at the cinema a few years ago when it was on limited release, just one week if I recall, and remember being blown away on the big screen as well).Although not always the absolute cheapest option, I find the customer service with Amazon (UK and USA) an important factor when buying on the net, and it's the main reason why I return to them over many other sites. An extra pound or two cheaper is less valuable than a shopping site I can implicitly trust.	5.0	Great Amazon customer service	2010-06-07	3	2	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1PJHF6OCWCDAY	Zach Layman	Blade Runner is simply a classic movie from director Ridley Scott.  The movie is about a the main character played by Harrison Ford who tracks down androids or skin jobs and terminates them.  The movie may not have the special effects of today's movies, but the movie is still looks very real, with a very believable story.  I would recommend this as a gift to any fan of science fiction movies.	5.0	Cult classic indeed	2012-12-20	2	1	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2V3CQLCT9OT28	"Zach Powers ""wordist"""	Maybe the worst mistake in the history of film-making was releasing &quot;Blade Runner&quot; with a 'happy' ending.  The ending in the theatrical version basically destroyed much of the meaning of the movie.  Fortunately, Ridley Scott saw to it that there was a video release of the 'real,' restored ending, which is this, the director's cut.This movie is one of the most impressive movies ever made.  It combines a great plot, awesome acting, deep characters and spectacular special effects.  Put simply, there is nothing wrong with this movie, and everything is very right.  Harrison Ford deliver's the performance of a lifetime, and is complimented nicely by Sean Young.  But Rutger Hauer steals the show providing some of the finest acting ever captured on film.  Toss in some wonderful visual effects and cinematography, and you've got the greatest sci-fi movie ever (no offense to &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans).So get this movie, and be amazed.  If you've only seen the theatrical version, get this director's cut and see what its really about.	5.0	One of the best ever	2001-01-16	2	2	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	AC2A0QAC1HIIK	zero@voicenet.com	Absolutely the finest piece of SF movie making ever. It's set design is hugely influential to other, sometimes inferior SF films. The unicorn dream sequence is a brilliant insertion, now raising questions about Deckard's  humanity (which was PKD's intent, in a way). And many people don't realize  that the theme draws much from Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and  Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Wouldn't you like to ask God why He has  created you, given you but a short time to enjoy life, and then take it  away? This is why there is a massive cult following of the film. It's  viewers require a bit of smarts to fully grasp the film's philosophical  questions.	5.0	Changes the entire meaning of the film.	1999-10-04	5	4	1

Everything you could wish for if you are a Blade Runner fan. I have compared the different ultimate edition on different media and while there is no doubt about the quality of the HD Version being amazing, i believe they could have included some more goodies (for maybe a more expensive price) if you wanted a really ultimate edition. I am thinking about small things like adding the 25th Anniversary Soundtrack or adding the goodies from the Collector Set (the dvd version that came out in 2000) and finally maybe a poster or something framed, but the hologram included is already very nice for that matter. Don't get me wrong i really like everything inside that briefcase, it's just that there is no cherry on the Anniversary cake :).	4.0	Ultimate Edition ?	2007-12-24	0	0	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A25JBPU5G0C29H	Zev Bazarov	Directed by Ridley Scott in 1982, this film based on a novel by the great reality bender Philip K. Dick, is a visual and mental assault mixing retro-futurisitic gothic dystopic scenery, and a thoughtful story of an android meeting his maker, and the cop trying to kill him. Harrison Ford, plays Decard, who is a Blade Runner; that is his job is to kill robots that live illegally on Earth. During his investigation he falls in love with a mysterious woman.... As Decard investigates, the two surviving illegal robots, hatch a plan to meet the man who engineered them, in order to prolong their current life span, which is only 4 years. What will these humans and robots learn of themselves, and their nature? Of reality? Love? God? Death? Technology? All of these issues are explored and more. Any fan of science fiction, or a thought provoking story should see this immediately. While there are action scenes, the film is sometime slow, so if that bothers you, then maybe you should reconsider watching this. But I suggest you do, as it is worth the effort. 5 stars. A must see.ushing Tyrell's eyes back into his head), which I felt, ruined the overall enjoyment of the film.  I was annoyed at the lack of extras on this DVD, as well as the sound, which is a standard Dolby Surround track.  But the picture quality makes up for everything.  Thanks to anamorphic enhancement, which allows an incredible amount of detail into the picture, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; now looks better than ever!  I'm suprised people were dissapointed in it.  I would give this DVD 5 stars, had they included extras of any kind.  That annoyed me, yes, but the picture quality is stunning.  I heard that they are preparing a special edition of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; for DVD.  That would be great, although I am quite content with the existing version.  I also heard they are preparing a special edition of Ridley Scott's &quot;Legend&quot;.  It was torture watching the American version, and would be more than happy to see Scott's vision of what the film should be!	5.0	Beautiful sci-fi noir thriller	2002-12-12	2	2	0
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A3CSIKVHC4D40M	Ziad Doueiri	I saw Blade Runner when it was released in Beirut in 1983. I remember going to Hamra street, an avenue filled with movie theaters, and I just saw the poster of the film, and I decided to check it out. The civil war in Beirut was raging at the time, and one of the only distraction we could have was going to cinemas, plus movie theaters were like  bomb shelters.And two hours passed as if I was suspended in time, gone into a new zone, where nothing outside mattered anymmore.I got this strange feeling: I belonged to the film, I became part of the set, I felt like hovering above the city with Olmos; it felt possible and accessible; one day we'll have that. Then there was Sean Young. Few years earlier, I fell in love with Carrie Fisher, I had Star Wars poster on my wall; but Young, my God, who's this woman?I was so overwhelmed during teh film. Went and saw it over and over; my friends couldn't understand where's the fuss; they were into realism because the civil war and what not, they were into social messages and big themes etc...Blade Runner IS realism. It will look like that. Whatever...After emigrating to Los Angeles, I went downtown looking for the Biltmore; at the time it was still rundown, ravaged by time; but at least, I got to see where it all happened. I thought maybe it did.ziad	5.0	Blade Runner in Beirut	2008-02-16	0	0	0

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A2RPVO8YZ709KH	"Zippy ""zippyman"""	"Blade Runner is a great movie.  Unlike a lot of movies, though, it's not the kind of film you can just put in and sit back to watch.  It's not raw entertainment.  It's slow and doesn't have as much action as some things might lead you to believe.  The film really wants you to think instead.  It's one of those kinds of movies that asks a lot of questions but rarely gives you the answer.  So you definitely have to be in the right mood to watch it.  When you're there, though, it's quite a powerful film.Fortunately, the collector's edition comes with a few cuts of the film (legacy of the film's troubled development).  A few people might enjoy the original theatrical release a bit more because it adds noir-style narration that explains a lot of things you'd be otherwise left to interpret on your own.  On a personal level, I prefer the latest 2007 ""Final Cut"" as I think it makes the strongest statement, even if it makes the movie less ""casually watchable.""It's not the kind of movie everybody's going to want on their shelves but it is incredible and, when you really get into it, it's easy to see why it was so incredibly influential on the genre."	5.0	Cult Sci-Fi Classic	2012-05-01	1	0	1
0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	ARE5MQ4D12C2C	"zmax ""bostonmusicfan2"""	Don't you wish there was something like this for some of your other favorite films?! I don't want to repeat what you can read in other reviews, but simply state my impression of this collection. For the casual fan you can buy a standalone copy of the Final Cut and be happy. The directors cut dvd was good but the sound quality was lacking. This final cut version not only sounds amazing but looks even more stunning if that was even possible. With the new sound you can hear things not heard before or easily noticed in the prior version. There is also the long awaited commentary track from Ridley Scott.For the serious fan or film maven, this collection is a must. The documentary Dangerous Days is one of the best most comprehensive behind the scenes features I have ever seen. I couldn't stop watching it. It has been created and edited with meticulous attention to detail and features interviews with many people connected to the film. Then you've got yet another disc with even more excellent features. And then just when you've got all four versions of the film, you get yet another with the workprint!I think however that there is yet one more version of this film that could be seen. The Dangerous Days feature says that there was a first pass of the film once they initially put it together. I'm guessing it was probably at least 2.5 hours long. I would love to see that one too!	5.0	Excellent compilation and a must for Blade Runner fans!	2008-02-02	1	0	1

0790729628	Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)	A1ONAV7F73CIWK	ZombiDeathPunch	"Blade Runner, Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi masterpiece, is both a critique of our human need to create and an exploration of what it means to be a human. The film starts with an explanation to the viewer that, early in the twenty-first century, the ""Tyrell Corporation"" has advanced robot evolution into the next phase, having achieved the ability to produce ""replicants""--artificial beings virtually identical to humans. Replicants are superior to humans in strength and agility, and are at least equal to the genetic engineers who created them in intelligence. At the time of the film's beginning, replicants have mainly been used off-world as slave labor and in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny by a team of ""Nexus 6"" replicants on an off-world colony, however, replicants have been declared illegal on Earth and have been barred from traveling between planets. ""Blade runners,"" on the other hand, are human detectives whose priority is to hunt down and kill--or ""retire""--any replicants who have illegally made their way to Earth. The replicants' original designers were afraid that their creations, after a certain period, would develop emotional responses of their own--such as love, hate, and anger--and so they gave all replicants a four year lifespan. It is my belief that this film, in its use of a futuristic setting and its portrayal of the relationship between humans, blade runners, and replicants, showcases our deeply human need to create, reveals how our acts of creation can have unintended consequences, and explores what exactly make us human.There is a scene early in the film where a replicant, Leon, is interrogated by a blade runner who uses the ""Void Kampf Test,"" which searches for emotional responses in a test subject by measuring the movement of the subject's eye while the subject is asked targeted questions. The blade runner asks Leon to ""tell me only the good memories you have of your mother."" Leon does not answer and instead shoots the blade runner, ending the interview. Leon's reaction shows he knew he could not respond to the question in the emotional way expected of a human because he has, in fact, no memories of his mother. His instinct was to kill the interviewer and end the questioning. This suggests that memory is what makes us human. If one can detect emotional responses to memories, then one could tell who is human and who is artificial.Another scene that illustrates this point comes about a third into the movie, when the main protagonist in the film, the blade runner Deckard, is asked go to the Tyrell Corporation and apply the ""Void Kampf Test"" to a potential replicant held there. Dr. Tyrell, however, asks for the test to be performed on his assistant, Rachel, to show that it can positively identify a human. However, the interview with Rachel goes on much longer than usual and Deckard comes to the conclusion that Rachel is a replicant who believes herself to be human. He then asks Dr. Tyrell how it can be possible for Rachel not to know who she really is, to which Dr. Tyrell responds that Rachel is, in fact, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece. Dr. Tyrell's experimentation reflects our basic human need to create and continue to improve upon our creations. By giving this replicant memories, he has created a more advanced being that is harder to detect as artificial. This again suggests that one of the most human characteristics is the possession of memories. Rachel, when she finally realizes that she is a replicant, becomes intensely emotional and does not know how to cope with the revelation that, although she has human memories, she is not human.Replicants were created for use as slave labor in off-world colonies, freeing actual humans from hard and hazardous jobs. However, as Deckard puts it, ""replicants are just like any other machine, they are either a benefit to society or a hazard. If they're a benefit, then it's not my problem."" If the machines we create to benefit society turn into hazards and cause humans to become hurt or dead, are they worth the effort and time it takes to create? It seems clear that our creations, even if we make them with good intentions, can have unintended, and even disastrous, consequences, especially if we give our creations the ability for thought and reasoning. If we are to allow our creations to think, then we must put in place certain safeguards to diminish the possibility of their uprising against us. One scene in the film in particular deals with this insight. Roy, the leader of a group of replicants on Earth, is on a mission to discover his incept date in order to prolong his life. He discovers his creator is Dr. Tyrell and believes the doctor has the power to prolong his life. When he meets with Dr. Tyrell near the end of the film, Roy realizes that the doctor does not have the power to prolong his life and so kills Dr. Tyrell in a very horrific manner. While creating Roy, Dr. Tyrell almost certainly did not think his most advanced creation to date was going to be what ended his life. There was no possible way of knowing this would happen. In an earlier scene, we see Leon and Roy, on their quest to elongate their lives, appear at the workplace of a genetic eye designer named Chen. They use harmful interrogation tactics on him and discover that their creator was Dr. Tyrell and that they should find a genetic designer named J.F. Sebastian to learn more about their incept dates and longevity. They then kill Chen with no sympathy or compassion, which shows that they have no respect for human life.Another interesting scene comes about half way through the movie, when Roy and another replicant, Pris, discover the location of Sebastian and proceed to his building in order to try to access Dr. Tyrell through Sebastian. Sebastian, a leading genetic designer at the Tyrell Corporation and sufferer from an advanced aging disease, recognizes immediately that they are ""Nexus 6"" replicants, admiring them for being perfect, and bonding with them because they, like him, have short lifespans. He then asks them to show him something that they could do. Roy replies, ""We're not computers, we're physical."" Pris then replies, ""I think Sebastian, therefore I am,"" before performing some gymnastic moves and reaching her hand into a pot of boiling water. Pris' response shows how these replicants have an understanding of what it means to be alive and suggests that they may see themselves as more human, at least in some ways, than many actual humans. Sebastian lives alone in an enormous building and has contact only with the toys and friends he has created. This reflects, once more, our constantly felt human need to create, be it for industry, to solve problems, for companionship, or simply for the act of creation itself.The final scene in the film has Deckard face off against Roy in dramatic fashion upon the roof of a building in the middle of a rainstorm. As Deckard hangs off the edge of the building, in danger of falling to his death, Roy states, ""it's quite an experience to live in fear--that's what it means to be a slave."" Roy then pulls Deckard back onto the roof and says to him, ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, but all those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain."" He then takes his last breath and dies in front of Deckard. This scene shows that Roy knew his end was near and understood that, even for humans, no memory will survive one's death. Even our most advanced creations will inevitably come to an end.In closing, I feel that Ridley Scott's Blade Runner shows how we, as humans, have a constant need to create, even though our acts of creation may very well have unintended consequences. The film explores human experience and asks what it means to be human. I believe the scenes I have discussed here are great examples of this exploration and this questioning. I feel Blade Runner should be seen by anyone interested in our future and the direction we might be going as a society  . Though I know it is very difficult to predict what our own future may hold, I know for certain that we will continue to create new and exciting things, because such creation comes naturally to us as humans. I also believe, having taken Blade Runner to heart, that one of the main things that makes humans so human are the memories we accumulate through life, as well as the particular way we use those memories to experience the world around us."	4.0	My English Professor wanted us to post our essay's somewhere online and I didnt know where else to post it.	2013-09-30	1	1	0
