B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1A1WCAIEOBZCR	&#34;DoctorObvious&#34;	I bet the bad ratings on this site for this film were done by pharmaceutical companies and the government.  This is an excellent story with a cautionary tale of the endgame of statism and tyranny.  I've owned it for years on DVD still enjoy how well it was done.	5.0	Amazing story of dystopia that is now more credible than ever	2013-09-14	2	1	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1PUV4XTMT14L3	"Aaron Demner ""FungusTrooper"""	For some reason, I love this movie. It's a dumb action movie, it's predictable, and the story isn't even that great - but I love it.The setting, the action, the stunts, the visuals.. all amazing. A great cast of actors really bring it to life, too.If you want to stop thinking and start being entertained, try Equilibrium.	5.0	My Favourite Movie	2013-03-06	1	0	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AGUFAWDQJZC4Z	Aaron	First off, I  would rate  Equilibrium as a 5 star film,  however  this review concerns the blu ray itself.  If you could even call it a blu ray.  Aspect ratio is cropped from 2.35  to 1.78 ( lame) and there is no multichannel HD  audio track.  Are you kidding me?!  Equilibrium is a great movie but this blu ray just doesn't do it justice.  Don't buy this.  Instead get the Miramax double feature of  Equilibrium  and  Renaissance.  The films  are compressed to fit on one single layer blu ray but at least it is done well with proper aspect.  It at least has DD  though I  would prefer at least DD+  or better yet DTHD or DTS-HD	1.0	Stereo?  Really?	2013-05-16	3	1	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A74V2EOSPDJ2O	Aaron Hines	The concept of this movie was very cool. Unfortunately the execution was pretty lame. Christian Bale was his usual lame self, boring and unemotional (though on some level, it's what the roll called for).	2.0	Not amazing, but okay...	2014-05-31	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3W1O23RDWGLBX	Aaron Judy	Chritian Bale stars in this action film of little known around town.  Incredibly filmed. The cinematography and sound, yes sound are brilliant.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1POO8HA01AD96	Aaron Zambrano	This new blu-ray has horrid video encoding and audio mixes. There is another one on amazon that has the 5.1 Dolby Digital and true 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It still isn't the best (the japan release has the best audio mixes.) But it is better than this one.Equilibrium [Blu-ray] That's the one I got. It is the Canadian release done by Alliance(has double sided box art one in english one in french) and is actually good.	2.0	Get the other Blu-ray version	2011-05-21	16	14	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2RBFF7VTDR7ZS	Abby	It is not often that moviegoers are given the opportunity to view an unforgettable Sci-fi flick such as Equilibrium. Most so- called &quot;Science Fiction&quot; flicks now days, aside from the classic star trek movies, are Hollywood simply trying to please a mass audience that seems to only respond to blood and gore and sex scenes. Equilibrium gives us true Sci-fi fans the feeling that we are reading a classic Ray Bradbury novel, complete with great characters, subject matter that leaves you pondering for days and not to mention some of the greatest action sequences ever put on the big screen. Not only do these action scenes entertain to no end, but they also boggle the mind with the amount of intelligence it must have taken to come up with the &quot;sword fighting with guns.&quot; WOW!	5.0	A Science Fiction Masterpiece	2003-07-14	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q	Abdul Fazrul	I don't like to write reviews about the movie itself. I purchase based on actors, directors, etc. I check out movie reviews from imdb if I am not sure. I only buy movies that I know I will enjoy (I enjoyed this movie but the movie feels like an 80s movie about the future). About the bluray itself: Awesome video and audio.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3NT28K113P007	A. Blackwell	The review you see above, the amazon review I must say is a load of crap. I just saw the movie today, and I went in to watch this movie with pretty low expectations, expecting a cheap thrill is over the top guns fights and a story a six year old could have written in 5 minutes. However, I was pleasantly surprised after the first fight scene to see that there was indeed a story, and contrary to what I thought, it was surprisingly deep and very well done.The review above, the amazon review caught my attention by stateing that the fight scene was stupid for the fight was spurred by a puppy. And if I had not seen the movie, I would have probably agreed that fighting over a puppy is pretty stupid story wise, however, if you watch the scene, it is actually quite moving, hearing the dogs getting killed and than introducing a view of a innocent puppy going up to a cold blooded killer and stirring something up inside of the clerick.I could go on longer, however, I will not, I will wrap up this review by saying that this is very high quality movie magic. Action scenes to droll over, a story that'll make you think be grateful for emotions, and an ending that'll make you really smile from ear to ear. If you want to spend your money well, you'll be wise to spend it on a movie of this high caliber.	5.0	Excellent movie, no doubts......	2003-07-17	7	7	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AC9AN0TJ6NRPJ	"A. Boiser ""anonymous70"""	The fight scenes and its possible physics was clearly explained and justifed earlier in the movie. Thus making the later fight scenes more entertaining. Unlike the matrix where Nemo just closes his eyes and meditates or starts believing that only then he attains his super fighting abilities in the artificial world. Not convincing enough.	5.0	Great Movie!	2004-06-27	4	2	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AJQV1GCU92BUY	Acacia Manning	This movie was truly sensational. The ideas are not completely new, but then again, there is virtually no originality left in the world. What was new was how is was presented and the cast of actors. It is a distinguished blend of fine acting, moving slow scenes, and stylized action. The Gun Katas is a very cool concept...many of the gun sequences and the one sword sequence are extremely well done, and though the hall scene leading up to Fathers office is extremely reminiscent of The Matrix, the fight is so stylized and extreme you just enjoy it rather than criticize. The grittiness of the world is perfectly matched by the cool, sterile offices, the slicked hair of the Grammaton Clerics and the buttoned coats they wear, along with the monotone colors present throughout, unless when dealing in the Underground. The movie is superbly acted,the action scenes incredibly choreographed,and twists and turns are very enjoyable. The dialogue, though quiet at times, is always worth paying attention to. The whole film smacks of a artistically-done drama, yet is not that at all because of the fantastic action sequences which are seamlessly worked into the fil. Highly recommended to any moviegoer, whether they are a fan of futuristic sci-fi, action, drama, even philosophy. Fantastic film, 5 stars hands down.	5.0	Great movie	2007-08-14	5	4	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Equilibrium starring Christian Bale is kinda like The Matrix but the message of the film falls flat.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"This film was a combination between The Matrix, Fight Club, Fahrenheit 451, and Blade Runner. There are heavy symbolic messages being thrown at you concerning religion, dictatorships, and the power of the human spirit. Equilibrium was a sci-fi film to the utmost degree. I say this because most of the time you can only cover these topics with a futuristic approach. This allows the director to give us, the viewer, a warning that unless we contain ourselves as humans, this may be the future that we will have to endure. I thought that the actors very well played it out, the direction was steady, and the action was powerful.The only complaint that I have about this film is the story. I felt at times it was rushed and a bit difficult to follow. The basis of this film was to not show emotion, which I felt the actors did very well, but there were times when I thought they were showing emotion and guards were going to come and take them away, but never did. When Bale did break down, why were the other pedestrians of the city not surprised (again, was it because they couldn't show emotion). This is where I started grappling with the overall feel of the film. There should have been a must stricter balance between emotion and non-emotion. I felt that anyone could get away with anything, and with as many spies as they ""claimed"" being around the city, why were more people not picking up on this?  If Prozium was issued to everyone, why were there some in the city not taking the drug. Take Watson's character. She could have been utilized in a much deeper way, helping to bring not only Bale's character to the surface, but also others around them. I just felt that with this story, there were issues not being addressed and topics not brought out until a very suspenseful moment. I despised, dare I say hated, the scenes between Bale and his son. Sometimes he was calling Bale ""Dad"" while other time he was using the name ""John"", then there was the fact that there was a painting in ""father's"" office, making us question if they had to take the drugs as well ... hum ... there was just not enough consistency.Out of what I disliked and onto what made this film work. First, our actors. I have never seen actors give so much to a small film as I did with this movie. Bale was superb, ranking close to Keanu in his ""Neo"" role, as the gun-toting officer of the government. Even Sean Bean brought a human feel to this story about emotion. I especially loved Emily Watson. She picks the oddest roles to add to her resume, but simply put ... they work. The acting was only the tip of the iceberg, I loved the action sequences. They were fantastic. I am a sucker for the ""bullet-time"" style of fighting that was issued in The Matrix and I am always impressed when films use it better or add their own spin to it. Equilibrium was one of those films. The kata style gun fighting was slowed down when needed, or kept the same pace to show the power of the human wielding those powers. It was flashy, but not too flashy. Bale pulled these sequences off with the greatest of ease, only proving that he could be the next Hollywood action hero. The battle between Preston and Brandt was exactly what I was hoping for. While there were a couple of clich&eacute;s that riddled this film, there were scenes of power and originality that gave me more delight than I can wave a stick at. The battle between two of the strongest lasted just as long as I wanted. Bale was the best, and this film never strayed from that idea.The final topic I would like to discuss goes over the symbolic references in this film. Please, look closely and see if you can see the Holocaust references staring you in the face. The most blatant is shown whenever somebody is accused of showing emotion they are burnt in the incinerator. This is a direct reference to what Hitler did to the Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps. Then there was the supreme ruler that just happened to be everywhere people were. He was unavoidable. It reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 in the sense that ""Big Brother"" was watching those that would not obey. Toss in a pinch of the Salem Witch Trials and you have a little film I like to call Equilibrium. I think I liked this film due to the numerous amounts of references to our culture, yet that was what Bale and his government were trying to destroy. While they thought that our culture was being repressed, it was actually seeping through the seems. They would try to crush it in one section, but it would only cause more distress in another. The never won battle against the culture that helps make us the people that we are today. It was interesting to see a world that was scared of repeating the horrible deeds of their past actually create a carbon copy of the horrific deeds of the Holocaust. Their attempts at a utopia failed because the rulers and the people were afraid of whom they were.Overall, I felt that this film was not without flaws, but it did make a good impression on my mind. It dealt with an issue that is not explored enough in cinema because we embrace the theme in every movie created. What would a film be like without creating any sort of emotion from the audience?  A film full of emotional void being enjoyed by a couple that embraces it. Strange, weird, world that we live in!Grade: *** out of *****"	3.0	I'm not feeling!

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A19BWSUIKT0B69	A. Kuempel	-----------2.0 STEREO ?!?!?!?!?!?--------------Had to give 1 star even though I love this film.From what I understand and if true can sum it up: Alliance (the totally crappy Canadian distributer) also owns Echo Bridge who is who bought the rights from Miramax.Also as the other reviewer mentioned this release is in the wrong aspect ratio. The movie was filmed in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. This Blu-Ray is in 1.78.1 aspect ratio.It is possible both of these things are wrong (2.0 Stereo and Aspect Ratio) but that is how it is listed on the Blu-Ray case in front of me and I'm debating weather I should return it or not so I have not opened it yet.I was so looking forward to this release......bummer.Edit: 2.0 stereo and wrong aspect ratio confirmed see comment.	1.0	Wait don't get this DEMAND BETTER!!!!!	2011-05-11	110	86	24

This is not that kind of movie. You might have to watch it two or tree times to get everything. Lots of action with a pistol, and rifles. They even have a nice scene of some sword fighting that I thought was great.Most of all I think this movie shows what our world might become if we try too hard to be politically correct.	5.0	Amazing movie to have for any collection or just to watch.	2013-09-14	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A12JEY2PKSM195	Alex Winston	"Several years ago I dated a girl who had an older brother with an expansive DVD collection. From time to time she would let me borrow some of his DVDs, and one time we watched a science fiction/action movie called Equilibrium. I so thoroughly enjoyed this movie that she bought me a copy of my own, and it quite possibly will go down as one of the crowning hallmarks of our relationship.Receiving a limited theatrical release on December 6, 2002, Equilibrium is the directorial debut of Kurt Wimmer. Wimmer also wrote the script, and even invented the incredibly unique fighting style on display throughout the movie known as the Gun Kata.Equilibrium is set in an Orwellian future where human emotion is outlawed. The film fills in the reasons for this drastic step for the audience over the opening credits, but basically after World War III ends humans realize that they cannot afford World War IV. As a means to an end, any sort of content that invokes emotion is outlawed, and the citizens of this new society take designer medication with robot-like precision several times a day to rid themselves of emotion.Music, movies, television, paintings, and essentially art of any sort are rated ""EC-10"" for emotional content (a subtle jab at the MPAA ratings system) and are to be destroyed on sight. In the first scene, police raid the home of a group of resistance fighters and find the original ""Mona Lisa,"" which they proceed to incinerate with a flame-thrower.Christian Bale stars as John Preston, a member of the elite Grammaton Cleric. The Grammaton are practitioners of the aforementioned Gun Kata, and their job is to seek out and eradicate sense offenders, as they are called in the film. Bale really shines as he portrays a full range of emotions as Preston. He begins as a cold, emotionless (literally) servant of the state. As the movie progresses his human nature slowly takes over, and he manages to portray the onslaught of emotions quite well.A good example is the scene when Preston hears music for the first time. Wimmer chose the first movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony for this scene, and its powerful impact is readily apparent on Preston as well as the audience.The movie has merits other than Bale's performance. The cinematography and music all help to set the proper tone. Taye Diggs and Sean Bean do not disappoint in supporting roles. The action is very tightly knit and well choreographed. On-screen combat is filmed in such a way that viewers can actually see what is happening. Despite some elaborate fight scenes, no wires were used for any of the stunts. This gives the finished product a classic B-movie feel, but this is definitely a good thing in this case.One of the biggest problems with Equilibrium is a glaring example of unfinished visual effects late in the movie. I understand the movie was made on a budget, but such an oversight is just unacceptable in a major motion picture. There are a few minor plot holes towards the end as well, but these are definitely overshadowed by the technical flaw.The DVD includes very meager special features, but there are two entertaining commentaries that are full of interesting information. Kurt Wimmer really poured himself into both writing and directing this film, and his passion is apparent even in his commentary track. There is one behind-scenes-featurette that is fun but not outstanding.Equilibrium is a well-done sci-fi/action movie that is underappreciated. It has drawn comparisons to Gattaca and Blade Runner, but it is in no way a cheap derivative. The Gun Kata is a wholly original form of combat that will offer plenty of awe-inspiring moments. All things considered, this movie is definitely not offensive to the senses."	4.0	Fantastic Directorial Debut for A Young Talent	2009-10-02	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1LT3921RUXTC0	"algee ""aguy1"""	"I liked this movie.  There were some minor plot holes and it did slow down once or twice, but 99% of movies are no different.What I enjoyed most was that even though it used elements from several well-known movies or books, the makers were brave enough to do some things drastically different, even if it didn't always work.I think it is laughable to compare this movie to the Matrix. I think that years from now Equilibrium will still be discussed and debated with all of its flaws, while the Matrix will probably look and feel dated.  If you think about it, this is a very old and often copied story:The young man (the One) who performs miracles and who will save us all. Hmmm.Now I do love the Matrix for what it is. The timing of its release was perfect and it had the feel of something new from Hollywood. I don't see, however, why a person can't like both movies.  Is this a competition or something?  People actually seem angry that they are reminded of the Martix when they watch Equilibrium!  After my second time seeing the Matrix, I was reminded of Dark City, but I didn't get upset by it.Another note:  Another reviewer wrote that if there had been no Matrix, there would have been no Equilbrium - I submit if there had been no Dracula, Dark City, Blade, The Last Dragon or any other movie that featured skilled fighters, an important mythology or tragedy, gothic trappings, long coats/cloaks and one person who is the best of us or the ""One"", there would have been no Matrix.To end, I think that The Matrix had great effects and a tighter story and I enjoyed the martial arts, the acting of Christian Bale, and surprisingly, the deeper sense of emotion and drama in Equilibrium."	4.0	"All movies are ""copied"" from . . ."	2005-02-28	2	2	0

What it has a lot of is guns, guns, guns and more guns.Based on the Gun Katas; stand in the centre of a dark room and move only your arms while 12 opponents with automatic weapons try to shoot you. Result 12  dead oponents with No injury to you, the cleric  and not even a sweat!Next,you destroy an elite police squad to save a puppy (DOG) but watch emotionless as a dozen HUMANS are lined up against a wall and slaughtered again and again and again. Conclusion: dogs are worth more than people.You discover emotion and feelings for a woman while being videotaped in a high security prison but no one notices the display of affection and emotion in a society where emotion is outlawed.AN elite cleric team surrounds you, the most dangerous cleric,  at arm distance with their swords sheathed, you slaughter them. Not one scratch on you.You take out the number 2 cleric in 3 seconds and 3 moves.All this without breaking a nail or a sweat.This movie was a total disappointment. Utterly unbeliveable. The pace was boring at times, the ""battles"" pointles ( the outcome was always the same) and the end was ridiculous.I understand that several perons were moved by the actions sequences,the style copied from a famous predecessor.

Because I had to watch it on my own time outside of school, it was a little more difficult to get through, but in comparison to Macbeth, it was good.  I saw a lot of 1984's influence on the movie, but I don't know if I liked how they changed thought crime to sense crime or the crime of having emotion.  I don't remember the exact wording of it.  Personally, I liked the Matrix touch to the movie too.  It brought a lot more action to the film and made it more enjoying to watch.  I also thought the scenery helped set the mood of the movie, and thought that was done well too.  However, I didn't like the weird romance they tried to incorporate or the fact that they had to inject themselves with drugs everyday.  It kinda reminded me of Brave New World, and I didn't like that book.	3.0	Mr. Yochum's English 12	2009-04-13	0	0	0

Within the first 5 minutes, we were presented with an individual who, after standing in a completely dark room filled with armed criminals for AT LEAST 30 seconds - 30 seconds real time of staring at a totally dark screen, no sound, no picture, no nothing - this guy proceeds to clear out the room without getting shot, without reloading his pistols, without getting a scratch, without even breaking a sweat.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ATXMIZXC1IHNU	Amazon Customer	The trailers for EQUILIBRIUM kick a**. Guns, explosions, Matrix-style shots, a futuristic world, Taye Diggs and Christian friggin' Bale. But while the trailer looked attractive, it's well-known that many a polished trailer has masked a giant turd of a movie. I was willing to take that chance, however, and picked up this flick one night to see if it had the goods.The result? One h*ll of an action flick, that's what!It's not enough that EQUILIBRIUM was rife with things that went BOOM. The fact that it fused action with martial arts made it that much cooler, much like what the Matrix did by melding martial arts and cyberpunk. From there, it held me on the edge of my sofa with a suspenseful man-versus-Big Brother plot wrapped inside the bigger theme of feelings and emotions and how mankind would be nothing without them. Bale's character misses a dose of his emotion-numbing medication one day and--bada-bing--the tide of revolt against Big Brother has turned.And the ending didn't disappoint, although it was a bit easier for Bale to save the world than I thought it should be. There was also A LOT of dummy dialogue that was used to bring the audience up to speed on the backstory. Very clumsy and awkward. The biggest complaint, however, focuses on the irony of many of the bad guys getting angry at Bale and the freedom fighters. In a world where emotion is a criminal offense, why doesn't anyone take them in?Now I'm not saying EQUILIBRIUM is a great movie in strictly cinematic terms. It's imperfect and flawed. But in terms of an action picture? Rarely does it get better than this. If you like your action fast, explosive, and hardcore, do yourself a favor and rent EQUILIBRIUM.	5.0	Happy, kick-butt-and-take-names kind of equilibrium	2007-05-22	2	2	0

This may not be better then the first matrix, but its stong storyline and new take on martial arts (gun kata)help this film outstip the two later matrix's by far, as they were just a chance to show off CGI.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A80CDMFUK6IAH	Amazon Customer	Equilibrium was a bit of a dissapointment for me. The cover of the DVD says &quot;Forget the Matrix!&quot; but after watching this once, it was swiftly returned to the shelf. The problem is, you go in thinking this is going to be a hyperactive action film with lots of action-packed fight scenes. The few fight scenes in the film are great, don't get me wrong, but they're too one-sided. Christian Bale's character is nigh-invincible from start to finish, which removes any real sense of dread you may get during the minimal fight scenes. Furthermore, while the characters aren't supposed to show emotion, which is the focus of the story, it also makes for some dull character interactions (except of course, when you can spot certain actors--cough, Taye Diggs--failing to appear emotionless). As I watched this movie, it felt like forever waiting for these so-called 'groundbreaking action scenes' this movie was hyped about. While it's not a bad movie, it's far from the greatest I've seen. &quot;Forget the Matrix&quot;?

Christian Bale is in it.  I don't know what it is about him but he invests so much into each role he plays that it just draws you in. As an actor, he makes you care for the character John Preston.2. You see the hero's character unfold before your eyes and you cheer him on as he comes to the inescapable conclusion that he needs to use his talents to right wrongs.3. The spectacular action in the end.  I found myself running out of breath just watching one fight after the other. Gun kata is especially cool.4. I see John Preston as every man.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AQ84QU6BFRTY4	Amy K. Walker	I didn't think this movie was that bad. It was very similar to the book, 1984. They both had main characters who rebelled against the acceptable way of life. They both also had a love story intertwined into their plot. In both, loving someone was against the rules. And eventually they were both caught in the action. I liked the setting of the movie because it made the movie more interesting. It also made the movie more suspenseful. On the other hand, I didn't think that the acting was very good. It just looked too fake. For instance, at the end of the movie, it looked like he was just waving his arms around and everyone was falling over and dying. The fighting just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. But other than that, I thought everything else was pretty interesting.	3.0	Mr. Yochum's 3/4 Senior English Class	2009-04-13	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3GAAHTOSQBDDC	"AMZ-T1 ""&#34;"""	"EQUILIBRIUM is a ""stylistic allegorical sci-fi docudrama"" with sufficient classical good vs evil twists to warm the heart of both nihilist and marginal moralist alike, aided by appropriate excursions of cinematic excess. Any sub-perfect plot aspects are largely rendered nonintrusive by the character and performance consistency of all the main actors.Kudos to the the casting director for a near perfect match-up of expected typecast personas with the screenplay characters; what often is a distraction or weakness in many films becomes another level of storyline dynamic.While this is not an Oscar-level Tolstoy epic, at worst it is certainly a very good 100+ minutes of enjoyable escapist R&R; at best, a graphic expos&eacute; into disturbingly probable aspects of future societal structures, some of which are already manifest in our present techno-existence.Oh, and the martial arts stuff is kick-ass![ PS: I agree with many other reviewers regarding various sub-par distributions!

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3EFGZBIKEZBL0	Andrei Pankov	For action sake why this movie was so poorly received by critics?  Ok, I'm a huge action fan.  I love watching a movie with well-developed characters, great plot, interesting conversations but when I rent something in the action category I am expecting to see a film where the main character kicks some serious butt.  Equilibrium was great!  It not only satisfied my hunger to see beautifully choreographed gun battles but it also delivered likable characters and an intense plot.  Christian Bale shines in his role as the cleric John Peterson.  His expression is so cold, his stance with a gun in each hand exudes extreme power and fearlessness.  In fact, he doesn't feel fear because he has to take Prozium, a drug that eliminates emotion.  Accidentally, however, one day John misses the dose of his drug and starts feeling the world around himself like a true human.  This is where the trouble starts and cool fight scenes begin.If you are an action fan, you will love the fights in Equlibrium.  I'm also a big Matrix fan and after watching Equlibrium I have to say the gun battle scenes of this movie can almost put Matrix to shame.  For the love of action, do not miss this film!

Now, don't get my wrong, I love the Matrix movies but Equilibrium brings raw hand to hand combat without the high tech, high speed motion cameras and effects. The main character, part of the elites, who is employed to stop the rebels learns first hand at what he has been missing when his emotions are first felt.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AT9TLLPA9PJQN	Antonio L. Roberts	It's shameful to think that this movie was in theaters for only a couple of weeks in 2002.  The little fan fair it received (mostly due to the low budget) was not deserved.  Anyone would have been lucky to have seen this 'film' in theaters.Yes.  This was a FILM...not just another movie.It was emotional.  I wanted to cry with his character when he heard classical music for the first time.  I felt for his character as he felt an absolute need to protect that puppy after witnessing the previous events(don't want to give anything away).  If I had his abilities, I would have fought for that dog myself.(You have to look at everything leading up to that scene.)  This film also showed how you CAN have a superb fight scene performed without all the wires and CGI.  There were things in the fight scenes of 'The Matrix Reloaded' that made me laugh.  There was nothing about the fight scenes in 'Equilibrium' that made me laugh.  And about the GunKata: I believe it was a very unique idea.  A lot of movie makers don't have the guts to be that creative.  I give the idea itself a B+.Where 'The Matrix Reloaded' tries to be a movie, 'Equilibrium' succeeds in becoming a film.  This is an absolute must see.	5.0	The Best of 2002	2003-10-14	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AKCPE5V24BAJR	"ANX ""matthew4491"""	Did you like the Matrix but feel it had just too much loopiness in it's plotline?Did you like the book Brave New World, but felt at times it lacked a modernistic approach to action?Did you ever wish to see those two stories in one.Okay this movie has that kind of feel. It's basically saying in the Early years of the 21st Century, WWIII happened. Since then the world joined together(what remained of it) and created a society where emotions were outlawed because it was believed that emotions cause war.  These emotional criminals are monitored and eraticated by these Gestapo type policemen called Clerics.So it's like BNW in that it's a society hellbent on one ideal. (BNW=Youth alone EQ=No Emotion) and then one Cleric learns what it is to feel and tries to work his way through it all.  While there's some incredible fight scenes (no CGI or Wires mind you. Just pure crazy choreography) it's also got a great deal of feeling to it without all the crypticism of the Matrix.Christian Bale provides an amazing portrayal of innocence through naivity. And while Taye Diggs belied his part by smirking far too much for an emotionless Cleric, he did play a natural bad guy 'just doing his job.'All in all despite a fairly basic plotline, and Taye Diggs minor slip ups, this movie provides all that was lacking in Matrix and more.Tired of Wire Fighting and CGI taking over the job of great choreography blended with great acting?

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3PSXLJYK0XQWA	Arin G.	To be honest, on the whole it's not that horrible a movie. I enjoyed watching it, and the actors were great. The only problem I had was the extremely loopy screen writing. You call that a plot? (Well, the gun fights WERE ridiculous, but I got a good laugh out of it so that was great.)The film jumps from one place to another. It doesn't take time to build its character and as such it'll leave you gaping and shouting, &quot;What? How did THAT happen?&quot; When I saw it in the movies, people laughed in unison at the supposedly 'serious' scenes. There's no logic to the film. Farenheit 451 and The Giver work because the authors spent some heavy time thinking up the why's and how's of their futuristic monotone societies. Clearly the screen writer for Equilibrium didn't; he just ripped off from the said great works and threw in a few touches of Matrix. Even though the actors act so well, you can see that they're just acting because their dialogue and actions simply don't ring true.The fight to protect the doggie was ridiculous (why a DOG, of all things? He killed his own partner and he's risking his life for a DOG? How did that happen?) The film turns insane in the later half; what, you mean THAT was the truth about Preston's son? I found that turn exceptionally hard to believe, and so did everyone else in the theater. (A foreigner next to me kept shouting, &quot;Jesus Christ! That's stupid!&quot;)Oh, and THE ENDING... Don't get me started about the ending. How did the writer stumble upon the stupidest possible way to bring it to an end? I simply can't understand. There are so many great aspects of the movie; great set, great acting, great idea,great design... Why, WHY didn't they get someone else to write it?!It's not such a bad choice. I mean, relax, don't be so angry that you spent a lot of bucks on the DVD, and I'm sure you'll be happy about the way it made you laugh! Especially with all the 'gun fights'...LoL It's truly a gift to be able to make people laught at a bloody fight just because it's so plain impossible. I mean, Matrix 2, with its multi-Smith battle caused just a few chuckles and smothered laughter. Equilibrium? We couldn't hear the lines because people were laughing and choking all over.If you don't have too much disposable money, though, I suggest you rent the movie, not buy it. It might piss you off quite a bit.	2.0	Good acting, ridiculous gun fights, horrible screen play	2003-10-04	16	4	12

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3MQAQT8C6D1I7	AverageReviewer	Christian Bale and Taye Diggs did a fantastic job in this movie and we can't forget the commanding scenes with Sean Bean and Emily Watson in the film.  I think Christian Bale proved in this film that he was ready to be Batman.  It was in a sense a feature length introductionAt the end of the day though this movie is Kurt Wimmer's.  He's a very experienced playwright.  He demonstrated that he can write an engaging story that has developed almost a cult following years after the production and release of Equilibrium.  As a director, he worked within his budget and came up with all kinds of innovative ideas on how to make the movie shine.  His hard work comes across in this movie and I have to applaud him for such talent.With this directorial debut, he has proven that he can step out of the purely creative chair of writing a play and has demonstrated that he can juggle all of the pieces of a film direction to create on the screen.  Its not an easy job that many get wrong.  Wimmer gets it right, and he gets it right in a responsible and hard working fashion very unlike many new directors who simply look through the lens and accept what's there.  Wimmer is the opposite.  He puts what he needs into the screen and he considers what it will cost him to put a certain effect into the screen and when he needs to conserve budget, he comes up with an interesting trick - like simply having the muzzle lights light a scene: very unique and interesting.The story is strong from a science fiction standpoint.  Think Farenheit 451 plus the Matrix all mixed into one but without the gigantic budget of the Matrix.  The director and crew had to work here to take a small budget and stretch it.  The studio probably gave him Christian Bale who was a rising star and needed a movie like this and a modest budget and Wimmer had to make it work - and he did wonderfully.Not only that, this movie has a great cult following.  It would be great to see another Kurt Wimmer directed movie.  I wonder what he could produce with a larger budget?If you're a student of Art and movies, see this movie - you'll see the hard work.If you're a fan of Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Emily Watson, or Tye Diggs -- this is a great B budget movie that elevates itself to A status through its tremendous actors, original story, and extremely hard work by a director who is taking the director's chair for the first time.	5.0	Kurt Wimmer Shines	2008-12-08	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3GTY3C7E45GLX	Avid Reader	This dystopian movie envisages a world where emotion is illegal.  Oddly, those in power get angry when people break the law, but don't seem to notice it.  So the whole premise of the movie is incoherent.  The aesthetic style of the movie -- rooms without any color, huge buildings apparently modeled on totalitarian regimes -- is so over the top that it is ridiculous.  The plot details are so absurd it is funny -- seeing Bale stare into the eye of a little dog and have is heart broken is laughable.  Similarly, having the Mona Lisa represent a moving work of art is very strange.  The many scenes where Bale fights about 30 other people and kills them all are completely unbelievable.  The director says in the commentary that they ran out of money, which is apparent, but that does not explain the crappy and incoherent plot.  Some people like the acting of Christian Bale, but I've never seen him convincingly show an emotion, even when he is winning at the Golden Globes, so he is not the best choice to be the lead actor in a role where he is meant to be the overcome by experience of emotion.  The best thing about the DVD is the director's commentary where he gives a lot of excuses for why his first movie was such a failure.	2.0	So bad it's good.	2011-01-27	9	3	6
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1CQGAPQMN41LV	"A. Whitehead ""Werthead"""	Equilibrium is an SF action thriller originally released in 2002, starring Christian Bale and set in a dystopian vision of the future where humanity lives in enforced peace, strictly controlled and enforced by a drug called prozium. The theory is that 'feelings' are responsible for war, murder and mayhem, and prozium represses these. Anything that inspires feelings, such as art, literature or music, is classified as 'EC-10' and destroyed, and those who create or hoard such items are summarily executed as 'sense-criminals'.The government's will is enforced by the Clerics, elite warriors who are trained in the art of 'gun kata', a total mastery of firearms in ranged, close-quarters and melee combat. The Clerics are tasked to seek out and destroy EC-10 materials and attempt to bring down the Underground, a rebel organisation dedicated to restoring senses and feeling to humanity. When one of the Clerics is 'turned' by the Underground, his colleague Preston becomes disturbed and starts his own exploration of what it means to be human.Equilibrium was somewhat dismissed on release for being a bit of a Matrix rip-off, with its focus on martial arts, gunplay and brooding heroes dressed in black (although Christian Bale is a considerably more intense and charismatic performer than Keanu Reeves), although Equilibrium owes a lot more to prior dystopian/utopian visions such as Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four and computers do not play a significant role. Also like The Matrix, Equilibrium's premise and storyline is full of holes and if you think about it for more than a few minutes, the whole thing falls apart.Luckily, Equilibrium works better on a thematic basis, asking some interesting (if unoriginal) questions about freedom, responsibility and consequences. It is visually arresting, and the story dodges several tedious cliches and features some genuinely interesting twists along its path. The action sequences are relatively few and brief (possibly a budgetary decision), but when they do take place they are spectacularly executed. On the acting front Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Emily Watson do some excellent work, but the film suffers from weak antagonists who do not present credible threats when stood up against the murderously efficient Preston . The ending is also bemusing, as the scale of the Underground is revealed to be so vast that it is likely they would have succeeded without Preston's intervention anyway.Equilibrium (***) is a watchable and solidly enjoyable movie which suffers from some major logic problems, but if you can overlook those, it works quite well. The movie is available now on DVD in the UK and USA.	3.0	Decent, but flawed	2009-04-02	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A12QL3YE58F9RI	"B. C. Whitcomb ""WTF?!"""	"""Equilibrium"" begins with an interesting premise: a world that has found peace by eliminating emotions, using behavioral drugs to keep them at bay. Order is reinforced by Clerics who dispense justice and fight the Father's enemies with martial arts and firearms. It's an interesting concept that would have made this movie somewhat like our present. However, while the production design is outstanding and the performances uniformly good, this movie is like a house of cards ready to collapse. And it does collapse, halfway through, when Christian Bale's character, Preston, tries to protect a puppy from slaughter. Is this the best the writers could come up with to describe Preston's realisation of the error of the order he defends? They should have started with Preston exploring why his partner and mentor, played by Sean Bean, went astray. They also could have gone further exploring the reasons for Preston's fascination with the woman, played by Emily Watson. Is it because he feels guilty for not saving his wife from an execution order for 'sense crime'? And what about Preston and his son? I noted that Preston was fearful of his son right from the beginning of the movie. How about some father/son relationship exploration?Lots of story options that would have made this movie better.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	"I saw this movie with four friends of mine, and we all left the theater with vastly different opinions about it. Though we all agreed that the action scenes were incredibly done, I found them out of place in this film. The premise regarding a world free of emotion, if executed better, could've been interesting, but, by the end, ""Equilibrium"" left me unconvinced about its points.Christian Bale plays John Preston, a law enforcement officer who goes about assuring that everyone in society is without emotion. The society controls the emotional responses of its people through drugs and use of the martial arts. (The martial arts in the film, used with guns in a stunning, if bafflingly incoherent, provide its best effects.) Preston, over time, begins skipping his treatments, though he's initially a stalwart in favor of the old system.As he develops emotions, in scenes that aren't quite convincing because actors pretending not to convey emotions come off as wooden (whether or not it's a plot device), Preston begins fighting the establishment, caring for his kids and caring for his old partner's lover, a renegade art-lover played by Emily Watson. (I'm not entirely sure if this is supposed to be some sidebar love story, for it's hard to be convinced when Christian Bale doesn't play up emotions in this, or any, regard.)The movie lost me with its use of the cute puppy dog. Bale finds that, with emotions, he can't shoot the poor thing in the head, even though it's required of his job. Instead of shooting the dog, though, he guns down about 15 men trying to kill the dog. Where's the emotion and morality in that? One cute dog we can't kill, but let's violently dispatch a whole bunch of people because they don't have emotions and want to kill us. It's weirdly uneven, and the scene of him gunning down the people, then embracing the furry creature and crying is just silly.Don't waste your time. Though it's action-packed and sorta has a moral point to it, it's unconvincing."	3.0	Uneven movie with a good premise. But the violence is cool.	2003-01-23	18	3	15
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AJJBIXVL2U8FP	"Benjamin Mcnully ""Movie Idiot"""	1984, The Matrix, Clockwork Orange; these movie are set in the future.Equilibrium is a movie about the future.Set after the third world war, the people in charge decide that the reason man has fallen isemotion. They create a drug called prozium, something we would relate to Prozac, or something that creates a calm euphoric state. Basicaly, no one knows true joy or hate, or has experienced any extreme emotion.Christian Bale plays a Grammaton Cleric, a defender against 'sense crimes'. The goverment employs an army of well armed guards, and the ultimate fighter, the cleric. We start off seeing two clerics raiding a sense offender hide out. Christian and his partner, Sean ? (who plays Boramir in Lord of The Rings, and 006 in Goldeneye), head in, and Christian shows us in one of my favorite cinematic techniques I've seen, The gun kata. More on that later. After the action scene, his partner asks why they have to be so cruel and heartless. This tips him off: He is a sense criminal.Later, he must face his partner. This tears him apart, but the affect of the prozium keeps him from feeling it, same as his wifes murder. One morning, he skips his dose. His son, who is training to be a cleric, notices. We assume he is an enemy to his very feeling, just like everyone else around him. So begins his journey to emotional fulfillment, or at least stability, in this world of no highs or lows. It's one of my favorites, and so is Bale, who is a really good actor.The picture quality is decent in most scenes, but in comparison to the cg, they look fuzzy like all good sci fi action adventures (namely the matrix... why does it always get compared there?). The sound is great, with sweeping orcheastral scores and techno beats, and the bizarre mix of both.The action is so amazing. With attention to all weapon styles, choreography, and visual effects the director has pieced together something cool and stylish. He mentions his influences in his commentary, everything from Christian holding his sword underhand like Zatoichi, and the Gun Kata being created as a response to movie where guns are in a seperate category from martial arts. So, now they ARE the martial art, and are influenced by all kinds of weapon arts. Fast paced, hardly cheesed or hollywood, all the actors are athletic in their own respects.For special effects, theres a featurette, that despite being a few minutes long covers all the asskissing and talking about the tough parts, and how they trained... You've seen it before. Next,there are two commentary tracks: one of the director, and one of him and the producer. The director's commentary is insighful into why he thought the movie didn't do so well, the parts he likes, he doesn't, budget problems, etc. The one with the producer is more about the script, how the film came together, and even more about techniques and budget solutions. I kind of like this, he no Rob Rodriguez or anything, but it's pretty cool to hear their opinions and all the little insights.There are a few trailers, but nothing too exciting. It kills me to not give it a five. But, overall, the story gets a 4, the quality a 4, but the disc gets a 2 1/2 for no originality or cool features, just a good commentary track(s). Overall, a solid 4, for a movie you'll love and maybe even come back to.	4.0	"""Better than the matrix!"" -Review on box-"	2005-08-20	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1JE7ZFZ71MR13	"Ben Larkins ""larkins621"""	"One of my favorite. Easily in my top five, and one of the most underrated movies of all time. Great actors who really sell the role (Christian Bale should have won something for his part), along with a great story that makes you think, but leaves with a nice resolution. Granted, the action does force you to put your logic on hold for a second...but I really don't have a beef with that. So long as the characters actions and abilities have been explained prior to those actions being fleshed out on the screen (ala the Gun Karta training, which explains WHY he can stand in the center of a circle of bad thugs and still take them down) then I'm okay with it.It was this movie that made me want to read 1984.

Now the state must find the rebels before they disrupt the experiment. In the rebels must displace the state with chaos and assure that everybody has lots of feelings.One man who might be capable of bringing these changes, John Preston (Christian Bale) who is now in the employ of the government may soon see the light.Will he bring on these changes?Will he want to?We get to watch.Do we want to?I do.If you like action there is plenty of it.

For that person that likes plot twists this movie has a few.Some people like to equate this story with ""1984"" by George Orwell and I can see that there are some aspects but this is definitely not a remake. There is a small architectural resemblance to ""Metropolis"" (1927.) Other people watcher hero flip around and try to compare this to ""The Matrix"" again it doesn't carry the same message and the technology is not really equivalent.

This movie was allowed to die in the Top 20 test marking cities after only two weeks, with absolutely NO advertising.  Why?  This film is politically-incorrect and centers on many issues (hate-crime laws, war-on-terror, government censorship, absolute government ... etc) that those in `the establishment' would rather you not consider for yourself.  This film was `shelved' for almost a year, then finally released late in 2002 for only a few weeks.  It is very likely that Dimension Films is going to only sell only one run of DVDs and tapes to recoup their losses in production costs.  As this movie was not marketed in any meaningful way, it seems likely that it will vanish as soon as the copies are all sold out...  If you waited to see it in the theaters, you missed it (like I did), if you wait again to add this to your collection you could be in for a long wait before you see it again...  It has within it the elements of several other movies:All the government of Orwell's ""1984""All the censorship of Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451'All the cinematography of Lang's ""Metropolis""Along with themes of many other movies including ""Gattaca"" and ""Logan's Run""This film `seems' like so many other near-future totalitarian masterpieces in many ways.  Yet, it remains it's own movie and retains its own plot and twists, without having to ride on anyone's coattails, least of all the ""Matrix"".  It is graphic, violent, often shocking, and filled with religious connotations.  The actions sequences are fewer and shorter than those in ""The Matrix"".  However, the action in ""Equilibrium"" is still superior, partly because it is more controlled, less flashy, and more realistic.  The incredible stunt scenes, done with very little CGI, complement the story in ""Equilibrium"" without dominating the entire film.  The fight scenes in ""The Matrix"" seem way overdone and excessively gratuitous by comparison.  The quality of Christian Bale's performance is exceptionally above that of Keanu Reeves (who is still as vacuous as he was in his `Bill and Ted' days).There are a few scenes that may upset some highly sensitive people, such as; the incineration of a living woman named Mary, some soldiers shooting some penned up dogs, and the arrest of John Preston's wife at home in front of her children. After all this is a serious film about brutal government and by no means a `family classic' nor a `chic flick'.  Taye Diggs was the only shortcoming of whole movie as he was `too emotional' for his part in it.Here is what ""Equilibrium"" lacks thankfully) ...Cheap, easy, pointless and gratuitous sexUnnecessarily foul and obscene languageA positive view of drugsEmpty humor and meaningless comic reliefA hopelessly depressing ending typical of this kind of movie"	5.0	You Better Buy This One NOW!!	2003-05-14	0	0	0

There is so much wrong with it that it would take to long to write them all down but how about these (SPOILER ALERT) that are not in sequential order:1.  When Preston (and others) are on the med, they're supposed to feel nothing. yet their voices have tone and reflect anger (a lot), fear, etc, etc.2.  The son was never off of his meds, yet he discovers his dad's cache and gives the meds back to cover up the crime.3.  The dog is somehow kept when every movement in the city is observed? Preston lives in what is clearly an apartment-type of building (no gardens or yards) and yet the neighbors never hear a thing? And just where does the pooch ""go""?4.  My second favorite glaring error...the dog is licking the daughter's hand when she's clearly at school...WHAT? How did the dog get there without being shot? Every movement of the school kids is monitored and yet she was able to nonchalantly walk in with a FORBIDDEN object??5. And my absolute favorite glaring error...drum roll, please...everytime Preston shoots a group of soldiers/enforcers/whatevers, it's never just one or two but at least a dozen...and they're all positioned to be as good a target as possible. Not only that, but while he's wiping out the first few, the rest hang around until it's their time to die. Surely if you have super-professionals like the clerics, then the rest of the forces are going to be reasonably well-trained, too, not just waiting for their turn to spew blood.

The story is supposed to be modeled after the Matrix in that is takes in a future time (after WWIII) where emotions and feelings are outlawed. Items such as art, literature and music that invoke strong emotions are also outlawed. One of the opening scenes shows members of the resistance sitting around looking longingly at painting etc-it was really hard not to laugh at this and in the end me and my partner dissolved into a case of the giggles. Bale plays this an agent in the government charged with enforcing the persecution of the resistance movement. The only way that the government can suppress emotions among the loyal is through a dose of an emotion suppressing drug. One day, Bales character misses his dose and begins to experience emotions. He then begins to assist the resistance.It is  very predictable story line. Bale is stiff even after he gets his emotions back. The premise doesn't work well and has to be recalled by silly scenes (such as the one described above).  Overall, very disappointing.	1.0	disappointing	2014-05-04	4	2	2

This seems to be a collage of Orwell's 1984, the Matrix, and a few other movies I can think of, but while the concepts of those movies may fit this one, they just also seem to be missing those key elements that make if unique and fun.

Christian Bale gives a great performance as John Preston, a secret policeman working for a emotion-banning totalitarian government. His job is to kill anyone who skips their daily dose of fluid that takes away all sensation, emotional and physical; but when Preston neglects to take the sense eradicating medicine, he begins to experience feelings and sensations... and doesn't want to let them go.It is really heart warming to see Bale take his character from a calculated killer to a determined freedom fighter, especially during the puppy and sunrise scenes. His resolve to destroy the government that has denied everyone emotional freedom is powerful, and as a result the gunfight scenes are pretty satisfying.The only peeve I have with Equilibrium is it's rushed climax; the main bad guys are defeated far too easily. Also, the special effects look a little dated for 2002 standards, but Bale's acting and the fight scenes more than make up for it.

If that wasn't bad enough, Bale can't act and the gun scenes are truly absurd.  I don't know how people could have found the action scenes impressive--blips of gunfire around a completely black scene (you see, close study of geometry tells the protagonist how to shoot people in the dark!?!)Perhaps teen boys might like it--it has some positive reviews here, but honestly I found it the dumbest movie I've seen since I rented Battlefield Earth.

Wimmer never diverts from the film's psychological and political statements, while still providing credible, edgy, beautiful and somewhat unique action sequences that propel the story rather than detract. The monotone atmosphere created by wadrobe,set design,and photography create a disturbing while effective backdrop,allowing contrast for the developement of the emotionally tortured cleric wonderfully yet subtly played by Christian Bale.The casting was perfect and each performance unique.If you need touchy feely; don't understand good filmmaking and you do not want to think,you should avoid this film.

'Equilibrium' might borrow some of its visual style from the Wachowskis' creation, but it holds its own as a futuristic tale about the corruption of society.Law states people are no longer allowed to feel, and have to periodically inject themselves with an anti-emotional vaccine. Bale's character works as one of the watchers, who delivers those who refuse to abide by the rules to 'the main guy'. One day, he doesn't take the pill, feels horrible about some killed dogs, and rises against the government.Okay, so there isn't much to the plot, but it's supported well by an emotional performance from Bale, astounding set designs, perfectly choreographed beautiful fighting scnes (the movie has its own extreme style of fighting, involving a lot of wireworks and computers).

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3LWRXC8OB7MU7	"Breck Stewart ""Breck Stewart: http://www.brec..."	"I didn't expect much when I rented this DVD.  I had never heard anything about Equilibrium when it came out in theaters last December and I'm sure I wasn't the only one.  The film bombed as could be expected since not many were even aware of its existence.  And then, the marketing team tried to connect it with the Matrix phenomenon to get their products known, even putting references to it on the cover of the DVD.  I agree with some reviews that the implied connection does somewhat of a disservice to the movie.  This is no Matrix as it shouldn't be, even though a few minor elements might be seen by some as ""Matrix-influenced"".After a third world war, a new regime has decreed that feelings are dangerous and the cause of every human being's self-destructive behavior.  Therefore, they decided to suppress emotions in the population by using regular doses of a drug which will inhibit their capacity to feel.  ""Clericals"" are highly trained officiers hunting down and executing ""sense offenders"", who are people that stopped using the drug.  This premise is actually interesting even though not necessarily new, with obvious references to ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"" among others.Shot on a very low budget especially for a sci-fi flick, some of the special effects are definitely on the ...side but surprisingly, the whole look of the movie is quite stunning.  Dark and greyish tones are utilized in different sets to evoke a sense of rigidity and coldness which fits well with the storyline.  The plot is fairly simple but engaging, even though many aspects of it border on the cliche and seem convoluted at times.  Despite its flaws, I found myself quite engrossed in the story even though it still felt a bit like a [copy] from so many other sci-fi movies I had seen.One thing that really irritated me about this though, as some reviewers have pointed out, is the fact that all the actors who were supposed to play characters unable to feel would emote all over the place.  In the short documentary about the making of the movie, the director explains that he made the conscious decision to have the actors avoid playing their characters as ""zombies"" because he felt like it would have been much less interesting for the audience.  Excuse me?  Personally, seeing all those actors show every emotion in the book made the whole purpose of the story seem ridiculous and pointless.Christian Bale as the lead probably gives the best performance, even if he has some trouble making the switch from cold to emotional seem fluid.  Then again, how is the audience supposed to see the difference between a character who is still under the influence of the drug and one who isn't when everybody acts the same way?  I must admit this really bothered me because I feel like the movie could have been even better if the acting was more in accordance with the story.This said, I still enjoyed Equilibrium quite a lot as I was able to suspend disbelief long enough to not let this big flaw ruin my appreciation of the film.  I won't pretend this is a masterpiece but rather, a good ""little"" movie who deserves to be seen and appreciated.  Four stars seemed appropriate here as I felt like, although not the best sci-fi I've ever seen, it is far from being the worst either.  It has a coolness and sophistication which redeems its flaws and I truly feel like the movie deserves an audience.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AVOCNUFOXUCA6	Brian A. Schar	This is a decent movie with some serious problems.  It doesn't bother me so much that it is quite derivative of a number of sources; that's not uncommon in the science fiction genre.  Instead, I was really bothered by two serious flaws.First, the exposition is so thick you'd think that Basil Exposition from Austin Powers is a resident of Libria.  We get title cards and narration at the opening of the movie to explain the basic concepts, which is never a good sign.  Then, 10 minutes later, they tell us all of the same stuff all over again in the context of the movie!  I suspect that the redundant explanation at the beginning was tacked on as a result of testing.  Nevertheless, telling us exactly the same stuff, and a lot of it, twice in ten minutes is boring.  On top of that, some very important exposition (i.e., the fact that Bale is the very top Grammaton Cleric, the best there is) is thrown away so quick that if you cough you'll miss it.Second, the very point of Librian society is that no one feels emotion, and thus there is no war or crime.  Yet, people express emotion all the time in this film.  We notice it first with Taye Diggs, who is supposed to be a Grammaton Cleric with total emotional control, who nevertheless laughs, smiles, and seems to be quite the emotional guy.  Then the Party higher-up shows a lot of emotion, but I could buy that at least, because leaders traditionally do not have to obey the rules they set forth for others.  So, the movie violates its internal logic from the get-go, with Diggs emoting away and making the viewer scratch his head about what's happening.  This is not Diggs' fault.  On one of the extras, the writer/director explains that he let the actors show emotion, because a movie about emotionless zombies would be boring.  That is an amazing admission about your movie, to state that showing its actual premise on screen would be boring, and thus you have to cheat on it in order to make a decent movie.  Wow.  I would refer him to THX-1138 as a counterexample, but what do I know?So, this movie is kneecapped by its own writer and director.  Great.  In other respects, it's very good; the actors do a fine job, the fight choreography is excellent, and the technical aspects are nothing but professional high-end stuff.The Gun Kata stuff is goofy but very well done, and I was happy to suspend my disbelief because it looked so cool.  I did have to laugh when it was introduced as Gun Kata, though, because all I could think of was the classic Gymkata with Kurt Thomas, which about as far from looking cool as you can get.It's too bad the director didn't cut about 20 minutes out of this, tighten up the script, and stay true to his vision.	2.0	Blend Matrix, 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and Logan's Run	2004-05-04	13	6	7
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2DNVNSNP50BB4	Brian	I cannot recommend this movie enough.  The plot is about a utopian society, similar to the novels Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and 1984, (forget authors name).  This is a great movie, for me, especially, since I've read brave new world, and wished there was a movie about it, or similar, that did it justice.  This movie is perfect.  The suspense is very tense, and the drama also.  The actors do a great job in the movie, and everything gives you the feeling of a unfeeling society.  The plot is great, the suspense and action just keeps building up as the story goes along, the main character is at first very stern, and uncompassionate, but as he slowly realizes how wrong everything is, he becomes admirable. Instead of just all of a sudden going against the government, he slowly starts doing things differently, and this makes it more believable.  Usually when i go see movies, i yell at the main character to do something when something goes wrong, in this movie, he always does what you want him too.  Everytime a action scene comes up, its incredibly exciting, me and my brother were shouting cause we loved it so much.  It's a great action movie, a great suspense movie, and a great drama movie, and a great sci fi movie, all in one.  It's, in my opinion, the best movie out right now.  When i read on the cover &quot;better than the matrix&quot; i didnt believe it, but it really is.  It's as thought provoking, maybe even more so, than the matrix, and it doesn't need slow mo bullets and incredible special effects (although the effects are great, especially the city design, and the pale blue atmosphere of the movie)Oh, and for all you slamming it for the &quot;dog scene&quot;.. that scene adds to the drama, because it may seem silly him being that attached to a dog, but that is because he was never attached to ANYTHING, and the dog appeals to him, and stands for much more than just a dog in that scene.  Any critic who slams this movie is an idiot.  This movie made me appreciate reality a lot more.	5.0	one of the best movies	2003-12-22	3	3	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ABJZ0NI9UHZI6	"Brian Ponkey ""BP"""	Equilibrium strives to be a hybrid of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and The Matrix. Unfortunately, it lacks the powerful social commentary of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 and fails to achieve the technical mastery and philosophical underpinnings of The Matrix. In reality, director Kurt Wimmer has merely remade Logan's Run with the stylistic sensibilty of The Matrix. He should have called the movie Neo's Run.Sure, the gun fights are cool, Christian Bale is effective as a poor man's Neo and I actually enjoyed this movie. However, it is absolutely absurd to suggest that this movie even approaches the literary or cinematic greatness of the aforementioned titles. The sets are cheap, the CGI is poor, the costumes are cheesey and Taye Diggs is absolutely abysmal.In short, Equilibrium draws inspiration from a broad spectrum of superior sources and ends up being nothing more than a bit of mindless fun.	2.0	A Mindless Matrix	2004-11-02	19	4	15

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3CTQMVOF32G8J	BrooklynGuy	"Should be on the list of the best 100 science fiction movies ever. No exaggeration. If Hollywood spent more time promoting movies like this and less time promoting junk, we wouldn't be suffering through the two sequels to the Matrix. I enjoyed this movie so much when I saw it on satellite, I went out and bought the DVD.I had the total displeasure of watching Star Trek Nemesis this year. (That dud should be on the list of worst movies ever.) But here's a movie that shows what a science fiction movie should be. An innovative, action-packed movie  that is story and character centered. The action in this movie is something I've never seen before. It was like the director (who also wrote the script) created a new form of martial arts. I viewed it with an adult female and a teenager, and we all enjoyed it.Me, I enjoy a good story. You could put a ton of effects and all the actors in the world, but if there's no story--like in the Matrix Sequels, the latest Star Trek movies, or any of George Lucas's recent Star Wars bombs--then I either shut if off or walk out the theater. So far there have only been a few good sci-fi movies that stand out: The Core, Spiderman, and this movie, to name a very few,  and I bought all three. Meanwhile, I didn't even bother watching the last Star Wars movie when it came out on satellite.I remember the director of The Core saying something that I've been saying for years, only he said it better, ""Movies today have been hijacked by special effects."" He went on to say how he wanted his actors to be the focus of the movie; and what he created was a movie where you cared for the characters. And that's also what happened in this movie.At first you think the story is sort of ridiculous, I mean a society where having feelings is a crime; but then I thought about some of the wacky stuff going on today and how the government is in every facet of our lives, and then I thought it's not that ridiculous after all.  For example, do you think someone even 50 years ago would ever imagine schools would put in metal detectors to check kids for guns?Oh, and no wire tricks in this movie, thank God. If I see one more actor doing an acrobatic kick or jump that defies physics, I think I'd go beyond migraine. And I enjoyed the central character so much, I'm going to check out American Psycho. Okay, enough praise. Check out the movie and see if I was right."	5.0	Great story with a new kind of action.	2004-06-27	7	7	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2H8NP7I9LF6O8	BruceK	"(WARNING!, this movie is very violent, lots of shooting andfighting and killing, but stylized, and not too realistic)I saw equilibrium when it came out, not quite knowing what toexpect.  I was more than pleasantly surprised to find a moviewhile totally fantastical and filled with special effects thatwas so relevant to the this age of terrorism and corporatemass media and individual helplessness that we live in today.I was amazed that this movie was so resonant with myself andwith the audience.  This is the quintesciential target thatscience fiction aims for and so often misses in favor orhorror, or fantasy.  ""Equilibrium"" got it dead on and wasvery entertaining and suspenseful at the same time!""Equilibrium"" is about a world where people are totallycontrolled.  Controlled to the point where the people inthis world police themselves and do not allow themselvesor each other to experience any emotion at all, in fact itis a crime punishable by execution.  They enforce this byextreme regimentation, powerful emotion numbing drugs, anda police force and law enforcement machine that I imagineJohn Ashcroft would dream about.Our hero, John Preston, a so-called, Grammaton Cleric,the elite of the elite secret police and expert practionerof a deadly, pistol wielding, form of kung-fu, is so goodat his job he is able to read the mind of his falteringpartner which leads him into the rebel underground of thisdistropian society to bring the last of these terrorists totheir just reward.  He also seems to be able to use the forceto dodge bullets.At the same time, some of his experiences lead him toquestion the things he has been taught all this life,about the basic realities of his world, other people,and the universe.The betrayal of himself by his society, and the paththat leads to his awakening as a person and a veangefulresponse is strictly fantasy, but really seemed to reachsomething in the theater in which I saw this movie, aswell as it seems about 100% the people here who took thetime to review this movie.I do not want to be too specific, but suffice it to say thatif you at all enjoy movies like ""The Matrix"", or ""1984"",""Logan's Run"", ""THX-1138"", that sort of thing, or extremeaction movies, and movies about the human spririt, albeitin this case pretty far out and fantastical, you willundoubtedly enjoy ""Equilibrium"".If you do see this movie, and you enjoy it, I am afraid youwill have to be watched for the rest of your life though, itmay be too subversive! ;-)"	5.0	Post-1984 dystopian SciFi tale of our time - a must see!	2003-03-10	9	8	1

For 48 minutes the movie was B grade tripe and eventually got interesting. Even with Cheap props and an Orwellian, oppressed society theme (which is tired in today's cinema)... this was a potential winner.  My problem was the desperate attempt to channel The Matrix with knock off action and music which was corny and distracting. This movie should have been made to it's own theme and would have been another Matrix &#34;caliber&#34; movie. Unfortunately, the desperate &#34;cloning&#34; of the Matrix just made it cheap.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	"OK, we've seen this type of movie before. The oppressive future governments ruling with violence and without remorse fighting against rebels wanting to be free. Equilibrium does this style of movie so much better. How? I hear you ask. With the help of Christian Bale. My review will be in three different stages. They are the story, the characters (or character) and the review which is just my opinion on the whole thing.The Story: In the beginning of the 21st century, World War Three ravages the Earth and almost obliterates mankind. The few survivors realise that a fourth world war would mean the end of mankind once and for all. The world is taken over by ""The Father"" and his Tetragrammaton government. The father believes that the cause for WW3 was human feeling and in order to prevent that it must be eradicated. They have created ""prozium"" which is a medication that prevents feeling. But they must also locate and destroy every piece of art, music and other such items that would cause a human to feel. John Preston is a high ranking Grammaton Cleric and is on the front line when bringing ""sense offenders"" to justice. The only problem is that one day when accidentally smashing one of his prozium injections, he starts to feel. Feeling is the only thing that makes us human and Preston seeks to destroy the government that is destroying basic humanity.The Character: John Preston is played by Christian Bale, and I must say the character is portrayed superbly. John Preston is a man who has no emotion and is dedicated to the cause of the Grammaton. He's so dedicated that he even allowed his wife to be executed for being a ""sense offender."" Preston also executed his partner and friend for being a ""sense offender."" This goes to show you the ruthlessness of Preston when he believes in his cause. The interesting part of him, however, is when he goes through the transformation of being completely emotionless to feeling things for the very first time.He begins to dream of his wife, he begins to seek out art and music in the pursuit of emotional stimulation. Seeing him develop and seeing Bale pull it off is what makes this film tremendous.The Review: When I first started watching this film I thought it would just bore the life out of me and I almost switched it off about 10 minutes in. This is simply due to it starting off as completely emotionless, sure the action's cool but without character emotion you're not getting much more than the odd gun fight. The film truly comes alive with the transformation of Christian Bales character. His acting ability really shines when he has to display a character experiencing emotions for the very first time.The film is dark and at times haunting at us being reminded that such a totalitarian government could come to fruition in the near future. Until that time comes we have this film to tide us over. The action scenes are really intense and something this film holds unique to what has become quite a clich&eacute; sub genre. The supporting cast also do their job in holding their own with such a talented actor.It's an enjoyable movie all round and I think everyone will enjoy it. It takes a while to get started but once it does it becomes something very special."	5.0	An Entertaining Adrenaline Ride	2008-07-27	1	1	0

Christian Bale (American Psycho, Shaft) plays the best of the best of law enforcement who makes sure those who break the laws are punished...that is, until the tables are turned on him.Bale plays the hard-lined, emotionless cleric turned &quot;sense offender&quot; to perfection, and it's great to see him play the hero. The movie is also loaded with familiar faces: Taye Diggs, Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Sean Pertwee (Dog Soldiers, Event Horizon, Soldier) and Angus McFadyen (Braveheart).The film starts out slow, but holds one's interest enough to get you to the end, which is where the action really kicks in. Filled with well-choreographed, real-time action sequences to rival that of The Matrix, &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a satisfying sci-flick well worth the viewing effort.	4.0	Holds its own amidst comparisons	2003-05-12	4	4	0

It seemed like a thinly-veiled ripoff of the ""books are banned"" premise from Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  Only there, the premise worked.  Here, the premise is that emotion has been banned.I couldn't buy this for a second.  According to the movie, emotion is caused by things such as old lamps, paintings, and carpets.  In reality, since emotions are caused by, say, having a baby, getting a promotion at work, watching the rain in the afternoon, whatever -- they would be difficult to ban.  Or, if they wanted to ban them, they'd have to go about it in an entirely different way from the method employed in this movie:  antique sofas are now banned, so the public won't be emotional?Beyond that, there was a lot of unnecessary kung-fu, whose connection to the issue of emotional suppression raised by the plot was not clear to me."	1.0	infuriatingly moronic	2011-09-19	17	3	14

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A14LV2SJSR3102	Cartimand	OK, so we all know that Equilibrium is really Brazil meets Fahrenheit 451, with a portion of The Wall, a dollop of Metropolis on top, a hint of Dark City, a side portion of 1984 and just a twist of Matrix, but it's still an entertaining and occasionally thought-provoking 100 minutes.Christian Bale plays a blinder as the dispassionate cleric, whose emotions - now strictly outlawed, start to bubble to the surface. Some of the dialogue with his son is genuinely chilling and the relationship with the doomed prisoner, who awakens memories of his dead wife, is very moving.The criticism levelled at the paucity of action, I feel, was unfair, as Equilibrium is not primarily intended to be an action movie. Its message, if indeed one was intended, is surely to make us consider the qualities of humanity and to be aware of forces that would drive us towards totalitarianism. Admirable stuff indeed!The sets are suitably convincing, in a post-gothic, pseudo-nightmarish fashion, the sound is superb - Dolby digital has rarely sounded better as those bullets seem to ricochet around your living room, and Wimmer's direction is clever and sometimes quite inspired.Why then only three stars? - Simply because the viewer cannot help themselves playing spot the rip-off here every ten minutes or so.Had I not seen the seven movies I mention above (and I'm convinced Wimmer must have studied them intensely), I would give Equilibrium 5 stars easy.	3.0	Hugely derivative but still entertaining sci-fi fable.	2004-09-17	4	3	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A34JGR3LMV1I64	ceffalo	I had no idea what kind of film this was until I actually started watching it.  But, once into it I immediately realized that there really was only one possible outcome to the plot, and was totally correct.  The film attempts to trick the viewer with the notion of unpredictability. It fails at this.  With this kind of actual story scheme the possibilities for story development is full of potential and it should have been fully exploited here, but it fails to do so as it keeps one thing going that really interrupted the flower in this garden: the use of martial arts gun fighting.And, that's really a shame.  Because it could have been one of the great films ever made.  Very Orwellian in theme and content it really does touch at the humanity in the viewer.  It is very intelligently displayed in the sequences in which there is no actual combat.I recommend this film for at least one viewing to all sci-fi/action lovers.  You folks will thoroughly enjoy it.  Christian Bale is absolutely great at his role here.  As is Taye Diggs and Emily Watson.  As mentioned already, though, the style of film really detracts from the potential of the story so don't expect to be enriched by a grand film experience.  If you are looking for films which give you a great story punch in this style then you want to see Bladerunner or Children of Men.I've given it four stars.  I doubt that people not interested in this genre of film would really care for it, so for you folks consider this to be a three star appraisal.	4.0	A dream film for sci-fi/action buffs, but a trifle silly in the end.	2009-07-18	0	0	0

For the first half of the movie, not a single government guy was killed, but a thousand rebels were. For the second half, not a single rebel was killed but government guys all died. The special effects were not detailed enough and looked video-gamey. All the government guys wore motorcycle helmets for some stupid reason. And the plot itself was all about people being anti-emotion, but then even the characters who were supposed to be upholding that position demonstrated endless emotion. It was just thin and poor in almost every way.	2.0	Who seriously thinks this is a 4-star?	2013-08-31	3	1	2

Although the movie's roots are from Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and similar books, it is presented in a cohesive and entertaining way.  The movie includes some great action scenes.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A334OHGVEKC2Z9	"Charles Pinady ""Gwodny"""	This movie features not only the most impressive gunfight sequences in recent movie history but also some very stylish swordfighting scenes. An outstanding performance by Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire) made it all the more enjoyable. His convincing portrayal of the highest ranking Grammaton Cleric, an unfeeling, unemotional, near superhuman killing machine, draws you into the post-apocalyptic, prozac nation of Libria very quickly.Initially, the set designs took me aback; it wasn't as polished as the costume designs but that's quite understandable given the movie's budget. It's definitely no Minority Report nor The Matrix in terms of production quality but it succeeds in bringing its own memorable flavor. Despite the premise and some pretty weak moments along the way, I found myself being entertained by this little gem of a sci-fi action flick.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ANBSW3BALFRR2	Chet Fakir	"If a cartoony conflation of Fahrenheit 451, 1984, THX 1138 with special effects and art direction cribbed from The Matrix appeals to you, then have at it. Christian Bale is a great actor and here is sadly wasted in this pastiche of much better films and literary sources. Ditto Emily Watson, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs. This is as hollow a movie as can be made on a fairly large budget and no more than a by the numbers and for the money effort.The plot, such as it is, concerns a post WW3 society where emotion has been outlawed as a way of controlling the population and ensuring peace. So in order to ensure that no emotion is expressed all artwork, puppies, music, color, freedom, etc has been outlawed. To enforce these laws the population are forced to take emotion supressing drugs and a police force with shoot to kill authorization is employed to eliminate anyone without purely Vulcan emotional control. These uber policemen also have some sort of special emotion detecting power and employ a form of martial arts involving the ability to shoot and kill dozens of people without getting scratched themselves. A sort of ""gun fu"" if you will. Plenty of Matrix like special effects are used and of course the elite police wear black dusters just like Neo! Yay! Christian Bale is one of these uber cops, one of the best actually and he decides without much prompting to stop taking his emotion supressing drugs and the games begin. Sound familiar? It should. What was immediately apparent to me was that if all emotion has been supressed why is everyone dressed in black, why is the leader surrounded by armed guards and protected by a glass cube when talking even tho he is a hologram? Why is murdering the population considered peaceful? Why is it that characters who supposedly are emotion free consistantly express negative emotions? If everyone is on emotion suppressing drugs why would you need to ban artwork in the first place? If noone can react to it, who cares if it exists? Oh forget it, logic is not this idiotic movies strong point."	1.0	A robust example of the paucity of originality in Hollywood today	2013-07-28	6	3	3

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3KIUYDO0A9EY6	chosen12k6	I guess I was a little late to this one but hey it was on Prime for free (technically). So I decided to give it ago, and the following two weeks I watched the movie at least 20-30 times. Lets dive into my review for 2013.The Good:Action: Sequences are still some of the best I have seen. Reminds me slightly of Kung Fu movies but Gun Kata brings a twist. The way it is descibed makes you belive it is almost possible.Direction: Loved it, provided great flow, close-ups of the emotion displayed AWESOME! Found it hard to believe this guy also directed and wrote UltravioletActing: Christian Bale do I need to say more. I am not a fan of Taye Diggs and for the plot of the movie he smiled too much for me. *****SPOILER ALERT****** (You will find this out in the first 2 minutes of the film but if you want to remain completely surpised skip down to the next paragraph) For a nation that is supposed to be without emotion he sure displays alot of it. Anger, confidence, pleasure. Christian Bale meanwhile is cold as ice. Maybe there was an underlying tone that he was not following suit as the rest of the nation.SAFE TO READLocation: Watched this whole movie and wondered where they filmed it. Wonderful location shots definitely gave the feeling of a country torn apart by War.For a miniscule $20million this movie surprised me. In 2004 that was still cheap for a movie. It could have made more but Sony did not want to risk losing profit. I am sure it has made up for it in DVD sales (wish they would release an updated special edition not that blu-ray I keep hearing complaints about)Story:Plot: Many would say it copied from 1984, Farenheit 911 and any other movie containing elements of government control. Unless I am mistaken taking an idea and expanding it is not copying but evolving it especially over 60+ years later for the current generation.Character Developement: Christian Bale-Main Protagonist character developement was awesome, I saw his history, evolve, and what his future self could become.The main Antagonist was great as well with the twist at the end (although I knew it was coming).Taye Diggs once again, I felt was lacking. As I watched the movie for the 15th time I couldnt help but wonder if he was a character rewritten into the screenplay at the last minute. I just never connected with his character the way I did with the others.Supporting Cast: Wonderful, the foils were foils if you will. Fillers were fillers with enough development for you to connect but not confuse you on who/what the story was about.Overall: 4.5/5 (5 Stars on Amazon because I round up lol)The .5 deduction is for Taye  Diggs/Character/Development. I just felt like he was there to confuse you or add that edge of your seat thrill moment. I just never connected with him the way I did with Bale. Most movies I like to connect with both the Protagonists and Antagonists. His character just felt misplaced. Maybe if he was more cold, heartless, and less grinful all the time I would have liked him more.Movie is great and I will purchase immediately if they ever come out with a decent Blu-Ray release ( I doubt) or Special Edition.	5.0	"""Citizens of Libria"" WE HAVE ACHIEVED MOVIE GREATNESS!"	2013-09-19	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AH5Z0XEQHQL0W	"Chris Bundoc ""filmmaniac"""	Equilibrium is a film that I've wanted to see, ever since I saw the trailer. I saw the incredible fight sequences, the exceptional cinematography and the undelivable production design. When this film arrived on DVD I went and rented it right away and WOW!!! Equilibrium delivers on all those levels!!!The movie is set in the future; where people are kept 'intact' by them taking doses of a new formula called Prozium. This formula keeps people from feeling any emotions whatsoever, because the government believes that human emotions get in the way of individuals, which causes the many intolerable violence and deaths in the world.I have to start out by saying that the performance of Christian Bale is really something to see. He is very rigid and strong, which is why the film works. You get a sense of his pain of living life without feeling anything. Also, the supporting roles of Taye Diggs and Emily Watson is great. They add the right amount of attitude and completeness to the film which is great to see in this movie. The action sequences are EXCELLENT. With this new technique called 'Gun-Kata' adding a cool punch of using guns to fight in a way that is both beautiful but dangerous. I cannot say anything bad about this 'Gun-Kata' technique; It's really something to see for yourself.With the positive aspects being said, there are some minor flaws in the film. There are some parts in the movie that are dialogue oriented, and some of them seem a bit too long. But, when the film is right on the action, it makes up for the time of the dialogue.Overall, Equilibrium was a miss in the theatres, but go and give this movie a try and I guarantee that you'll be blown away.	4.0	Not To Be Missed	2003-06-28	0	0	0

But one of their best has just forgotten to take his dose. And now he's feeling.The story pulls you at breakneck speed, you care about these characters, you don't even have time to think about ""i hope this or that happens"" because you'll miss something great in those few seconds.At first i wasn't sure but when  you let it gets going, wow, wow and wow!The action is phenominal.This is a great film that is acted and scripted to brilliance and uses ideas that make you wonder ""why did no one ever do that before in films!""It puts you on edge like nothing else.This is a fav of mine and i'd recommend it no matter what you like.A great film.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ATJ2K0ABQUKHX	"Chris Lockwood ""LockwoodLetter.com"""	This is an enjoyable, if not very original, movie about a society in the near future that has decided it can avoid war by suppressing human emotions. Everyone is required to inject themselves with a Prozac-like drug that greatly reduces feelings. Art is outlawed, and Christian Bale plays a leader of a team whose job is to go around finding art and destroying it and those harboring it. I found that aspect of the story to be a (perhaps unintentional) metaphor for the current failed War on Drugs.It's hard to imagine a totalitarian future that's not influenced by George Orwell, and this film is no exception.There are several well-done fight scenes which are heavily influenced by The Matrix, with excessive gunplay, impossible martial arts moves, and even a leather-clad main character.	3.0	The Matrix meets George Orwell	2006-07-28	5	4	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2JEF6FVKAELMN	Chris O'Brien	"Christian Bale, perhaps one of the most overlooked talents in Hollywood today, delivers his best performance yet. As John Preston, the most esteemed ""Cleric,"" a police-like figure whose responsibility it is to hunt down and kill those reisistance fighters who still cling to human emotion and collect relics of human culture in post-World War 3 civilization, Preston belongs to a government which firmly believes that it is our own emitions which threaten to destroy mankind.  The logical conclusion is to shut these emotions out, which is acomplished through the administration of a special drug.I don't want to summarize the plot for you, but being an employee at a major video rental chain, I see a lot of crap.  And this movie had the potential to join that crap in the stinking, steaming pile of garbage movies that are produced each year without fail.  But something about this picture is different.  Anyone who dismisses the blending of martial arts and gunfighting as ridiculous is obviously not a true fan of the genre, since they accept such equally preposterous concepts such as harnessing the powers of three psychic siblings to tell the future of crime before it is comitted in other similar films (not naming any names).What we have here is a mix of Orwell's 1984 and Bradbury's Farenheit 451, with some Blade Runner and yes, I'm proud to admit, some Matrix-esque slickness thrown in for good measure.  The result is pure energy, a film which oozes cool without overtly trying to do so.  Hell, even Taye Diggs manages a  convincing performance.  For that alone this film deserves my rating."	4.0	One of the 10 best sci-fi films of all time!	2003-06-02	5	5	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3BOUPGDLG7QPP	"Christian Hunter ""Christian Hunter"""	"Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium is a good science fiction movie that went fantastically unnoticed.  It is not however, in my opinion, ""the best Sci-Fi movie ever"", or even ""better than the Matrix"".  Common praise, perhaps intended to raise it from its pathetically unfair obscurity.  That's not to say it shouldn't be seen.  Quite the contrary.  Equilibrium is a movie that, from the beginning, surprises with its excellent cinematography, big-budgetesque effects, and admirable performances.Set in post WW3, Equilibrium portrays a world fed up with violence, so fed up that they turn to imposing a drug that inhibits emotion.  This, by theory, would neuter man of his violent tendencies.Ok, I thought the setup was cool, so to were the excellent performances by Christian Bale and Taye Diggs.  There were however some annoying inadequacies.  Most notable was the obvious emotion shown by those characters who were supposedly emotion-suppressed.  In fact, the enforcers of societies condemnation of emotion are called ""grammaton clerics"" (of which Christian Bale and Taye Diggs both serve), they're supposed to bring ""sense-offenders"" to justice (usually by bullet or baking).  However, in key scenes, these clerics would carry on like a bunch of pre-menstrual high-school girls on prom night.  That really hurt the immersion factor.Another minor issue surrounded the ability of these clerics to seemingly bend time and dodge bullets.  About midway through the movie they give that ability some basis, but it would have been cooler if they beefed the science of that up a bit, and did it earlier, as most viewers will probably be going ""um, ok, cool outfits and all, but how come the clerics are dodging bullets, and everyone else is getting mowed""?Minor gripes.  Fact is, I went into this movie with very low expectations, and was completely blown away.  I would have watched The Sound of Music in its entirety just for access to the 5 minute fight-climax at the end of the Equilibrium.  Truly fantastic!Anyway, I hope you enjoy as much as I did.Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California"	4.0	A must-see for Sci-Fi fans.	2005-03-28	13	12	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2Y7SD9X8BDWGA	Christopher Weiss	The plot of this movie is absurd.  It brought in elements of 1984, Brave New World, etc., using drugs to control the populace.  However, how many truly enjoyable science fictions stories are realistic?Christian Bale was very good in his role as the Grammaton Cleric, who numbly watched the incineration of his wife and who kills rebels as easily as a normal person would swat flies.  His action scenes are believable and beautifully choreographed.  The precision of his character's moves were pure visual candy.  The fight scenes alone would make a fantastic montage.  One of the movies' weaknesses was Bale's children, who were just too unbelievable.This movie was a sleeper, and I see why.  The story lacks general appeal and the visuals are not enough to draw in the average movie fan.  The sets are too drab, which unfortunately was one of the points of the story.  Unlike the matrix, which has beautiful visuals, Equilibrium would have lost something if it did what would have made it more visually appealing.For any science fiction fan, this movie is perfect.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A76OD7P2S5LL4	C. Mitchum	"This movie borrows from enough famous sources to feel familiar and yet throws in some twists to keep you watching.  Set design and wardrobe definitely bring to mind, Gattica, The Matrix, even Blade Runner and Dune to a degree.  THat is to say it looks mostly dark and cool.A few plot holes undermine the premise.  For example, the introductory voice-over needs to explain why some ""feeling"" is obviously legal and other forms of emotion are not.  Ambition, jealousy and pride exist, all three are in the Diggs character.  In fact, Bale is married with children and showed loyalty to the state.  All these emotions, allowed in a Prozium nation.I can forgive the casual burning of the Mona Lisa (wouldn't that be a great find for ""emotion hunters?"") but after a brilliant fight sequence, the entire communications network was brought down by shooting out 8 or 10 workstation screens.  One last gripe:  Couldn't the producer do better than a whited-out late model Caddilac Seville as a ""car of the future?""The good stuff?  Bale's performance was gripping; the whole premise makes the emotions he shows all the more meaningful.  By the way what was Keanu Reeve's excuse for being stiff?  The Matrix never suppressed emotion!The concept and delivery of guns married to martial arts was a fresh and stunning visual concept.  Sure, it was surreal...but it was cool!  The twists that Equilibrium uses to avoid total predictability are effective.

Great actors, great wardrobe, great gun fights, great city, nice story and a really, really badass main character that cancels all emotions when he starts kicking ass.The 4 stars are because at some moments it looks like an Apple TV commercial, and that's just plain dumb...and because he decides to kill 10 fellow humans for doing their job over the life of a Puppy...and that is also dumb.Don't compare it.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A4316PPLD6UM6	C. Norman	No, I actually liked the  movie a lot- unfortunately Amazon.com does not provide a way to rate their own DELIVERY  of the movie. With every movie that I have watched so far on Amazon's streaming service there has been the same problem; lousy sound. I mean , I have to turn up the volume so much just to hear the voices that the feedback through the speakers produces background noise that makes what the actors are saying almost incomprehensible. This is not the film's fault, but that of the provider of the streaming (Amazon). I  do not have this problem with videos and movies downloaded from Itunes. In truth, the movie itself deserves at least 4 stars, but Amazon needs to correct the sound problem and provide a way to criticize its delivery service.	2.0	Movie was good, but sound was terrible...	2012-12-04	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1BAU33PV3HMK7	Cobalt	I'm really happy to see that this extremely underrated movie is finally getting the recognition it rightfully deserves in the home video market.  When it was officially released in theaters in 2002, it didn't even make back half of its $20 million budget.  Of course, at the time, The Matrix was all the rage, so everyone probably thought that this movie was just a half-a$$ed ripoff.  After watching it in all its Bluray HD quality, I've come to realize that this is an entirely unique movie that stands on its own and has everything a good, quality movie should have: it actually makes you think, it has knockout action scenes, and the acting is amazing.Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, Equilibrium takes place in the far future, where a third world war has almost completely decimated humanity.  A new government, the Tetragrammaton Council, has risen out of the ashes, led by an elusive figurehead known only as &#34;Father.&#34;  It decides to eradicate the one element they believe to be the root of all evil: human emotion.  The general population is forced to consume a drug called Prozium, which suppresses any emotion in them.  In addition, anything that is likely to trigger emotion, such as music, paintings, and books is automatically destroyed.  However, an underground movement has arisen, consisting of people labeled by the government as &#34;Sense Offenders.&#34;  They utilize specially-trained government assassins called &#34;Grammaton Clerics,&#34; who are trained in the unique, powerful fighting style of &#34;Gun Kata,&#34; to hunt down and eliminate the sense offenders.Christian Bale stars as Captain John Preston, one of the highest-ranking and most effective Grammaton Clerics, who butchers sense offenders without mercy or remorse.  However, he catches his partner, played by Sean Bean in a short but effective cameo, reading a book.  Preston's partner explains that once he rejected Prozium, he ultimately realized how bad it was to live without emotion, and that he would gladly trade his life to be able to feel again.  Preston is forced to kill him after he starts to raise his gun.  After that, Preston accidently misses his regular dose of Prozium, and slowly begins to realize that the world around him is a lie.  Of course, Preston must attempt to maintain his unemotional facade in front of everyone else, especially his new, ambitious partner (Taye Diggs).It's hard to deny the similarities between Equilibrium and The Matrix Trilogy.  Both movies take place in a warped, dystopian future, both movies have relucatant heroes ultimately fighting with the resistance against the dictatorial higher power, and both movies have incredibly over-the-top, stylistic action sequences.  However, there are also distinct differences.  Whereas The Matrix is a virtual world that doesn't actually exist, Equilibrium's world of Libria is completely real.	5.0	More realistic, relatable, and engaging than the Matrix, in my opinion	2014-01-30	1	0	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1ICAHY1ZAQC92	Colorado Citizen	a cheap knock-off of other such movies - Matrix - Minority Report, etc.  Concept of human nature void of emotions is intriguing, but human actors - with their emotion intact - can't accurately portray emotionless characters.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1627O18BU0CUG	Connie Hughes	The movie reminded me of what Hitler tried to do; force allegiance to himself, & kill the reluctant.  The premise of the movie was unrealistic, since it was dealing with humans, who are inborn with feelings.  They cannot just be legislated out, as they found out, nor drugged into oblivion indefinitely.  It was a reminder of what humanity is capable of, in the worst sense, & how a chosen few with some sense left, have to restore right to the world.  Just a little too far out for my liking.  I like sci fi, but this was too far fetched.  Not suitable for the mentally unstable or youth.	3.0	Futuristic reminder of what Hitler tried to do (sort of)	2014-03-13	1	0	1

I mean, sure - I could easily rip this movie to shreds with my own words (and have a lot of fun doing so), but in the end you might not really trust my perspective and then you might end up actually seeing this film.Since I don't want that fate to befall you (or anyone else on this planet), I thought it might be more persuasive to instead use the words of this movie's director, taken directly from his commentary track.  After all, who would know better about the merits (or lack thereof) of this particular cinematic offering?  So, without further adieu, allow me to present Kurt Wimmer's very own remarks to describe this thing he has made:""Do I actually have the b@!!s to hang the movie on this concept, which may fail?  And it did fail.  The movie itself failed.""""Critics laughed at this scene, and for the life of me I don't know why.""""I failed to a large degree in this scene; it doesn't have the power or resonance that it could have or it should have.""""I have no idea how I could have made it better - I just think I sort of reached the limits of my filmmaking ability.""""In this scene, I had an idea that actually worked for once.""""I basically ran out of time, as usual...""The second editor on this film (who had never cut a film before) was ""one of the few people who was actually an advocate of this film while we were shooting and was optimistic about what this film could be"" (the first editor asked if he could leave, by the way)""Here's an example of creative bankruptcy at its best: I just couldn't decide what he should be wearing...so I put this decision off...until basically the day of and ended up sticking him in a plaid shirt, which looks kind of silly I think.""""It's interesting how sterile these split dioptre shots were.  I really, really don't like them.  I was just dying to do one of my own, and I doubt I will ever do them again.""""The composition has clearly fallen apart - that's what happened to me here.""""When I watch these fight scenes, I kind of cringe a bit because I know we could have done them so much better""This scene is ""a moment of slightly flawed comedy which doesn't really work.  I've concluded I'm not good at it and I'll just stick with the action.""""In the final analysis, this film was eviscerated by the critics.  It was really vilified, and I don't fully understand it.""Um.  Kurt.  So as to aid in your understanding of the critics' vilification, might I refer you to your own commentary?

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"The cataclysm wrought by a third world war at the onset of the 21st century has forced the surviving world to abopt a new form of government to prevent the obliteration of the planet.  In the Kurt Wimmer written and directed intense sci-fi thriller ""Equilibrium"" the society known as Libria suppresses the act of feeling in its inhabitants.  With the aid of a drug Prozium, which all citizens inject at regular intervals, all emotions and feelings are quashed.  A vast militaristic organization has been created to root out any undesirables that don't follow these societal tenets.  At the apex of the enforcement arm are the Gramatan clerics, a group of super martial arts practitioners.Christian Bale stars as John Preston the most highly ranked Cleric with unsurpassed fighting skills.  Pure of thought and uncompromising, Bale and his partner Errol Partridge, played by Sean Bean comb the nether regions outside the city for rebels and to destroy any artifacts that could promote emotion and feelings.  His unflagging loyalty to societal head, Father played by Sean Pertwee is shaken when he is forced to kill Bean who has committed an unspeakable sensory crime.Bale purposely avoids dosing himself with Prozium which clears his mind and allows him to reconsider the jaded mores of the society.  Working with an ambitious and suspicious new partner Brandt played by Taye Diggs, he secretly joins forces with the underground while appearing to stalk them, striving to topple the gonernment.The underrated ""Equilibrium"" plays like a cross between ""Brave New World"" and ""The Matrix"" and compares quite favorably with the later.  Impressive action sequences filled with incredible gunplay propels the film forward, creating an exhilarating viewing experience."	5.0	Unsung sci-fi view of the future	2006-05-10	5	3	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1UTVEGO99ZXGZ	Craig McPherson	I guess there was some sort of twisted logic at work in the minds of the studio execs who decided to pitch this movie as a quasi-Matrix or Minority Report clone. It's too bad because while this film is far from original in it's concepts, it's a thoroughly excellent, entertaining, and intellectually engaging bit of film making and has nothing even remotely in common with the two aforementioned films.While it borrows heavily from the concepts and themes behind the books Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, it does so in its own unique way to deliver a story that works equally well in terms of social commentary and action.The added element of &quot;Gun Ka&quot;, the form of martial art gunfighting practiced by the film's clerics, is superbly photographed and riveting.While not a perfect film, it's flaws are minor at best and easy to forgive.A not to be missed film for the sci-fi connoisseur.	5.0	Easy to overlook, but not to be missed	2004-01-28	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A6J8D9V5S9MBE	Curtis G	"The biggest question I have about this movie is: Why didn't Dimension promote it (more heavily, if at all)? I saw not one commercial; in fact, I'd never heard of ""Equilibrium"" until yesterday, on a gun-related Web forum. I figured that unless there was some really good word of mouth, it wouldn't be in theatres long, so I rushed out last night to see it. I wasn't disappointed. (The answer is, Dimension had already made back their money on foreign pre-sales and didn't want to risk cutting into their profits by spending a lot on domestic advertising.)Sure, there's a lot that's familiar (the whole ""1984"" milieu), but that's not necessarily bad. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has taken a lot of influences (""The Matrix"" is an obvious one, ""Metropolis"" less so) and molded them into a movie that's both familiar and refreshing, with some nifty twists. It's not perfect, but it's very, very good, and eminently watchable. Although the pacing could have been tightened up, it was shot extremely well and looks as if it cost much more than it did. The ""gun-kata"" scenes were suitably over the top (there were more than a few ""Oh, yeaahhhh!"" moments), while still managing to skirt the edges of possibility. Take note that it's no more a ""gun fu"" movie than it is a samurai-sword movie; instead, the weapons are part of who John Preston (Bale) is and what he does. The story itself follows Preston's journey from unfeeling tool of the State to fully human (and flawed) savior.What's funny is that viewers are giving the movie rave reviews, while the ""mainstream"" media critics are panning it. I suspect it's because the movie's conservative bent offends their delicate statist sensibilities (the State is supposed to be good and benevolent, not evil).I peg ""Equilibrium"" as a sleeper: It won't do huge business in theatres, but it's destined to become a cult classic when it hits DVD. Still, I plan to see it a few more times before then."	5.0	Good stuff. But why didn't Dimension promote it?	2002-12-09	4	4	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2G0KS2DQPFI9U	"cybergel78 ""cybergel"""	"This movie can be summarized as 1984 meets The Matrix. It certainly invokes the Orwellian world as well as the visual anime style of The Matrix. However, what makes this movie so unique is the way how the world of Equilibrium is being protrayed as so ""white"", so ""anti-septic"". Everything looks so clean. Of course, one could not ignore the big television screens, the ""Father"" figure, the grammatron clerics as the embodiment of the thought police.Since 1984 has been made and remade quite a number of times, the addition of a kung-fu style, ""gun-kata"", utilized by the clerics would only add to stylistic updadte of such visited and re-visited material.This DVD edition has certainly excellent transfer. I had the good fortune to compare this with the region 2 copy and found that the picture quality in this region 2 DVD is sharper and clearer. Audio-wise, they sound the same. The only differences were probably the trailers and the tv spots. In this edition, it's the UK version is the better one.

Beyond the exceptional Zen, sci-fi, martial arts moves, and stunning performance by gorgeous Christian Bale, this movie has an intense message, ""Uniformity at the expense of one's emotions, makes one lose what it is to be human.""  On many levels, this movie reminded me of Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"", Vonnegut's ""Harrison Bergeron"", Orwell's ""1984"",  and Huxley's ""A Brave New World"".This movie portrays the future as a cold, sterile, charred place, where everyone conforms to one mind, one order; under the rule of the one they call ""Father"".  War has been vanquished but at the cost of human emotions. All emotions are outlawed, and all feelings are controlled by a drug known as Prozium.  In a city called Libria, most likely the central nexus of the ""one world"" lives an elite force called the ""Grammaton Cleric"" whose sole task is to eradicate all human emotion and anything or anyone that provokes it.  Those who illegally feel are called Sense-phants and they or anyone associated with them are quickly annihilated.  But the state has something beyond underground rebels to worry about.

In many ways I enjoyed it more than the first Matrix film because it's less about special effects and more about an engrossing storyline.  The premise of the film isn't original like many critics have been quick to point out, but it's presented in an original style that is very entertaining.  I like to describe it to friends as a sci fi Matrix like film that incorporates martial arts with guns.  There are some gratuitous action scenes but for the most part the action is really cool to watch.  Especially since they use really neat looking guns and every one is dressed up in chic and futurist clothes :)The acting, the music, the sound effects, and the script all work well together.  I really like the fact that the movie centers around Christian Bale's character rather than the whole anti-authoritarian premise.  As a viewer you actually care about the character John Preston.  It's the quiet scenes within the film that really lend strength of purpose to the action scenes.  Unlike Neo in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; you learn about Preston's past, his wife, the fact that he has kids.  It's great how you don't only remember the action scenes but the quiet scenes as well, like the extermination of the dogs, the arrest of Preston's partner (Sean Bean), and the execution of the rebels.  There is one scene in the film where the main character shares a quiet moment with a puppy and yet seconds later he is blowing away a squad of soldiers.  Surprisingly, scenes such as this worked really well together and weren't inappropriate at all.  That's one of the best things about this film.  It's the fact that SO many things could of went wrong, but it turned out to be very well done.  Highly recommended.	5.0	An excellent film...	2003-10-07	0	0	0

The fight scenes (which i must add contain the now generic ""Katana"" although its acctually done write in this movie)have not a hint of bullet time due to the budget but subtle usage of occasional slow motion is all you need. Ok the idea that a man can know exactly where his enemies are at all times and never taking a scratch is a bit far fetched but if we wanted realism you shouldnt watch sci-fi.The acting is awsome, Bale gives a fantastic portrayle of a blank slate being ruthlessly thrust into a bleack but colourful world. Sean Bean, one of my favourite actors is at his best although his role is small and entirely voice acted i really felt for the guy.Of course there are plot holes the size of texas but its dealing with an issue that is in reality flawed so i ignor that fact and concentrate on the emotion that is so tied to the soundtrack it is precedented.I could say more, but a keyboard cannot express it, oh yeah did i mention the music rules all."	5.0	I hope it gets reloaded	2003-08-13	1	1	0

No worries.You get to spend most of your day gazing up at the huge, bloated, godlike head of Sean Pertwee (""Father"", Equilibrium's economy-class rendition of Big Brother) blaring away at you 24/7. Your reaction? Hey man, it's cool.Yup: Prozium is a real wonder-drug. And if you miss your dosage? See those big guys in the leather trenchcoats with the black-visored helmets and the itchy trigger fingers?Of course, there is another way: go off the Prozium, quit cold turkey, begin to feel, start an art collection. Trouble is, government in the world of Equilibrium doesn't come calling with public donations to your arts foundation or underground symphony.They come with a Death Squad.They send in Society's ultimate weapon: the Disciples of the Tetragrammaton---the Grammaton Cleric. The Grammaton Clerics let the shock troops do all the initial wetwork and perimeter-securing, stride into the dark little warrens where you and your Picasso-loving rebel scum are hiding, show off their astounding Gunkata (a discipline where the adept wields his weapons in mathematically and geometrically precise sweeps and arcs designed to maximize carnage on the enemy and minimize damage to the Cleric. It's neat. Where do I sign up?), provide you with about 300 extra air-holes free of charge, and then pay you and your ""Feelings"" the ultimate compliment: they introduce a little napalm and chordite appliqu&eacute; to your bootleg copy of the Mona Lisa.That sounds pretty harsh, you might say. And I might say: consider the alternative: the brutal b*tch for humanity that was the 20th century. Father would back me up, citizen. Mankind nearly didn't survive. We made it through four World Wars, nuclear apocalypse, mass murder, environmental catastrophe, ecological collapse, mass genocide and ethnic cleansing, even 24-hour Jerry Springer episodes.Prozium is far better than the alternative. The problem starts when Grammaton Cleric Preston (Bale, who is so good he makes you cares despite the overall silliness) goes off his meds.Alright: first off, I was told ""Equilibrium"" was a mind-f*ck flick: much like the Matrix. I expected that Bale's character, once off the drug, would start realizing that something truly horrible was up---like, you know, when Rowdy Roddy Piper in ""They Live"" when Piper puts on the shades and realizes the yuppies are actually revolting outer-space monsters with meaty, veiny heads. Something like that.I thought maybe Bale would discover that Libria was ruled by giant carnivorous pink lemurs, or that the citizens of Libria were actually being forced to eat their own snot while Father took pictures and laughed.Nothing at all like that, I'm afraid. Bale wakes up, starts grooving on fine art and getting down with his erstwhile buddy Partridge(another great, grounded performance by Sean Bean)'s sudden interest in the poetry of Yeats, and starts to feel. You can probably connect the dots and fill in the plot from there.But that said, ""Equilibrium""---which doesn't have an original bone in its sleek little body---entertains. Director Kurt Wimmer has certainly added something to the bubbling cauldron of cultural Cool with Gunkata: even if it's not a real martial art, it should be. I'd take lessons.The acting is the glue that holds the flick together: Bale is astonishingly good here and provides the movie with so much gravity that it seems more profound than it actually is. Good job! Sean Bean is equally excellent: the two make such a convincingly formidable duo that a `twist' 15 minutes into the film is actually compelling. I've never been a big Angus Macfadyen (Dupont; the actor was Robert the Bruce in ""Braveheart"") fan: he doesn't give me any reasons to start here. Maybe it's the weak chin and the pouty face.And the movie looks absolutely awesome: the firefights are great, the choreography is stunning, Kurt Wimmer keeps the pacing so tight that even as the wheels come off the wagon and the seams start showing, you're just so overloaded you don't notice. As for the film's big `message': is Utopia worth the emotional price?I don't know about that, and I don't know that I care. Things blowing up? Check! Christian Bale looking hip and sleek as he robs Neo's wardrobe? Check! Lots of wire-fu and gunkata-fu? Check and check! Hip white cadillac with white interior you get to drive if you make it through Grammaton Cleric training? Big check.Dose up on your Interval---or hey, go the cold turkey art-appreciation route and don't---and check ""Equilibrium"" out.JSG"	4.0	Going off the Meds	2005-11-07	4	4	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	I saw this movie twice! I must be crazy right.Well the first time I saw it I was restless and watching it by myself suffering from insomnia or something. Apart from the last 10 minutes or so of the movie I thought it was overall rather dull and uninspiring. I thought - maybe it's just me, I'm not super crazy about science fiction so it's probably an okay movie if you are into that sort of thing.The next day I showed the DVD to my landlord (who is a big, big sci-fi fan), he thought it sounded 'interesting' so the next evening we all (five of us) sat down to watch it. I knew I was in trouble when 30 minutes of the way through the movie I heard my landlords voice booming from the other end of the room, 'Tell me it get's better.'The truth is this movie only 'get's better' minutes before the end. It's drab, dreary, sterile and altogether the most boring movie I have ever seen. I am usually very easy on movies but this one needs a public health warning attached to it so I feel compelled to write this review to warn other possible purchasers to save their money.The story is very much influenced by 'Fahreheit 451' and revolves around a society where 'feeling' is outlawed. Christian Bale plays a cleric (a policeman with the ability to tell when people are feeling) and (through some power never explained) able to tell where works of art and a room full of candles are through solid walls. He is charged with attempting to inflitrate the resistance and things are going okay until HE accidently knocks over his daily dose of a drug which he needs to not feel. I capatalize HE intentionally, because that point blows apart a gaping plot hole towards the end of the movie.Avoid at all costs.	1.0	It's not just me **phew**	2004-07-31	23	4	19

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A27BF3YQB9N8AH	Darth Rater	This is a well-done sci-fi, depicting a future following a third nuclear war.  The survivors are so appauld at the warfare that has dominated much of human history, and believing that our emotions are the root of all evil, this futuristic society chooses duty over feelings with the help of a government supplied drug that helps to keep emotions in check.  An elite police force highly trained in their own unique martial arts works to maintain, &#34;Equilibrium,&#34; of society, but they are pitted against an unseen underground that prefers to, &#34;Feel.&#34;  The overall tone of the film is predictably depressing in this emotionless world.  Ultimately, the conflict boils down to, &#34;What is it to really be human?&#34;  Of particular interest is the theory of the elite police force that by studying a multitude of physical combat situations, distilling by statistics the line of fire and typical reactions of participants, that a martial art can be developed that produces success from statistical outcomes.  Lots of violence, shooting, swords, physical combat.	4.0	Reminds me a little of the Matrix	2014-01-20	1	0	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A29X35MG107YGJ	Dave	In the future (this time), WWIII happened and humanity has lost it's way (as usual). After the aftermath, the government decided to become fascists. NOW, the human race is controlled by a drug  that makes people completely emotionless to prevent war and all that. An elite team lead by some guy (CHRISTIAN BALE) eliminates sex offenders (people who feel), all forms of art work, puppy dogs (I cried over that) and anything that will make a human emotional cuz feeling is illegal! But the dude forgot to take his dosage one day and starts feeling and sees the world in a whole different way! So now he finds himself working with sex offenders to battle the fascist emotionless government!This is probably the first movie to ever come up with the concept GUN KATA. I loved that! This is an original film without a doubt! A very good story, spectacular acting, awsome action, and original! I predict in the futrue that other people will rip-off the GUN KATA concept and use it for their own movies! I'll bet my life on it! My only complaint is the film should of  focused more on the action rather than making it a sci-fi thriller but that doesn't take away anything from this movie! Still highly recommended movie!	4.0	LOVE IT!!!	2003-09-05	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A12H1RI9BVKFKN	Davey Jones	"Why was this movie so universally loathed among critics?  (Well, not quite-Roger Ebert once again shows he has taste.)  Equilibrium is every bit The Matrix's equal when it comes to action, and it packs an even greater emotional punch than that much-lauded film.  Christian Bale plays John Preston, a cleric of the new order of mankind-an oppressive dictatorship that, by mandate of ""The Father"", forces citizens to take emotion-killing drugs.  Violators, or ""sense offenders"", are punished by death, so it's hard to blame the zombie legions for taking their medicine every day.  At first glance, Preston appears to be a villain, but little by little he comes to rediscover what it is to experience emotion.  This leads him to seriously question his loyalties.  Rather than lazily run on autopilot, the movie is unpredictable, subtle, and tense. It is full of delightfully clever little touches; Bale's Mona Lisa smile was too perfect, as was the little boy telling his sister not to play with her cereal-you'll see what I mean.  Equilibrium is a movie that separates the jaded critics from those who still know what a classic feels like.  Batman Begins was good, but this in my opinion is Christian Bale's finest hour."	5.0	It's not as good as The Matrix.  It's better.	2005-07-25	7	6	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AS4TGDRGMEKER	"David Debor ""ddebor"""	"This film appears to have been made within minutes of the director finishing the novel 1984.  The plot scheme and motifs in Equilibrium are almost identical to those found in George Orwell's classic.  However, in an attempt to make the story more contemporary, this work resorted to excess gun violence and underground dealings as cheap thrills for a certain age demographic.  Probably the most painful ting to watch is the acting; the dramatic stances and mundane voices just scream ""Matrix"" and come off as a very poor performance.  The overall aspect of the film was enjoyable to watch if you don't exactly want to witness something more creative and just want the ""SparkNotes"" version of 1984.In short, you will enjoy this film if you liked the book 1984 and don't want to watch something that builds upon it.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3A2G2BXS6PE3D	David D. Gallion	I truly enjoyed viewing Equilibrium. The story itself certainly has similarities with other movies of the genre, but delivers sufficiently new angles and aspects so as to make it thought-provoking and even compelling. The main characters are interesting and complex, while some supporting characters provide depth and variety. The cinematography is first rate, as are the action scenes. The textures of the various settings provide visually interesting contrasts and enhance the story without being overwhelming or being a distraction. Plot and character developments that would normally feel predictable are simply made inconsequential by the superb performances delivered by several of the actors. The movie contains more than a few violent scenes, with some being particularly violent, and thus the film may not be a good choice for more sensitive individuals, but I never felt that any of the violence was gratuitous. This film will likely deliver an enjoyable roller-coaster ride to most viewers.	5.0	Pleasant Surprise	2013-10-30	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3QYDAHN8EFXUK	David Group	You've got to give this movie credit-- it does the best it can with a low budget.  The special effects run hot and cold (the cityscape is amazing, but the darkly-lit interiors practically scream &quot;No Budget&quot;); the performances are fine; and the direction more than competent.  Unfortunately, the screenplay needed work-- a lot of work.  What can you say about a movie where violence has supposedly been eliminated, but everyone is packin', and there's a gun battle about every fifteen minutes?  And why eliminate *all* art?  I can understand destroying rap CDs or slasher movies, but the Mona Lisa???  Seems kind of counter-productive to me.  The gun battles were the most interesting part of this too-bleak movie, but even that reached the height of silliness when Bale-- with his two pistols-- wipes out some fifty gunmen with automatic weapons (who, incidentally, are all lined up like ducks in a row).The director's commentary is interesting mainly in recounting the numerous problems he had in filming this movie.	2.0	Equilibrium is off-balance	2003-10-03	9	5	4
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2OVUDBRWGX0LL	David	This movie has everything that Matrix Reloaded should have had but didn't.  The movie is set in the near, post-apocolypse future, in a world divided into sterile technology and burned out ruins.  The film borrows elements from Farenheit 451, Gattaca, 1984, Metropolis, and even Logan's Run.Christian Bale's character, unlike Reeves' Neo, is someone you can truly sympathize with--self-deprived of emotions but ultimately all-too-human.  He begins to struggle in a society that adopts the creedo that only man's inhumanity to man can stop man's inhumanity to man.The story is well-written and paced.  The fight scenes, using what is referred to as &quot;gun kata,&quot; are extraordinary.  Also impressive are the sets and CG (limited, thankfully).  While the ending is expected, it does leave the viewer asking, &quot;Okay, what do they do now?&quot;.Rent or buy it, it's worth the money either way!	5.0	Superb Addition to the Genre	2003-06-01	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2T8K67A7T96HG	David K. Fried	"Though I had some reservations about the film given the many comparisons I was hearing to The Matrix, they are only similar in their action sequences.Action!While The Matrix has its ""bending of physics,"" Equilibrium has ""Gun Kata,"" whereby a person learns through rigourous training how to kill rooms filled with people using guns in precise short motions for maximum effect. It sounds odd, but when you see it in action you'll appreciate the effect. Later on in the movie they even use kattanas to do battle. Suffice to say, the action sequences are pretty cool.Plot!The plot for Equilibrium is nearly an exact replica of George Orwell's book (and the movie) 1984 (written in 1940 as a desperate warning about where the current state of politics was going to take the human race). They chose to take from the right book though, as George Orwell's book becomes more relevant every year.The basic premise of the movie is that human emotion has been abolished and everyone must take a drug that inhibits any feelings. The main character (Christian Bale) works for an agency that tracks down people who have abandoned the drug and are ""feeling."" Usually to arrest them, but often to kill them as people who have tasted emotion are rarely willing to give it up again. A ""Big Brother"" figure gives speeches to the world about how emotion has destroyed the world in the past with wars and racism and violence. At one point, the main character's partner (in stopping emotion feelers) reveals that he has abandoned the emotion stopping drug. The main character must then make a choice, and from that point on the world ceases to be a simple place for Christian Bale. Anything more would ruin the story for you so I'll stop here. However, if you decide not to see Equilibrium, I highly recommend reading 1984 due to its ever increasing relevance in the modern day.Acting!Christian Bale does an excellent job portraying the main character (John Preston) torn between a world of emotion and the strict and regimented world that is familiar and almost comforting to him. The other actors in this film (and there are many that will make you go, wait, isn't that the guy/gal from Bravehart/Golden Eye/Punch Drunk Love/etcetcetc) do an excellent job as well, though there are several moments where they go a bit over the top trying to get across what their character is supposed to be feeling.Directing, Editing, Scenery!The directing and editing both seem well done. No complaints. The scenery is quite drab being all grey and blue, but it is a necessary component of the ""world is not allowed to feel emotion"" stuff that plays out in the movie. It also helps to accentuate the few bits of color that you do end up seeing.Overall!While not quite a full 4 star movie, Equilibrium has its moments and is a good take on the book 1984. If you are into high action movies, or if you appreciate dark future world plots, then you will probably enjoy Equilibrium."	4.0	1984 meets The Matrix	2005-08-09	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3M76PE0QTCK2J	David Skeele	"As I state in the title of this review, Equilibrium may just be the most unfairly reviled thriller ever made.  Most mainstream critics panned it, and Entertainment Weekly (whose opinions I otherwise respect) recently included it in a list of ""Most Embarrassing"" movies for their respective stars, even though the critic who listed it unwittingly revealed in his description that he hadn't actually seen it!!  The main criticisms leveled at it are: 1) It owes too much to other dystopian visions; 2)The CGI is mediocre; and 3)There's scene in which Christian Bale fights to defend a puppy.  Of these, only 2) is valid: some of the CGI really does suck (especially in the closing sequence), but that is clearly because all of the budget was put into the fight sequences.  And what fight sequences!!  The idea of ""gun katas"" based on statistical data about where opponents are likely to fire and seek to evade return fire is brilliant, and the action sequences are some of the most exciting I have ever seen.Disposing of the other points, there is nothing wrong with being influenced by the likes of Brave New World and 1984: they are masterworks and it is likely that EVERY fictional dystopia will bear their imprints in some way.  This movie finds enough originality (in the idea of a society repressing every emotion, and training ninja-like ""clerics"" to enforce it) that it is hardly plagiaristic.  And finally, the widely-mocked scene of puppy defense is perfect for the particular moment in the film.  The POINT is that he's reached such a state of newfound emotional connection that he's willing to dispose of a couple dozen cold and unfeeling killers to protect one innocent and vulnerable being.  And it's an absolutely kick-ass scene!!  (Check out the shot from above, with Bale's gun flashes illuminating his kata pattern as he mows down storm troopers from inside a crowd of them.

A futuristic tale is in the strong shadow of Bradbury's Fahrenheit 411, so strong, that you wonder why they just did not call it an outright remake.  Equilibrium is set in the post World War III era, where they evidently watched Star Trek one time too many and bought into Doctor Spock's lack of emotion is superior to human emotions.  To see this robot-state exists, where all emotions are suppressed, the government ruthlessly removes anything to provoke feelings.  In Bradbury's tales it was books - Fahrenheit 411 being the temperature at which paper burns.  In this movie, it's anything that provokes passion, senses.  Books, Grand Masters' paintings...even puppies.It's beautifully lensed, and writer-director Kurt Wimmer gives you a pinch of this and a dram of that, blending a Metropolis and Fahrenheit 411 feel to paint this bleak picture of the possible future.  Christian Bale (Reign of Fire) turns in a strong performance as the dispassionless top cop, who busts the ""sense offenders"" It's no surprise when the work eventually gets to him, and a gentle fuzzy puppy breaks through his already cracking resolve, setting him off in a near one man crusade to make change.  His performance is a tour de force, raising the movie to astronger level than the basic premise.  His cold, emotionless, mood-flattened state, perpetuated by required drugs, is dead bang on target.

The film was virtually dumped into theaters, with Miramax doing the least they could do in its distribution, so it didn't really take off until its release on DVD and corresponding runs on cable.  Miramax had a second chance when they released the film on blu-ray, but they screwed it up again.  The DVD was letterbox and had two commentary tracks plus a &#34;making of&#34; featurette;  the blu-ray converted the frame to the standard 16x9 HD, and left off the commentaries (but kept the featurette).  Now a second blu-ray version has been released by Alliance Entertainment, which has all the features of the DVD, except the framing, which is still the 16x9, despite being advertised as being the 2:35 ratio.  While this is annoying, it is not a tragedy, because nothing of the original frame line is lost (16x9 conversion doesn't &#34;cut off&#34; top or sides of the picture, just changes the proportions), only the effect of the presentation the director chose;  most blu-ray players will allow you change the format, so you can choose &#34;letterbox&#34; and see the film in the original proportions (but the image will be a bit stretched, most noticeable in faces).  Also, while the quality of the blu-ray is better than the DVD, it is not vastly superior, probably due to the film's budget in the first place.  If you are a stickler for the widescreen, already own the DVD, and have the kind of blu-ray player that &#34;upgrades&#34; DVD images, I think you can get by without the blu-ray disc.  If you value the BR upgrade more than the format, the blu-ray is inexpensive enough to take the plunge, but you need to be sure you get the right version.  The new Alliance release, which has cover art featuring Christian Bale large on the right, a small Taye Diggs behind and the tunnel with circle pendants going backwards to infinity, has the commentaries.  If you don't already have the DVD, or don't want to have to keep it just for the commentaries, you must buy this version.  The Miramax version, released a few years ago, has Bale, Diggs, and Emily Watson in a triptych on the cover art, and is probably less expensive;  it does not have any commentary tracks, only the &#34;making of&#34; featurette.  You should only buy this version if you are prepared to keep your DVD, or if you don't care about listening to the director's commentary.  All in all, when it comes to this film on blu-ray, I'd rather have it than not, but I shake my head at the missed opportunites.	3.0	"No balance in ""Equilibrium"" blu-ray"	2013-04-26	2	2	0

Right off the bat the film takes a very European feel, which isn't bad, but different from what i was expecting. Further into the film, the look and feel changes again from a European feel to a very Asian one. The transition, unfortunately is not smooth nor clean as an american style is trying force it's way through the whole of the film. In the end, while the story is interesting, the ambiguous style with which the film was directed only served to bring this movie down from a 4 star to 3.	3.0	Equilibrium: a film with multicultural schizophrenia	2013-06-03	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1Z1P4D7XD65FP	"Diana D. ""Laraesque"""	This movie has some thought provoking themes about strictly controlled societies and ethical standards.  It does ask questions typical of the best science fiction by taking a situation and stretching it to its extreme, in this case, creating a society that values peace so highly that it bans emotion, ending up suppressing that which is the greatest in humanity for the sake of preventing the worst.  Of course, it backfires. Although the actors are excellent, the movie falls short in its depiction of human character. There is only black and white, only gray.  People are either government zealots or rebels.  Stupid choices are made by the protagonists and antagonists that are unbelievable. In addition. the obvious statement against widespread use of psychoactive drugs to control behavior is paper thin.  Still, the movie is watchable and intriguing, the fight scenes well choreographed, and the overall setting grand and compelling. I watched to the end, and because I am a fan of science fiction in general that undertakes a close look at societal trends, I found it acceptable.	3.0	Good Grade B Sci-Fi with excellent cast and fight choreography	2013-11-04	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3KWAGK3T5FX0Q	"D. Jeter ""DwayneJ"""	I liked this movie for the space it created in the sci-fi area.  Christian Bale was as usual dead-pan and perfect for the roll and Tye Diggs did a good job in the role of adversary.  The colors played right along with the cold and lifeless mood the controlling powers evoked in the population and I almost  let out a gasp when the M??? L??? work of art was set ablaze.(movie buffs check out Farenheit 459, I thought of it while watching this one). The high-lite for me though was the very idea to combine modern day hand gun technology with the age old art of martial arts.  The fighting sequences were fantastic and the pace of the movie seemed to me to move along enough to keep me interested.  I think that this is one move that action fans will watch over and over again.  I was very close to giving it 5 stars but I hate when beautiful women are lost.

Equilibrium was one of them.  It's a very intriguing concept of not being allowed to ""feel"" any emotion.  Without getting into a bunch of specifics, it's a good movie!  And Christian Bale is excellent as always.  If I had one complaint, it would be how unrealistic it is when Christian Bale's character can consistently take out 100 guys surroundng him with guns, without ever being so much as scratched.  It's WAY over the top.  But they're trying to convey that he is the cream of the crop, upper echelon cleric. Pretty much untouchable.

The plot is not great, but it still holds and if you like bleak visions of the future Equilibrium is defenitely on par with Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AC6QB59R9XNVM	Don Riddick	"I am not surprised this movie was panned by the critics. It is a haphazard cautionary tale of the future, but not as good as the things it borrows from, like Atwood's ""Handmaids tale."" The premise, of a society that takes an emotion numbing drug each day, but this usage is not tracked or controlled, seems counter-intuitive. All the main characters end up emotional, and the underground resistance isn't fully developed. Basically, if movies that have dumb or undeveloped premises annoy you, like ""The Core"", then this movie will fit right into your garbage basket. There is more than enough to be annoyed with from start to finish. Blah!But... The stylistic approach to Gun combat, reminiscent of John Wu's ""Killer"", where the Gun Kata (A cool concept) allows the main character to become an unstoppable killing machine is breathtaking. The martial arts scenes are good, although there is a spurious swordfight scene that is so typically Western and silly that you may laugh a bit. Still, if you are in love with the Gun, and martial arts, there is much to enjoy.I did lament that the mass firefights weren't envigorating, but the personal combat scenes were sweet.It's no matrix, nor is it particularly well written, but the fight choreographer was masterful."	3.0	It's a great action movie, but leave your mind at the door	2003-05-29	3	1	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1KD8NJPZ01R37	doppelganger	"Don't ""Forget the Matrix"" as the cover says, but don't miss Equilibrium either. The last comparable B Sci-Fi movie was ""Imposter"".Plot: In the future, there is no war and everyone takes a drug to quell their feelings, so everyone lives in a nice orderly society. Stopping your dosage or possessing banned items warrants execution. There is an underground that fights, occasionally blowing up a pharmacuetical facility and our main character gets involved with taking on the society's high cabal. So it's kind of a cross between the movie ""1984"" and a B version of the Matrix (it is loosely comparable). There could have been more done with Equilibrium than this, but it's a good movie. The fight scenes are cool and at times the acting was very well done, especially on Bale's part. The same rigidity that flowed for the character of ""American Psycho"" comes back with this non-feeling enforcer who finds humanity and realizes he is a mass-murderer. The story is somewhat empty in that, it's difficult to believe that a whole society could be so brainwashed as to be totally drugged, obedient and willing in the first place to implement such measures, but on the otherhand if I look around these days..."	4.0	don't miss it	2003-06-03	3	2	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1TQ59ENLET55M	D. Psaros	I was one of the lucky few who saw this in the theater and enjoyed every minute. One thing that becomes quite obvious early in the film, except to maybe the most dull of movie watchers, is that this film is not to be taken literally. The story unfolds as a parable where a fascist society controls the masses under the guise of society's best interest.All of the performances carry the futuristic fairy tale through its motions in a fresh if not original narrative down to the final battle.My only problems with this film are the people who are marketing it and the people who are watching it. The creators of the Matrix wisely recruited the veteran talent of Yuen Woo Ping for fights and stunts. I love his work in the dozen and a half movies I've seen that showcase his it. But NOTHING done in the Matrix with respect to fight choreography is new and has been done better by Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Equilibrium offers not only an original looking choreography but there is a reason to it aside from looking cool because you can. Neat fight scenes and a dark future are the only things this movie and The Matrix have in common so to all those professional and amateur movie reviewers alike, please stop illustrating your narrow knowledge of film by continuing to compare every dark future film to The Matrix, you might as well be comparing all these films to Johnny Pneumonic.See this film, expect a fun parable and enjoy yourself.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2VJ80PM1G00QV	drkhimxz	I viewed this without subtitles so even with my headphones on, I missed about 20% of the speech. Had I heard it all, I probably would have given a five star rating. At any rate, with so many ratings already in, I need only add my vote to the many: this is a fine picture for those  who want balletic action with a story that keeps one in its grip until the final curtain. The star does a first rate job and is well supported; wisely, the truly dramatic high-jinks in the use of handheld weapons is accentuated by its sparing use. The New Age story follows a general pattern: chief enforcer of a New Society dominated by a small elite and subjected by direct force and drugs taken by the population is freed by accident from the impact of the drugs  and comes to see things as they are. His life takes a new turn (which I should not describe to avoid revealing what it is better not to know beforehand ). His ability to love and hate is revived, as is his capacity to think and evaluate his situation and that of the New Society.I found it engrossing throughout and a winning yet quite human action film.	4.0	Top Flight Action With a Good Story	2013-05-17	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	A conceptual Christian Bale sci-fi vehicle that can't quite commit to its one primary plot point. It's the future, and we're living in a totalitarian regime thanks to a government-mandated drug that saps humanity of its ability to feel. Bale plays the cold, emotionless head of the gestapo, responsible for tracking and exterminating the few remaining shreds of liberal thought in the wild. Curiously, after incinerating every shred of artwork, poetry and literature he can find, this super-cop then retires to his ornately decorated office where a big show is made of the beautiful architecture and lavish sculptural decorations. The story's failure to comply with its own focal point doesn't end there, as Bale's coworkers and bosses are surprisingly animated and emotive for men supposedly removed from their own feelings. The plot offers no revelations, with the protagonist stomping through a shallow character arc and an overly simple, black-and-white evaluation of the grand scheme. There's fruit to be harvested here, but Equilibrium is either too short or too lazy to reach for it. A few very good action scenes (leading to an unusually high body count) are its only saving grace.	2.0	High Concept, Low Reward	2012-02-25	2	1	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1ZSOK69XSXF73	"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic"""	"I decided to re-write this review of Equilibrium since I thought my original wasn't that good, so here's a better review.I'm extremely puzzled as to why this atrocious Kurt Wimmer film has now become a sacrosanct moving picture, to where any criticism on it is met with some of the most vicious down-voting and imbecilic commentary that's only rivaled by really snotty anime fans.  Don't let this movie's jejune fanbase fool you, Equilibrium is NOT a masterpiece, but rather an extremely derivative piece of hack film-making made to appeal only either to those that don't know the foundations of good film-making or those that somehow think concepts in philosophy and politics override the proper mechanics of film-making.STORYThe story to Equilibrium is that after World War 3, the leaders of the world decided that it was human emotion that was the cause of war and created a society called Libria, where human emotions are phased out of peoples' lives through a mandatory drug called Prozium.  Naturally, pockets of resistance form up in this society and with the aid of a totalitarian police force, people known as Grammaton clerics use an art called Gun Kata to shoot out all enemies without much effort.  However, a high-ranking cleric named John Preston (Christian Bale), forgets to take a dose of Prozium and after feeling emotions, is starting to reject the beliefs of Libria.CHARACTERSI'll be honest here and say that none of the characters in Equilibrium gripped me at any point.  I get that most of the characters are supposed to be devoid of emotion and personality due to the movie's setting, but for the characters that do show emotion and personality (like Preston), they're really hokey and clich&eacute;.  A good example would be Vice-Council DuPont, since he's almost like a villain taken right out of a Saturday morning cartoon's interpretation of a Stalinist dictatorship.  Preston's change into a ""normal person"" was goofy and his scenes with him being emotional almost made me laugh in how goofy and forced they were.It's also worth noting that the dialogue in this movie is HORRIBLE.  There's plenty of lines that try way too hard to sound poetic and meaningful, but are also marred with Matrix-esque cheese that further decimates any chance this movie could be taken seriously.LACK OF TENSION/ACTION SCENESAny action film fan worth their salt will tell you that one of the most important things to have in an action or thriller film is tension.  The best and most common way to achieve this is to make the protagonist put fourth a ton of effort to defeat his or her enemies.  Think of Kyle Reese from The Terminator and John McClane from Die Hard as good examples of protagonists using creativity and ""fighting for your life"" effort in their attacks against the bad guys.John Preston, on the other hand, is quite possibly the most boring protagonist in an action movie.  He's so overpowered that he doesn't have to use a single shred of creativity or effort to defeat his foes.Now this is where the action scenes come in.  Simply put, they're some of the most boring you'll ever see.  This is so because aside from Preston being too powerful to pique any interest from the viewer, so many of the enemies he fights don't put fourth a shred of effort in their attempts to take down Preston.  It's like they're lining up to get killed by this guy, and this makes for extremely boring action.  Some may say that the action scenes look amazing because of how well-staged they are, but this is one of their biggest faults because even in the context of a dystopian sci-fi flick, they look too absurd since the enemies are practically letting Preston kill all of them (other than the obligatory ""boss battles"" near the end).Among the worst examples of the plentifully bland action scenes has to be near the end.  Preston confronts the group of government troops guarding DuPont's office, and in the midst of him annihilating them, there's this really goofy move Preston does where he throws two gun magazines with balancers on them across the room and when his guns run out of ammo, he sticks his guns on the balanced magazines on the floor and continues fighting.Perhaps if Equilibrium were an over-the-top action movie not meant to be taken seriously like Commando, then seeing an overpowered hero blast away the opposition without effort could have been mindless fun, but Equilibrium takes itself way, way too seriously.TRYING WAY TOO HARD TO BE ""DEEP""Oh boy, this movie tries way, way too hard to be emotional, deep, and symbolic, and I rolled my eyes throughout these scenes.  I was angrily groaning in the scene were Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson) was interrogated by Preston, and she was going on about how ""life without feeling is like a clock ticking."" I wrote better dialogue when I was in the ninth grade, and it didn't help that Watson's acting was a total bore.  Eventually, Watson's character gets incinerated because she's a ""sense offender"" (the label given to anyone charged with feeling emotions), and there's a scene with Preston crying over it, and I just said ""Really?"" Wimmer also resorts to the government killing puppies as cheap means to make the audience hate the bad guys even more.  It's absurd that Wimmer has us see the resistance fighters get gunned down by government troops but not of the puppies.  Scenes like those are more fitting for a Lifetime movie than a serious sci-fi/action film, as they totally reek of the most base attempts at emotional appeal from the audience.Then there's the overuse of symbolism, and they're about as subtle as an Amtrak barreling into a Greyhound bus full of circus clowns at 100 mph.  Between the scenes with Preston tearing off the filter on his window to see the rainbow after a rainstorm and him changing from a black trench-coat to a white one near the end, it's like either Kurt Wimmer doesn't know what the word ""subtle"" means or if he assumes the audience is too stupid to notice things unless if they're right in their faces.  The painfully obvious and overdone nature of the symbolism scenes makes this more fitting on the SyFy channel.LACK OF ORIGINALITYEquilibrium is one of the most unoriginal movies I've ever seen.  It's like Kurt Wimmer decided to take ideas and visual styles from The Matrix (which is just a bland mixture of cyberpunk anime and Hong Kong action movies), THX-1138, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984.  You get the premise of emotional suppression from THX-1138, the totalitarian censorship of Fahrenheit 451, the absurd action scenes and guys in trench-coats in The Matrix, and the ""one world order"" of 1984.ABSURD PREMISEI have to laugh that according to this movie, the cause of war is human emotion.  Wimmer must have the intelligence and maturity of a sixth grader because any adult will tell you that there's so much more that goes into the causes of war and the ""evils"" of the human condition in general than just emotion.  Anyone with enough intelligence will tell you that other things that cause war are clashing religious and political beliefs, natural resources, and money.  The overly childish nature of this premise would be more forgivable if this were a movie geared exclusively for kids, but because this is an R-rated film, this gross oversimplification is like a hammer to the face of anyone with a shred of intelligence.LOGIC VS EMOTIONAs someone who knows that logical appeal is far more important than emotional appeal in just about anything, I was totally disgusted by the execution of this movie.Equilibrium has plenty of logical flaws, such as the fact that everyone is forced into being emotionless through taking Prozium, yet there's plenty of scenes of government troops and of DuPont showing a lot of emotion when either enraged or put in a tough spot.  Also, when Preston starts to feel emotion, wouldn't he do things differently than his previous partner (whom he executed for having emotion) did when he started to ""feel"" so he wouldn't get caught?Also, with the heavy-handed message about how emotion is so important, it leaves no room for the logical element of human existence playing any importance of society.  Even going along with the premise that emotions cause war (I'm still snickering at how stupid this is), in which the hokey prologue says that mankind couldn't survive another world war, it doesn't bother with the question of the ends justifying the means (which is in this case, keeping everyone doped up on Prozium).  It doesn't let you ponder about that for yourself as you're forced into hating the emotional suppression done by the government.  Also, if people not taking Prozium develops into a problem to where the government needs frequent raids and executions of resistance members, wouldn't the government develop a more efficient way of preventing subversion, such as installing computer chips into people when they're born to make them emotionless?  It's clear that all Wimmer cares about is emotional appeal rather than logical appeal, and people like this are rock-stupid.SOUNDTRACKI honestly don't remember anything of this movie's score, so I can't comment much on it.  Though if I totally forgot about it, then it probably wasn't worth remembering.FINAL WORDEquilibrium tries way too hard to be deep, emotional, and action-packed, and it fails hard on all three categories.Despite the rabid praises Equilibrium is receiving from people around the internet, this movie is a total dearth of cinematic quality in any area.  I'm not joking, Future War, a movie made fun of by Mystery Science Theater 3000, is marginally better than this.  At least that movie had hilarious riffing commentary by the crew aboard the Satellite of Love, whereas no comedic riffing could save Equilibrium.Stick with these movies instead:Total Recall (1990 version)RobocopAliensTHX-1138The Terminator (1 and 2)Blade RunnerGhost in the ShellDistrict 9Avoid Equilibrium at all costs."	1.0	One of the absolute worst action movies ever made.  2%	2010-06-02	24	4	20

And anyways, why let what someone else says influence your movie viewing choices?  Anyways, I thought this movie had a brilliant script, and the acting was superb.  The thing that set this movie apart from others is that it had a very intense emotional overtone to it, coupled with great action scenes.  I thought this movie rivaled the Matrix, and even surpassed it in terms of moral overtones in an action movie.  I feel it shouldn't have been compared to The Matrix as much as it was.  Great movie, and sets it apart in its own action-oriented genre through extreme emotional overtones.  One of my fave movies.	5.0	Great Movie	2003-07-10	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A36WE30M539RBC	E- 1	Originally, I saw a review that stated that the Canadian release of Equilibrium removed the black bars and zoomed in on the picture. This is not so. Though both the U.S. DVD release and the Canadian release state 2.35:1, only the Canadian Import version delivers. The DVD does have black bars, but those black bars cut some of the image off. The Canadian release, by Alliance, removed the black bars and presents the whole picture, which looks pretty good. The sound is also excellent. Though both the picture and the sound can be improved upon, it's a nice addition to any sci-fi or action blu-ray library, if this is your type of genre. But again, the Canadian import includes more of the original image, not less of it.	5.0	Canadian Import vs. U.S. DVD release Comparison	2010-03-06	8	6	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A18CA0GRHDVP8X	Earl Hazell	"Straight to the point: the comparisons of EQUILIBRIUM to THE MATRIX are not only borderline absurd; they ironically serve to reveal the inherent structural weaknesses of this movie.To begin with I don't know if EQUILIBRIUM actually made it to the theaters. I saw it on video a while back, with its packaging complete with critic blurbs on the cover saying ""It's like the MATRIX, only cooler,"" or something equally stupid. As this sci-fi Dystopia came out during the height of THE MATRIX trilogy's appeal, that conversation was an effective marketing tool, not a spontaneous one from the public. More importantly however, of the two plots, THE MATRIX is more believable--thereby more compelling--for a specific reason.THE MATRIX essentially follows the FRANKENSTEIN tradition from 19th century literature of Man screwing around with his own nature without having any real understanding of it, and unleashing hell in the process. With so many books and movies doing brilliant and socially relevant variations on this theme through the generations, for the Wachowski brothers to work within its application to the Information Society like so many before them takes a pair of unique minds. Especially since Arnold's THE TERMINATOR series basically does their plot brilliantly long before they did. (Not to mention SOILENT GREEN's application of the parable to population growth and consumption; PLANET OF THE APES with the parable as a civil rights metaphor; and the MAD MAX trilogy's application of it to the oil industry.) But that also meant, however, they had a great deal of help in making it plausible with all those models. The brothers Wachowski took the help and ran with it, making history in the process.EQUILIBRIUM fails where THE MATRIX succeeds for me on this point: a post-world war/holocaust Dystopia that survives on the suppression of anything central to human nature must still, as the movie shows, be built on some bureaucratic structure that supports a neo-capitalist, neo-feudal, pyramid/caste system--a system the movie hints at via the cleric-police but does not truly show. Referring again to its literary antecedents: Orwell's most popular books--1984 and ANIMAL FARM-essentially focus on the moral failure of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As such, in this post-Soviet Union communism world, it is hard for people to not believe our own press regarding the purity and unmitigated glories of our current system, having ""won"" the Cold War. But Orwell was equally if not more so concerned with the evil of pure capitalism and imperialism. Particularly capitalism's ability, when left unchecked and unfettered within an imperialist system, to, as the political philosopher Michael Lind says in his book UP FROM CONSERVATISM, ""completely replicate, down to precise details of organization and detail, the communism that it opposes."" The writings of Orwell addressing this were censored-that's right, censored-by the English press when he wrote them before and after World War II and are the stuff of dissident literature footnotes and trivia now. As such they are even more important to address today, given that our world has been economically redefined (sort of) from Globalization, a ""new"" animal we have yet to truly understand. There in fact has been an open debate amongst literary types for decades now as to whether Orwell's socialist/communist Dystopia that is 1984 is a more accurate prediction of the future than Aldous Huxley's techno-capitalist Dystopia that is BRAVE NEW WORLD. Most people, after even the most cursory look at Globalization and its discontents today, will tell you, via Huxley focusing on the irresistible force of pure capitalism meeting the immovable object of unquestioning scientific innovation (and human freedom becoming the thing that's got to give when that happens [and does]), that he beat Orwell by a mile.How is this relevant? Simple: the fundamental plotline of EQUILIBRIUM is the journey of a party-faithful man who, almost accidentally, reclaims his humanity in a dehumanizing world to such a degree that he becomes the force capable of initiating a truly human revolution. The dehumanizing world is one where the primary philosophy of existence is simple: human emotion is the cause of all suffering through its eventual inspiration to war. Therefore it must be suppressed and exorcised from the human experience for a healthy community and a stable body politic. This is accomplished through the manufacture, dissemination and institutionalization of state-sanctioned drugs (designed to suppress all emotion), and the institutionalized incineration of all things from the old pre-War culture that inspire emotions to surface, i.e. art, literature, passionate love, pets, etc. None of this could be possible without the systems and structures of the drug's manufacture and dissemination to each and every household. Therefore, *the state-subsidized monopoly that is the drug industry* is what is actually running this Dystopia, not its stated philosophy--which the very designers of the drug and the system supporting it could easily prove to be scientifically bogus. That is the true message. EQUILIBRIUM is a cautionary tale about CAPITALISM gone mad, not any experiments in communism or socialism or neo-Puritanism, like what it implies. It is Capitalism-as-Frankenstein: the blindly arrogant belief that ""the market"" could not enslave its creators...leading to exactly that. The writers, seemingly to avoid pissing off the would-be corporate distributors of this film, fail to make this abundantly clear.Where THE MATRIX never loses its structural grounding in its ""scientific-innovation-via-artificial-intelligence-as-Frankenstein"" cautionary tale, the writer(s) of EQUILIBRIUM never fully establish theirs. And it is this sense of ""let me tell you a cautionary tale without telling you in actuality what you really need to be cautious of"" that makes the movie not nearly as good as THE MATRIX or its classic Dystopia predecessors with a clear cut, courageous-and relevant-message.Christian Bale, the star, is still, however, one of my favorite actors. Sean Bean and Taye Diggs are great.  I expected good performances in EQUILIBRIUM (and some silly special effects) and wasn't disappointed. I wouldn't buy this movie, but I would recommend you seeing it."	3.0	An effective, well-acted nod to Orwell, Bradbury and Huxley--and, yes, the Wachowski Brothers	2006-02-17	7	4	3
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ANIGGGE1C260E	"ecb41 ""ecb41"""	First of all, I'll address some prior comments:  THIS IS NOT A MATRIX RIP-OFF.  The only things the two have in common are that they are sci-fi and action movies-THAT'S IT.  While I watched this, the Matrix didn't even enter my mind, and it didn't strike me at all afterwards until I read some Matrix-freak's review that tore into Equilibrium.This is a no BS action movie that, unlike many that come out these days, has a great story to go along with it.  It was a lot better than usual action movies that get a great deal of hype, and was very well cast (Bale and Diggs give flawless performances).  This also surprised me that a film with such established actors (including the woman from Red Dragon-I'm sorry, I don't know her name) would be a limited release and be relatively unheard of in most parts of the country.The makers of this movie surely did miss out on a great chance to make some serious money, as this movie is much more entertaining than the majority of the ... that's out there.  I'd recommend picking this up if you want great action or even if you just want an inventive movie that, unfortunately, went unappreciated.	5.0	How can such a great movie get no respect?	2003-04-19	2	2	0

Plenty of action, perhaps a little too much, and the pace drags at times to the point that it became tedious.

The action scenes where extraordinary, and while some people say they are fake, they aren't. Here's how it works, the star is surrounded by enemies. He has two guns and shoots them in opposite directions(ie, one forward and one backwards, or one to the left and one to the right). Those guys are dead, then he does it the opposite way(ie if he shot forward and backwards then he shots left and right the next time), this is because those are the most likely of your enemies to shoot you next. Then it happens diagnally. Now this may seem a little fake, but you have to remember that this guy has been trained for a LONG time and is the BEST of his proffesion. He's also fast, not Matrix fast, but fast. Bale does the fight scenes with a kind of beauty, and it makes the action seem very real, very concrete.And while I'm on the Matrix, I'll say, that this movie is original in its action, nothing like the Matrix. Don't worry, this movie isn't a rip-off of the Matrix.While reminiscent of Farenhiet 451, this thriller is still very original. It has many twists and should be much more widly watched. I learned about the movie, not from T.V., not from the newspaper, or a magazine, but from another person who took a chance and rented it. I wasn't wild about renting the movie, but decided to as there was nothing else to rent at the local Blockbuster. I took a chance and loved it, you should too, wether you are looking at this review to rent, buy, borrow you shoud definetly get it, or at least rent it. It's worth every penny.Christian Bale, does a splendid job too. In a world where there is no emotion he can't show happyness, sadness, anger, nothing. And he does it very well. He shows no emotion while doing the shoots up until the parts that require emotion(He accidentally doesn't take his emotion-depressing drugs on accident).	4.0	A well balanced movie.	2003-06-08	6	6	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A34GZPHWYPSY2T	"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry"""	"EQUILIBRIUM (2002) is one of my most favorite Deeply Personals, thus it merits a Deeply Personal film critique. Firstly, look at this list:a/k/a ""Cubic"" - Europea/k/a ""Rebellion"" - Japana/k/a ""Equilibrium - Killer of Emotions"" - GermanyYou will not find another film quite so well-viewed and beloved. For good reason, mon famille....In the sprawling fascist city-state of Libria, the Tetragrammaton is like the commie party. Ruled by the ""Father"" (think Mao, Pot Pol and Saddam Hussein all rolled into one) and with the iron hand of the body of clerics, Libria is a drug-addled place. Not for fun: this drug is meant to turn them all into Vulcans. It eradicates emotional extremes (it does not eradicate emotions completely as has been wrongly stated).I will say I was offended by the use of the word Tetragrammaton, which in my tradition is the term for the four-letter original Name of God (YHVH), but oh well, it's THE MOVIES! Not theology school!Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale in his first and only impressive role) is forced to execute his partner, Cleric Partridge, for ""sense offense""--Cleric Partridge has been reading Keats (or was it Yeats?--they read the same thing in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD). Partridge has stopped his drug intake, and he's feeling.Bad!Cleric Preston finds his world and acceptance of all things Libria is crumbling. He meets with the resistance, and the results are SLAM! BANG! Better than the comics. And that is the smooth beauty of this action-packed, philosophically charged film that to a degree influenced everything that was to follow.It had few predecessors, and practically no inspiration or idea-stealing. The closest thing I could ultimately find to compare to EQUILIBRIUM wasGattaca(1997) and the stunningLogan's Run(1976) which also influencedStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (Two-Disc Widescreen Enhanced and Original Theatrical Versions).I got hooked on this because of the fashion. Seriously. But also due to the fact that I also carry the title ""cleric"", and because we also try to eradicate strong emotions. EQUILIBRIUM explains how that is not possible, unhealthy and at the end of the day, unnatural.From the beautifully slick habit-uniforms worn by the clerics to the martial arts, the ""gun katas"", a T'ai Ch'i-like martial art of the two-handed gun (all inspiring the drearyThe Spiritfrom a couple of years ago), EQUILIBRIUM truly has it all.Taye Diggs and Angus MacFadyen are most impressive in their villainous roles, sneering and scene-chewing with the best of the chewers. The martial arts, while quite sparse, are spectacular (MacFadyen is most surprisingly gifted) and the moral-emotional tension never quits until the end.Well past the end, you will be thinking about this unique, thought-provoking masterpiece--and you'll wonder why they don't usually make them this good."	5.0	I told you I'd make my career with you	2010-06-07	4	3	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	APBRAL723MUM4	EJon	"Imagine that a group of high school students are taking a science fiction class.  As a final project, they are told to write a story based on classic dystopian visions.  They come up with a pretty decent concept that's a mix of Fahreneit 451, Brave New World, 1984, and THX1138. Unfortunately, they top it off by infusing elements from their favorite movie, The Matrix; namely, ultra-cool fashion sense and highly stylized martial arts and gun play.I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic and dystopian movies, even when they're unbelievable and totally derivative, but the best of these are fundamentally cerebral exercises, intended to make the viewer think.  Equilibrium could have gone in that direction, but by focusing instead on extended and completely nonsensical action sequences, it just turned into a cheap ripoff of the Matrix and all the other cheap ripoffs of the Matrix.  It's silly enough to watching Keanu Reaves...eh, I mean Christian Bale, armed with only two pistols and a bad ass stare, take on several dozen guys with machine guns and full - but apparently only decorative - body armor, but when every inexplicably drops their guns and switches to swords, I just said ""Give me a break here!"".Then there are the many mistakes, from a very wrong-sized Mona Lisa (hasn't *anyone* involved in this movie been to the Louvre?) to a pivotal plot error so glaring I immediately rewound to make sure I'd seen it correctly.In the end, I gave it two stars because it is decent eye candy, and in spite of everything, Christian Bale is a good actor, so it's worth watching if it's free."	2.0	A silly, silly movie	2011-10-21	6	1	5

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AR7EG02GNFAP0	"Eliseo Ruiz Jr. ""Comics, music, movies, video..."	"After reading the rave reviews of Equilibrium on Amazon I came very close to buying the DVD. Some reviewers have claimed it to be better than The Matrix. I was very much looking forward to watching it but decided to check it out on cable instead.  All I can say now is thank God I didn't buy it. I watched it just the other day and my roommate and I almost fell asleep. I like Christian Bale's acting and was surprided to see that I felt nothing for his character. (He was great in Empire of the Sun and American Psycho.)  I felt nothing for this entire movie!  The acting was dull, the story made no sense and the characters were cardboard cut-outs. There was no suspense, no intrigue, no excitement,  no NOTHING!  I now understand why this film came and went so quickly from theatres. It may not have gotten a strong marketing push probably because the studio knew they had a clunker on their hands and didn't want to waste any more money.  I seriously doubt marketing would have helped it.Maybe I was expecting too much because I was thinking it might be similar to the Matrix, which they borrowed heavily from for this train wreck. The look, the style of clothing and the gun fighting all lifted mainly from The Matrix. Heck even the movie posters and the DVD box design screams ""LOOK AT ME! I'M A CHEAP KNOCK OFF OF THE MATRIX!""  Though I thought the Matrix was a great film, it had it's problems. It borrowed liberally from many sources but at least the Wachowski brothers managed to make it all work together.Equilibrium has an intriguing concept that just wasn't executed very well. All emotions are outlawed.  A drug called prozium is used to suppress all human emotions including happiness and anger.  The citizens of Libria all take the drug voluntarily. (Like that could really happen!) Those who don't and show emotion are called sense offenders.  They are dealt with by a police force called Clerics, who supposedly are highly trained in the art of kung fu and the art of keeping a serious face!  The funny part here is that one of the top Clerics (Taye Diggs) shows tons of emotion during the film. But it somehow goes unnoticed. Even Christian's character starts to show emotion and no one seems to care. He doesn't get taken away until he gets overwhelmed with emotions and literally runs through the street screaming. The head honcho of this police force shows anger and Christian's character doesn't even bat an eye.  I'm glad I saw it on cable because it's not even worth a rental in my book. Speaking of books read 1984 or check out that DVD if you want to read/see a decent story about a dystopian future.  Heck even Logan's Run is better than Equilibrium!"	1.0	DEFINITELY NOT better than Matrix.  Extremely disappointed.	2004-06-21	27	6	21
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1JNUH09ONA7FQ	Emerikol	Anyone who compares this movie to the matrix is misleading you.  This is not groundbreaking movie making as was the case with the matrix, it is simply a bad remake of 1984 with guns.*THIS REVIEW IS NOTHING BUT SPOILERS --- BEWARE*OK, where to start.  In the beginning the movie shows plenty of 'emotion' police around, picking people from the crowd at random, for acting suspiciously.  But for the rest of the movie as Bale runs around hyped up on emotion no one stops him or anything.When he finds and saves the dog, his priestly partner does not automatically turn him in but simply accepts his lame excuse about disease verification, or whatever.  Also, how does he take care of this dog in the highly controlled society, and how does his daughter have the dog under her table in class, without anyone raising an eyebrow.Somehow, in the end, it is revealed that Bale has been setup, because they needed someone to infiltrate the resistance.  How did they know he would be the perfect candidate, when in fact he showed himself to be anything but.  I mean, he just shot his partner of several years in the face.Which brings me to the next point.  How could Emily Watson ever begin to forgive Bale for shooting her lover in the face?  I mean, so he now has the capacity to feel and somehow this is enough for her to just forget about the part where he shot her lover, and in fact begins to have feelings for Bale?!?Overall this is just a very badly made remake of 1984.  There is nothing new brought to the story and the fighting is pretty ridiculous.  Somehow the clerics have developed a fighting technique that allows you to fire more accurately while avoiding the common firing angles, or something to that effect, however, it seems like the cleric just sort of gyrates in place while everyone misses and they don't.  Not very convincingly portrayed.I would avoid this movie unless you truly have nothing else to watch.	1.0	Don't be fooled by the 4&5 star reviews	2013-11-16	9	7	2

The only thing that comes close is the swordplay scene in &#34;Kill Bill&#34;.That aside, it's a fairly interesting movie. I agree with other reviewers who opined that this movie has more in common with 1984 than the Matrix... Actually, the most unrealistic thing about this movie is that the surveillance used by the Big Brother society is so inept. Even with today's technology, it would be easy for a totalitarian state to make getting away with the stuff in this movie impossible. Also, there are some pretty big plot holes ... I don't want to give away any spoilers, but there was no point to carrying out the assassination at the end.  The movie plods along in the middle, then really gets going at the end, with one or two good plot twists thrown in for good measure. I'd give it 3-1/2 stars if I could.	3.0	Highest ... body count ...

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ARPI7ILEOQ848	"EnglishTeacher ""scubabear"""	"From start to finish, this film is a ""wannabe"".  There are no big stars, and no major special effects.  The much-touted ""Gun Kata"" fight sequences were wooden (Christian Bale is NO MARTIAL ARTS GURU-- the man is as inflexible as a concrete pier piling) and laughably unvelievable.The ""gun kata"" which is supposed to intrigue us is described as ""martial arts based on positioning your body where the bullets are least likely to be, based on an analysis of thousands of gun battles"".  In practice, however, this laughably stoooopid ""Gun Kata"" amounts to Christian Bale standing in the same place, absolutely rigid from the shoulders down, standing in stark relief illuminated by a room's only lightsource, while a handful of guys fire at him with with automatic weapons.  He should have more holes in him than Sponge Bob Squarepants (tm).  When asked to suspend my disbelief, I just fell over on the couch and laughed myself slly...until I realized that I'd PAID to watch this.  Then, I felt like crying for those little, lost bucks that coulda bought pepsi & popcorn instead.We're also asked to believe that heavily armed & well-trained police officers will gather in a tight circle around a suspect, and start firing.  *ahem*.  Ain't they gonna shoot one another ?  Is there ANY reason they don't ?There's also a HUGE gap in plot-logic, when we're shown a character's flashback about a gun-switch.  It's simply...not possible that the gun switch happened when he think it did, and this point is never resolved in a logical way.Consider this whole thing an also-ran, loser rip-off of The Matrix...kinda like Matrix 2 & Matrix 3, without the SFX budget & Keanu Reeves."	2.0	"zero-budget ""Matrix"", laughably bad fight scenes"	2004-08-30	12	5	7

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A358KSPZ752C78	Epitaph	"First of all, because of the silly artwork many people thought that this movie is a clone of matrix.And matrix was good, (the first one,not the silly sequels)and it is definitelly better in artistic technics.But the thing is , while equilibrium is one of my top 5 films,matrix cant even make it into the list. because despite all the depth, it aims to be an action movie. One with attitude and depth,but an action movie.But equalibrium is depth itself,with action.Equilibrium stars the great actor Christian bale,who is the newest and the best face of batman.(he made me like batman) The movie is set in near future,in a time where human race stopped their emotions in order to restain balance.Christian bale is a cleric,a champion of the system in charge of protecting it against ""rebels"" ; the people who still feel and want to stay that way.Well,what happens happens and christian starts feeling again,and it doesnt take long for him to see what is right and what is wrong.To give the natural balance to humanity,now he has to fight against it.i'm sure you understood why this movie is always being compared to matrix..Equilibrium (the name comes from the building where they buy the thing they inject themselves to stop feeling)has a few logical flaws but nothing important.This great action makes you think about the meaning of being human in ways you probably never did before.it is interesting,original and unique. i hope no one tries to make squels for this one ,cos i still want my money back for reloaded and revolutions :)"	5.0	A modern classic	2006-01-26	5	3	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2YL0WU97U88AD	Erica Burns	To Kurt Wimmer:  Thank you for introducing me to the genuinely new experience of not wanting to leave the theatre!  I saw this movie 6 times (a personal first), and each time I was amazed at how I could just sit through it again!Whenever I tell people about it, they jump in with a comparison to The Matrix, but the truth is, while both films are incredibly exciting to watch, Equilibrium makes you care about the characters in ways the other never did.  We never knew why the good guys in The Matrix were drawn to fighting for their freedom, it was never explored.  In Equilibrium, Wimmer DOES explore this, and Christian Bale and Emily Watson give fantastic performances that will bring tears to your eyes.I also found Equilibrium interesting because of the commentary it makes on issues that are here today---the militarization of the police, police raids, victimless crimes, etc. (WACO would have been a lot different with a John Preston around, eh?)The bottom line is this movie NEVER STRAYS---it's exciting, great gun-kata scenes, thought-provoking subject matter, and all of it balanced with the more human elements that keep us caring.It's strange, but for the only time in my life I felt like I was going to miss a movie after it stopped playing.  I don't think there's a greater compliment than that....	5.0	KILLER ACTION WITH A HEART	2003-01-09	22	19	3
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1KKV78K4B9RT7	ERIC GOLDLUST	...which, ironically, echoes the theme of the movie -- except that the protagonist, who is supposed to be the central unpredictable element, is simply playing to expectations as well.The setting is familiar: a dystopian future society that is even more &#34;Brave New World&#34;-ish  than &#34;Brave New World&#34; -- changing only the fact that people are impelled by their rules, to take drugs to keep themselves from feeling emotion, rather than electing to do so in droves, which is perhaps the most compelling part of &#34;Brave New World,&#34; and without that element, becomes simply a totalitarian regime.  What's worse is that many of the characters who claim not to &#34;feel&#34; are clearly demonstrating anger and cruelty.  Hard to know whether this is flawed writing or bad directing, but since the writer _is_ the director, the point is moot.The characters are one-dimensional.  (Spoilers follow.)  There's the old partner doomed to die for his deviance in Act 1 (with a setup as subtle as a sledgehammer); the new partner who is unswerving in his dogged pursuit of criminals; the love interest who redeems the protagonist by warming his cold heart; the totalitarian leader clearly motivated by megalomania rather than the ideals to which he claims to adhere.  Bale's character has kids, and the pivotal point at which point their actions could heighten the plot -- how do I say this without a mega-spoiler? -- the character zigs when they should have zagged.  They take the easy way out, and the plot remains dull.Bale himself undergoes the requisite transformation from cold to hot, but does so in about six seconds -- and the rest of the movie just plays it out.  It would have been much more interesting to see him trying to _understand_ what he is feeling; instead, the focus is on how to _hide_ the fact that he is feeling.  At the risk of another spoiler, I'll just say that how the puppy situation is handled is just silly.  He arouses so little suspicion that it makes you wonder how such an incompetent totalitarian regime rose to power.  Perhaps they just hire thugs for how well they fit into the black suit.To be fair, they do explore his newfound feelings, and how he is affected by history, and music, and culture... but you don't see the internal conflict: now that the veil is lifted, what does he make of his previous ideals?  It takes him essentially no time to switch sides; the one battle where he is seen to be conflicted by his own actions does little to convey his internal conflict.  Bale does a good job with it, but the source material doesn't help.The imagery is heavy-fisted.  The god-like leader, who is seen on screens but never in real life, is called Father.  When Christian Bale's character speaks to his second-in-command via projected images, that image is over the shape of a Greek cross, which appears incessantly throughput the film (as do T-shaped windows, bluntly echoing the Roman cross).  And the leaders appear repeatedly to preach the ideals of conformity.  The best I can say is that this last is done in a way that blends the images of religion with those of Nazi Germany, with millions faceless (helmeted and visored)Even if you can settle back to watch a popcorn-flick with enjoyable action sequences, there's just too many reasons NOT to enjoy them.  The action is fairly sporadic, and the setup is always similar: All is quiet, when suddenly, our protagonist springs into action and shoots everyone.  There's no element of chase, or evasion, or suspense.  And while the final battle adds an element, it's not enough to redeem the movie. Plus, they're over too soon -- especially the penultimate battle.  And several times, Bale's character uses the same maneuver: the attackers have come so close that he can simply disarm them and use their weapons against them.  Does nobody see this coming?Which brings me to the ultimate flaw in this movie: there are too many reasons why you cannot suspend your disbelief.  The protagonist emerges from battles unscathed because of an admittedly clever device: he is trained in an martial art that resulted from the analysis of countless gunfights, resulting in a precise sequence of movements and shots that unfailingly strike their opponent.  ...Really?  Unfailingly?  Not one time does an assailant deviate from their predicted move?  In the world of self-sedating opponents, perhaps.  But his chief enemies do not use the mood-blunting drug, and (spoiler alert) his fellow peacekeepers are ALSO trained in this martial art, and so it seems like a MacGuffin that they cannot ever -- even once -- predict Bale's moves.  Every assailant exists to be gunned down. If this was a Terminator movie, that would be plausible and frightening; in this case, it's simply unbelievable.  And then there's the aforementioned puppy scene, clearly designed to horrify the viewer and whip them into a regime-hating frenzy -- in such a heavy-handed manner that it made me care _less_ about the conflict between rebels and regime.It;s on Prime for free, so, not much to lose, except for a couple of hours.  But as for me - I enjoyed writing this review more than the movie itself.	2.0	Predictable from start to finish.	2014-04-28	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	"P>Equilibrium features a terrific premise: the film is set sometime after WWIII (the year is unspecified) in a city called Libria, which is headed by a man called ""Father"" (Sean Pertwee), who only appears to the citizens via hologram.  All citizens are required to take a daily dose of prozium, a drug that dulls the emotions, which is what's believed to be the source of man's inhumanity to man.  To ensure people continue their dosage, examples are made by law enforcers called clerics.  These clerics are warrirors trained in a unique style called gun-kata, which teaches the fighter to stand in the position where they're least likely to be hit by enemy fire and to use a gun as an extension of the fighter itself.  In the opening scene, we see how such a concept works.But similar to Logan's Run, our hero, cleric John Preston (Christian Bale), comes through an awakening when he misses his dose.  He experiences emotions for the first time and finds himself conflicted with everything he'd believed in and fought for and what he now believes is the right thing to do.  He wants to contact and join the rebel forces against ""Father,"" but finds this isn't an easy task, especially with his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), watching his every move and a massive army backing ""Father.""Equilibrium is a film that can be viewed as thought-provoking entertainment.  Writer/director Kurt Wimmer conveys this emotionless world with great attention to minute details (I never noticed the cars were entirely white, even inside, until my second viewing), incredible sets and production values that display the sterile feel of the environment.  Whoever constructed the sets should be applauded, especially considering the modest budget the film had to work with.  The  look and feel of this city, along with Preston's erupting emotions, are nicely backed by Klaus Badelt's brooding score.Simultaneously, the film has an utterly fabulous story, engrossing in its ability to convince you of this terrifying future and take you along for the ride beside our protagonist.  Are there plot holes?  Yes, but none that couldn't be reasonably explained, which means they're closer to being contrivances.  For instance, the soldiers Preston face obviously display some fear, but I think prozium is only a suppressant; it doesn't completely rid the person of emotions.  Plus, when someone has a shotgun pointed straight at his face, it'd be pretty difficult not to show some concern.Much of what makes Equilibrium's story so suspenseful is it's unpredictability; Wimmer is so skillful in his delivery that it isn't until the conclusion we figure out the surprises and it's revealed who truly has the upper hand in this constantly twisting plot (possible spoiler: I will say this, I am quite glad the villains didn't turn out as dumb as they may have initially seemed).Equilibrium's future claim to fame will be the gun-kata sequences, which are, for lack of a better word, breathtaking.  There are other terms I could use; innovative, exhilarating, exciting, thrilling, heart-pounding, but I think breathtaking most accurately captures the complete surprise and delight I felt while watching the film (on the big screen, no less).  There are five sequences that display gun-kata (along with two ""ordinary"" gun battles, a well-done sparring sequence, and some terrific swordplay), and each setpiece almost always tops the one that came before it in both innovation and excitment.  I hesitate to go further, as I feel your enjoyment will be heightened if you don't know exactly how the action plays out (suffice to say the one-on-one jaw-dropping climactic duel is, bar none, the best fight scene I've seen all decade long).Of course, as with almost all thrillers, action sequence only take up a minor portion of the running time (in this case, about twenty minutes in all, still a hefty amount, with a large portion of that in the climax).  So what keeps our attention to the screen isn't just the story, the stylish cinematography and production design, but also the performances.  At the center of the story is Christian Bale, an always superb actor who delivers one of his best performances as Preston.  This immensely difficult role is made entirely believable and moving by Bale, whose captivating turn ensures we have a rooting interest from beginning to end.Taye Diggs doesn't get the opportunity to shine nearly as much as Bale, but is solid as Brandt, though his constant smiling has been a source of complaint.  (spoiler) By the end of the film, it's still questionable whether or not he was taking prozium. He is Dupont's underling, which suggests he, too, might not have been taking his prozium.  Emily Watson is good, though underused, as Mary O'Brien, a woman Preston takes interest in.  William Fichtner has an intriguing role as a somewhat mysterious but passionate rebel leader and Angus Mcfadyen is suitably chilling as the head cleric Dupont.Equilibrium's action sequences have raised the bar for future competition, and not even the just released The Matrix Reloaded can compete (not that their action is similar) with what Wimmer has crafted.  But just as important, the movie engages our mind, our emotions, and pulls us through all 107 minutes without a hiccup in pacing or momentum."	5.0	A must see for anyone who enjoys sci-fi action.	2003-05-15	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	Can you imagine having your emotions banned from society? Well, if you can't, then you'll have to watch Equilibrium to see for yourself. Here, we see a Fascist regime that has banned all forms of human emotions. Christian Bale is John Preston, a man of the highest rank for this notorious empire. At first, he sees human emotions as a plague upon humanity, but after he doesn't take his medicine due to an accident, he beings to experience emotions. Here, we get to see the good things in life, like music and color. But that's not the only thing that makes this film so recognizable.  We also have some tense action sequences. They may not be very realistic, but they're still so spectacular to look at. The cast is a great ensemble, though I did find Emily Watson to be a bit wooden at times (for a person who actually HAS emotion in this movie). Overall, I tried hard to love this movie, but I ended but only liking it. It is a very good film, but it's not one of my favorites (mostly due to the slow pace in the middle of the film, and some unnecessary choral music).	4.0	Can emotions be taken away?	2009-09-17	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2RIRJJPGPMM8N	Everyone's_a_critic	As noted, this film borrows from Dark City, Blade Runner, Terminator, The Matrix, Fahrenheit 451, and Total Recall, but this movie falls far short of those greats. There is a difference between employing genre, plot, character, theme, and other such elements from past movies and rolling them in to a creative, inspired, and unique film experience, compared to such films as this which represent nothing more than simply stealing from the successful and not even attempting to cover your tracks.Christian Bale looks great in this film, but his beyond-Neo super-human antics have no basis for believability, whereas the Matrix properly set the plausibility stage for how one man could kill dozens. We saw the same implausible kind of ripoff with the Selina character in 'Dark Knight Rises' who performs Trinity-like moves with the same lack of foundation. They're hoping we won't notice, or care.Equilibrium is also full of the kind of plot twists and unexpected character behavior audiences tend to go for.... except, again, absolutely no set up for the twists, so it gets less and less easy to suspend your disbelief, while at the same time easier and easier to predict what's coming next as the movie drags on. By the end of the film you are fed up with the nonsensical sequences, you realize there's not a fresh piece of meat to be found in this turkey, and you start to regret the time you've invested. Save yourself the trouble and instead catch one of the aforementioned films you haven't seen yet! :>	1.0	We've Seen It All Before - and done better!	2013-07-19	6	3	3

It was well thought out. it gave me food for thought of what could possibly happen if nations continue to be at war & the solution those think tanks could come up with.

Even if the story is implausible, the symbolic imagery, heartfelt acting, and excellent gunplay battles make this movie well worth a viewing - or even owning.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A313FHXGRZNB68	"FateJacketX ""FJX"""	"""I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly...""I'm a few years too late on this review, but I've just seen it for the first time, as recommended to me by a friend. I don't normally let movies this cool slip under my radar, but I'm glad I got to it eventually. It's a great film.This is a futuristic, however loose, retelling of the Bradbury novel Farenheit 451. In that story, in order to keep humanity's knowledge and ambition on a leash so limited that - long story short, we're too dumb to eradicate each other - all books are outlawed by a specialized order of Firemen. These firemen BURN things though, instead of stopping fires. Equilibrium is the same story. The only differences are that in lieu of knowledge, the human failing to be done away with is emotion. The firemen are a highly trained order of clerics who kick ass and take the names of the world's most emo criminals: People who feel.After WWIII, the government says that if we can't get mad, we can't have war. So a serum was concocted to ebb the pangs of desire. That includes the desire to love, to hate, to want, whatever. Humans are reduced to nigh-automatons in order to survive. And the primary enforcers are the Grammaton Clerics, a Jedi knight sort of order who have mastered the art of gunplay. They outrank the police who also work to uphold the ideal of ""feel nothing."" The serum is to be taken twice a day in order to keep the urges under control. And, of course, with the pressence of authority comes the pressence of resistence. There's an underground network of players who refuse to abide by the rules and, if found, are exterminated. More ""Star Wars"" references there with the Empire vs. the Rebel Alliance.Christian Bale plays Preston, the head cleric who is as emotionless as the Terminator. He  goes by the book at all times, even if it means killing his partner who was emoting on the sly. He's a widower with two kids, his pre-teen son also learning to be a cleric. And this kid doesn't mess around. He's worse than his dad, often to the point where he's keeping Bale in check. He scared me.One day, Preston drops and breaks his morning dose of ""Vulcan"" serum and when he tries to get a new vial at the Equilibrium complex, they're closed down because of terrorist activity. That means he has to go the whole day without shutting down his emotions. And that's when all hell breaks loose. Slowly, ever slowly, we're shown his inner struggle with having to be true to himself or adhering to the rules of society. Soon, he is all out refusing to use the serum in favor of enjoying the sunrise...the delight in touching things...music...etc. It's all beautifully played out by Bale and perfectly directed by whatshisname. And Preston is usually successful with going to work and faking his robo-attitude, except for the suspicions of his new ambitious partner, Brandt - played by Taye Diggs - a man who can detect when people are ""feeling.""The direction is pretty well done as this film's meager budget was stretched thin. The intricate matte designs and claustrophobic camerawork keep things dark and ominous. The cinematography and A.D.D. friendly editing reminds one of ""Underworld"" with consistently blue lighting and quick-cuts action. There's so much talent in this film that it doesn't look low budget at all. The script is tight and to-the-point and anything left out is covered perfectly by the highly expressive cast. The obvious references to stories of the past, i.e. ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Return of the Jedi,"" ""Out of the Past,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Terminator,"" ""Dark City,"" et al. are really fun to pick out too.The action scenes are top notch, melding martial arts with magnums in a specifically designed style of fighting called ""gun katas."" And Bale delivers beautifully, foreshadowing himself as the obvious choice for our modern day Batman. Also, the ""gun katas"" are a very cool concept. They are based on statistical research of return fire, making sure that your body is not in the way of enemy gunplay. Scientifically numbers-based, it's their way of guessing how your foes are going to shoot. There's a great scene where a grossly outnumbered Bale takes out his foes who have him completely at point-blank range. He's just dodging the bullets before they're shot. And the last 20 minutes are so filled with firepower that you might want to think twice before letting your kid watch with you.The story is well-crafted, complete with interesting twists as the O'brien character fights to survive as he sleeps with the enemy day in and day out. And Taye Diggs just delivers, flirting with stealing every scene he's in. There's nothing really wrong with this movie. But I can't, just CAN'T put it up there with Casablanca for some reason. Why? I can't say. There's just something missing. Something I'm just not...""feeling?"" Whatever the case, it's a damn good movie. And that's all I asked for when I pressed PLAY."	5.0	Only Made One Million At The Box Office???	2006-09-13	1	1	0

I found myself giggling at the Matrix style fight scene in the opening act. Wondering if it was trying to be ""The Matrix"" or ""Farenheit 451"" or ""1984"". And in truth it is a bit of all of these things. Pieced together amazingly well. So my giggling ceased and became slack jawed awe as the film progressed.This movie has alot to offer. Thrilling actions scenes that have you rewinding them to watch them again.The action in this film can be described as a beautiful violent ballet. I also found the story line to be quite engrossing, the plot twists truthfully kept me guessing. And the cineamatography is beautiful as well.I almost didn't see this movie because of the fact that I had heard it was a Matrix [copy], I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics, because I would have missed out on a fantastic film."	4.0	Give it a try you'll be surprised	2003-05-30	0	0	0

It was not made for mass appeal. People who love action and understand suspension of belief will enjoy this film. The distributors probably made a poor decision in comparing it to the Matrix. As a relatively low budget sci fi film, it stands on its own. This movie is great entertainment but the audience must understand two things. First, the director himself said that the society was not truly emotionless as emotion is an essential part of being human. The drug in the film merely removed the highs and lows. Maintaining ""equilibrium"" is a matter of societal influence and the Clerics. Second, all movies build on previous films. Whether it be production techniques, actors, or stories, without the foundations of previous work, we wouldn't have great movies like Charlie's Angels II.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3LQDYVAAHHV2T	FYI	"If you are a fan of ""Dark City,"" you will enjoy this visual treat - a dance macabre, a vicious, graceful delight, and critique of antidepressants. Totally original, yet an homage to Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" and Lang's ""Metropolis."" Christian Bale is subtle in portraying both control and loss of control, each emotion a careful part of the narrative, he grows in depth as each painful experience of emotion is peeled back from the drug-induced onion-skin. There is nothing over the top with this layering, this cleric/assassin grows in character and depth. The song ""What Have They Done to Me"" by VisageAnvilcould be the soundtrack here, or just about anything by Sisters of Mercy: Original Album Series:A Slight Case Of Overbombing/Some Girls Wander By Mistake/First And Last And Always/Floodland/Vision Thing. Sean Bean is always excellent, as is Emily Watson. As an aside, never has a puppy looked so lovable. This movie haunts the past and suggests a possible future. Wake up. Take off your gloves. Feel life. As with true Sci-Fi, moral questions are framed within new technologies, our choices as human beings are further stretched by each innovation, perhaps to breaking point. Is this the future, is it the past? In an almost recognizable, unfamiliar environment, the elements that consist of a soul, of a society, are confronted, making ""Equilibrium"" both futuristic and ancient in its concerns. You also might enjoy the ""Riddick"" and ""Underworld/Evolution"" films.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AUTUO3R8V60GN	"Gautner ""Gautner"""	"Equilibrium is a curate's egg - its best parts are not good throughout, and its worst aspects make erratic appearances. The acting is really the least of its problems; the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up.Equilibrium, however poorly, aspires to be a dystopian film, and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike. Such a formula was employed magnificently in Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. Contrarily, films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by Alfonso Cuaron's junky adaptation of P.D. James' The Children of Men. There are essentially three parts to this formula. First, there must be a depiction of a believable society, and plausible justifications for its existence. The author or script writer must paint vividly, yet remain nuanced, since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer, without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it. Second, two-thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist, which formally unveils the ethical dilemma. Here, the protagonist offers his alternative, usually an acknowledgement of the humane. Third, the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist's choice: he must surrender to the system, rebel against it, or be conquered by it. The ending, if it is not tragic in the classical sense, must be ambiguous; if it is ended happily, it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers' thoughts: the problem has been resolved, and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it.Libria, the society depicted in Equilibrium, is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings, and the actions carried out on their behalf, represent the fons et origio of man's inhumanity to man. The objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace. Is this believable? Ultimately, it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist, no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved. However, a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war, and aversion is something we principally feel. A more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings, but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent. The protagonist (John Preston, a member of the Grammaton Cleric, an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called `sense-crimes') marries, begets children, hesitates in killing his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling? And, if we are being generous, and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say, ""You can never entirely eliminate feeling,"" it fails still; because if the denizens of Libria weren't completely devoid of feeling, they couldn't be as cowed as they are depicted. Instead, countless times throughout the film characters make comments, statements, enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion. To have had characters who were truly apathetic, or for whom the fictitious drug Prozium was effective, they would have had more in common with Star Trek's Borg. The backdrop for this dystopia, then, lacks subtlety or nuance. From the first fifteen seconds of film, the viewer ethically objects - it remains tediously Manichean throughout. The viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen.In Brave New World, it is Mustapha Mond's conversation with John the Savage. In 1984, it is O'Brien's talk with Winston Smith. In The Children of Men, it is a debate between Theo and the Xan. In Equilibrium, the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout, culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the Matrix three years before. Here was the moment for the ""talky"" bit of the film, the sophisticated counter-punch, the moral awakening, the vindication of the human; instead, the viewer is given another low-brow, Hollywood denouement. John Preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with Father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that ""Feelings are essential to thought,"" or that ""peace has been obtained at a terrible price."" All the loose ends, littered liberally throughout the film, are never addressed: Why have art in Libria? Why does Father intonate, and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film? A better film would have acknowledged these scenes, and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between John Preston and Father (or DuPont as it turns out).The conclusion of Equilibrium can be summarized as follows: ""Good guy kills bad guys, sixty-second revolution ensues, people can feel again, hero smiles, time to go to bed."" There wasn't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway: what was wrong was obviously wrong, and what was right was intuitively right. The viewer never believed the reasons Libria came to be, or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found Huxley's, Orwell's, James', Zamyatin's, or Koestler's explanations. In Equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal, unoriginal action movie to follow. The plot, then, was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films: they needn't be sensical because no one is interested in the story, but rather for the titillation, arousal, and amusement. Many viewers of Equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences (a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest); but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience, Equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	Equilibrium - an interesting concept. Yes this film may look and perhaps imitate other Sci-Fi movies but its basic storyline is original and thought provoking.Christian Bale is John Preston, a Cleric who enforces the law of no emotion after they were declared illegal in order to prevent further war - achieved by the newly created drug 'Prozium'. One morning, having failed to take his daily dose of it, Preston realises the highs and lows of his new found human emotions and embarks on a new alliance with 'The Underground' and a fight to free the rest of the impassive city of Libria.Some interesting ideas here, yet Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer did not execute them well enough nor expand on their philosophy. Not only that, its intent to be an action film was not fulfilled considering the Cleric's powers revolve around the fictional fighting style 'Gun Kata', it is seldom used. Had there been a few added fight scenes near the beginning and a bigger climatic fight at the end, Equilibrium would have been a lot more entertaining.That aside and considering the rather low funding it had, Equilibrium exceeds as a low budget action film. Definitely worth watching.	3.0	Interesting Yet Not Enough Action.	2004-07-12	2	2	0

Cinematically, the look is highly influenced by Metropolis, and the fight scenes are reminiscent of The Matrix.Okay, now that I've established ""Equilibrium"" is highly derivative of other influences, I give it high marks because it's a well-told, well-acted tale of trying to break free from total mind control in a dystopian future. Christian Bale does a great job as an enforcer of the ""no feeling"" rules; and when he begins to feel emotions himself, he convincingly plays a man experiencing feelings for the first time in his life. Emily Watson and Taye Diggs turn in fine performances as well, and also, as the ""big man in charge"", the actor that plays Robert the Bruce in Braveheart does quite well."	4.0	Good Synthesis of 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451	2010-10-06	1	0	1

I saw a portion of ""Equilibirum"" on FX the other night, and then immediately went out the next day to rent it. If you can momentarily suspend disbelief, this film is fantastic!  I love its stark aesthetics and particularly Christian Bale's performance as the ascetic and elite Grammaton Cleric John Preston.  The gun-kata fight scenes are pretty beautiful to watch too.  If you like the ""Matrix,"" or ""Aeon Flux,"" you'll probably like ""Equilibrium.""Basically, this film is set in the not so distant future.  A third world war has ravaged the Earth.  Political leaders realize that the world can't possibly survive a fourth world war.  As such, they set out to create a ""great society"" founded on peace.  According to the political elite, however, peace can't be achieved without the total eradication of emotions.  Peace is also coerced.  The citizens of the ""great society"" are therefore forced by an arbitrary legal system to take the drug Prosium which inhibits emotions.  As a member of an elite police force, Grammaton Cleric Preston leads enforcement of the law against ""sense offenders.""  He is so cold blooded that he doesn't even bat an eye when his wife is accused of ""sense offence"" and is taken by a police task force to be ""processed"" aka incinerated.  But in a series of events starting with his enforcement partner's defection to the realm of emotions, Grammaton Cleric Preston starts to question his unbending loyalty to the ""great society.""

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3A06ZU6QI9KIL	"G. Marshall ""Geoffrey Marshall"""	"One night back in 2003, I was channel-surfing with one of my then-housemates on a Saturday night. As we went past The Movie Channel, I got a glimpse of Christian Bale in a cool black leather suit doing something totally funky with a huge semi-auto pistol. The movie was halfway through, but we decided to take a look at what it was all about. We ended up watching the rest of the movie, and wondering why it is that we never heard anything about it when it came out in the theaters, because it was pretty durn good. I had to go online and look up the movie schedule to get the name, and then I went and rented the DVD to get the whole movie.This movie is a new cult classic. I won't go over the plot synopses here, but I will say that while its inspirations are readily apparent, this movie is not a rip-off of anything. It is totally orginal, down to the gun-kata discipline which is just good ol'-fashioned butt-kicking made glamourous. I don't know if gun-kata is actually possible, but all acttion scense that included it were great. THe storyline is pretty simple and straight forward.The acting is very good. Christian Bale does a solid job of making John Preston real and sympathetic, Taye Diggs is deliciously smarmy as Preston's new partner (who has a lot of pride in himself; isn't that a crime, Bill Fichter pops up a bit and Angus McFayden deserves a mention.Odds are that you've never heard this movie. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not going to on the Library of Congress historical archive, but it will go on the ""fun movie to watch over weekend with the peeps.""

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A300JR91ZGTZYI	GojiraBoy	"Disappointed with ""The Matrix Reloaded""?  Felt let down? ACHIEVE ""Equlibrium"" by watching this GREAT movie.WOW!!!...Taking a breather after finishing this incredible film had to sit down and throw in my two cents.First of all, this is another much needed and sorely missed breath of fresh air that we've seen so rarely come down the pike from the cookie-cutter that is Hollywood.  This movie made me feel the same way after viewing such films as ""Dark City"", ""The Matrix"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Memento"",  ""Donnie Darko"", ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"", as well as The films of Wes and Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze, Guy Ritchie, and Doug Liman--which is completly surprised, and pleased with the blend of intelligence with action and an ever increasing difficulty level of taking elements of genres and giving them a unique new twist (true originality is all but dead).Granted this movie uses elements of stories we've seen before whether it be the oppressive dystopias of movies like 1984, Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, THX 1138, Metropolis, Brazil, Gattaca, Logan's Run, Rollerball (the original), or ""The Handmaid's Tale"".It's interesting to note that Libria's citizens are encouraged to ""rat"" each other out. It brings to mind Mao or McCarthy although not to such hysterical fever pitches...that would be a ""sense offense"". Instead of books, or political idealogies, emotions themselves are outlawed. Instead of ""A Brave New World's"" ~soma~ the good citizen's of Libria have the opiate for the masses ""Prozium"".  This is Libria's cure to end war (unlike Rollerball's ""game"").Not that ALL emotions are eradicated , as director Kurt Wimmer shares, rather prozium eliminates mankind's tempestous highs and lows.  And those emotions, ambition, jealousy, that might further Libria's cause of promoting ""Non-feeling"" are allowed such as Taye Diggs character's motivation to bring John Preston (Christian Bale) down.  It's also interesting to note that the director meant this as a parable, a cautionary tale of socio-politcal ideology gone wrong, rather than a literal story.The Grammaton Clerics similarity to the sandmen in ""Logan's Run"" (""Minority Report"" has similarities to ""LR"" as well) was interesting--two partner cops hunting down ""offenders"" whether they be ""runners"", ""Pre-criminals"", or in this case ""sense offenders"".  One has to pursue and kill a partner then have his conscience / soul pricked to have an epiphany and find they are questioned or pursued themselves.I can't say enough about the performances other than agreeing with the director he batted a thousand with his casting.  Everybody was superb, Christian Bale is a delight to watch grow with each new performance (Damn why can't Hollywood wise up to this proven action star with acting chops to boot-- like the late Brandon Lee, Christian Bale packs a deadly combo of ripped physicallity with a deep emotional wellspring to draw on).  Sean Bean continues to blow me away with performances of his ""flawed= REAL"" characters, whether in ""Goldeneye"", ""Patriot Games"", ""Ronin"", or ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" Bean wrenches a very soulful, human performance out of what little screen time he's given.The action of this movie is a much needed shot in the arm for HARD CORE ACTION JUNKIES.  The impressive ""Gun Kata"" invented by the director is a fresh, inventive next-step in the evolution of the cinematic gun battle. Hong Kong innovators such as John Woo / Chow Yun Fat ushered in the Balletic ""Gun Fu"" (as coined by writer Ric Meyers).  This film unlike ""The Matrix"" and it's sequels does not rely on ""wire-fu"" stunts-- (the flip by Cleric Preston was accomplished by a diving champion stunt double) --refreshing after being bombarded by the likes of the 2 ""Charlie's Angels"" entries, augmentation of recent Jackie Chan (The Tuxedo), Jet Li (Pick one), and Chow Yun Fat (Bullet-proof Monk) movies.  Don't get me wrong wire work is a great tool in use of projects involving super-human ability (such as Jet Li's multiverse titan in ""The One"") any number of recent Superhero movies (Blade 2, Daredevil, Spiderman, X-men), or the Swordplay classic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".The action sequences resonate with the speed and beauty of the best of Jet Li's Hong Kong work, married with the swordplay scenes with Preston's use of the ""Zatoichi"" underhand swordhold style.  The opening introduction to the prowess of the Grammaton Cleric's ""Gun-Kata"", the numerous confrontations between Preston and the many ""sweepers"", the Kendo bokken match between Preston and Brandt, and the climactic Hallway ""weeble wobble-clip"" gun battle, Preston and Brandt's ""Face-off"", and the final confrontation between Dupont (Angus MacFadyen / Braveheart) which innovatively uses the hand locking styles reminiscent of Wing Chun's 'chi sau'/'lok sau', or Tai Chi Chuan's 'toi sau' only with guns!In the Director's commentary Kurt Wimmer hints at a fighting technique not used in this movie that he's saving for a future project...I can't wait!I find as with the umpteen reviewers before me the ""Matrix"" comparison on the box a bit of a misnomer and rather tedious.  As for the swipes at Preston's clothes copying Neo, other than they are sleek tight fitting and black I don't see the comparison (I mean Neo was wearing a trenchcoat!) I also remind all that ""Equilibrium"" predates ""Matrix re-loaded"" in which the tables are turned Neo's ""uber-mensch/superman"" persona has on the ""GOD Smock"".  I find that I, as a political cartoonist in a daily competition with other artists to put a humorous spin on current events notice on occasion that 2 or more creative people will come up with the same idea independently from one another.  So I agree with director Kurt Wimmer that the bros. Wachowski were giving Neo religious garb to outwardly represent his 'deity' which coincidently took on the 19th century deacon smock motif.In the interest of observation, viewers may find Jim Jarmusch's ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai"" (2000) interesting in that the Hit-man character played by Forest Whitacker adheres to Modern Bushido as he swings his pistols around like swords...something to check out-you just might LIKE it!"	5.0	Hey You!Get off the 'Prozium' WAKE UP and watch this Movie!!	2003-07-06	4	4	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A36WGHR8TO5DKT	"Goldwave ""shopper"""	"This film is very formulaic, aligning with old classics like Fahrenheit 451 and 1984.  So, I was expecting it to be more predictable than it actually was.  It's well crafted even though it doesn't look like they had a big budget to work with.  The film could have been even better with more money, I think, since the teams hired to do the various bits all did a good job and I would have liked to see what they could do with more cash to play with.  As is always wise, the producer took advantage of the talent cast in the film to help overcome the sterility without losing that totalitarian theme.  It's a simplistic script but nevertheless you feel that it could be an authentic scenario and thus you can go along with it.  Another big plus I would give to this film is that it does not rely on gratuitous violence and sex.  It has intense scenes and some violence, but the graphic stuff is usually left mostly to the imagination.  In doing so, a lot more suspense, tension and emotion is achieved, I think, compared to many films that have a less artistic sensibility behind them.  I think that also supports the overall dynamic taking place between emotion/emotionless states of consciousness; all very well-done thematically throughout in this regard.  Finally, I thought the ""Gun-Fu"" choreography and concepts were interesting and well executed, as well as being quite logical in this scenario.  If you like science fiction, action, suspense, or martial arts films, I think you would enjoy this."	4.0	Entertaining; less predictable than you'd think	2013-08-22	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1ZS82R4RC0I2N	gonn1000	A dark and futuristic thriller, &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a clever and convincing addition to the somewhat tired and repetitive science-fiction genre.In a flawed society after World War III, emotion and feeling are considered the proeminent elements that lead to the collapse and fall of social order, control and organization. So, the best way to avoid a disastrous scenario is to block or destroy any kind of emotion, building an apathetic, controlled and obedient society.Christian Bale plays a special agent whose mission is to kill anyone who dares to defy the rules and actually gets to feel anything, and his task is well suceeded until a point where he starts questioning his system.Director Kurt Wimmer manages to combine diverse references, from George Orwell`s &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot; or &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and delivers a consistent and gripping sci-fi thriller, even if its premise isn`t all that innovative. The futuristic society is dark and gloomy as it should, the atmosphere of the movie is dense and claustrophobical enough, the fight scenes are well directed and the plot presents some creativity (the ending, however, is a bit predictable, simplistic and anti-climatic).&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is also a one-man show, where Christian Bale shows (again) that he is an enticing and credible actor, adding depth and presence to a character that could easily have been a cardboard tough guy.Although it`s not as challenging as some of its influences, this cinematic experience is still a strong effort and an unexpected surprise worth discovering.	3.0	Interesting Sci-fi	2004-03-15	7	3	4

If you have some time to kill then give this movie a try. It was free with our prime membership so there wasn't anything to lose. The movie IS a bit dated.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1VJ7HYM1EC94M	"G P Padillo ""paolo"""	"Silly, predictable, seriously flawed, with moments that are outright laughable, Equilibrium nonetheless transcends all of these and through its compelling performances and fun pseudo-comic book settings delivers a powerful emotional punch that should resonate strongly for anyone who loves stark, stylistic Orwellian drama.In a future dominated by Father (with a not so subtle nod to ""Big Brother""), emotions have been eliminated and feeling is a crime, punished by immediate incineration - along with things like art, music, literature, friendship, love and everything else that makes life worth living.  Wisely, there is an underground rebellion contingency who continue to ""live.""  Among them, Emily Watson's saintly, emotional Mary O'Brien.  These folk are, naturally, hunted down by the Grammaton Clerics, that physically fit bastion of unfeeling purity out to uphold and enforce the law.Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston gives a performance that is simply terrific offering a fascinating character study.  One witnesses in anticipation as, throughout the slow process Preston's emotion free automaton - the pride of the Tetragrammaton - evolves into freedomfighter and ultimately liberator. Watch as, for the first time, Preston listens to music (the opening measures of Beethoven's 9th Symphony) and through his face captures and reveals the range of awe and wonderment as though awakening from a lifelong coma.  Bale is more than up to the task as we watch his Cleric struggle with his newfound duplicity and makes route for him, but still believe the man may very well fail his mission.Director, Kurt Wimmer, in what appears to be his first big screen directorial job, has created an entire new, faux martial arts: ""Gun-Kata.""  Gun-Kata is a highly stylized combination of two handed gun fighting and classic tai-chi/martial arts movement based on ""a scientific analysis of bullet trajectory and range"" combined with mathematics, etc.  At first, it is almost painfully hilarious to watch, but give in and it achieves a type of anime, hyper realistic that can only be described as ""wicked cool!""Bale's Preston is THE master of Gun-Kata and as he inevitably goes after ""Father"" his penultimate fight with former partner Taye Diggs' will leave you cheering.Like a great conductor, Wimmer brings together all of the disparate elements of his symphony with its wordless, choral based soundtrack, jumps every hurdle and flaw, delivering a terrific movie full of action, meaning and emotion."	5.0	Matrix?

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AIOR855KQQPTN	greygeek	The plot of the movie is boring. An occasional &#34;Schwarzenegger&#34; moment seems to have been randomly inserted in an apparent attempt to inject some energy into the plot.The basis of the movie is that the cause of all of humanities problems is human emotions (love, pride, etc.).  The existing power structure has developed a serum that  suppresses human emotion and has cultivated individuals with the gift of reading human emotions.  Individuals not willing to accept the serum are considered to represent all of the evil in the world and are targets of eradication.  The humans with the ability to read the presence of emotions in other humans are used to identify the non-compliant humans and schedule the non-compliant individuals for termination.I suppose the message in the movie somehow relates to the apparent (sometimes subliminal) emotions displayed by the unemotional enforcers of the non-emotional culture...but perhaps I shouldn't judge.  I bailed about 1/3 of the way into the movie.  I couldn't take anymore of the movie.	1.0	Boring	2014-04-04	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AKB2PYODH0TKS	"Grey Wolffe ""Zeb Kantrowitz"""	This movie will remind you of a lot of movies but only in part and that's the problem with this movie.  It tries to do too much while not giving us enough of a background to understand or care about what is happening.  The main character is a 'cleric' but that's never truly explained.  The whole society seems to produce nothing so how does it survive?In any society, if you continually gave drugs to people to suppress their emotions, it would destroy the ability to produce REM sleep.  Such suppression has been show to be a precursor to sleep deprivation and the inability to sleep (i.e. insomnia).  REM sleep is when we dream and it is thought to be necessary for consolidating memory and releasing tension.  The loss of REM could lead to a society of insomniacs.  Since no drug is perfect a number of people would become immune to it while others would have allergic reactions that could lead to death.The 'shooting' scenes are right out of the MATRIX trilogy, the burning of the pictures,books,etc. are right out of Fahrenheit 451, and so many other scenes are out of 1984 (especially the man speaking from a screen to people in rooms and on the street).  The movie just seems to telegraph what's going to happen in the next section over and over.  The man at the top (who is supposed to report to 'Father') seems to be emotionally unstable which makes us wonder if he take his drugs.To formulaic and to much taken from other movies that did it better.Zeb Kantrowitz	3.0	Neo meets 1984 meets Fahrenheit 451	2009-06-24	0	0	0

I loved the fighting scene at the end, where Christian Bale took on like 80 guys at once by himself and seems unhurt at the end. In comparing this movie to George Orwell's 1984, I found notable comparisons, from Christian BaLE'S CHILDREN, TO The Parson children in the novel. Both had children whom by apperances seemed loyal to the party, and willing to turn in thier parents. Likewise, the book and movie, have monitored coversations, i.e., through tvs. In both, the main character is drawn away from the desired living, and rebells. I like how Chrisitan Bale's character turns, when he accidently destroys a dosage of medicine he has to take. His orginal partner is like Syme or Julia, because they were also drawn to rebelion against the goverment.	4.0	H. Dandoy Mr Yochum's 13/14 Eng. Class	2008-05-02	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1283Z83HCLL36	Heather Simmons	"Equilibrium is incredible. Having seen The Matrix, I was not particularly interested in watching this movie because I was expecting a copycat. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the Matrix, but I had no desire to see a film that tried to imitate it. I was very wrong. Equilibrium was way better than the Matrix, and is nothing like it. Some of the fight scenes might make you think of the Matrix but the two movies are not alike. Maybe it was the sword fighting and the gun fighting in the same scene that made it so great. Or maybe it was a clean shaven, slicked-backed-haired Chritian Bale. Christian Bale's performance is unforgetable. The incredible fight scenes and the way you can see his emotions starting to erupt in his eyes through his emotionless face. I also liked the lack of romance in this movie. I can't express how many action movies have gone to crap due to a sudden romance in the middle of the movie. There is some attraction between John Preston (Christian Bale) and Mary (Emily Watson) but there are no kissing or sex scenes or even a real romance between them. The attraction was needed to show that John Preston was starting to feel emotions, but it was none of that ""Im in love with you, I want to marry you"" junk that ruins action movies. I highly recommend this to everyone who loves a good action movie with incredible fight scenes. I also recommend this to everyone who liked The Matrix, I challenge all of you to compare the two films. I know that you will find the film to be equally good or better."	5.0	Forget the Matrix...

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ	"-- ""--"""	"""Equilibrium"" truly gives ""The Matrix"" a run for its money. It may not be as revolutionary, and it was certainly made on very limited coffers (in film terms, that is, with a budget of about twenty million dollars), but this movie nonetheless has it all: heart, soul, brains, and more than its fair share of visceral action. It is this combination of the dramatic, the cerebral, and the intense that makes ""Equilibrium"" one of the best action films of its kind, and one of the very best films released in 2002 (though Dimension, for whatever reason, opted for a limited release, which may be why you've never heard of it up until now).The always versatile and vastly talented Christian Bale plays John Preston, an emotionless enforcer (or Cleric) who arrests, and more often murders, those known as ""Sense Offenders"" - people who refuse to obey the laws of the futuristic regime, which has made illegal all forms of artistic expression, and even emotion itself. Emotion is regulated by daily drug use, and those who refuse to indulge are summarily executed. But when Preston kills his partner (played by Sean Bean, who so effortlessly portrayed Boromir in ""The Lord of the Rings"") for displaying unusual sentiment and misses his own required inducement of the emotion-quelling drug, he realizes that perhaps he is fighting for the wrong team.""Equilibrium"" feels like John Woo's take on ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""Brave New World,"" and it's absolutely astounding. Though at times ""Equilibrium"" may be guilty of mimicking ""The Matrix,"" it sometimes outshines its forebear, and is every bit as compelling, its world every bit as believable (if not more so). Like ""The Matrix,"" ""Equilibrium"" makes a powerful statement, and despite its splendidly choreographed action segments (which are revolutionary in their own right), it is a film with brains and brawn alike, and should not be missed. At last, despite all of its immitators, ""The Matrix"" has a worthy adversary in the genre."	5.0	"The first true rival of ""The Matrix"". . ."	2003-05-14	6	6	0

The movie is well paced, superbly acted (especially Christian Bale who is, as usual, outstanding), and suspensful to the end.  It is rated 'R' for the violence (lots of choreographed shooting/killing (but no gore), but little (if any--none that I can remember) profanity, and no sex). It is really more like a PG-13 movie--OK for the kids (at least teenagers) to watch.While the standard DVD issue had excellent video and sound, the Blu-ray transfer is nonetheless a definite improvement. It is well worth the purchase.  The bad news is that, for some reason, this movie has not been released on Blu-ray in the U.S.  The good news is that you can purchase it directly from Amazon.UK for about $20, including shipping. The Blu-ray is indeed region-free--it will play on your U.S. Blu-ray player--no problems whatsoever on my Sony player that was intended for playing only Region A (USA) discs. Purchasing from Amazon's UK site was effortless--they already knew who I was from my account information in the U.S.  The shipping was relatively fast--about a week. Since the item is being shipped from overseas, you cannot avoid the shipping charge--even if you purchase several items at the same time.There are several other notable Blu-rays that were only released in Europe but fortunately, are also region-free, including ""Zulu"" and ""The Island"".

This movie was one demensional.  The bad guys were all stupid, the plot and storyline were poor at best.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A457S8SW690NM	hi	Equilibrium is a movie that follows in the footsteps of the Matrix, yet is better than its predecessor in every possible way. The acting is excellent notably by Christian Bale, who isa much better actor than Keannu Reeves. Bale should have been Neo. It would have been a much better movie. The plot of Equilibrium is better and the fights are even better! The plot of this movie is thought provoking, very original and very memorable. The movie is set in the future in a very change world after World War III. In this future, feelings of any kind are outlawed as are objects that provoke feelings. Everyone injects themselves so that they never feel. Christian Bale plays a cop that finds sense offenders and arrests them. But this world is depressing and weird. Christian Bale's character can't take it anymore and becomes the leader of the rebellion against this world.The movie is very moving and interesting, and the fight scenes are absolutely amazing. The final fight is AWESOME and very memorable!This movie is worth a buy thanks to the amazing fights and the memoralbe story! This movie IS better than the Matrix in every possible way and I strongly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good action/ sci fi movie. It has some of the most memorable fighting scenes ever and everything just seems to click in this awesome movie.	5.0	Vastly superior to the Matrix!!!!!!	2005-08-08	2	1	1

He does just that in this twisted-future flick, where everybody is drugged to keep down violence and war.  Of course, after he misses a few doses, he sides gradually with the resistance.  He tries to deal with newfound emotion while keeping that poker face for his job as top cop/enforcer.  Entertaining, and draws you into his character.	5.0	heroes of the future	2007-01-27	2	1	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2EGVIYZ31SEEC	hmmm	I have been told that the movie, Equilibrium is very similar to the box office hit, The Matrix. After watching Equilibrium I can say that it cannot even compare to The Matrix. There are some similarities but I would say for sure Equilibrium does not come anywhere close to The Matrix. My spedific thoughts about Equilibrium are mixed. I thought the movie was at times a little too cheesy for me, but at other points I thought the movie had some great action scenes. The actions scenes were pretty unrealistic but then again movies tend to be way more entertaining if they are completely unrealistic. People like to watch movies that show events that clearly could never happen. The movie kept my attention and thats all it needed to do in order for me to not bash it. My one complaint though is the ending. I think the ending could have been a lot better. I felt as if I was left hanging and wanted to know some of what happened after he basically destroyed everyone/everything bad.	3.0	Mr. Yochum's 13/14 Senior English Class	2009-04-13	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1E11HKN4IRY09	Hogarth Hughes	EQUILIBRIUM is a difficult movie to review.  Although this film is a really good b-movie, with some nifty (if not borderline silly) action sequences and great concepts, there are plot holes-a-rama.  I can't help but like CHRISTIAN BALE whose movie status is becoming that of zen guru of the smaller sci-fi/horror genre of well made b-flicks, and here he shines as usual.  The entire idea of the Gramaton Cleric is pretty cool, and is executed in some inventive set peices that are remiders of THE MATRIX as much as they are not.  I think this film stands on its own being just different enough to be original.  The production design was good as well, usually movies with a smaller budget and advertising campaign end up looking like they were filmed on a soap set.  The director helps us view an antiseptic world as void of emotions as the characters within.  Enjoyable at face value; don't even try to bring up realistic implications about the storyline because there are so many lapses in logic.  TAYE DIGGS' character displays a wide range of emotions throughout the picture and he's suppose to be emotionless.  From minute one he wants BALE's job, is not that jealousy?  Well he does lose some face eventually.  This is one movie where style totally reigns over substance but somehow both intertwine to create a pretty decent film with cool gunplay and something to think about a least a few hours after the credits roll.	3.0	Clerical debate.	2003-05-17	1	0	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ACW6JGQNXORRN	HorrorGuy	I am not sure how I missed this movie but it completely flew under my radar. A girl I was seeing recommended this film and I ended up taking a chance and picking it up on Blu-Ray. I am so glad for the recommendation and that I took a chance on this. This movie did not disappoint at all. Great action sequences with highly choreographed and impressive gun battles.This movie has a very interesting view on the future; a society that tries to strip away everything that makes us feeling human beings in an effort to quell emotion, that the society leaders claim, leads to violence, anarchy and inevitably - war. The movie lets you peer into a culture that squashes, with swift brutality, any and all things that spawn passion of any kind.Christian Bale is very good in this and the little known supporting cast does an admirable job as well. This is an Alliance title released in Canada primarily and comes to us via import through Amazon. This studio also has current Blu-Ray titles like Kill Bill 1 & 2, From Dusk til Dawn, Blade 1 & 2 and Gosford Park; all of which are very respectable 1080p transfers with great picture quality and DTS Master HD sound tracks.Though it does not say on the cover (cover mentions only a Dolby 5.1 and French 2.0 sound track) this Blu-Ray sports a very cool DTS Master HD soundtrack, which sounds fantastic. The picture is very clean and crisp in 1080p HD. The corporate cold and gray culture, which dominates this film, is occasionally met with some very rich colors that pose a nice contrast.I was pleasantly surprised how good this was for a relatively unknown film. There are plenty of scenes of brutality and highly stylized graphic violence to wet your appetite for good action and entertainment. If you enjoy Sci-Fi action films this is a must have to add to your Blu Ray collection.	5.0	A Solid Sci-Fi Film & Amazing on Blu-Ray	2010-01-26	3	3	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1QYBVONVG1X46	"Ian Low Boon Tian ""Ian Low"""	Never even heard of this in 2002 when this was released, and 2002 was a great year itself for sci-fi. We had Star Wars Ep2, Solaris and my favourite sci-fi film up to that point ... Minority Report. Then only a couple of weeks ago, went down to my local HMV store and saw this on the shelves on sale.My expectations wasnt very high, but I am a big fan of C. Bale and to me, he was always engaging. After putting this on, and 107 minutes later, I was hooked. Not the way I was utterly impressed like Minority Report when I first watched it, but somehow, it certainly had me thinking of the movie's theme, the gunkata fight sequences, which were so awesomely jaw-dropping it outdid anything Matrix ever had at a fraction of its budget.Then I watched it again with the commentary, and I caught all the details I missed out the first time. Then it hit me, this was a great film. No, make it a supreme film. 2nd time around, I noticed the cinemtography and the production design, which were in a word, beautiful. And the story, which whilst not original, is definitely very engaging. 1984, Fahrenheit 451 are movies that come to mind, but they were never this entertanining.Make this the 1984 for this millennium, a movie that moves with the ultra slick pace of a Matrix, but with a more deep rooted theme of dystopia and control that is worlds apart from the philosophies and twists of the Walchowski bros. In a way, it is a simple story, but simple stories told well and acted well can also be profound and long lasting.And the acting, I believe Bale's role is his best. It's not easy to notice at first as he plays a cold, ruthless cleric and despatches the resistance with hardly a blink. But his physical abilities and fluid movements shows off Bale's capabilities as an action hero that can give Keanu's Neo a run for his money. But what augments this immeasurably is his ability to act ... and to slowly emote over the length of the film.Catch the scene where he awakes to a sunrise and for the first time, is able to feel and appreciate it even for this simple act. And Emily Watson's short but very effective role as the woman who first instigate him to think about turning. Their scenes are not the easiest, yet the tension and eventual connection they make through just looks and the slightest of dialogue. Sean Bean is always equally memorable in his very brief role as Bale's partner.Round it up with good performances by Taye Diggs and Angus McFadden and this movie surpasses the usual sci-fi stilted acting that we are so often bombarded with. Kurt Wimmer, the director is also a smart director. Instead of giving us cliches, he gives us situations which you might not necessarily expect, short but stunning fight sequences instead of prolonged fights and explosions/stunts which only hampers the story and pace.Ultimately, it's a movie that rewards with subsequent viewings, and may explain why this has turned into such a cult classic among its devoted followers, myself included. Fan fiction and fan videos have already extended the world of Libria and pay homage to the movie and its characters. While it may never reach the dizzying heights of Matrix, it doesnt need to.This film is not for the masses, but for those who can really appreciate its intentions and its strong visuals (despite its lack of budget) and eventually, the theme behind it. As Kurt himself says, its more about numbness towards everything and how one man reacts to it and finds himself liberated by the simplest of things that we take for granted.For myself, I will enjoy rewatching this as only the best in sci-fi movies can compel me to do so. It is simply not just a sci-fi cult classic, it is a geniune masterpiece in a genre that rarely produces one.	5.0	Equilibrium - Sci-Fi Masterpiece	2007-03-19	9	8	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3S6E6FCWN39P4	ImpendingBlue	"This film, although a recent purchase, has been a favorite of mine for quite a while now.I like action movies.  They are fun escapism and easy amusement or gratification.  They are not a one size fits all genre, but when you want to watch that type of story, there really is no substitute.I also, however, appreciate a depth of story.  Especially a story that asks, or at least looks at, real questions.  Things that matter in the bigger picture.This film is a rarity in that, in my opinion, it does both of those things.  Well.The action is fast, violent, not so absurd as to totally break suspension of disbelief (an important factor), and also beautifully artistic in it's choreography.Those scenes are the frosting on a cake of deep questions.  What is it to be human?  Are feelings required?  Would you trade them for safety?Is that even possible or is it just lying to ourselves?  To what extent can we solve our problems with chemicals and social engineering?Set in the not-too-distant future, a totalitarian regime preaches against emotional extremes and requires timed-interval drug dosage for the entire populace to prevent them.  The given theory being that elimination of those strong emotions is the key to peace and the survival of humanity in the fallout of the third world war.On the surface, it is dull, but successful.  No murder.  No rape.  No crime at all is suggested, but not specified.  By trading in the highs of joy and passion, we have eliminated the lows of rage and misery.Yet, this same governing body views anyone in violation of thier dosage, or worse yet in pursuit of those emotional extremes and all the things that provoke or inspire them, to be criminals of the worst sort.  They are viewed as collectively trying to undo the peace and drag humanity back into the pit, so to speak.So what does the regime do?  It finds these people.  Labels them ""sense offenders"", and murders them.So did we really find peace and escape killing each other?  Or are we just protecting ourselves from the dissident few, that would bring us all down?Good stuff.  Splendid acting and exposition, and the action movie frosting to boot.

On the DVD it reads: ""In the future where freedom is outlawed, outlaws will become heros"".  The difference:The Matrix:  This is a film about a computer-created messiah with godlike abilities called ""The One"" whose calling is to save humankind from the machines they built. Throughout all three films we are subjected to every religious philosophy ever conceived by mankind mangled into tiny bits and then sautered together to suit the AI. It makes sense a computer would come up with this type of ""religion"" having to depend on it's data base of man's religious history to create it.Equilibrium:  This is a dystopian story; a government gone wrong with a highly placed government loyalist finally seeing through it and eventually bringing the government down.  The hero in this one is a well-honed, brilliant warrior called a ""Cleric"", intelligently schooled in the deadly martial art of Gun Kata--no godlike abilities here--just the best fighter the Palace of Justice has to offer.I thoroughly enjoyed this film's execution of it's premise; it was well-done.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A19JYLHD94K94D	Itamar Katz	Given the very poor overall quality of sci-fi movies released every year, maybe I don't have the right to complain about Equilibrium. After all, it's a well-made, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi movie in the finest tradition of the `highest' prototype of the genre, with some great design ideas and highly impressive action scenes. And, to tell the truth. I quite enjoyed it. It sure was better than the Matrix Revolutions. It strikes me as peculiar, though, that with so many great sci-fi novels lying around just waiting to be adapted, this movie ever needed to be made. The plot of Equilibrium is so incredibly trite and predictable, I can practically spot which novel each aspect of it was taken from. Most of all it owes incredible amounts to 1984, while the fight scenes are inspired directly by The Matrix. The plot twists are predictable, and the ending immensely disappointing. There were more than a few 1984 rip-offs made before; check out Terry Gilliam's Brazil for one that managed to stay fresh and original. Equilibrium, on the other hand, makes no new statement and thus fails to justify its existence.A few words of praise, though, should go to the lead actors. Christian Bale is great in the main part, but I was more impressed with supporting actors Emily Watson and Sean Bean - Sean delivered a short performance, but nevertheless it was the best part of the movie. It can be safely said the story becomes more boring and more predictable as the story goes on, the deterioration beginning with the death of Bean's character, and hitting rock bottom with that of Watson's. The ending in particular is rushed, unconvincing and unimpressive. Matthew Harbour as Bale's son is especially wasted, as are all the lead villain characters. The final showdown is far too short and the happy ending too strained; it almost seems as if the last twenty minutes were glued on, like the fabricated happy ending Brazil got in its US version. Still, good acting, good photography, good pace (for the first hour and a half) and terrific fighting choreography make Equilibrium a nice watch. If you're a fan of the genre it's worth renting, but don't expect too much of it.	3.0	Well made, but predictable	2003-11-11	13	5	8
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A278ABYYACM3Y7	"Ivan Ramirez V ""Kal-El from Krypton"""	It looks like Matrix marked a new age for Sci-Fi movies by showing deep phylosophycal drama, fast paced action sequences, complex martial arts ballets and doomy/gloomy societies. Anyhow, if you want these ingredients in a sci-fi movie I invite to buy this one! The main plot exposes us to a very good human question as to whether will we be able to annihilate war by supressing our own feelings...Like or not, it is a valid point of view. Very good political view of a not-so-far future and a resistance which tries to gives us back our humanity. The fight sequences, thou not having the complexity of those of Matrix they are really good because they have martial arts and gun shoots everywhere. If you are also looking for very emotional performances take Bale's and Watson's lookings at each other. I highly recommended movie that I am totally satisfied of and if you are a good sci-fi fan just like me, go and get it!	5.0	A new generation SCI-FI dramas with fast packaged action! a classic along with Matrix	2007-09-03	2	0	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3J6XV1TVL0MRM	Jack Thompson	I still can't understand why I never saw this movie in the theaters.  I was totally surprised of the visual and mental revelations that were made.  Equilibrium presents us with the (very plausible) idea that humankind have figured out how to finally maximize our societal obsession with efficiency.  I won't say how, but the idea is realistic and startling.  There are enforcers for the system, as played by Christian Bale, and their job is to ensure the continuation of the society.  They are expert gunfighters who are sent to the toughest battles.  The action sequences will blow you away.  Not only are they incredibly artistic and original but they are down right cool and will stun any action-movie junkie.  All-in-all the movie is AMAZING!!!!!  It's number 4 on my list of ALL TIME BEST MOVIES beat out only by GLADIATOR, MATRIX, and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON.  p.s.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	"A strange remake of many films and many books of science fiction. Brave New World, 1984, Brazil, Total Recall, the Running Man, Terminator, and so many others. The basic crime here is to feel. How can we get rid of feelings in order to guarantee social peace and complete control of everyone and everything? The question is the answer.A drug will do the job everyday and destroying anything that could resemble any feeling or their carriers will do the job every night, and we are covered day and night. But what happens in any society? Some do not like drugs and compulsory acts. So they rebel and they stop taking their drugs. And that is called the resistance.In Brave New World they are tolerated in some human reservation, but in this world they are underground and have to fight against the official society overground. And there will always be one secret agent of the feeling police who will rebel one day and will get in touch with the resistance and will be the instrument of the end of this world. That's part of life and no one can prevent it.So the film is a little bit nave on the means with which one man, even a cleric of super power and strength, can succeed in killing dozens of trained soldiers in about two minutes without even getting a rip in his coat. It yells impossible but we are a good audience and we suspend our disbelief long enough to know that this rebellion is absolutely possible and that it exists in any totalitarian system.The only pass&eacute; element is that the power of ""free"" information is not captured in this film which is already old and cannot know the power of the new medium called the Internet and the way even the best kept secrets in the world can be made public tomorrow morning by Wikileaks or any other eaves dropping site.But apart from that it is an entertaining film and I like the dog, the mongrel, the BO of this film that was made even before that famous BO was elected President of the United States who brought a dog named Bo into the White House along with two young girls.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"	5.0	Our unbelievably true future	2010-12-30	4	2	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	APY278QDDLEW1	"James Shields ""Marasbaras"""	"I love this movie.  Love it.  It reminds me of the older sci-fi movies like Soylent Green, Rollerball (the original with James Caan), Logan's Run, Silent Running ... or even the more modern Demolition Man.Sci-fi with a message.  Fortunately for us, this one manages to cram a lot of gunfire in with that message.Some reviewers have compared this movie to The Matrix.  The are, simply, wrong.  There are brooding heroes in both.  That's about where the similarities stop.Equilibrium is a pleasant meld of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451.  In the future, feelings are considered bad.  Feelings lead us to war, crime, and that which we can no longer tolerate.So, a drug is created: Equilibrium.  Taken twice a day, all citizens are required to take it.  To not take it is a crime apparently punishable by death.To go with the drug, all things that might cause one to feel are outlawed, classified EC-10.  Our main character, Bale, is part of the police-like force, called Grammaton Clerics, that are tasked with eradicating all things that elicit feelings.Naturally, there are folks who dislike this.  They like to feel.  They want to feel.  They need to feel.  They are the rebels.  These rebels hoard items of art, perfumes, music, books.The movie is about Bale's character, Preston, and his journey from unfeeling, lethal enforcer for a very dull and oppressive government ... to sense criminal and last hope of humanity.I do see a lot of 1984 in this movie.  The imagery is drab, we see children enlisted to spot feelers and turn in their parents, we have a ""benevolent"" leader known as Father.This is mixed with the very basic premise of Fahrenheit 451: the Grammaton Clerics are tasked with destroying anything that results in feeling.  Unlike their F451 counterparts, the firemen, the Grammaton Clerics are also tasked with killing anyone who feels.All this, and the movie was done on a tiny budget in Eastern Europe.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1143YEAZYMYHJ	Jamie Ratliff	Equilibrium is an awesome movie that goes with the idea in Fahrenheit 451, where books, art, and music are outlawed. Emotions in general are not allowed in this post World War 3 era, because the new government thought feelings created war and hostility towards others. The leading role is a cop named John Preston (Christian Bale), who is a cleric in the new government. What begins as routine &quot;feeling busting&quot; turns into life changing set of events that puts Preston on the wrong side of the law, but the right side of human nature. With awesome scenery, great fight scenes, matrix-like choreography, and a good story, this film is definately a must see. How it didn't get big in th cinema is beyond me. I give it 5 stars.	5.0	Excellent Movie! Matrix meets Fahrenheit 451	2003-05-22	1	0	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2GWA7GB1MTCVO	Jamison Ballard	"I do not know how I missed this movie, talk about flying in under the radar.  It is very well done with oustanding visuals and some great acting by Christian Bale.  For those that keep referring to this film as a Matrix rip off it needs to stop.  If everyone walking around in trench coats is considered Matrix like then there are quite a few movies to add to the list.The story starts full speed with the movie that plagues the people of their emotions a brainwash if you will coupled with a drug taken periodically to tranquilize you emotions.  Then moves quickly to the task force that disposes of ""sense offenders"", basically people that have feeings.  The society the task force is trying to preserve is one of no emotion.  This no emotion society is supposed to be a cure for anger, hatred, grief, sadness, sorrow etc. all the thing that caused the WWIII that these people survived.  Through the processing(killing) of the sense offenders you get to see a very unique gun visual.  The technique is called ""gun-kata"" and it is a fighting style that maximizes movement and angles to interpret your assailants moves as well as giving optimum angle for your attack to inflict the most possible damage.  See it once and you will definitely think that is the coolest thing ever.  After the awe factor of ""gun-kata"" wears off our lead Bale forgets to take some of his tranquilizer and soon starts feeling emotion again.  He continues down this path of feeling and soon leads a revolution.  I won't throw in spoilers because I want everyone to see the film and find out the outcome.Outstanding movie, perfect fit for Bale and full of action with a mind provoking story line as well.  Highly recommended for fans of darker sci fi settings and anyone who likes John Woo action films, because it is full of two pistol firing mayhem.

But the movie is an example of using tired cliches and making something fresh.  The action scenes elevate themselves above ""Matrix clones"" and are fun and inventive, and the idea of ""Gun-kata"" sounds laughable until you see it.  The acting from most of the primaries (Bale, Watson, Diggs, and Bean) elevate this film above standard Hollywood action fare.  If you took out the action, you would still have a very solid and moving film.Though keep in mind this is also not a light movie by any means.

It is the kind of...science fiction that would even get cut from the Sci-Fi channel.  The plot is a rahash of Fahrenheit 451, but is done in an incoherent and inconsistent manner.  The characters make dumb decisions at every point that they are able to (but prevail anyway, of course).  The overarching theme is ""feelings,"" and how they make us human.  Ugh, it's like Janeway in Voyager, you just want them to shut up about the whole thing and quit trying to ram it down your throat.I will give a few examples of the most egregiously ennui-enducing elements of the movie.  I won't give an exhuastive list, both because it would crash your browser.The box says that there are gunbattles in this movie, but I didn't notice any.  There are a lot of scenes where people are killing other people with guns, but in NONE of the many sequences does a member of the winning side ever get touched.  Each one is a slaughter.The front of the box talks about how much better this movie is than ""The Matrix.""  Here's a hint:  if a movie has to resort to that claim, run the other way.  The mood, technique, and design of the film are cheap Matrix knockoffs, unoriginal in every way.If the movie took itself less seriously, it might be possible to just laugh these types of things off.

Great idea for a sci-fi story, but the execution of the film is not always as good as it could be, (should be) considering the talent and potential of the story.In the future, a daily, mandatory drug treatment has been developed for all human kind to suppress emotions completely in order to assure peace. Unfortunately, most of the characters in the movie still seam maniacally happy, or angry at various points, even though they're not supposed to be able to feel these things. Mind you, this is a conundrum in some ways, because if everyone was emotionally flatlined throughout, as the story calls for, the film would probably feel even slower than it already does.Decent special effects considering they are primarily done with no CGI and some of the action sequences are pretty exciting, if your into good fight choreography.	3.0	Great Idea, Decent Execution	2013-09-15	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ	Jason	"At the dawn of the 21st century, society was faced with a great Third World War, and knowing that something had to be done to prevent further problems, humanity was faced with the dilemma of solving all of man's troublels.  As a result, they created a new enforcer of the law, the Grammaton Clerics, a collection of warriors who practice gun kata to improve their lethality while executing their sole task of eradicating any instance of feeling within humanity.To control the general public, daily dosage of Prozium are self-administered, similar to the daily dosages of Soma in Brave New World, except this opiate of the masses elimites melancholy, rage, hate, and jealousy, as well as the suppressing positive feelings of pathos, joy, and love.  Similarly, destruction of all that creates feeling, literature, art, all that gives us emotion, just like the firemen in Fahrenheit 451.  Large-scale indoctrination is accomplished through the visualized, Apple commerical-esque, Big Brother screens of 1984 (used later in V for Vendetta).  The combination of the three classic dystopian tales is flawless, each blending into the other, and the collective producing realism and fear for what could easily be a not-so-distant future.Two Grammaton Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale) and Errol Partridge (Sean Bean), have worked together to ""protect"" society.  However, Errol has been confiscating sense offender material.  Eventually, John catches Errol because he had been sneaking outside of the city to commit sense crimes.  When he is eventually uncovered face-to-face, John must bring his partner in for justice.  His partner would rather die than be captured or give up feeling, and in a final act of defiance he quotes a passage from his book and raises his book to cover his eyes.Partridge's final words would later haunt John in a dream, as they serve as the catalyst for his finaly memory of his wife, the moment of her sense crime incarceration and eventual incineration, and he remembers with horror his still, emotionless inaction.The following morning John drops his dosage of Prozium.  His sone recommends a trip to Equilibrium for a replacement dosage.  Only, John doesn't go, and he begins to feel, to sense and perceive all the wonderful feelings previously unknown.  Soon, he enjoys the touch of an intricately designed vase, cries at the sound of Beethoven, and risks everything by protecting a puppy from extermination.The gun battles are equisitely designed and choreographed, a little Matrix crossed with a little Jet Li action.  Christian Bale delivers an impressive performance as a man who is initially wooden, and later severely troubled by his actions.Eventually John must face the battle between his logic and his emotions, his allegiance and his freedom, as he comes to terms with what he has done, what he has become, and what he wishes for the future."	5.0	A brilliant, dystopian science fiction movie	2008-06-07	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2ZWTA18X37QOZ	"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX"""	(Warning: Some spoilers ahead)The cover of the Equilibrium DVD has a quote that says `Forget The Matrix!'. To be honest, I felt that putting that on the cover might actually backfire. Diehard fans of the Matrix might scoff at seeing Equilibrium because of that quote, thinking there is no way the lower budget Equilibrium could beat it. Others might come in with unrealistically high expectations for the movie, expecting over-the-top special effects, and will probably come away disappointed. Frankly I think that's too bad, because Equilibrium is a great movie in its own right with an original and engrossing story, as well as some pretty darn cool fight scenes.Equilibrium takes place in a time in which World War III has taken place, and humanity was almost destroyed because of it. Everyone knew that mankind could not survive a fourth war, and so a radical solution was conceived. Since wars were caused by emotional arrogance and intolerance, all emotions should be suppressed to prevent any future conflict. As such everyone one in Equilibrium's world is required by law to take doses of a drug called Prozium every day to suppress their emotions. This law is ruthlessly enforced by a group known as the `Clerics', who hunt down anybody who commits a `sense offense'. The story of Equilibrium revolves around a Cleric named John Preston who accidentally misses a dose of Prozium, and starts being able to feel emotions. John is eventually sent to capture a group of rebels opposed to the current government, but joins them instead.Many people who have criticized this movie have felt that Equilibrium's atmosphere and characters were too cold. My question to them would be, where have you been the entire movie? The society that was presented in this movie is supposed to be devoid of emotions, so you wouldn't expect people to be acting happy (or angry, or any other observable emotion). Personally I think all the actors in the movie did a great job, with the stand out one being Christian Bale as John Preston. From his uncaring persona at the start of the movie, to when he starts to first feel emotions, to his smiling at the very end of the movie, I could feel what his character was going through.So how about the film's action sequences? Unlike The Matrix, Equilibrium uses very little computer enhancements or `wire-fu' techniques, but they look just as well done. There's sword fighting, guns ablazing, and bone-snapping martial arts (therefore a little bit of something for everybody). Although admittedly there was one scene towards the end of Equilibrium that seemed vaguely similar to The Matrix's `lobby' fight scene. However, this scene was more of an homage if anything, since it is done and choreographed quite differently.It's a shame that Equilibrium did so poorly in the theatres, and that it did not get a better promotional boost. Personally I wouldn't have even seen this movie if it was not given two thumbs up on Ebert & Roeper's TV show. Now that Equilibrium is out on video and DVD, this is as good a time as any to go see this movie. With an underlying message about freedom, great acting, and awesome action, what's not to like about it? Forget about the negative comments made by the critics. Go see this movie and judge for yourself.I give this film a solid 8 out of 10!	4.0	Do not miss out on this great movie	2004-08-17	5	4	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2N0J52O368CVV	Jeff C. Cho	Out of the 100+ minutes of Equilibrium, there are maybe 10 minutes worth of Gun-Kata action sequences, which is more than enough for me to rent and love this movie as one of the best gun-fight scenes of all time (a list I will soon create to include Matrix, Desperado, Way of the Gun, Black Hawk Down).  The premise of this movie, a totalitarian dystopia devoid of emotions, is nothing special even to the most casual of sci-fi fans.  Orwell has been there, Huxley has done that, and Bradbury said it before.  The acting is adequate, which is more than you can ask for out of an uninspired and stereotypical plot.BUT isn&iexcl; Equilibrium an action movie?  Isn&iexcl; an action movie&iexcl; plot, however unbelievable and unoriginal, there to serve only as a backdrop for the actions?  Which brings me back to the only redeeming quality of Equilibrium.  Gun-Kata is a form of martial art focusing on the use of handguns (kata refers to the set, almost ritualistic movements in martial arts to be repeated by students).  The movements are mathematically calculated, factoring in the position and distance of the targets, the trajectory of the bullets and the physical recoil to flow from one motion to the next in order to maximize killing potential.  The CGI sequences used to explain the principles of Gun-Kata is absolutely brilliant and should be implemented in high school geometry classes.  The idea of mathematically analyzed martial art is mind-blowing (at least for me); and its execution on screen, coupled with Equilibrium&iexcl; relentless electronica soundtrack, will rip your cornea and give the most ardent adrenaline junkies multiple cardiac arrests.	4.0	Finally, a movie about Gun-Kata	2003-12-01	3	3	0

I actually saw this movie by mistake, tickets were sold out to Lord of the Rings so we went to see this at the time, and I never regreted it. I saw this movie twice and I love it, even my wife love this movie. I wanted to see it again but it was already taken off the screen at my local theater, now its about to be released on DVD, what a bonus to have this movie so soon. The plot leaves much to be desired but the action sequence makes up for any shortfall. I think of it as a Matrix type movie at probably 1/3 the budget but on par with the action and imagination. Watch it and you too will know what 'Gunkata' means.	5.0	Great Movie...should have spent more on promotion!	2003-04-21	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1B1GTMC7OABHB	Jeff Howe	"I rented this movie at the behest of my 13 year old.  I made sure that it was acceptable for his age level first, then agreed to it.A lot of people compare this to Fahrenheit 451 or 1984.  To my way of thinking it was a cross between Fahrenheit 451 and Logan's Run meets Revenge of the Sith in reverse with Vulcans in control.The storyline is a rehash, really, of Fahrenheit 451 and that's fine as the Bradbury novel was written in 1953.  A do over with slightly different plotting makes sense.  But the movie really kind of lacks originality, something that will make your head turn off to look out the window in deep thought while saying, ""wow.""  It's all rather predictable.Except for one thing.  The ultimate combat scene did not drag out like the one between Anakin and Obi-Wan.  It was over in a couple seconds, and I actually rather liked that.The acting was good, natural, nothing forced.  There was a sufficient amount of action.  But at the end of the movie, all I could think was, ""so what?""I can see how it would be liked by a 13 year old.To it's credit, it avoids language and sexual content beyond a mild reference.  The violence is to be expected in its format, though the face of Taye Diggs sliding off was rather disturbing.That's my take on it.  I don't recommend it, but I don't disrecommend it either.

The premise was just plain dumb, so it's no wonder it didn't develop into anything. Nothing resonated. This was like &#34;Farenheit 451&#34; emptied of inspiration. The most interesting idea was to have a kind of scientific reason why the clerics could survive an action sequence full flying bullets, but nothing was made of this other than that the clerics did what all action heroes do: survive action sequences full of flying bullets. There might be a good idea for an entirely different movie in there somewhere. The plot was empty of tension.

NO STORIES ARE COMPLETELY ORIGINAL!  Stories are just good, or bad, and this one is kick-butt.This is a low-budget movie with heart.  Watching Christian Bale's 'deterioration' into a feeling human being was fascinating without becoming too sticky.  Bale is perhaps one of the only action-capable actors to pull off such a demanding role.  Gun Kata is a concept that has been around for a long time without anyone placing a name and philosophy to it.  Yes, the odds he survives are unrealistic, but so is flipping upside down while firing an M-16 and actually hitting people.  What's important is that gun kata is a means of explaining the mythic capabilities of the hero in a cool way.  And the action scenes pay off in a huge way.By the end of the movie, when Bale shows up in his white cleric's outfit, he has so morphed into the ultimate good guy that you just can't wait for him to explode.

The acting was not too bad, even though it felt like the storyline was missing something. That something was development of characters - the audience is asked to care deeply about characters that have only barely been introduced. However, by far the biggest problem with the movie is that it is basically another V for Vendetta knock off. You take one side and paint the most grim and sadistic picture of it that you can and then you present it as the Christian Church. You then have a hero futuristic warrior with extraordinary skills go to wipe the ""evil"" regime out for the glory of the human race - for freedom. The evil guys in this movie are dubbed ""clerics"" in a system that represents itself with the Jerusalem cross and that is lead by a ""father."" It left me realizing that the whole movie was just another propaganda piece against the Christian Church by Hollywood, and not even an original one at that. Of course, the irony is that the ""church"" in the movie stands for pretty much everything that Christianity is against. In reality, the search for a society without emotion comes from Greek philosophy - it is called Stoicism!

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3NLUZ5SWQR1XW	"jerryskate ""DJ KLICK"""	This time is the not-so-distant future, after a third world war. The place is a city called Librium. The status quo is that all persons are no longer allowed to feel emotions, the reasoning is to prevent their dark emotional desires to fight and cause another world war. To supress their emotions, all persons must take a regular dose of Prozium (opiate?) which causes emotional vacancy. Also all forms of music and art, and anything which conjurs human emotion are illegal. Christian Bale plays Johnathan Preston, aka &quot;Cleric&quot;, whose job is to uphold the law and find &quot;sense-offenders.&quot; Along the way he begins to think he can feel emotions again, and he eventually stops taking his Prozium. Soon he begins to work against the status quo and tries to help the underground &quot;sense-offenders&quot;. The plot in this movie is nothing too original, but it is a valuable metaphor. What is outstanding in this movie, is the action and fight scenes. The gun battles are excellently done and well choreographed, there is also enough action to satsify an old-school John Woo (Hard Boiled, Killer) fan! Christian Bales performance is also outstanding, if you are a fan of his (he's the new Batman!) this movie is worth a watch. The rest of the casting is also pretty good, except I don't really agree with using Taye Diggs as the emotionless, new partner of the Cleric. Overall this movie is well-done and not too well-known, so if you haven't seen it and you are an action, sci-fi, or any other type of movie fan, I highly recommend it.	4.0	Great for any action/sci-fi fan!	2003-12-11	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A27KDN8D82RRIT	Jesse Dell-ross	"This movie is so good, that I bought it on amazon within the hour that I first saw it. I've never done that with any movie. In many ways, Equilibrium is better then its cgi-filled counterpart the matrix. Where the matrix takes you on a completly si-fi journey into the distant future, equilibrium takes you to a future that could happen. The main question the auddience is asked when seeing this movie is this: Would you give up all the highs of human emotion to supress the terrible lows of human emotion? I've asked that question to many of my friends and it makes them want to see this movie.The cast of this film is nothing short of amazing. Christian Bale is amazing as the main protaginist John Preston. Sean Bean has a very small role in this film as Preston's partner but that doesn't diminish how important he is. He sets the tone for the film. The person I was most amazed at was Matt Harbour who plays Robbie Preston, John's son. His acting is very good for someone his age and I fully expect to hear his name in the future.The plot of the film is what I love most. For those who have read ""The Giver"" this film is very similar. Its set in the no-so-distant future, after a third world war in which mankind is devestated. The survivors turn to a government called Libria, which is led by a myserious figure known only as ""father"". The leaders of Libra promise the people peace, and freedom in exchange for some god-given freedoms (sound familiar america?). This freedom is emotion which is taken away through regualar shots of a drug called prozium. A law enforcement group called the grammaton claric is formed to find and destroy anything that can make a person feel, called EC-10 by the government. Preston is the hightest ranking cleric and master of a form of combat known as ""gun-kata"". But after being forced to kill his partner and close friend (Bean) Preston begins to question if the utobia that surrounds him is really that.The Gun-kata is one of the things that separates equilibrium from the matrix. It provids amazing fight scenes that require little to no CGI.The soundtrack is truly inspiring. Each song fits its scene perfectly and turns the movie from being good to great. It can make you cry one second and make you want to go out kick someones butt the next.In conclusion, this is a must-see film.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	Christian Bale stars as a man that starts to have emotion and feeling in a world where it's a crime. The film starts out with him as a cop fighting and killing people who feel. A prisinor played Emily Watson makes him curious to what it would feel like to have emotion. He then realizes that the right to feel and have emotion is worth fighting for. He decides to fight and stand up to the system he once stood for. The action is fun if not a little too quick and often even silly. I mean Christian Bale fights a bunch of cops just to defend a puppy for god's sake.Equilibrium has been called a Matrix rip-off among being called a rip-off of many other Sci-fi films. I think it stands on it's own though. It's a good movie if you look past the silly plot. The performances by Bale, Watson Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, the cool looking atmosphere and the action make it worth watching.	3.0	An Under-rated sci-fi action/drama	2003-05-22	1	0	1

The ""Gun-Kata"" concept, design, and implementation was impressive and beautifully done more with the choreography than with special effects, and I think that's what I truly loved the most about this movie. Though it has a Matrix vibe, it does NOT have the special effects, which is very nice. While I love the Matrix and its SFX, I truly appreciate a good flick that can pull off the story without all the crazy slo-mo and the like.This movie is definitely finding its way into my library.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3UUNL0WMA5A4B	"J. Kennedy ""J..."""	"Some say it's a cheaper Matrix rip-off.  But in my opinion, if you liked Dark City, Blade, Terminator or The Matrix, you are bound to love this film.  Equilibrium gives you what many movies these days are missing:  actors who can act, action that kicks [butt], and a plot that truly works for a sci-fi film.  With a storyline somewhat similar to the dismal Gattaca, this film takes place post World War III, where emotions are suppressed in an effort to dehumanitize mankind and prevent a fourth war.Hats off to Kurt Wimmer for a well-written courageous script and some fine directing.  Christian Bale gives an excellent performance that only he can.  His emotionless and intense John Preston is eerie. Yet the depth he later brings to his character is genuine and sincere. You ""feel"" right along with him.Watching this film, I didn't really know what to expect.  It was slow at first, almost tedious at some points, getting us used to the lifestyle and laws of the future.  I admit I went in half-anticipating a copycat Matrix, but what I got was a ballsy thrill ride.  This is one of those films that gets better and better all the way to the end, without a letdown.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3S5UQ3ORAMWCG	J. McAllister	Christian Bale stars as a Cleric, a futuristic police ninja who is tasked to hunt down folks who still feel, especially people that smuggle art, music, and comfy furniture. You see, the population is mandated by a post-world-war totalitarian state to take a drug that suppresses emotions, therefore ridding the world of crime and war, as well as anything fun. Of course, Bale sees enough to change his mind about the drug and eventually begins to sympathize with the &#34;bad guys.&#34;Equilibrium is a fun watch. Bale is decent enough as the cop-come-revolutionary, despite the movies rushed pacing. The sped-up martial arts scene zap you back out of the film, as they come off cartoony and juvenile. The Gun-Kata kung-fu seems to be written specifically for 14 year old boys to enjoy. The evil corporate-head-of-state was about as dimensional as a piece of paper.Despite the problems, Equilibrium is a fun watch, especially when you should be doing something else. And why does Hollywood keep making Ayn Rand's &#34;Anthem&#34; and calling it something else (see also: Divergent)?	3.0	Decent Sci-Fi Mucked Up with Corny FX and Wooden Acting	2014-04-20	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A6X6LNZO1C3EZ	J. Munyon	"2002's release of ""Equilibrium"" stars Dominic Purcell, Christian Bale, Sean Pertwee, and the lovely Emily Watson.  It is about a future existence where the sense of feeling has been not only outlawed and banned, there is a drug to sedate and subdue it that is required by law at a daily dose level to maintain the sanctity of having no feelings about anything whatsoever for any reason.What makes this movie powerful is the onslaught of political correctness in society, and the forced adherence to ""diversity"" being a coerced requirement for continued employment at most workplaces, as well as getting right down to harassment policies where even an overly stern or ""mean"" stare is considered grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal; because no one should have to endure a hostile work environment or feel emotionally uncomfortable by peers and especially not by superiors.  The boot camp experience for military inductees for the first time in history now equips the raw buck private rank newcomer with ""timeout"" cards so they can get distance between themselves and a drill sergeant they perceive is being too aggressive.  These are happening NOW here in America, not in some fantasy film about the future.So getting back to the movie, we see an enforcer (called a Priest) who exacts his duties with weapons and martial arts skills.  There are no penalties for deadly force when arresting those who have chosen not to take the government's required drug to avoid having feelings.  Any item of sentimental value or object causing feelings or arousal of the senses in any definition, are to be destroyed immediately or turned into the repository back at headquarters for evidence so the guilty parties of human beings can be cremated alive.This film flat out rocks.  If you have any concept at all about government censure of the true nature of human experience beyond the more obvious stuff like strong indications the perpetrator has lost their moral compass, then you realize the magnitude and relevance of this film.  If you exercise self-restraint far, far beyond what you want to so you can keep your job, or your fellowship elsewhere, then this movie ""Equilibrium"" resounds into the marrow of your bones.The John Preston character portrayed by Christian Bale is one of the best Sci-Fi / Fantasy roles ever brought to the screen.  There is no way Keanu Reeves could have pulled this role off as well.  No way.This movie is said to be a primer for the ""Matrix"" series of films.  I just call it one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  If this movie was on the floor I'd roll all around on it like a dog trying to get the scent of a fresh kill on themselves.  This movie knocks all the others like it stone cold dead.Favorite scenes?  The last 20 minutes of this film.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1PHUQ1QZKGMSH	J.M. Wells	This film grabbed my attention one boring night as I scrolled through pay per view on demand. And the night was no longer boring!From the very beginning the superb acting by Bale grabbed me and didn't let go. His portrayal of John Preston was so well done I could feel what Preston was going through. The sceen with the puppy made me weep. I am now a die hard Bale fan.Ignore the Matrix with all it's polticio b.s. and go for the raw meat that is human emotion - which is what this film is all about. The most dangerous thing we humans do is feel but it is also the most glorious.After watching this film (I watched it 3 times in the 24hrs.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3GUTAC5UVKUH	Joe Carugati	"Being into action films, I heard many things about ""Equilibrium"".  Mainly, everyone talks about its gun, sword, and fist fights.  After finally seeing it (thank God I did), I realized there's so much more to the story than violence and action.  Underneath, you can find a beautifully written story that is both compelling and thought provoking.In the beginning of the film, it is told that World War III has occurred.  The war's catalyst was emotion: people would have feelings and take their feelings out on others.  After WWIII, people all over the world were given a drug that would take away all emotions.  Noone could feel, which meant noone could harm anyone else.  This is what society has become.Now, people who do not take the drug (""sense offenders"") hide countless pieces of music, literature, art, and even animals so that they can feel like the others cannot.  This is where the government comes in.  They send in Clerics such as Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) to wipe out any sense offenders for their wrong-doings.  Clerics are also on the drug, so even after they kill many people, it doesn't affect them in anyway.All that changes after Preston kills his old partner, because he too was also beginning to ""feel"".  Preston misses the dosage of his drug and finally starts to realize what is actually happening in his world.  Using his his special up-close combat skills and his newly acquire emotions, Preston delves deeper into society and exactly who the good guys are: the government he worked for or the ""sense offenders"".This film works on so many levels for me.  There are just so many great things that make it even more interesting to watch.First off, the action scenes.  I hear many people say, ""Oh, 'Equilibrium', it rips off 'The Matrix' in terms of action.""  Okay, first, ""The Matrix"" is overrated.  Second, the action scenes are ""so"" different.  There is no bullet time, no CGI, no wire, kung-fu stuff.  The way Preston fights may seem a bit unrealistic, but this is the future, and the battles are choreographed tightly and are never too long, which doesn't leave our minds numbed, but actually making us want more.  In other words, that battle scenes just plain out rock.Second, Christian Bale.  It's his job to either make or break this movie.  He totally makes it and passes the mark.  He is excellent.  Words cannot describe his transformation from his wooden state to all out resistance fighter.  It's so perfect and makes sense (no pun intended).  Also, SPECIAL NOTE (SPOILERS) - if you do not cry or shed a tear in the scene with the dogs and Christian Bale's expressions, there is something wrong with you.  A beautiful moment.  Besides that, Taye Diggs, Emma Watson, and Sean Bean were also awesome in their roles which were fairly minor.  Yet, this movie is seriously Christian Bale's.Third, the direction from Kurt Wimmer is really nicely done.  The pacing is perfect and flows nicely, but not too fast.  The action sequences are also nicely edited, instead of being a mess of close-ups and quick edits (Batman Begins - take notes).  Very good job in direction.Four, after watching this film, it felt really uplifting and satisfying.  I know this section has nothing to do with the technical or plot aspects of the film, but I just wanted to point out that the movie is just a poetic thing to watch unfold.  It's nicely written, and just perfect.Overall, ""Equilibrium"" was an intense action film inside a amazingly structured story.  The film has many underlying messages and is definitely one to watch over and over again.Rated R for thematic elements and sequences of intense, violent action."	5.0	Beautiful and Poetic In Both It's Story and Violence...	2005-12-17	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	This movie had been so hyped up on message boards that I was looking for the ultimate hidden gem with this movie.  While I'm not sure it quite stands up the brilliance that is has been described as being, this is a very fine movie.  The setting for Equilibrium is after World War III.  Having survived three world wars, humanity might not be able to survive a fourth.  It was decided that the greatest danger to humanity was humanity itself.  More specifically, it was human emotion that drove men to war.  To ensure that no war or murder would ever happen again, emotion was suppressed.  Every man, woman, and child had to daily take medication to suppress emotion.  There was no more murder (excepting the state sponsored kind), and feeling was a crime...called a sense crime.  A new agency was put into place to enforce the sense laws.  These men were known as clerics.Christian Bale plays John Preston, the highest ranking cleric in the city/state.  It is his job to hunt down the sense offenders in the city.  We see Preston going about his job (violently at times) until he captures a sense offender named Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson).  Mary seems to remind Preston of his own wife (a sense offender, herself) and it is at this point when we see John Preston take an interest in feeling, and in the forbidden objects (music, most vestiges of the past).  You can guess where the movie goes from there.  This could be an excellent novel is the story was fleshed out a little bit.The main aspect of this film that will draw in viewers is the action.  It is intense and at times unbelievable.  But, during the course of the story, we are told how such a thing is possible...and this helps more than one might think.  Not only do we believe that John Preston can pull off this action, we believe that with the proper training we also are capable of the same.  The gun battles are almost a dance, they are that well done, and I don't know how to describe some of the fight sequences.  In particular, there is a gun battle where the guns are almost used as swords where one mistake can end the battle....simply beautiful.It seems that every science fiction movie will bear comparisons to The Matrix.  This is entirely unfair and absurd.  This movie is different than the Matrix, not necessarily better or worse.  It has its own style and is an excellent movie in its own right.	5.0	where did this movie come from?	2003-05-20	1	1	0

(Ever seen Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? He was in that as a young boy, and was a great actor even then.) That will all change soon though, as he is soon to take on the mantle of the Batman in Warner Bros's new revitalization of the Batman franchise.

I love the Toshiro Mifune action at the end.  (Sometimes less is more.)  There are all kinds of comparisons to the body of previous SF work.  (I especially enjoyed seeing an echo of the old classic 1984 Apple computer commercial.)  Much of the social and political content is worth thinking about.But much of the first three quarters of the film was tedious.  There were a lot of small filler pieces that didn't really advance the plot so much as get in one's face with, ""we're not sure you get it yet so we're going to drop another scene in here to repeat ourselves.""  I guess when the premise of a movie is that the main character has no emotion for the first half, character development and the audience's bond with that character is going to be a bit challenging.  Still, why does the gradual return of emotions have to be so gradual and (let's say) linear?  Why not an intense emotional spike earlier in the movie to hook us in a little more?  The scenes with the puppy were laughable and wildly out of place.I think 30 minutes could have been chopped out and replaced with more material dealing with the main subject of a society without feelings.  What motivates those in control of society if there are no emotion?  But I suspect that there is a contradiction in the plot that undermines it.  Totalitarian societies gain control because they exploit feelings - not repress them.  Totalitarian societies need expertly managed emotion.  Well it's Hollywood so the safest bet ever is that it will have a happy ending.  It's so nice that the risk-adverse, formulaic entertainment conglomerates let us get to cheer on the rebellion at the end.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1EKA9XSI641C9	John S. Milas	"Ok, let me start by saying that Dimension has made a great movie here.  The atmosphere's are really like how I usually picture a Dystopian world.  Very grey and nuetral colors.  Christian Bale is really cool, but I like him better in Reign of Fire.  Our boy from Goldeneye Sean Bean plays a small part as Bale's partner at the beginning who discovers emotion before the movie sets in.  That one guy who's on a UPN show...ah..I don't know his name, plays Bale's new partner, sort of evil.  Well now let me talk about something confusing.  Christian Bale plays a ""Cleric"" who is a very highly skilled fighter used as an instrument by ""Father"" to take out people who break the laws of feeling emotion and taking their medicin which helps them be emotionless.  See, after WWIII the world decides that something has to be done, so they take away all free expresion and emotion.  Fahrenheit 451..yes.  There's even a scene where two guys in white clean suits burn the Mona Lisa with flamethrowers.  Anyway it's about Christian Bale discovering what it's like to feel, and he breaks down, but is good at supressing his emotion when he's around other people.  But is this really about humanity's inevitable dive into a dystopian society?  Or is it about cool action fight scenes?  Here's where something is strange.  For the first scenes the dystopian mood is set in showing us what a terrible place it is.  Than there's really outrageous scenes where Christian Bale turns into Neo and begins shooting everyone in sight without getting a scratch.  It's sort of hard to tell what the writer was all about, but maybe some of that is explained by the DVD features.  Regardless of what it's really about you should see it, because it's still a good movie."	4.0	It's good, but what's it about?	2005-03-30	4	3	1

While the idea of [chemical substance]-induced ""numbness"" is an interesting one to explore, it rubbed off on the performances and photography too much. The script is dull and pretentious, and develops as intelligently as Mortal Kombat. ""Let's get this character from point A to B and then have him fight and move on."" This film is dumb, boring, uninspired, pretentious, slow, illogical, too ""serious"" and an otherwise complete waste of time. I wish the film's interesting concept had been developed by a less self-important personality with an actual grasp of story and character development.I wholeheartedly recommend watching director Kurt Wimmer's director's commentary on this thing, though ...

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AWX16S837WV54	"Jose A. Ramirez ""The grammaton cleric"""	"When I first watched Equilibrium I was in complete awe. I had never seen anything like it before. The story, characters, and the all important character development makes the viewer care about the rising action in the movie.Thecover of this movie says ""Forget the Matrix"", and I agree 100%. The matrix was highly predictable, with little to no character development, and is actually, to me worthless to watch.  In contrast to Equilibrium, the main character evolves in a world that he can physically change, as opposed to the matrix when Neo ""evolves"" into the one.. nothing really changes...he simply stops some bullets and makes a phone call, oh and he makes out with Trinity.. which I am sure is highly compelling to some people, but to me, I was looking at the screen (never saw this in the theater) and said... and.. what else?? The action and the emotional development in Equilibrium is very compelling. We have a father, a soldier, and a person, all being torn apart by an emotion-inhibitory drug. The plot is very clear, and very direct. Unlike the matrix whose plot is very thin, very ""mysterious"" (I didn't seem to think it was), and not based on the characters, but more on the visuals.  I will take a good story over special effects any day of the week.  The music is also a very good reason to check out equilibrium.  It doesn't try to be hip or cool (like the matrix), but adds a sort of strength to the action, instead of an action scene (lobby scene of the matrix in which one is waiting for the main characters to start dancing.  Overall, Equilibrium is a completely different movie than the matrix, because it deals with human emotion and character development and it's effect on society, instead of ""wow, like whoah.. it's my destiny to be the like second coming of the one....and I choose to do absolutely nothing, but make more sequels with plots that lead absolutely nowhere. If you haven't seen Equilibrium.. Buy it! Watch it! Don't compare it to the matrix, but if you do, remember, Equilibrium deals with characters, and The matrix deals with the special effects that are supposed to replace the characters and their development."	5.0	"yes, ""Forget the matrix"", Bale is the way better than neo"	2004-10-03	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	APK9PCJR4NXEK	Joshua M	Ok people listen up, I know this movie didn't debut across the country, I know it didn't have big name backers flooding daytime TV shows with celebrity interviews and non-stop TV spots. I also know this movie was not a large budget undertaking. But it should have had all three. This movie is definately in the top five movies of all time as far as I am concerned. While lacking the budget for special effects and expensive location shots, this flick manages to score actors of the highest caliber making for an incredible performance even by Hollywood standards, there is not a single second of unbelievable acting that throws your trust in the story. The shooting locations, (Berlin, Rome) lend an impressive aura of authority to the movie's setting that only compliments the amazing character interaction. Christian Bale's performance as a Grammaton Cleric named Preston is without flaw. You can feel his rage at the machine that crushes all opposition to the Law. You can see his inner turmoil, and you can sense his fear when he mounts the Resistance. Not to mention the absolutely mind-blowingaction scenes the man can produce (you have never seen anything like it, and no, this film does not use hong kong wire acting.)Angus MacFadyen portrays a head operative in the all controlling Big Brother society of the future with authority and magnificent presence; and Taye Diggs plays the role of devoted statesman and dangerous enemy to the hilt. (Literally!). The film has a well thought out premise and doesn't engage in gratuitous violence for the sake of shock value, making the action sequences in which Preston (Christian Bale) annhilates the bad guys (think black storm troopers in Matrix leather coats)are enough to cause you to jump on your coffee table and throw your drink through the wall and scream &quot;HELL YEA&quot; loud enough to scare your neighbors...or maybe that's just me. (If you have a high powered surround sound system, invite your friends over for this one). The director (Kurt Wimmer) did an absolutely amazing job splicing this one together, and the musical overtones and backgrounds will have you biting your tongue off in anticipation, and crying at the cruelty of man to his peers.I could talk about this movie forever, but I will simply say, when the sequel is made I will buy a copy sight unseen...although I hope they get rid of the white cadillac of the future. Oh yeah, and you guys who say Matrix is better...The Matrix WAS my favorite movie. Equilibrium crushes Matrix, and Matrix Reloaded underfoot with a giant steel-toed spiked leather standard issue grammaton cleric boot.

Phelps ""His Weapon of Choice is a Pencil"""	In a world not to inthe distant future, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) is a top-ranking governmentagent *like a super cop,judge and excutoner* responsible for destroying those who resist these rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-alterering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.this movie is getting panned by critics but really qwhat dothey know.this movie has the actoon of matrix .. yet  the martial arts are more believeable. I swear after you see gun kata in action you will really thinkyou to cvan do all these movies. thesenone of that 20 feet inthe air or punchs that knock a person back 30 ft and all those other wire trips.The whole idea of no emotions due tothe drug that everone has to take after the 3rd world war. does bother me because I'd see emotion as the drive behind everything.. going to work and the need for a promotion and the act of procreation.. and such.. but maybe i'm missing it.Bale  and Diggs do an awesome job..  , the movie having I think a 20 mil budget you could hardlt tell.It's the type of film that has two messages..

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3C1J2OE0H05MJ	"JunkyardMessiah ""jonkadane"""	"Christian Bale elevates this already-superb story into a sci-fi cult classic.  Some have described his acting style as ""wooden"" and ""emotionless"", but for me he's the exact opposite -- someone who shows an entire range of emotion leashed -- just barely -- beneath the surface.  In Equilibrium, he seethes with anger, a sense of injustice, dismay, guilt, righteousness, and yes, love, all played mostly with looks, not words.  From the opening scenes, Bale and his first partner, played with gravitas by the excellent Sean Bean -- let you know that this film will NOT be a tired rehash of concepts you've seen before.  Sure, the world (post WWIII, futuristic-Third Reich distopia) may at first seem like a mish-mash of pulp sci-fi films with a dollop of Matrix thrown in for good measure -- but Bale, Bean, Diggs and Watson all act as if this is the first time this story has been told -- and we the audience are quickly convinced!I can't say enough about Bale's acting, he does a great job, but it's really his physical control and athleticism that stand out.  The ""gun-kata"" fight sequences are phenomenal.  I don't know why no one ever thought of it before and I don't know WHY Kurt Wimmer hasn't done anything with it since!  I want to see a whole movie about gun-kata.  I want to see Equlibrium II!  Come on Wimmer, give us more!Anyway, between this role and this macabre performance in the Machinist, Bale had a lock on the role of Batman.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"With the release of 'The Matrix' series of films, the sci-fi thriller genre was given a much needed breath of fresh air.  Proving that good sci-fi can be comprised of terrific storytelling, and contain issues and ideals that do apply to the modern day, the sci-fi world was allowed to explore other things than just the inside of a space ship.  In 2002, writer/director Kurt Wimmer presented audiences with a bleak look at a post-World War 3 existence for humanity in ""Equilibrium"".""Equilibrium"" is set in Earth's future where World War 3 has occurred, in an attempt to stop any and all future wars from happening, the powers that be have outlawed the very thing that makes us human, emotion!  Requiring that all people of the world take a daily dose of a emotion-blocking drug, and that anything that could possibly trigger emotional responses are destroyed.  To enforce these laws, the governement forms an elite police force known as, Grammaton Clerics.  Trained in the art of 'Gun-Kata', a blend of martial arts and weapons training, the Clerics are a force to be reckoned with.  When a resistance to the anti-emotion laws begins to increase in strength, the government looks to it's top Grammaton Cleric, John Preston (Christian Bale) to bring an end to the rebellion.  During a raid on a rebellion hideout, Preston meets a woman who slowly unlocks the emotions within him.  As a result Preston slowly begins to cease his emotion-blocking drug, and starts to feel all of the emotions he had never experienced.  Realizing that what the government and the Grammaton Clerics are doing is wrong, Preston joins forces with the resistance to bring down the emotion-less leaders of this dark world, bringing emotion back to Earth's people.Packed full of incredible action scenes that can easily rival ""The Matrix"", a strong story of redemption and self-discovery, writer/director Kurt Wimmer has masterfully crafted a new classic for the sci-fi genre.  Terrific performances from all involved, it has to be tough for an actor to give a solid performance without relying on their emotions, delivering their lines virtually dead-pan and not sounding bored is an achievement for any actor.  This cast comprised of Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, and Sean Bean deliver on all counts, Christian Bale especially, his journey of self-discovery regarding his emotions is carefully handled, and Bale truly excels with conveying every newly discovered feeling Preston has in this film.Sadly, this movie did not do well in the box-office, mostly due to other sci-fi films of recent time overshadowing it's possibility, films such as, ""The Matrix"", ""Minority Report"", and ""Star Wars - Episode 2:  Attack of the Clones"".  Though it didn't do well, it has enjoyed a fairly strong following on DVD that serves as a testament to the film's quality, that even though it didn't produce strong box-office numbers, doesn't mean it's not a good movie that audiences will enjoy and pay money to see on DVD.  If you are a sci-fi fan, especially of the other movies I listed above, or even just an action movie/martial arts fan, then I truly believe that you will enjoy ""Equilibrium"".

It is a world where emotion (or ""sense violations"") are outlawed and punishable by immediate execution.To keep everything in check, residents within the walled city are given five daily doses(interesting paralell to Moslem's 5 prayers a day in Mecca, a walled city ), or intervals, of an emotion-blocking drug called Prozium.Sense violations, which occur primarily outside the city walls, are enforced by Clerics of the Tetragrammatron, aka ""Fathers."" these clerics are a new policing religious order that are judge jury and executioner to whoever commits the crime of having feelings. when they are fighting and holed in somewhere,They've figured out the mathematical possibility of combat, and they put themselves in the least statistically possible place to be hit at each moment of a fight,. and boy do they fightChristian Bale plays John Preston, the highest-ranking Cleric who is both a brutal executioner and practitioner of Gun Kata (more on that below). Preston misses a dose one morning and his chemically-muted reality starts to crumble.As more and more of his manufactured reality comes apart, Preston eventually finds the ""underground"" where he is recruited to help bring down the system. As his partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) becomes more and more suspicious, Preston must deal with his flood of emotions, the death of his wife, and the imminent execution of a sense offender named Mary (Emily Watson) whom he arrested before.if the following below does not sound cool to action fans then action movies should not be madeGun Kata : a form of martial arts created by filmmaker Kurt Wimmer. (first time i think a martial arts has been created for a film) In Gun Kata, the practitioner of the art uses guns as an extension of controlled bursts of acrobatics. The theory being that each gun-battle only has limited outcomes and by applying a series of angles and probability factors to potential foes, one can win any shootout. The sequences are excellently conceived and very exciting to watch. now doesnt this alone sound cool enough?the movie's budget was 20 mil, and it shows in some sequences but they make the best of wht they have... good production design, unoriginal philosophical concepts borrowed from 1984, ray bradbury's fahrenheit 51,looks like a ""B"" film at times.. etcthis movie oozes style and christian bale is a damn good action hero who has acting chops and coolness to bootThe director of this film Kurt Wimmer is worth keeping an eye on for the future."	5.0	Mindblowing Action but mediocre plot	2003-07-12	2	1	1

It asks the question is peace among all mankind worth any price we have to pay--even a total loss of emotional experiences? While the film offers very little that is truly new but it is a pleasant way to pass the time and may be thought provoking if you haven't seen FAHRENHEIT or the countless other films with similar themes.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AM0QYQ3E9PJMS	"Karl F. Hamm ""Karl F. Hamm"""	"My advice is to give this movie a change. It seems familiar, almost hackneyed.  I saw elements of the emotion control form ""THX-1138,"" the Prozium from ""Brave New World,"" the indoctrination chambers from the 1984 Apple commercial, and the firemen from ""Fahrenheit  451."" Costume-wise, this film owes everything to ""The Matrix."" This , by the way, was my biggest hang-up: is this is merely a remake of ""The Matrix,"" then forget, we have the original. If it is different, stop confusing us my associating it with ""The Matrix.""This cobbling and pastiche, however, last for about the first third of the movie. From then, it becomes it's own film.  Wimmer seems to use the clich&eacute;s and stereotypes as a springboard for his own story.  In this sense, it is a variation of dystopic films, such as ""Blade Runner,"" ""Brazil,"" and ""1984.""  Wimmer merely adds ""guns martial arts,"" and the oh-so-present Japanese flavor typical in today's movies.Additional, he adds stunning visuals and rare cinematography in the vein of Fritz Lang or Orson Welles.  The Wells connection is obvious-the dropped snow-globe, and Dominic Purcell (Seamus) bears an odd resemblance to the Fat One.This is a ""Rage Against The Machine"" story, hence the bows and curtsies to Lucas, Orwell, and Bradbury.  Additionally, the Mother Of All ""Rage Against The Machine"" novels, ""Atlas Shrugged,"" was also alluded to in the move: remember that large atlas statue in the office that seemed so out-of-place?  That is a nice tribute to Ayn Rand.One of Rand's talking points was the idea of the Renaissance as the beginning of humans as humans.  That is why the image of the burning of the Mona Lisa is so important: this society that values peace at any cost actually dehumanizes humanity. Once passions are gone, we no longer are humans. Or, as C. S. Lewis put it, we are ""men without chests.""I highly recommend this film, since it has all the action and energy of ""The Matrix"" -style films, without all of the Junior High philosophizing that bogs the film down.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2ED8XZG3468QJ	Karl Grava	"Every once and a while a film comes along that has had almost no advertising or even a decent release to the general public, alas the purgatory of limited released and art house films. Yet in the case of Equilibrium I am more amazed as to why this never received a wider release. Upon seeing the movie I honestly did not have high expectations other then to see some cool gunplay and martial arts as the star of the film. While this factor did prove to be entertaining the true star belongs to the finely crafted script which pays homage to such novels as ""Brave New World"", ""1984"", and ""Fahrenheit 451"".The story places the viewer in the post-apocalyptic world of the future. Having suffered the aftermath of World War III the survivors banned together to form a new society one which would rid them of humanities greatest flaw, emotions. Controlled by a drug, which nullifies such senses the future is a utopia free from war, yet enslaved to those that wield power and the establishment created. Art, music, literature, all these are banned and the penalty for committing such sense-crimes is death.The most feared of the establishment's protectors is the Cleric. A group of men trained in mind and body to be the perfect killing machines and the poster children of their ideals. One such Cleric, whom even executed his own partner for reading a book of poems, begins to see the world in a new light when he misses his regular dose and experiences a flood of emotions he had never felt before. While trying to maintain his duty he finds the cruel sadism of his appointed task almost more then he can bear. In a desperate search he tries to find the resistance and bring an end to the madness he has safeguarded.Christian Bale, playing the Cleric, is incredible giving depth and emotion to a role that demanded none. In this he makes the film all the more deeper. The cinematic style and editing while borrowed from such filmmakers as John Woo and Tsui Hark brings enough freshness while adapting such styles. The art direction is fitting in creating a claustrophobic world of grim lies. Although the backdrops of the city are not that impressive and are obviously CG effects. The music which is at times dark and laced with the foreboding conflict arising and then it is a fast paced techno score which sets the pace for the gun fire without missing a beat.In all Equilibrium is a Science Fiction fans dream come true, yet it is also a film that can be enjoyed by fans of classic literature as well. While the ending may seem over-simplified I actually found it to hold deeper meaning as well as an interesting commentary on humanity in general. But most will just be thrilled at the ending ten-minute gunfight, with an impressive sword duel to boot. Equilibrium contains strong violence and language and is recommend for ages 17 and up. For once style and substance collide on celluloid."	4.0	A Near Perfect Mix of Action and Classic Literature	2003-01-03	4	4	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AIIR8E34EDKCQ	- Kasia S.	"When action leaped up in mid air and dance like fighting sequences splattered on my screen, the first question I asked myself was ""How come I have never heard of this movie before?""  It came and went into the movie theaters like a hushed shadow, yet hundreds of outstanding five star reviews prove it was well received and it did not slip by silently.One can easily assume that Equilibrium is just another action movie, but this hybrid of marital art styles, refined weaponry and stunning fight scenes reached deeper than many movies I've seen of serious topics and non frills entertainment. This movie reminded me of movies such as Kill Bill, V for Vendetta, Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet,  yet the story and theme touched on the rawest foundations of humanity.In the future as wars threatened mankind , drugs replaced all feeling and emotions. There was no art, no books, no fancy clothes, only sterile solemn looking houses and no individuality whatsoever, people looked like they stepped out of an assembly line at a factory. A totalitarian society ruled by a man called Father and his high officials distributed a drug which upon injection sustained the feeling of nothingness. Amongst that society there were real people, those who hid or ran away and tired to keep some of their possessions with them, but they were at risk of an instant and brutal death if found by the Grammaton Clerics, a breed of super cops who sniff out the fugitives. It is amazing what they did in the name of peace, how many people they killed and murdered, makes on think about what is right and what is wrong but carries a good name.One day John Preston (Christian Bale) skips a dose and notices undesirable to him effects taking place. He uses his excellent combat skills to trace reasons of why he should not take it and of what the truth really holds. The story as far fetches as it was, was fun and witty and did not take a trilogy to portray it's message. It was a scary glimpse into the world where all feeling and emotions were suppressed, and when I left my boyfriends house after watching it I thought that the air never smelled so good and the world never looked so fresh before. It made me value the kind of freedom I complain about daily, as non perfect as it is, it sure is better than the life Preston had.There were many twists and turns to the story, secret traitors and hidden agendas and I loved solving it with Preston.  The icing on the cake was the fighting, especially when he used his guns as swords, I real treat to watch! This is a must have movie in anyone's library, especially for action buffs!- Kasia S."	5.0	Furious force of action and suspense	2006-08-31	12	11	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3HHDHKYL8UG4Z	Ken Kupstis	If you're not put off by violence, this is an AMAZING film. It's basically Fahrenheit 451 crossed with every &quot;Gunfight&quot; movie ever made. It's a postapocalyptic future where emotions must be suppressed to keep mankind from having a 4th world war. However, the cure is worse than the disease, as the &quot;Grammaton Clerics&quot; wipe out everyone with even a shred of emotion. Christian Bale is GREAT, as are Sean Bean and Emily Watson. Taye Diggs, who is normally good, gets a bit irritating here as a treacherous lawman. Also the film is a bit flawed here and there...even those who supposably aren't 'feeling' show plenty of emotion in various scenes; killing nine people to save a puppy seems a bit ridiculous; and some of the bad guys can't shoot worth a DAMN, even when they're SURROUNDING a target! However, this film has some of the most amazing gunfights ever filmed, courtesy of Kurt Wimmer's &quot;Gun Katas&quot;, which make gunfights into swordfights at the same time. A very underrated film, well worth the money.	5.0	Fahrenheit 451 + The Wild Bunch = MAYHEM!!!	2004-01-14	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1N406N28JGD31	Ken Lowe	This movie is about as exisential as Bladerunner & A.I. and has all the mindscrew of Minority Report.  Fantastic displays of hyper-kinetic gun-kata and the uber-cool visual combos of Bladerunner, The Fifth Element, & Metropolis aside, this movies delves into an area sci-fi doesn't go that much into anymore...psychology. Can we find the line of behavior to save ourselves from our most basic emotions without giving up what makes us human? And what are the prices of the extremes on either end of the spectrum? It shows how cold, lonely, bleak, & empty absoute emotional isolation & control can be, and how the world looks & feels as you experience it without inhibitors for the first time. This film in some cases does exceed the first Matrix movie, but keep in mind these are two TOTALLY different animals.  My only complaints are (1) I never saw this on the big screen. (2) There's no trailer, or DTS format on the DVD. Aside from that, Equilibium is an absolute, thought provoking gem of a  keeper.  ...and considering that all the major retail outlets in my area can't keep the dvd on the shelves for more than two days, says it all.	5.0	OWN THIS MOVIE!!!	2003-05-17	0	0	0

Funny though, how it never actually made it there. It seems that too many people compared it to the Matrix for the studio to see it as a profitable vehicle. If you accept that the Brothers Waichowski and Kurt Wimmer drew from the same influences in realizing their seperate visions it's EASY to see that the films are otherwise nothing alike.The people who say it is are the same tunnel visioned close minded lemmings who say all rap music sounds the same and once you heard one country song you've heard them all.This is a great, action packed movie.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Up until I saw this film, I knew very little about Christian Bale.  My wife told me that he was in a version of ""Little Women"" sometime ago.  I've also seen him with smaller parts in other films.In ""Equilibrium,"" Bale takes center stage as John Preston, a top cleric in Libria who hunts down ""sense offenders.""  These ""sense offenders"" range from people who read poetry and novels, study art, or enjoy the occasional musical piece.  In other words, anyone who shows any sort of emotion is dealt with swiftly and deadly.  Also, if you skip your dosage of Prozium, an emotion dulling drug, you risk facing death.All of this emotion control is done in hopes to render any ideas of revolution moot.  After the third World War, balance is brought about by removing art, music, etc. so that no one gets any crazy ideas.  Of course, there are some folks who want to feel.  These people, including one fellow cleric, manage to get under the skin of Bale.  Bale slowly begins to lose his emotionless nature and begins to cherish things such as rainbows and puppies.  He begins to care for human life and worries for the safety of his children.  Eventually, he is recruited by the revolutionaries to lead their revolt on ""Father,"" a Big Brother-type who controls what is considered good and what is considered bad.Bale goes from emotionless puppet to a vengeful, angry man.  Though some may find his love of a puppy and the lengths he goes to in order to save its life a tad silly, you have to see the situation through his character's eyes.  The best example I can give is when you see a deaf person ""hear"" for the first time using a hearing aid.  They usually begin to cry tears of joy and pain all at the same time.  Something very similar occurs to Bale when he hears music for the first time.Taye Diggs provides a smarty-pants foe to Bale's Preston.  Angus McFadyen plays ""Father"" with sinister flair.  Both Emily Watson and Sean Bean have small but significant roles and they put their whole hearts into their respective characters.  The rest of the cast is very good, though most of them are simply ""sweepers"" and revolutionaries who fight violently and often.The story moves at a steady pace and really picks up when Bale begins to show a little too much emotion around Diggs.  The action is brilliant, especially the gun-kata.  Others have compared this film to ""The Matrix,"" but I see nothing in ""Equilibrium"" that wasn't copied by ""The Matrix"" and vice versa.  Let's be honest folks, the whole ""Matrix"" story and things not being as they seem has been thrown around for centuries.  It's all been done before in countless books, plays and films.  What it all boils down to is good versus evil and in the end, good prevails.  Stop with the comparisons already!Anyway, watch this film if you really enjoy action-packed sci-fi that is a little bit more intelligent than most of the shoot-em-up sci-fi we are treated to these days.  The acting is way better than a lot of other flicks out there these days.  The action is fun to watch, and you will actually pull for the good guys in this one.Highly recommended."	4.0	Bale Shines	2005-03-02	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ANTHG1QQOVLO6	"K. Hardaway ""khardawa"""	A lot of people have been comparing this movie to The Matrix.  But the special effects and fight scenes are actually realistic and believable.  Not just a bunch of people flying around(obviously on wires) in slow motion for 2 minutes before landing a kick.  Also the story isn't confusing or complicated. Anyway, comparisons to Sci-fi movies like Gattaca and Minority Report are more fitting.  It's a futuristic version of society where rulers try to rid the world of war, hate crimes, etc. by eliminating the cause...extreme emotions.  So they use a drug to eliminate ALL emotions, including love and fear.  Where Gattaca targets classism (money buying status), and Minority Report targets morals (arresting a person who's done nothing), Equilibrium targets desensitization.  It's an excellent study in extremes in order to avoid...extremes.  Christian Bale plays the top &quot;cleric&quot; who begins to feel, and decides to join the resistance to knock out the system.  Where The Matrix failed for me (long, overblown, over computerized, implausible fight sequences), Equilibrium succeeds with good old fashioned martial arts with weapons (that NEVER is overlong or boring), and only a few special effects, and no wires at all.  So everything looks fantastic and real. A must for any fan of the &quot;futuristic society&quot; genre of films.  Definately in the league of Gattaca and Minority Report.  With better action and choreography that in big budget, highly digital movies, like The Matrix and Charlie's Angels 2.  Christian Bale will definately revive the Batman franchise if his performance in this is any indication.	5.0	A thinking man's movie	2003-10-20	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2PETG7TDJYGJT	"Khausmo ""k-unit"""	Went to see this even though i knew next to nothing about it. Similiar thematically to Minority Report; similar theatrically to the Matrix, with the CG city scapes, color filtering, and innovative martial arts gun battles. I'll just make random comments that hopefully will ring true when you see the film; i'd rather not repeat the plot that is summarized somewhere else on the internet. Costumes are slick. Fight scenes are sexy, cool and bad to the bone. The CG city background was futuristic enough to work for the film; they might have been better, but at least they weren't so virtual, they looked fake. Not sure why the cars were so late 80s/early 90s american vehicles. They should have done a little product sponsorship like Lexus in Minority Report; people always like to see cool new things; it broadens their horizons. Seeing re-painted chevy's does not. However, the auto-handguns used are the sort that make gun-geeks weak in the knees.  Great story for such a muted romantic angle, they could have done more there.  No cool, power woman characters. In this day and age we should see tough,...ladies showing up the men in every other film. It shows a little lack of vision or imagination on the part of the film makers. Even in Metropolis (the early 20th Century flick, not the anime), they were working the female heroine angle.  Science fiction is known for having innovative, bad hotties dominating the screen, so it's a glaring oversight. The scenes and shots start out truly cinematic with some memorable shots, but they never resurface as they give way to audience-minded action thrill shots later. I mean, why not throw in more bizarre, euro-style shots of water or something just to give it the sophistication you started out with? Again, scifi flicks give film makers a suitable genre to try out the nifty, cutting edge stuff that people no longer tolerate from Arnold movies. The entire picture is filmed with a color filtering that is similar to the matrix...same dark, fall colors like green and burgandy. The colors sort of carry this feeling of a strange reality, like a dream or memory...a nice touch which borrows on the strength of themes from the Matrix, but overall the film didn't achieve the plot, thematic and cinematic achievements of the matrix. Equilibrium borrows a lot, but fails to capitalize on it and take it further or elsewhere. A disappointment after such a strong beginning. Go see it...enjoyable and entertaining.	4.0	Blazing Social Commentary via Sex Appeal Action/Violence	2002-12-10	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1S267FU2VFOZI	Killer Shrike	"I saw this movie recently at a friends place, somewhat reluctantly.""Oh boy, another Matrix clone...yawn.""But a few minutes in Im like ""Hey, this is like Farenheit, 1984, and BNW all shoved together!"", and it had my interest.The plot has some thin areas, no question, but as a paranoid future dystopia cautionary tale type of story its pretty good.Taking a page from Brave New World everyone is on a mood altering drug; however whereas BNW's soma was a pep-pill, the Equilibrium drug is a emotion-suppressor, rendering people into calm, cool, and collected living mannikins.Taking a page from 1984 the Tetragrammaton is a Big Brother-esque government, though they seem to rely more on human surveilance than on electronic spying, which suppresses art, culture, and entertainment as they engender to many emotional upwellings. There are also constant 1984-esque propoganda broadcasts, and the ""sense offense"" concept of the movie is pretty much the same thing as the ""thought crime"" of 1984.The Fahrenheit 451 similarities mostly show up in the fact that art and various bric a brac are burned when found, and in the parrallels between the main characters; also, one could find some similarities in the puppy the main character becomes attached to and the little girl next door in '451.Of course, having been made post-1998 the movie also has some martial arts. Even Yoda is a ninja these days, afterall. In this case however rather than more ho-hum Wire Fu we are presented with the concept of the Gun Kata, which sounds cheesy, but is actually somewhat compelling. At the very least its original, and that's got to count for something?Like any good martial arts Gun Kata makes it practitioner invincible, or at least unbeatable by anyone else in the film. The focus of Gun Kata is a scientific analysis of the most probable angles of fire in a gunfight, enabling a practitioner to  simultaneously avoid being shot and deliver highly accurate fire even in total darkness and at both close and medium range. It also has a melee component consisting of pistol whipping with extreme prejuidice anyone that gets too close.Unlike the wire-enabled gyrations of the Matrix, the Gun Kata is very stationary; the practitioner basically plants their feet and  becomes the focal point of a fire fight. Since the ""art"" is supposed to be trajectory based this even makes a certain amount of sense.Cinematically this results in frenetic action packed sequences of  very tightly shot violence that is actually really striking and distinctive. There is also some kendo/japanese katana fighting in the movie which is interesting, but much less interesting than the Gun Kata  scenes IMO.There is one scene towards the end that is obviously Matrix inspired, and the black outfit worn by the ""senior"" Grammaton Clerics (basically the ultra-chic ""too sexy for my goth look"" equivalent of Thought Police in the movies setting, or to put it another way for the comic book crowd like the Judges from Judge Dredd) is very Neo-esque, but otherwise this movie owes more to Bradbury, Orwell, and Huxley both thematically and stylistically than the Wachowski brothers or Hong Kong Wuxia.Sean Bean is in the movie for about 5 minutes, as is the guy that played Robert the Bruce from Brave Heart, and Taye Diggs is another Grammaton Cleric who has maybe 10 minutes of screen time, but the movie revolves around Christian Bale. This guy is the king of minimalist expressionism. The merest fluctuation of his facial expression can communicate volumes. He was perfectly cast in this role, and I'm really looking forward to seeing him as Bruce Wayne in the next go around of the Batman franchise.Bale plays a top-mark senior Grammaton Cleric who is basically the bizomb. The only mar on his record is that he failed to detect his wifes ""sense crime"" and turn her in for execution himself a few years previously. After going off his emotion-suppresent drug Bale basically becomes the Guy Montag/Winston Smith/Bernard Marx parrallel of this particular dystopian tale, proceeds to get involved in the de riguer anti-establishment underground, and turns his abilities against the oppressor Big Brother state. Fight the Power! You know the drill, standard dystopian fare from there on out, but with frenetic fight scenes.As an aside, I bet that if 1984 was made into a big screen Hollywood movie next year Winston Smith would be a master of some kind of martial art and would kick some serious Party behind in the last 15 minutes of the movie. Nothing Hollywood loves more than a proven formula! But I digress....So in summary, if you are a fan of dystopian fiction/literature and havent seen a decent action flick in a while, this movie is a way to satisfy both tastes all in one easy to swallow go. Keep your expectations reasonable and you'll have a good show."	4.0	Suprisingly good	2004-04-27	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	In the future, a majority has been taught that emotions are the root to all evil and they now must be eradicated by the government through a police force lead by the Clerics.  Anything that can cause emotion is to be exterminated or taken in for investigation such as art, books, music, and people with knowledge of feelings.  The people are controlled by Prozium, a mind-numbing medication that controls emotions.  However, when Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) loses his partner and repressed memories begin to haunt his sleep, he decides to see what happens if he does not take the Prozium.  Equilibrium is a dark film about a possible future that promotes thoughts about our current freedoms in the western world; however, it also offers some action packed sequences that will keep the sleepy awake.  In the end, Equilibrium offers a solid cinematic experience.	4.0	Emotions are the root to all evil...	2004-01-03	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3SQ1V9IGUZQRX	kiwijinxter	Of course it's not the Matrix.  Equilibrium actually begins and ends with an excellent storyline and tight plot!I wonder why I've never picked this DVD up before - it honestly boasts of some of the best, if not the best, choreography and fastest action sequences I've ever seen!  Few movies can live up to this kind of lightning-quick action.  Yes, if you loved the Matrix, you will DEFINITELY love this one.  However, this is actually a 1000 times more satisfying than the Matrix, considering Reloaded.  Wish I discovered this earlier!

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A5FNQSIZUMNRO	Kjartan Kvassnes	In any good action movie, it is ok to create an alternative reality. However it is, at least somewhat, important that the movie tries to exist within the reality they choose to create.When the movie goes way off track already within the first three minutes, and the rest of the movie really doesn't unveil any new aspects to the action genre, nor does it even give any twist to the established action genre, I get really bored. The movie is filled with faults in the logic of its own plot, acting really sucks and the movie fail to present any ideas of its own.If at least the action scenes where any good, or at least somewhat entertaining, I would be willing to forgive some of the massive faults in this movie. But no, effects and fight scenes are uninteresting and boring.There are really not many reasons to see this film, and I would say this is 103 minutes of my life I never will get back.	1.0	Don't waste your time and money	2004-01-10	28	8	20
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1BVEAJN9DYO96	Kojifresh	I would never say this movie is better than the Matrix, but I personally enjoyed it more than the Matrix. Perhaps I'm biased after ready Ray Bradbury's &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34;, which I believe this movie was heavily influenced by (a very good book by the way). As I'm sure other reviewers will do a more detailed synopsis of this movie than me, I'll briefly go over my impressions.Another great performance by Christian Bale. If this is a first time for any viewers watching movies he stars in, check this out! The martial arts choreography is stellar. The action sequences are perfectly balanced between the surreal and reality in terms of special effects. The movie's score does an excellent job at portraying the emotionless future that is centered on the movie's plot.Overall, this movie is definitely worth your time to checkout all the way through. It is an instant classic in its own right. Thanks for reading my review.-Kojifresh	4.0	A rarity in sci-fi drama/action	2013-10-15	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1Q6GFIK32RXHU	"""kopernikuz"""	The marketing surrounding this critically hailed and audience neglected film, says &quot;Forget the Matrix&quot;.  Not hardly.I can't really understand all the connections, honestly... the stories are apples and oranges, the action is apples and oranges... the costumes... well... okay... the Clerics look like they're jacked right in to battle Agent Smith.  But they don't borrow from any of the action style of the Matrix whatsoever.  Instead, they adopt a new-fangled gun battling called &quot;Gun-Kata&quot;, which essentially allows for the master of Gun-Kata to walk into a room full of armed enemies, instantly calculate positions and trajectories that will allow them to move and fire precisely enough to hit the enemies in kill zones and have their own body in a position to avoid the line of fire from any of the enemies.Sounds complicated, but it's beautiful to watch on screen.This movie looks like 1984, Minority Report, and the Matrix all in one.  In the future, there is no war, because there is no emotion... it's outlawed and controlled by a drug which everyone must take at regular intervals.  Anything which spurs emotion is outlawed as well:  art, music, literature... even their windows are fogged over so that they cannot see the sun rise or set, for fear it might inspire emotion.There are plenty of plot-holes in this film... but they're easy enough to overlook and just have fun.  For example, Taye Digg's character is Cleric Christian Bale's new partner.  From the beginning, Digg's becomes suspicious of his partner and even shows some clear ambition that he wants to be the top Cleric like Bale.  Ambition isn't so much an emotion, but it can lead to violence too... they don't account for that in the film at all.  What about greed?  They don't really explain if the drug counters these things.  Digg's ambition though, could clearly be read as motivator towards something bad happening... not to mention he smiles way too much for someone who isn't supposed to &quot;feel&quot;...Anyway, that being said... the movie is fun.  The action is limited to the beginning and towards the very end, while the middle is devoted to watching this Cleric unravel as he misses a dose of the drug and begins to struggle with newfound emotion.  There are a couple of neat twists, but overall, you will enjoy this morality tale unfolding while at the same time watching bullets fly like mad.It's a shame it was overlooked in theaters.  Here's hoping it gets a new life as a cult classic.	4.0	Forget the Matrix?  Well.... not hardly... but a good film!	2003-10-17	1	1	0

No, this movie is NOT better than the Matrix, and nor do its gun scenes at the end put the Matrix police lobby gunfight to shame.  Yes, it IS a really good movie that has a great cast, a interesting story and a rockin ending.  This movie only cost between 20 to 30 million to make, but it does NOT have a B-movie feel to it.Equilibrium takes place in the future, in which a totolitarian regime as banned sensing and feelings (everyone takes a daily feeling inhibitor) as a method for controlling conflict. Christian Bale truly steals the show in his role as the cleric John Peterson (basically a death dealer for the regime) who starts to doubt the system, but there are fine performances by Sean Bean, Angus MacFadyen and Taye Diggs.The tension in Equilibrium increases as the movie progresses. The front end of Equilibrium almost has a Gattaca-like feel to it, while the back-end has some serious butt kicking, along with some Total Recall-like shockers.  I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars.	4.0	Pretty good movie, but NOT better than the Matrix	2004-01-21	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A11B8DFULE1ZRP	"Larania Drake ""ALT gamer"""	This was the funniest movie I have seen in years. Why? Because it tried so very, very hard to be serious... and went overboard off the cliff of goofy.Christian Bale plays a 'cleric' in a dystopian future that has chosen to forgo emotion, saying that emotion is what leads to war. This is not a wrong statement, like saying oxygen leads to forest fires. It just leaves out most of the important factors. But the problem isn't the idea, but the execution. The director and writer has chosen to try to wring as much emotion out of a scene as possible, but what he fails it is making you &lt;i>care&lt;/i>. I do not care that this world is a dystopian future because of the massive leaps in logic it takes to create it. I do not care about the fates of any of the characters, because none of them are enjoyable. I do not care about potential harm to the protagonist because he is a boring invincible hero and the director/writer knows it. There was no tension, no stakes, because we knew that the hero would win, because the hero never got hurt in a way we cared about. The video-game-like action sequences were so over the top and ridiculous that you couldn't take them seriously.So I laughed. And laughed, and laughed.This movie is an enjoyable BAD movie. I recommend it for when you need something to mock or you need a bloody revenge fantasy. But as for useful or deep?No.	2.0	Two stars for quality, not enjoyment	2013-08-01	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3AOKQCH0YBZDS	L. A. Vitale	"I enjoyed this watching this film. It is a futuristic/sci-fi action packed thriller in which everyone is mandated to take emotion suppressing drugs to prevent them from feeling any emotion whatsoever.It is thought by the new government that any type of emotion is evil and will bring on war and violence. So the new government would rather keep everyone like mindless drones and prevent anyone from reading books, owning and viewing art and listening to music. All of which are crimes punishable by death.An elite force known as the ""Cleric"" enforce the rules that have been set forth by the current government. They also arrest those which are involved with the underground resistance movement trying to over throw the government. Christian Bale's character plays the head/lead of all clerics and is the best of the best. He loses both his partner and his wife to ""sense crime""---crimes done by those who've stopped taking there medication to prevent emotions from surfacing.Eventually Bale's character stops his medication as well. He continues working as a cleric but guards his emotions in attempts to over throw the government from the inside."	3.0	Reminiscent of Farenheit 451	2007-01-30	3	1	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is about a futuristic world in which a totalitarian regime has created a &quot;perfect society&quot; by suppressing emotions and banning ownership of bad things like books, art, and music. If you have a feeling you are guilty of a crime punishable by death. All the citizens take a mood-limiting drug to go along with the constant brain-washing providing by the single media source and keep everybody in place. Then we have the government officials who are charged with destroying those &quot;sense offenders&quot; who resist the rules, one of whom is one of the chief &quot;clerics,&quot; John Preston (Christian Bale).To anyone who has read Ray Bradbury's classic dystopian novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; the plot line of Kurt Wimmer's 2002 film is familiar. But instead of taking the simple idea of banning books to a logical extreme, Wimmer's world goes for absolutely everything. This means that for the first half of &quot;Equilibrium&quot; I was having a hard time finding mine because I could not believe that the world could really get that far. By what logic do you throw out Da Vinci's &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; along with the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, that gets rid of both the Sex Pistols and Ludwig von Beethoven, and prohibits everything from snow globes to puppy dogs? Then, on top of everything, you adopt a symbol that is about a close to a swastika as you can get, like this would also be a good thing in a brave new world.The assumption has always been that it is the conservatives who are going to turn fascist while the liberals are becoming communists, so for the sake of this film we have to believe in a world where conservatives give up religion, forgo any attempts at Vulcan philosophy and take drugs to curb all feelings (Preston is a &quot;cleric&quot; but there are no signs of anything like a religion beyond the cult like obedience to &quot;Father,&quot; this world's version of &quot;Big Brother,&quot; and the tendency to burn people alive as punishment, which may just be another homage to Bradbury). The point is to curb emotions, yet it would the anger of the righteous that would even attempt to spawn this sort of world in the first place. You tell me that Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs) is not angry and having other feelings when he he finds out what Preston is really up to. The man SMILES; should they not be shooting everybody who smiles?Of course this film has to do with Preston, who like Bradbury's Montag becomes intrigued by all that society denies him and then tries to defy the system he has upheld. This is where things get interesting because Preston might be alone but he has the strength of ten men. Well, actually, he acts more like Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies. You can surround this guy with storm troopers holding guns to his head and he will kill them all. The fights are apparently are example of &quot;Gun-Kata,&quot; that is to say &quot;a martial art completely based around guns,&quot; and they are rather impressive, even by &quot;Matrix&quot; standards. Just do not ask me why anybody needs this much martial arts and weaponry training in a world of drug-induced stupors.So the trick with &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is to balance the political position of the dystopian elements with the action sequences, in an apparent attempt to keep two very different types of audiences separate. It is rather difficult to enjoy the choreography of the gun battles while trying to deal with the deep philosophical issues that film is trying to raise in between the fights. In the end, what redeems this film somewhat is the end game, where Wimmer's film actually ups the ante and throws in enough twists and turns to make it really interesting. But even then if you do not see the about Father's identity coming then you do not know your classic films and the final sequence says to me that Wimmer is only pretending that he is trying to play on a higher level.	3.0	What if Montag in &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; was a Vulcan Neo?	2004-08-01	3	2	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AUS6TP9X0WI05	"Lawrence G Coatney ""Geno"""	What a strange movie. I really liked it. I think. I'm pretty sure I enjoyed it. Well, it made me think quite a bit, which is a sure indication that I got something out of it. And I really like to think, which I guess means I liked it.Really, this was a pretty decent movie, (scince when has Dimension Films had a budget like this, or did they finally learn how to use it?) with a fairly convincing storyline.To begin with I am wondering why everyone thinks it was &quot;silly&quot; to defend and kill for the puppy. There are two reasons that I can see that are valid for him doing this. Generally when an Emotion is felt for the first time it  is pretty strong because it is new to you. (Think of the saying &quot; She was my first love&quot;). Now imagine feeling joy for the first time when you are seeing a puppy (especially this extra cute Swiss Mountain pup), and horror knowing what is expected of you to do to it. Not only do you feel strongly for the pup, but you also want to keep that emotion. Second, there is anther emotion he is feeling that could drive him to  behave this way. Fear. This is what I believe he was feeling when arguing abuot opening his trunk. It wasn't so much fear about them hurting the puppy, but more because in case you hadn't noticed, animals didn,t seem to be part of this world. We are not introduced to them until we find these dogs being raised by sense-offenders. Therefore he feared he would be taken as one of them and be captured and incenerated.I also liked near the end when he confronts his former boss. The contrast to the world he was controlling , and the world he was living in were very well done. The room was colored quite beautifully compared to the outside world of cold, grey, lifeless buildings.Problems.1.My biggest problem (although this is personally just a matter of taste. It worked well for the story itself.)was with Sean Bean's role.He has been one of my favorite actors scince I first seen him in Patriot Games doing his best to knock off Harrison Ford and clan. But the role that was truly made for him, (or him for it) was as Boromir in the Lord of the Rings. Out of all the characters his was the closest (almost tying with Ian McKellan as Gandalf) to how I had envisioned him. So why kill him off in the first few minutes of the movie? Of course he was the only one showing emotion in the movie which is what they were fighting against. (Imagine if they had cast Keanu Reeves instead. He wouldn't need to take the Prozium injections. Of course maybe that is what they meant on the DVD cover by saying &quot;Forget the Matrix&quot;.)2.The fight scenes. While interesting they did seem a little unrealistic. I thought the matrix was more belivable, giving an explanation for Neo's god-like powers. The gun battles were pretty cool, but the scene where he and his partner spar each other seemed a bit choppy and fake. Although I must admit the last fight where he and his former boss clack each others guns for a few minutes while only firing a few shots was highly entertaining.3.When he kills his new partner near the end of the movie happened way to fast for me. The whole movie seemed to be building up to it, the ten seconds later its over.4.Well not quite over. After he falls to his knees he sits there for a few more seconds. Then the whole front of his face slides off. A bit unrealistic and gratuitous for me.5.I have always had troule with movies that have this kind of scope but don't seem to realize it. They say that Prozium has brought the world peace. Where is the rest of the world. They show it like the city and surrounding settlments encompass the whole world.6. It would have been nice to show the chaos that ensues when Prozium is no more and emotions run rampant.For me this movie was worth watching once, and if you are in the mood for some good science fiction then check this one out.	3.0	Slightly reserved	2004-02-13	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2874KTM6K6ZNF	L. Beard	This movie was a total surprise to me. I saw it just last night (March 2009). I somehow missed this gem of a movie. I've noticed a lot of viewers criticize the lack of realism of the Gun-Kata, and the premise of the emotions being removed, but I don't see the problem. The movie is clearly a fantasy. Nonetheless, there are some amazing scenes and some great acting in the film. The movie takes its world and characters seriously. That adds a lot of weight to the movie. The gun-kata and other fighting scenes are simply stunning. In fact, I'd say the fighting scenes are beautiful. The movie has many other moments of beauty as well. In particular, I love the scene of Bale running his hands over the contraband, trying to understand his new feelings. I also loved the moment when he tears the blinds off his window to see the world. The scene is obvious, but no less powerful because of it.Fantastic movie! Amazing. 5 stars.	5.0	This movie caught me off guard	2009-03-16	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3092FSEU96B64	Lee	"Excellent film - Highly recommended - 5 stars - do I make my point?  This film is amazing; full of action; full of exciting, ironic twists; and reminds a person of the book 1948.Scary though in that it is a mirror of what the recent Department of Homeland Security report said -- anyone not agreeing with the current government is a danger to society.  The original report (as of recent the websites I have seen are watering it down after public outcry - or putting their own words in it to make the position of the document seem less offensive) labels these people as terrorists - read it!  It is there in black and white!  The report specifically mentions veterans as being potential terrorists!  Again - try to find the original copy online - recently the websites are watering it down after public outcry.In Equilibrium, the personal thoughts and opinions of the individual are seen as a threat to the government head - called ""The Father.""  This leads to the imprisonment of those who do not agree with the established system.Equilibrium presents us with a fictional society where emotion (hence private opinion as to what is best) is required to be sacrificed by individuals for the (government defined) public good.  This film is a fictional, but harsh glimpse at what history has proven socialism always evolves into.  The reason history has absolutely no record of a non-evil socialistic society is shown in portrayed here.  Mankind has an inherent sense of greed and selfishness.  Therefore, when an authoritative figure is set up to become the entity to distribute everyone's private goods among all society (socialism) - for a state of equilibrium - the fact that, ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" rears its ugly head.The ""father"" in this film is so very typical of what ""absolute corruption"" results in: the ""Father"" forces his opinions on the masses, and (as in all recorded, historical instances) - allows only himself (and immediate friends) the very privileges he denies the citizens!  The parallelism of this film - although a fictional world not yet existing - to historical accuracy is an amazing parallel to witness.Equilibrium also accurately defines the human emotions of greed and selfishness to be the cause of war.  However, as seen here, these - always- are also the basis of evil regimes that kill their own citizens!  What a paradox!  This film accurately does show the way to combat these evils is NOT to sacrifice the rights of the individual and ""spread the wealth around"" b/c when individuality is lost, then existence becomes nothing but a play-toy for the few who wield the authority.  The citizens become puppets living only gratify the indulgences of the privileged few.Get it - watch it - feel it - learn from it - be entertained by it - but do not let the truth behind this enjoyable film slip through your fingers.  No wonder I heard so very little about this film in the news media!"	5.0	Amazing film - Stark reality showing the result of socialism/communism	2009-05-20	2	1	1

Someone said, ""It's like the Matrix, but not."" That perked my interest. So I went, but mostly just to hang with my friends.BeautifulMovingI can think of no better words to use for this film.It was a rather low-budget, but you wouldn't really notice it while you're watching it. They were able to make the movie in such a why as to NOT be expensive. Most of the sets are monochrome, yet sleek. So why does it work so well?The basic plot of the movie is this: Humans are an emotional creature, strong emotions lead to hate, hate leads to war, thus emotion is the enemy of mankind.Ruled by a ""benevolent"" dictator, the city pumps itself full of a drug that suppresses emotion. A special type of law-enforcers, called ""Clerics"", police the citizens for items with ""Emotional Content"". Objects like artwork, books of poetry, perfume, things with color and decoration.The overall plot is pretty predictable, but that doesn't lessen the movie in any way. The most moving scene is when you watch the Star, Christian Bale, begin to ""feel"" for the first time. I sat in my seat and cried. And the action sequences were something to drool over. This is probably the first movie that I've watched that satisfied both my Action/Fighting craving along with my desire for good Drama.If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT!

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3KB1H0S7T6JX1	L Gontzes	Equilibrium sheds light on human civilization following WWIII with efforts under way to prevent WWIV.  Having (barely) survived yet another world war, humanity has placed its hopes on a strict regime that forces drugs on the citizens in an effort to suppress all feelings (thus doing away with hate and aggression).  To implement law and order, and oversee the administration of the drugs, the state's leadership relies on the services of a special kind of enforcers known as the Clerics.  One such Cleric, however, will discover that what he's been fighting against might just be worth saving...Christian Bale, Sean Bean (from LOR), Angus Macfadyen (from Braveheart), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!There are strong hints of 1984 and Brave New World as well as the Matrix, Aeon Flux, Ultraviolet, and V for Vendetta so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure/mystery type of category.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the special effects are all wonderful!In short, Equilibrium will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!	5.0	The Cleric	2006-08-26	3	3	0

Make sure you have great looking costumes and production/set design.  Add heavy-handed dialogue.  Have the main character do a non-credible about face from emotionless slaughterer of dozens of human beings to being moved by a single puppy.  (Gee, how in the heck did THAT happen?)It just doesn't work, folks.  Why three stars?  Cause the production/set design IS really good.  Cause most of the actors ARE very good.  The cute babe, for example, is Emily Watson and she IS an excellent actress.  Sean Bean, though here only briefly, IS a good actor.  In the lead role, Christian Bale DOES do a good job.  The look of the film is top notch.The gun battles are not ultra-cool but just kind of...there.  It's just a whole lotta guys shooting a whole lotta bullets out of a whole lotta guns with a whole lotta people dying as a result. Yeah, so?The original Matrix rocked because the concept was so breathtaking--ESPECIALLY the way it was developed.  The concept here is NOTHING like the Matrix at all.  It is a straightforward tried and true 1950s (even 1940s)-style science fiction idea: emotion will harm you so let's get rid of it and have unfeeling robotoids populate the world, numbed by the injection of a government-dispensed drug.This is mildly entertaining (the real reason for the three stars) but is not a great contemporary science fiction film.  The Matrix (the original) is far superior.  So is Dark City.  This one is...just OK.	3.0	Derivative	2003-09-09	9	6	3

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	"Equilibrium (2002)is an underrated film that thankfully is getting more recognition on DVD.  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, the premise is deceptively simple: after World War Four, society has had enough.  Human emotions are blamed for all violence, and the name of this new totalitarian society is Libria, run by the faceless Tetragrammaton.  Citizens dutifully inject themselves twice a day with a drug that supresses all feelings, even senses of touch and taste.  The movie is a fantastic futuristic action thriller that also touched my heart and provoked endless thought.  The reasoning behind eliminating human feelings makes some sense.  The other side of love is hate, and passion is often responsible for murder.  Why do people numb themselves with alcohol and drugs, even committ suicide?  Because feeling is sometimes too painful to bear.  We have all been let down, hurt by someone we love.  But that is a sacrifice we make, to feel love and friendship.Christian Bale is the center of the story.  A magnetic and mesmerizing actor who moves with the athletic grace of a tiger, he plays Cleric John Preston.  As a top enforcer against ""sense offenders,"" Preston even executes another cleric (Sean Bean - Boromir in the Lord of the Rings) who has succumbed to Yeat's poetry.  ""Tread lightly on my dreams.""  Bean gives quite a touching performance.  Preston has two young children, but his wife was incinerated for sense offenses.  Of course, Preston feels nothing.  There is a resistance, of course, underground people who are not injecting and ""feeling.""  They cling to cheesy knick-knacks and tacky art, anything to evoke emotion.  These scenes of confiscated snow-globes and faded paintings are very sad.  Even sadder is a scene where companion animals are exterminated because they serve no purpose except love.  I cried at this scene.The sets and acting are very good.  Taye Diggs plays a villian here - how odd to see that engaging, bright smile become sinister!  He is also very good in combat scenes.  Angus MacFayden (Robert the Bruce in Braveheart) plays Preston's supervisor. Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) plays Mary O'Brien, a woman arrested for sense offense and sentenced to incineration. The movie is very violent, with lots of bloody executions and tons of gunfire.  But the hand-to-hand martial arts combat scenes are breathtaking.  The DVD contains a nice featurette entitled ""Finding Equilibrium.""  The featurette contains interviews with Bale, Diggs, Wimmer, and Watson, although Watson is so soft-spoken you really can't hear what she is saying!"	5.0	What Would It Be Like to Live In a World With No Feelings?	2005-04-28	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AQ9KJ6ZH4KYXG	L. Morley	"Somebody obviously read Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Brave New World, and probably some other dystopian novels. Somebody probably noticed that some of the dystopian movies of the time (The Matrix) have techno soundtracks and choreographed fight scenes that blend old world fighting with modern shoot 'em up weapons, so there's some of that too. But Equilibrium really never gets close to dealing with dystopian themes on the same level as any of the above. Some of my biggest gripes include the rather one-dimensional acting (though Christian Bale at times approaches two dimensions), the terrible fight choreography where the winning side's bullets hit every target but the losing side's bullets never hit anyone (even if the winning side never even ducks!), and the movie's fulfillment of so many dystopian stereotypes without actually doing anything new or novel in the genre itself. The movie is full of iconography designed to remind you of oppressive empires, from zeppelins flying overhead to Roman style lettering/engraving to an oppressive leader known as ""Father"". But instead of being novel or subtle, the use of imagery instead comes across as cliche and unimaginative. All in all, there are so many good alternatives in this genre that this movie really isn't worth anyone's time."	2.0	A poorly rendered copy of every classic dystopian story	2013-10-20	2	1	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A30PAUT31DA2U9	"""lonederanger122"""	To be honest, I never even heard of this movie until on two separate occasions I heard people mention &quot;grammaton cleric&quot;.  At that point, I knew I was missing out on something big and decided to watch it.  I'm sure glad that I did.All good movies need plenty emotion and this one gives you just that.  For the first hour there is so much tension that you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat.  Not that it will make you cry or anything, but it will definitely shock you as things happen suddenly and the outcome is unpredictable.  What's more, the soundtrack absolutely matches what John Preston (Christian Bale) is feeling at the moment.  That in of itself is crucial to the story, as you will find out.  My only complaint is the ending, which felt, for a lack of a better word, &quot;staged&quot;, but that really didn't matter in the long run.I'm inclined to give any movie with Emily Watson 5 stars; however this one deserves them on its own.  It has great action, an interesting story, superb acting, and, unlike &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot;, is fortified with enough drama to keep you interested all along the way.	5.0	The Sci-Fi genre needs more films like this!	2003-07-12	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3EDUR56KK59JF	Lori O. Kohn	My nephew brought the DVD to my house one day. It was recommended to him on the grounds of &quot;People who liked That, also liked This.&quot; As he described it I was reminded of a book I had read years ago, &quot;This Perfect Day&quot;, by Ira Levin, the author of Rosemary's Baby, the premise being a world that controls its human emotions is a world of peace.So we gave it a shot and I am not kidding, it is my new favorite movie. We watched it again so we could &quot;look at it&quot; on the second go-around. If you appreciate camera work, editing, lighting, set design, costuming, and all that cinema stuff, you know what I mean by &quot;look at&quot; vs &quot;watch.&quot;Other reviewers have made comparisons to The Matrix and rightly so, but Equilibrium is in its own way better because of its use of classical cinemagraphic techniques, not to mention the superb acting. The special effects never got too bossy. The action scenes are as original as I have seen, with a minimum of &quot;Yeah-right, I'm just sure, (yawn).&quot; and a maximum of &quot;How cool was that!&quot;I'm nearly fifty years old and I have seen plenty of guys running with two machine guns, doing horizonal leaps into doors and through windows, and I've seen hours of swordplay...but until Equilibrium I had never seen swordplay with handguns. The last time I saw moves so original was &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; with Geena Davis. Equilibrium's Grammaton Cleric reloads his weapons with even more panache than Lara Croft. And speaking of Christian Bale, he creeped me out in American Psycho, but has redeemed himself with Equilibrium. Henceforth, I'll watch anything he is in...no questions asked.I have one word of advice for the producers of this film...sequel.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"This seemingly original and promissing film disappointed me greatly and bored me almost to death. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Equilibrium is set in a near future, in a totalitarian state ironically called Libria. After the Third World War and its devastation, the survivors of humanity adopted an ideology founded on one principle: because human emotions are at the root of conflicts, if humanisty is to live at peace all human emotions must be banned. Everyone is therefore required to take daily injections of Prozium, an emotion-suppressing drug and ""emotionally stimulating materials"" like books, paintings, etc. are banned. Those who refuse to take Prozium are deemed ""sense offenders"" and when identified they are ""processed"" (burnt alive). Confiscated materials are always destroyed.Libria is governed by the Tetragrammaton Council, led by ""Father"" (Sean Pertwee). ""Father"" and the Council have at their disposal many thousands of policemen, including the elite Grammaton Clerics. However, no matter how hard the Council tries, a resistance movement (""Underground"") endures. This film tells mostly the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), one of highest ranking Grammaton Clerics and of his growing disaffection with the Tetragrammaton regime.Now, this film very clearly borrows a lot from famous dystopian books like ""Brave new world"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"", as well as from their cinema adaptaion and also movies like ""THX1138"" (mandatory drug taking), ""Matrix"" (Grammaton Clerics are the equivalent of Agents), ""Logan's Run"" (the unwanted are send to the fire by the hypocritical regime), ""Gattaca"" (people who play the system against the system itself) and - in my modest opinion - even from the old Stallone's film ""Judge Dredd"" (there is intrigue and conflict at the top of Tetragrammaton, as there was at the top of the hierarchy of the Judges). But the cocktail doesn't work all that well.The main thing which doesn't work is the whole principle of the Tetragrammaton ideology - in fact there is no way human emotions can be supressed. There is bitter rivality amongst Tetragrammaton highest executives - which means they know jalousie and resentment. Some younger Clerics are very ambitious and will stop at nothing to get advancement - and ambition, greed and thirst for more power are also emotions. Many younger Clerics and almost all policemen admire John Preston - and this is of course an emotion. At least one Cleric viscerally hates John Presto and wants his death so he can take his place - and those are emotions too. Most Clerics and policement are loyal and devoted to Tetragrammaton because they FEEL grateful that it maintains the peace (it seems that the war which devastated this world was a real abomination), etc. etc.Then there is the general weakness of the scenario in which virtually nothing is really original (we saw it all in earlier films) and everything can be anticipated long in advance. Dialogs are weak, characters are wooden (well, OK, in this film at least they have an excuse for that). Christian Bale does what he can but with this scenario he couldn't do much. The ""bad guys"" are pathetic and the ""Underground"" is even worse. Finally, the ending has ""deus ex machina"" painted all over it...Martial arts were considered as a good part of this film but I honestly found the very concept of ""gun kata"" rather amusing - and introducing sword fights into the fight for power in a technologically very advanced society is beyond ridiculous...NON SPOILER ALERT: yes, Sean Bean gets whacked in that one - as in all his films... This is why it is not really a spoiler...)))Bottom line, this is a really not very good variation on ""Fahrenheit 451"" theme and a bad coctail made with fragments of many other films and books, most of which were much better than this thing. I am glad that I rented this one rather than buy it. Avoid!"	2.0	I have no choice but remand this film to the Grammaton Garbage Can for processing...	2014-01-14	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2W23NRD5MF0EW	Mantaray	I've never heard of this movie before until I accidentally read someone's review on another movie. He was wondering why movies like Equilibrium did not get any attention which it deserved. I could not resist my curiosity and thus I rented it right away. What a pleasant surprise! Even if the cover looked like a typical B-class movie, the movie itself was a real deal. Equilibrium is so original and it was not a rip-off of anything as there are some reviews comparing this to the Matrix. I am not saying Equilibrium is better or worse than the Matrix. They are absolutely two different movies and each of them has its own strength as well as weakness.Although I should say that all those gunfight scenes are not the best I've ever seen, they are very impressive and well executed. I guess in the near future we will see some 'Equilibrium-clone' movies imitating 'Gun-Kata'.The plot and script are not the first-class but are bearable. The movie delivered its purposes and intentions well, and the character development is convincing and reasonable.Nevertheless, I can tell you that the acting in this movie was a real killer, totally unexpected. Christian Bale was perfect for his role. I've never seen acting like that in such low-budget, non-theatrical-released movie (well, I read that it was showed at some selected theatres for few weeks).'Euilibrium' is one of the most underrated movies ever, and it deserves your attention. I really would like to see a sequel with enough budget and better storyline.	5.0	Real Sleeper!	2004-02-08	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2X9AXCWH4MT4I	"Marcy G. ""MarcyG"""	I went into this not expecting much from the movie. I was drawn to it because I like Christian Bale and Sean Bean and I do enjoy films like &quot;The Matrix.&quot;This film is actually surprisingly fun! If you are a fan of &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies then you will definitely enjoy the cool effects and action sequences.  Having read George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; in college, it is easy to recognize the dominant theme of this idealized society based on the 'big brother is watching you' theory. But all this aside, i enjoyed it because of the  fantastic cast, impressive action sequences and involving plot.  Christian Bale shines as the main hero, John Preston,  and Taye Diggs as his ambitious partner. Sadly, Sean Bean has a minor albeit vital role as Preston's former partner, Partridge.  John Preston in this film is like Neo Anderson is to &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  Both characters have impressive physical prowess and convictions but they must go through a journey of self-discovery along the way.  As such, the final 'showdown' in Equilibrium is an exciting and thrilling ride.All that aside, I highly recommend this film to sci-fi fans everywhere.  It didn't smash any records in the box office but it finally is getting the attention it deserves on DVD. People are discovering this addicting and enjoyable film and I'm glad to have discovered it myself.  In fact, after renting this film at my local video store, I turned around and bought a copy for myself!	5.0	Fantastic sci-fi/action film! Highly recommended.	2003-09-27	3	3	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2RPJ90WE5DT8S	"Margaret Schmitt ""Brooke Schmitt"""	I thought the movie was pretty good. The comparison to 1984 was pretty strong although I enjoyed 1984 better. I thought the plot was interesting, but the story line was weak. I liked how they tried to spin off of 1984 with taking away people's emotions, but that seemed pretty ridiculous to me to take away emotions and feelings. I thought the romance they tried to include was weak, and if they could have created a stronger relationship or more details with that then it could have made for a more interesting story. I was not a fan of the violence, and how they killed the puppies. That to me was unnecessary and just too much detail. I liked how they tried to show how the society tried to be uniform. With that uniform society there is obviously going to be someone who tries to go against it. I thought it was weird that they had to inject themselves with medicine every day like they had no self control.

But the script is full of holes. It's a highly surveilled society, except half the time when it doesn't fit the plot being forced through. Characters who are supposed to epitomize lack of emotion are frequently smiling and laughing or pounding fists and yelling. So those aren't emotions? Why are they not executed on the spot?

What it is is a fairly clunky mash-up of ""Brave New World"", ""1984"" (or it's precursor, ""We""), ""Total Recall"" and especially ""Fahrenheit 451"". For a while, despite cheaper than we've come to expect from this kind of movie production values, it's not bad. Bale is good -- better than ""Batman"" -- as are Emily Watson and Sean Bean in what amount to walk-ons. The gun kata is novel. But the direction is indifferent, the pacing and narrative flow problematic, and the second act feels like it's going in circles. Despite a few twists, by the end the dystopian cliches pile up like the body count.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	"Usually when a film is released that borrows its theme, plot, and special effects from others, I tend to degrade its quality even before I view it.  However, in the case of EQUILIBRIUM, director Kurt Wimmer gives us a film that may have begun in familiar territory, but soon enough stakes out its own original niche.  In FAHRENHEIT 451, a fireman who burns books soon enough turns to reading them.  In THE MATRIX, spectacular aerial dueling scenes punctuate a tale of a future, dystopic society.  In 1984, a figurehead Big Brother is the symbol by which the Inner Party rules society.  In EQUILIBRIUM, all three motifes combine to produce an engrossing film that suggests our society is not all that far from the one pictured here.Christian Bale is John Preston, a policeman called a ""Cleric"", one whose job it is to ensure that all of society is rendered unemotional via daily injections of a drug that sounds suspiciously like our own Prozac.  The opening credits tell us that after World War III, the surviving political states decided that hyperemotion was to blame for the widespread nuclear destruction.  Thus was born the need for the Clerics, a martial arts trained political police force whose function was to track down and eliminate all those who refused this drug.  At this point, a number of subtexts arise, enough in any case to suggest an allegory that has meaning for us.  To begin with, director Wimmer implies that the forced repression of emotion, while eliminating the negative excesses of that emotion--like war and street crime--nevertheless have unintended consequences.  Unlike Spock's planet Vulcan, where a similar de-emotionalizing goes on, in this society, such a repression of all emotion leads invariably to a concommitant repression of civil rights.  All sense criminals are killed upon capture without recourse to a trial, a point not lost upon Cleric Preston, who complains of much the same thing to his superiors.  As Preston gradually learns that his support of his superior, called the ""Father"" is based on the false belief that the nonemotional ends justify a similar nonemotional means, he begins to associate psychologically with the very people he is sworn to apprehend.  His conversion proceeds slowly, beginning with his killing of his own Cleric partner who has already been infected with the lure of emotions.  Several reviewers have complained of what they see as a maudlin scene of emotional growth when Preston risks his life merely to save a cute puppy dog from extinction.  Yet, such seeming trivial scenes of conversion are need to establish a coherent and convincing segue of a man from emotionless killer to one who now feels such a wide range of emotions that he finds it impossible to hide them.  Part of the joy of this film is the plot twists that evolve into a cat and dog game in which both cat and dog exchange places more than once.  True, there are logical lapses, such as having an untaped police interrogation or not having a 1984-style ubiquitous television camera in every home.  Yet, these lapses do not do more than intrude for the moment.  The incredible ""Gun-Kata"" fight scenes between a Cleric like Preston and untrained police officers have to be seen to be believed.  There is also the surprisingly effective acting of Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, both of whom provide the evil counterpoint to the emotional growth of Cleric Preston.EQUILIBRIUM promises to be an untrumpeted current day version of BLADE RUNNER, a similar dystopic future vision.  I cannot recall that EQUILIBRIUM was released to theaters to any great extent.  But after having seen the video, I can see that in this nightmare version of a future prozac state, the ability to remain human is far more than a function of computerized actions.  What is further required is the profound contemplation of all actions that are forced upon one by a Father who is paternal only in the visual sense.  Cleric Preston learns this by the closing credits.  So must we."	5.0	Equilibrium: Derivative Does Not Mean Inferior	2003-08-06	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A8TZ88OM8YOLW	MartyHansen	"This movie -- set in the future -- starts off by recapping recent history.  The planet has just undergone its Third World War, and it resolves to avoid a Fourth.  This is accomplished by abolishing all human emotions - and thus all individuality - to eliminate the passions which lead to unavoidable conflict.  The world is angular and masculine and devoid of most color - where even the women dress like men.  The buildings look like Nazi temples.  And the rules are enforced by the Grammaton Clerics, who wear only tunics of black.  So if the movie looks a little like the Matrix. And if Christen Bale (as John Preston), the lead cleric, bears an uncanny resemblance to Keanu Reeves (which he does), then the similarity, I'm sure -- is purely intentional!The population takes a drug to entirely suppress their emotions.  Adults - and children - are free to report anyone for extermination who shows any amount of feeling.  Preston's partner succumbs to emotion early and Preston does the honors.  The tables are soon turned, however, when Preston himself foregoes his daily dose, and he becomes overwhelmed by the beauty of the world that he now ""senses"" once the effects of the drugs begin to diminish.  He discovers the emotional richness of the world's past; the books, the paintings, the passages of music - and a woman, Emily Watson, who captures his heart -- to make his anguish complete.The story is taut and well told.  And it builds to a climactic finish..  Preston joins the underground to help overthrow the world that the clerics are assigned to enforce.  Along the way, we are treated to some of the most beautifully choreographed hand-to-hand pistol combat I've ever seen.  The clerics also have this cool way of jumping into a group of six men - arranged around them like pockets in a billiard table - and then taking each one of the out, without ever changing their stance, by shooting and wrapping their arms around their heads as if they were doing yoga.It isn't until the end that we finally see the special up-their-sleeve speed loaders or the bulbous high capacity magazines that the cleric use with their automatic pistols -- that allows them to lay down a more blistering rate of fire than the multiple machine guns arrayed against them.Even Preston's young son, a miniature Nazi himself, provides one of the nicest twists towards the story's conclusion as Preston proceeds towards his irrevocable goal - to set in motion events that will eventually destroy the current world order and restore the sanctity of human existence.The movie starts off like a Matrix wannabe, but finishes by delivering some of the most exciting exhibitions of action, artistry - and emotion - I've ever seen displayed together in a pseudo sci-fi flick!  This is a film I highly recommend.  Don't miss it!"	5.0	A Very Cool Ride!	2003-10-19	3	3	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2PZ2IO5V7JNOF	"Mary K. Thompson ""Book Lover"""	"Like so many who have reviewed this movie here, I found this movie quite by accident, having heard virtually nothing about it.  After the first viewing I have watched it at least 10 times.  I know that may sound excessive, and obsessive, but I feel this is perhaps one of the best science fiction movies ever made.  I believe Christian Bale's performance is perhaps one of the all time best cinematic portrayals I have ever encountered.  Wimmer (despite his whining directorial commentary which focused on his budget and what didn't get done rather than what did, and which can be chosen on the DVD) has transcended the typical dystopian epic by focusing on the evolution of Cleric John Preston's emergence from the sleep of his drugged existence into the life of a fully realized human being.  The premise is unique.  No one pushed Preston into giving up the drug - serendipity (or was it a Freudian accident?) resulted in the destruction of his ""morning interval"" followed by his first transgression - failure to reveal to his new partner that he has not replaced his dose.  He compounds that transgression be disposing of the next day's dose while walking up a crowded staircase.  We watch as four days go by and we see him emerge from the fog of Prozium.  We feel with him as he experiences a cascade of new sensations.  True to his former partner's prediction, he does indeed dream, and his dreams haunt him.  He's dumbstruck when he watches the beauty of a sun rise.  He weeps the first time he hears music.  He holds back a volume of Mother Goose from a Nether raid.  He cringes as he holds a dying man, watches the light go out in his eyes and feels his blood on his hands.  He rescues an orphaned pup, then kills ""sweepers"" to protect it and himself.  He opens his heart to a woman doomed to die, and remembers how he stood by in drugged numbness when his wife, Viviana, was executed as a sense offender.  He vainly attempts to rescue a group of rebels.  He steals into his sleeping children's bedroom at night to sit by them.  He smiles with love and pride when he learns his children, Robbie and Lisa, have been off the dose since their mother was incinerated.  He locates the Underground and becomes their ""champion"".  This is a truly masterful performance by a superb actor, with a great supporting cast.  The gun kata scenes are as well choreographed as a ballet.  Casting was superb, location, sets and lighting were outstanding, music was fabulous.  I feel it important to emphasize that I am not a kid who is simply thrilled by the violent gun kata scenes.  I am a 61 year old woman who was deeply moved by Bale's riveting performance.  This is far more than a simple action flick.  This exceptional movie speaks to the heart."	5.0	Riveting.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A16X7GKCK83WUE	"Matthew Bratkowski ""mattster"""	Equilibrium takes place in a dystopian future.  Usually when a story takes place in this type of setting, each work presents a unique view of what will happen to society in the near future.  This was not the case with the Equilibrium.  Almost all of the themes of this movie are ripped from defining work of futuristic literature.In the movie, 'sense' offenders--those who posses individual qualities--are arrested and have their personal belongings burned.  Does this sound like Farenheit 451 to anyone else?The clerics--the sensory police that arrest sense offenders--are all too akin to the firemen in Farenheit, and also resemble the thought police in 1984.  The citizens in the movie also follow a ubiquous leader known only as 'the father' who is blantly a photocopy of '84's Big Brother.Since the setting of this movie is already hacked, it is only fitting that the plot itself be as unoriginal.  The main character follows a similar route as Guy Montog (F. 451) or Wilson Smith (1984) by originally being an intergal part of the society's structure, but then rebelling against his previous beliefs.  The ending is a little different, but leaves many loose ends that cannot be tied up by the fledgering plot.Another drawback to this movie is its much too constant depiction of violence.  The fight scenes really aren't that great.  I'm not sure when this movie was released, but the hyper-active martial arts styles that the characters use, and some key fight scenes in the movie are almost INDENTICAL to those in the Matrix, which would give another reason (as if it needed one) of why this movie is so terribly trite.This movie can be appreciated by those would haven't already read great classic dystopian literature.  However, for the many of us who have, it presents almost nothing new.  Ultimately, the movie steals from much better works of literature and inserts their themese in a more visually appealing but much less thought provoking medium.  My suggestion is to just read the books instead.	2.0	Not a horrible movie, but almost a complete copy	2003-10-24	12	5	7

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3OGMDFM045MQ7	Matthew Farrell	"I can easily see why people either love or loathe this one. Personally, it had aspects I enjoyed, as well as aspects that annoyed me, hence my middle of the road rating. In all honesty, the more I thought about it, the less I liked it, but you could also argue that the fact the film made me think about it at all after watching is a good thing...On the plus side, there's some decent cinemetography, and sets were great. I especially liked the forced juxtaposition of drab, monotonous sets with brightly colored ones, which was especially effective in underscoring the film's theme.As for the negative: the plot was painfully predictable -- especially if you even have a passing familiarity with 1984, Brave New World, etc. I called all but one plot point within the first 20 minutes. The script/dialogue was also hum-drum with little ""good"" dialogue, though the case could be made for that being intentional given the forced-emotionless milieu.I would also consider the fight sequences to be a negative, though they actually deserve their own paragraph. Although I can see how they would be a big appeal of the film -- admittedly they were well done/choreographed within their context -- but in all honesty, I found them out of place. Having super-human moves like these make sense only within context: similar effects in The Matrix or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon are okay because those are by definition other-worldly (a computer sim and a fantasy setting, respectively.) That is brazenly NOT the case with Equilibrium, and we are supposed to believe that someone can dodge bullets simply because of a little study on the subject. Sorry, but that's just too much suspension of disbelief for me, especially since this film otherwise purports to be grounded in ""reality.""If you like films that are just fight-fests and don't really care about ""plot"" except as a contrived means to get you from one battle to the next, then this film will *probably* appeal to you... though it probably has too much ""plot"" and not enough ""action"" for your tastes. Personally, I like to see people using their wits (rather than their fists) to get out of sticky situations, so if you fall into a similar category, skip it. At the very least, go into it expecting a relatively brainless popcorn flick."	3.0	equilibrium indeed: the good & the bad aspects cancel each other out	2008-04-20	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	The distributor for &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533;, a modestly budgeted sci-fi thriller, had so little faith in it that it placed the film in just a few theaters in December, then let it die. One reason may be the title itself. In restaurants, some people are afraid to order a dish they can&#65533;t pronounce. These same people tend to avoid movies whose titles they can&#65533;t spell, pronounce and/or understand. Beyond that, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Two other recent thrillers &#65533; &#65533;AI: Artificial Intelligence&#65533; and &#65533;Minority Report&#65533; &#65533; had already painted much richer and more elaborate portraits of life in the future. Finally, unlike other small sci-fi flicks like &#65533;Gattaca&#65533;, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; unwisely uses too much energy on special effects and not enough on the story, which might have been interesting if it hadn&#65533;t been overwhelmed.In this vision of the future, a third world war has resulted in a totalitarian society where all material things which cause people to feel emotion have been banned. People are also medicated daily to prevent them from feeling the anger and frustration which the government claims leads to war. Anyone who resists is dealt with immediately and harshly. Large SWAT teams swoop down on groups of resistors every day. In other words, this is a society that is continuously at war with war.This plot concept, which isn&#65533;t wholly original, could have proved fascinating, but it is clumsily handled and full of holes. The highlight is  Christian Bale&#65533;s carefully orchestrated performance as Cleric John Preston, a high ranking member of the group responsible for enforcing the regime&#65533;s draconian measures. Preston, at first a totally unemotional man, ultimately sees the absurdity of his job and becomes a member of the resistance.While not a noteworthy film, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; should provide many sci-fi fans with an enjoyable evening. It certainly isn&#65533;t the worst movie of it type, but it could have been so much more.	3.0	Style over substance mars this particular sci-fi film	2003-05-17	3	2	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1RHA90PCUDMG8	"Matthew R. Reynolds ""mister_r_"""	While this movie got hardly any support or promotion (only reason I heard of it was through a review at Entertainment Weekly when it came out on DVD) I was pleasantly surprised and pleased that I picked this up to rent.  I honestly don't know why it didn't get promoted more and why it didn't at least have any kind of word of mouth out on the street.  Christian Bale turns in another outstanding performance like he did in American Psycho.  Whether you liked American Psycho or not, you have to admit his performance was top notch in that movie.  Personally I liked it and I liked this movie.  I think Bale has the &quot;stonefaced/unemotional&quot; act down to a science, but showed off that he has greater range than just that in his arsenal.  The supporting cast was good in this movie and the action when shown was fast, furious, and very exciting.  Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a very solid entertaining film with a good message.  The action/drama/acting is all good and is definitely worth viewing!	4.0	Another Great Performance By Bale	2003-07-14	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3JJJ4H5HX99YH	Matt W	"Many people may find the often slow pace of Equilibrium to be a bit tedious, but I find it to strike a good balance between the silly over the top action of the Matrix and the almost painfully slow drama of THX 1138, both films in the same vein.Of course, this draws from Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, 1984, Metropolis and countless other repressive future society stories, but it is done so with aplomb.  Christian Bale's performance in this movie is downright incredible.  He should have played Neo in the Matrix as he is a FAR better actor than Keanu Reeves.  In fact, almost all of the acting in Equilibrium is well done.  Taye Diggs plays his role very well, even flashing his teeth in emotionless fake smiles.If the story does not move you, the action will.  Not only is the action superbly original and more realistic than the fly by wire act of the Matrix (more on this in a minute), but the actors performed their own stunts and had to memorize the fight scenes (watch the documentary), which certainly made their roles physically demanding.Many have argued that the ""gun-kata"" is silly and unrealistic, and they do have a point.  But, such study is not totally from the real of realism.  Anyone who has studied Japanese sword fighting learns that in order for many people to attack one person, they must be organized or else all they can do is mob him.  But the man alone does not have such constraints.  Add to this fact that guns create crossfire (you might shoot your comrades) and the ""gun-kata"" might even be plausible.  This combination of ideas make it unique and an interesting study in fighting.  Of course, no one can hold a candle to John Preston in the ""gun-kata"", but that adds to the fun!All in all, it is a highly enjoyable film, offering fresh insights into one of the most classic genres."	5.0	High Quality Acting	2003-05-30	16	14	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ASABAV2FSGSEG	mbflagg	It is easy to see that this movie is low budget and that many of the ideas were borrowed.  However, the message put forth and the quality of action are astounding.  Personally I think the action sequences are a step up from the Matrix Reloaded because I'm not one for CGI.  This is the real deal.  The gun kata is an amazing concept.  For anyone who has taken martial arts, they know a kata is an organized series of forms that could be used in a multiple attacker situation.  The fact that guns are used in this type of form and you still remaining in a stationary position, you just have to see it.  Then with the story, well, its a bit slow.  The message is there though right in your face.  This is definately a movie that will make you think and due to the low budget, a cult classic for this genre.	5.0	Excellent!	2003-07-03	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F	mdizzog	Equilibrium isn't perfect by far, but it definetly will entertain you at times.Certain parts of the movie are wonderful. The fight scenes are awesome. The gun parts are cool, but there are also sword scenes. Although there aren't as much of those as guns, they are awesome. Christian Bale does a good job, as usual. Taye Diggs is perfect.Now for the bad. Certain parts of the movie are real slow. It seems like the beginning of the movie isn't that inspired. As the movie progresses it gets better, but the beginning just doesn't have that much substance. Certain parts throughout the movie are slow as well, such as the scenes with Emily Watson. I think most would agree that although many of the characters don't show emotion(that's part of the plot), only certain people can pull it off and still seem captivating. Emily Watson just seems too lifeless, and she formed a bond with Christian Bale that feels uninspired every time I watch the film. I think they could of made a reason for their love, but instead she just seems like a way to tack on a romance to a film that doesnn't need one.This film is really good at times, but it could have been done better. Still, I would reccomend any fan of the Matrix or the book 1984 to watch it.	5.0	Good Film	2005-07-12	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ASYDZRSFCBHYE	"M. D Sadowsky ""Child of the 80s"""	OK - Folks, this is a flick primarily for those that love the genre.  No, its not 'The Matrix'; its not 'Minority Report' (both heavily overrated - sorry).  It is in fact a surprisingly entertaining dark vision of an alternate future.  Please note! Director Kurt Wimmer open admits that he is not paying homage, but in fact ripping off 'Brazil'; 'Fahrenheit 451'; '1984' and so forth.  In fact, considering the measly budget the action sequences are pretty amazing.  Rather than using familiar CG effects, the director is forced to utilize quick cuts, strange camera angles, and lighting techniques - which works quite well.Thus, without the safety net of special effects, the film must rely on the characters. In fact, many of the action sequences are reminiscent to 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' (What?)  Indeed.  One should ALWAYS be leery of straight-to-DVD releases (apparently the budget was covered in overseas box office results and advertising and theater releases in the US would have cut a loss).  But, this is a small gem.  It was not filmed in Prague (like most films are nowadays, 'XXX' 'Hellboy') but in 'East' Germany.  Thus, the vestigial remnants of communism in the architecture really lends itself well to the overall mood and tone of the film.  I suspect with Christian Bale starring in 'The Machinist' and the upcoming 'Batman' films due out soon -'Equilibrium' will become a staple on cable in the near future.	4.0	If You're Awake At 3 am ...	2004-08-23	2	2	0

Other than that, felt like an imitation, an attempt to cash in on the Matrix idea and action. Especially cheap attempt at a double twist in the story. Like ""yes, I'm really an agent for the other side, fooled you, haha, then later, just kidding, really was just trying to fool you, I'm not working for the other side, then hey, sorry changed my mind again, just trying artificially to create some plot turns."" And what about the helmets? Really, people? They couldn't come up with better police uniforms? Just seemed cheap to me. And it's not just about the action. Every word that was said by characters in the Matrix has meaning. If you haven't caught that, watch the Matrix a few more times. This movie doesn't have that depth or dimensions. I expected much more and was pretty disappointed.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2OIG88PG8K4M3	"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado"""	"Yes, the film is a blatant reworking of aspects of Orwell's '1984' and Huxley's 'Brave New World.' However, this does not make it a bad film; it has no spectacular goals, but it achieves what it sets out to do nicely.The story is set in the not-too-distant future, the late 21st century, sometime after the Third World War. The world's leaders, or at least the enigmatic leader of a nation called Libria, have decided that the best way to rule out such catastrophic violence happening again is to eliminate all human emotion. They do this by heavily medicating the entire population on doses of a drug called Prozium. The name bears more than a passing resemblance to certain very popular drugs of our own day, but this is how ""Equilibrium"" works: by suggesting things rather than outright saying them. The underlying ideas of this film are rather deep for this sort of action/sci-fi flick: that freedom of thought is dangerous to regimes, that individualism is the greatest threat to totalitarianism, that thinking or feeling too much is the most dangerous enemy of a government.These ideas are certainly an undercurrent in the film, but ""Equilibrium"" is by no means a deep, strictly philosophical movie; it is very content to be a fast-paced action flick, and is quite successful at it too. It reworks material that's been seen before, to be sure, but it does so nicely, in a slick, fast-moving package, marrying action with thought to keep both sorts of audiences happy.To keep the drug-induced peace, as well as hunt down ""Sense Offenders"" (those who refuse the drugs and engage in feeling, thinking, and otherwise enjoying themselves), the government of Libria - run by the nearly-omnipotent and highly Orwellian figure known only as ""Father"" - employs what are known as Tetragrammaton Clerics, who are highly trained in martial arts and psychology, dress in long black coats, and kill without compunction.The principal Cleric, and the most talented, is John Preston, played with fierce inscrutable perfection by Christian Bale, who seems to specialize in off-beat characters who distance themselves from humanity. He does it nowhere better than here: he keeps his features dispassionately cool even as he suggests a growing madness behind his dark eyes. Director Kurt Wimmer says he didn't think of offering the role to anyone but Christian Bale: watching him perform, there is no question as to why. Here Bale's dark good looks and intense manner are menacingly appropriate to his character; in his first scene, we see him surf into a completely darkened room on the door that he just kicked from its hinges, firing off several dozen shots with what turns out to be lethal accuracy. This is an exhilarating sequence, the first of many.Sean Bean plays his first partner, Cleric Errol Partridge; he is only in the film for 15 minutes or so, but he brings a quiet kind of poetry to Partridge that is most impressive. The two soon have a lethal falling-out when Preston discovers that Partridge has become a Sense Offender. Soon, of course, the inevitable happens: Preston misses his morning interval of Prozium and begins to feel. At first he is understandably apprehensive about this; he is, after all, the head Cleric, under a mandate to murder - ahem, ""summarily combust"" or otherwise eliminate - anyone who feels. He is very good at this job; indeed, he let his own wife be arrested and killed for Sense Offending. (This is one of the most perplexing bits of the story: given his extraordinarily cold demeanour, it is understandable that she might be driven to such things, but he is also extremely adept at sensing when other people feel...how is it that he never suspected her, especially as sex is clearly not outlawed in Libria?)He intends to reinstate his dosage as soon as possible but finds reasons not to...soon enough, of course, he finds he cannot help himself, and willingly begins to dispose of his drugs without taking them. His new partner, Brandt, played with slick menace by Taye Diggs, is very like Preston, clever and adept at knowing what people are thinking and when they are feeling. He wears an almost permanent grin, flashing blinding white teeth and eyes that sparkle with an ominous glint that makes one wonder what he knows and what he plans to do with it. He is absolutely a match for Preston. All this leads invariably to complications, but to say more would be to reveal more of the plot than I should.The scenes where Preston revels in his new-found emotions are extremely well-done, particularly one in the old cellar of an abandoned house that contains relics of the past that it is his duty as a Cleric to destroy. He discovers an old LP of Beethoven and plays it; it is most likely the first time Preston has ever heard music in his life, and Bale's face is an absolute marvel as he reacts to the passionate strings and brass of the 9th Symphony, a mixture of elation and despair, joy and heartbrokenness and surprise all at once.The visual design of this picture is really fabulous. It is shot primarily in shades of steel-grey, white, and black, providing an altogether drearily futuristic feel. This is particularly effective when shots of color are introduced, such as a symbolic red ribbon or a rainbow seen through a window; surrounded by such  unrelenting colorlessness, they gain far more intensity. Lines are smooth, sleek, hyper-modern. The ""new,"" government-sanctioned buildings are large, monolithic cement structures with an almost obnoxious lack of personality.The style of the film has been compared to just about every martial arts/sci-fi flick made in recent memory, particularly to ""The Matrix."" This is largely due to the fight scenes, which are long, choreographed martial arts sequences similar to those found elsewhere. If you're looking for an ""original"" martial-arts picture you won't find it here; the only new thing introduced really is the ""gun-kata,"" a form of martial arts using guns. However, I find ""Equilibrium"" immensely more satisfying than ""The Matrix"", largely due to the strong performances of the cast and the far smarter dialogue. The philosophy is actually meaningful in ""Equilibrium,"" although it is pop-philosophy to be sure. Still, it is intriguing, and richly ironic in places, particularly the idea that the only murderers left are those who are government-sanctioned; the only people who kill now are those determined to keep anyone else from killing. In perhaps the greatest irony in the film, the Clerics are asked to ""put their faith"" in Father, though faith would be a feeling and should therefore be outlawed; they do the Will of the Father based on their faith in him, which sounds very much more like a religion than a government.""Equilibrium"" is not a particularly deep-thinking film, but it is certainly more thoughtful than much of what passes as philosophy nowadays. More than that, though, it is purely entertaining, with fast-paced gunfights, slick swordfights, a funky soundtrack, and an utterly exhilarating climax that will take your breath away. Bale is an absolute pleasure to watch. It is disappointing this film never got a wider release in the States - I watched in dismay as release date after release date got pushed away, perhaps out of fear that the American public at large wasn't ready for such a film - but if you can get it on DVD, by all means see it. It is entertaining, but also thought-provoking; a rare and enjoyable combination in films today."	4.0	1984 Light	2005-07-17	3	2	1

In order to eradicate all emotion in the population, drugs are administered daily to wipe out all feelings. When Preston doesn't take his dosage one morning, his entire world is upheaved as he experiences for the first time the feelings and emotions of the world around him.With some truly stunning fight scenes that rival movies like the Matrix and the Transporter, prepared to be awed as this movie runs it course, ultimately leaving you thirsting for more.	5.0	This movie kicks butt!!	2003-10-22	0	0	0

All things that stir emotions, literature, art, music, color are banned and those who are caught not taking their medication or collecting emotional paraphernalia pay for it with their lives. But there is an underground movement willing to risk it.One day John (Christian Bale) breaks a vile of his medication and ends up not replacing the daily dosage. This leads to another day, and another day until finally he's hiding his dosages and killing his teammates to protect ""sensors"" (people who've stopped taking their medication and are feeling again) and lost puppies.It sounds a little hokey but it is an awesome movie. Beautifully shot action scenes as well as dramatic scenes. The child who plays John's son is perfect as the emotionless child willing to turn in friend or family. The film does have reminders of other movies but it really doesn't take anything away from this film.It was nice to see guest appearances by Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), William Fichtner (Prison Break), Taye Diggs (Private Practice) and Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love).This is going to be one of repeat viewing movies and is a must see film for any futurists or Christian Bale fans."	5.0	Fantastic - Worth Seeing More than Once	2007-12-10	3	2	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	Kurt Wimmer's stark, violent cautionary tale is set after WWIII.  Citizens are being controlled by a drug which stifles their emotions.  The government feels that without emotions, there will be no wars, no murders; they think emotions are a handicap, and they use clerics to uphold the law.  Anyone showing emotion is either killed on the spot or incinerated later.  No trials, nothing.  Of course, this means all things like literature, music, etc., are banned.Christian Bale stars as the highest ranking &quot;Cleric&quot;, who enforces the law dictated by Father (Sean Pertwee).  Early in the film, Bale's partner (Sean Bean) shows evidence of having feelings, and when Bales finds him reading the poetry of Yeats, he is forced to kill him.His new partner (an appropriately sniveling Taye Diggs) is excited to work with Bales, but at the same time he is more in mind.  Angus McFayden plays the chief of council, whose agenda is also more than meets the eye.Bales finally decides to stop taking the daily drug doseages and is rewarded with feelings----and a threat to his life and career.The battle sequences are awesome in their fluidity and imagination.  Bales and Emily Watson as doomed Mary O'Brien, are particularly good, and the movie is quite original in its take of Fahrenheit 451.Gloomy yet impressive.	5.0	HOW DO YOU FEEL?	2004-05-31	6	4	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A132BDNBHFCXIB	Michael	"Just watched it. It's a really good movie IMO and very similar to V for Vendetta. In both movies, the system is overthrown by the achievements of one skilled man (of course with help from other characters and lucky circumstances). While V remains in the underground, main character Cleric John Preston is a government official. By first accidentally and later intentionally leaving out his daily dose of sedative drugs (which all of the population has to take), his ""awakening"" is initiated. Because of his innate ability to feel and the newly gained ability to see the cruelties of the militant, killing regime, he receives one shock after the other, but quickly learns to develop a strategic enclosure to keep his position and save his life. He meets other people in the resistance movement that play this strategic game too.With some unexpected turnarounds, the movie is thrilling until the very end. The actors are perfectly suited for the main characters: Cleric Preston (Christian Bale) as a man of conscience and the vice-chancellor as perfect psychopath, who says in one of the last scenes (paraphrasing), ""don't take away my dreams.""So, the movie is worth the money -- at least, that is -- because it presents a handy metaphor for the process of awakening, seeing, receiving shocks, building of a strategic enclosure and ""acting for one's destiny"", regardless of the difficulties. The shock for the audience of the movie is to see how our reality is slowly turned into that presented in Equilibrium...Get it and spread it around!"	5.0	Get it and spread it around!	2007-12-21	4	2	2

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3IMBK2MHGUVA0	Michael Hooper	I loved this movie. I think this movie and it's star (soon to be Batman - Christian Bale) are highly underated. It didn't do so well in the box office, probably because of poor marketing (I only saw one commercial for it prior to it's release and never even new when it came out. I would have never seen it if I hadn't come across it in the video store). Pay no attention to the review above in which Pavel Simsa complains that there is not enough realism in this movie. Sure, there are some unrealistic scenes in the movie, but hey, I've got a news flash for you Pavel - IT'S ONLY A MOVIE! and a SCI/FI movie at that. Sci/Fi movies are supposed to be unrealistic. If you want realism, go rent Steel Magnolias or something. So relax and enjoy. Bottom line - If you liked The Matrix, and you're not one of these people who sits there through the whole movie picking it apart saying &quot;That would never happen&quot;, you'll love this movie. Lots of action, a good storyline, and a great cast. I've added it to my DVD collection and once you've watched it, I'm sure you'll do the same. Pay no attention to the editorial above either.

Sure The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions did not blow the audience or myself away, but you cannot deny the first one did.  With that said, I would put Equilibrium up there on the list along with the Matrix.  Sure we hear the ol' comparison to The Matrix and that it is/not a ripoff.  It's very subjective.  Yes, it is very similar to each other in terms of plot, but the choreography and makeup of the movie is entirely different.Equilibrium is based more on a reality based level than the Matrix.  Opposed to the Matrix, Equilibrium does not bend the laws of physics as much and brings the fight sequences more down to earth and realism.  The shooting scenes or terrific.  The swift choreography of the gun fight sequences were totally amazing, I was actually quite amazed given that I was such a biased Matrix fanatic.The one negative thing I did not like about this movie is the ending.  Because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched it, I just end this review by saying that the movie was great, but the conclusion left me wanting for more in terms of a ""Ending off with a BANG.""

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L	Michael Valdivielso	Equilibrium is a movie that, let me say, I love.  I happen to be a fan of dark futures in science fiction, either on the printed page or on the big screen.  The fact that ideas and emotions are dangerous to men is nothing new.  The fact that this movie took an almost Buddhism goal, to control feelings, to the point where this future society is out to destroy those who feel emotions is, in itself, fascinating.  The balance between plot and characters, between action and story, is almost perfect.  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and even Sean Bean are all great in the parts they were given.  I can't see any other actors doing those characters.  The commentaries, one by the director and one by both the director and the producer, really are interesting.  Beginning film makers would more likely get more out of the commentaries than I did.The idea that by destroying emotions you could better the world is, once again, not new.  In WE the Benefactor's goal, with the help of the Office of Guardians, was to destroy feelings and replace it with Reason (people didn't even have names).  To control emotions with drugs and brainwashing, such as in Brave New World and 1984 with its idea of Hate Crime and Thought Police, is well used in many films and books.  Burning the books, artwork, toys and music comes right out of Fahrenheit 451.  Even in Fahrenheit 451 there is many forms of brainwashing.But this movie is not trying to steal from these sources.  Any more than the reason for writing 1984 was to steal from WE (which is did).  The movie's goal was to tell us how important being HUMAN is.  Some people might say that idea is old yet we still don't seem to understand the need for staying human.  The warning will always need to be there.  And with such a delivery system as this film it can't fail to be passed on to the viewers.	5.0	Feelings count.	2006-07-23	4	4	0

Although it tried to tackle a difficult subject, I felt the plot was weak. &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; and Ayn Rand's &#34;Anthem&#34; (both books, I know) dealt with this in a much clearer fashion.Our protagonist, a stone-cold killer, misses one dose of his medication and suddenly slides down a path against his establishment, reading and listening to classical music. It was too far of a reach for me. I think Christian Bale played a believable bad-guy in the beginning, but I was lost after his transformation.I added an extra star for some interesting action sequences which will appeal to some watchers.

I thought it was unique calling the futuristic police in this movie clerics and the government forces everyone to take a emotion supressing drug. This means, no emotions.Christian Bale was pretty good, and even though the stunts looked a lot like The Matrix, I liked it. The movie moved at a quick pace. If you watch the movie for the first time and you are trying to soak it in, wait a few days then watch it again. If you are questioning the movie as you watch it for the first time, you're going to get lost. Anyway, the ending was pretty good and I will admit I was a little disapointed mainly because I was so intrigued at the end that I wish it went further and didn't end with Preston's son smiling after the ""big explosion"".

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A25LSNKTK8W9O3	Mike Renzulli	This move takes place in a post-World War III society (named Libria) where feelings and emotions are prohibited by law and its citizens are kept under control by state mandated drug use. John Preston (Christian Bale) is Libria's top enforcer and is ruthless in his enforcement of Libria's code of personal conduct until one day he forgets to take his required drug dosage. Preston then develops feelings for a woman he arrests as well as begins to appreciate the arts, crafts and books that he had no regard for as a Librian official and then joins Libria's resistance. The action is almost non stop throughout the film while it addresses many philisophical issues as well regarding personal freedom and tolerance which have been seen and addressed in other movies before. This film has elements from movies like &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;THX-1138&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and packs a whallop action-wise.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2AR0DF135Q5ZY	"Mike Siegfried ""aardvark"""	"OK, I read a bunch of the reviews out of curiosity, while I was at the web site to buy the movie after my daughter sat me down and made me watch it.  I am happy to see that so many reviewers liked the film.  However, even in reading the positive reviews, I am often left wondering whether we both saw the same movie.First, Equilibrium bears only a superficial resemblance to the Matrix, mostly, I suspect, because the Gun Kata sequences bear a superficial resemblance to the fight scenes in the Matrix.  However, 1) the Matrix takes place in a ""cyber-dimension"" if you will.  Neo can do extraordianry things because with the right programming anything is possible in a world where the laws of physics are just a series of zeros and ones.  The fight scenes in Equilibrium, although extraordinary, supposedly take place in the real world without time dilation or other tricks, as someone else said, without the cheat codes on.  More importantly 2) Matrix is a man against machine story more similar to Terminator (although stated vastly differently) than to the distopian universe of Equilibrium.  In Matrix, the great danger comes from outside of humanity, from the machines.  In Equilibrium, the danger is in humanity, in the struggle between the individual and the collective.  Matrix is frightening, but only like, let's say, a vampire story is frightening.  I can't bring myself to stay up nights worrying that my computer is going to turn on me, any more than I worry about werwolves.  Distopia I understand, and, yes, I fear it very much.  I doubt it will ever appear as portrayed in this film, but all the elements are there, and have appeared over and over again in the collectivist distopias of the real world, from the Soviet ""worker's state"" to the Third Reich.  A matter of degree perhaps, but not much of a stretch.  Thus, Equilibrium frightens me far, far more than the Matrix ever could, because it is possible.  More trivially, 3) the fashion statements in the two films are not the same, although they use the same color scheme.  In case nobody noticed, the clerics in Equilibrium dressed like priests.  Which is why they are called clerics and are trained in a place called the monastery.  The dictatorship in Equilibrium has obviously borrowed a lot of religious imagery from before the war.  Note that I do not believe that the use of this imagery makes this an anti-religious film.  There is nothing of christianity here except for the vestments, any more than the evil dictatorship is Khabalist because it calls itself the Tetragrammaton (which is YHWH, the unspoken name of God).  I suspect ""Father"" made use of these symbols because they still had power, and their origin has been lost by the time of the movie.  In any event, back to the point, the two movies do not remotely have the same dress code.(If it makes any difference, I like the Matrix, but found its sequels, hmm, stupid is probably the right word.  Between the first Matrix movie and Equilibrium, while the comparison is a bit like apples to oranges, I would take Equilibrium hands down.)I also do not understand the constant comparisons to 1984.  (OK, maybe I do.  They are both distopias, and they both feature a Leader (Father, Big Brother) who seems to be electronically everywhere.  So there are similarities)  However, if there is one previous distopia to which Equilibrium can justly be compared, it is Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451.  In both, the oppressor state targets specific cultural attributes and artifacts as much or more than the actual enemies of the state, believing that these objects in and of themselves are a threat.  Thus books and puppy dogs are both in danger.  More importantly, in Fahrenheit 451, and in Equilibrium, the dogs have their day.  The state is unable to eliminate the threat, and, in the end, the oppressed outlast it and survive, though in slightly different ways.  One must remember that 1984, brilliant as it was, had no remotely happy ending.  It was, to paraphrase Orwell, a boot planted on the human face, FOREVER.  That's what Orwell was warning us about, and why he is important.  1984 is a cautionary tale.  Bradbury, and Equilibrium, choose to emphasize the resiliance of the human spirit even under grinding oppression.  Despite the clerics, despite all the armed police, a resistance flourishes in the world of Equilibrium.Of course Equilibrium is like other tales in its genre.  Big deal.  There ain't much new under the sun, as Solomon might say.  I found it told in a startling, and very emotional, new way.I generally am not interested in the names of actors.  After seeing the movie, I still could not have told you it had Christian Bale and Sean Bean in it.  When I was told it did, I could look back and say, yeah, that's Boromir and that's the guy from Reign of Fire, so it must be true.  I still don't care.  Whoever they were, they did a good job.The fight scenes were impressive, but I've seen better.  They were definitely novel.  Gun and martial art deserve to be more closely related than they are always portrayed.  But martial arts sequences are only props to a film.  They can be as impressive as one likes, but without a plot I might as well go watch my son at the dojo.  In this case, I liked the plot.Or maybe that's the wrong word.  I FELT the plot, which, I suppose, makes me a Sense Offender.  I'm not even sure I can watch the thing again, because of the deep emotion it produces in me.  I would be too apt to cry in frustration or scream in rage.  That's what makes a great movie.In conclusion, I can only say that the silliest scene was when Preston shot out a whole row of computer monitors and thus managed to ""turn off"" the presence of Father and begin the revolution.  (As a computer tech, I am all too familiar with folks who think the computer is the monitor, and that box under the desk is merely the hard drive, but I didn't expect to see that in a movie.  Of course, maybe in this world they did build the brains of the box right behind the screen.  Who knows?)  The best scene was immediately thereafter when you see Preston smiling and bloody.  It is truly a s**t-eating grin.  He FELT that one, alright.  Oh, yeah.  And so did I."	5.0	Huh?  Did we watch the same movie?	2005-08-30	11	10	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3M1NNDD95HR0R	Mike Smith	This movie is set in a period where emotions are banned due to them being unpredictable and often causing unfavorable results.  What follows by banning emotions and all things that would lead to emotion is a very oppressive scenario indeed.  People are ordered to take a drug to drown out their emotions, and all objects (including music and books) that could lead to emotion are destroyed.  As I said, very oppressive.  After missing a dose of his emotion-blocking drug, Christian Bale's character sees the light, both literally and figuratively.  What follows is a suspenseful action-packed plot, and ultimately a good ending.  Glad our government is not like that.	5.0	Drama AND Action!	2006-09-20	7	6	1

Skeptical, I began to casually watch it as I did some work. After about five minutes, I left my work on the desk and became totally immersed in the movie. Christian Bale sells the story as Cleric John Preson, a futuristic law enforcer who ends up missing his dose of Prozium, a drug that deadens emotion. Once he begins to feel, he chooses to fight back against the government to liberate the people. Director Kurt Wimmer is probably better known now for the awful ""Ultraviolet.""

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"After World War III nearly destroys all civilization, humankind decides that war and violent crime must be avoided at any cost. In order to prevent violence, all emotions and items that might elicit emotions are prohibited. Everyone must take Prosium, an emotion-suppressing drug. Those who refuse to take the drug are labeled ""sense offenders"" and are hunted down and destroyed by the State's elite police force, the Grammaton Clerics. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton Cleric of the highest order and dedication. When he accidentally skips a dose of Prosium one day, his newfound emotions cause him to question the wisdom of his emotionless society. He is recruited by the Underground, an outlaw pro-emotion movement, to take on a seemingly impossible mission: assassinate the political leader behind the State control of emotions and free humanity from the tyranny  of Prosium.Equilibrium's costumes, camera angles, martial arts sequences, and Grammaton Clerics are straight out of ""The Matrix"". Its story and themes take inspiration -to put it mildly- from Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"", Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"", and George Orwell's ""1984"", to name a few. Borrowing ideas from other sources is not necessarily a bad thing, and those are great source materials. But Equilibrium amounts to a handful of action sequences among some badly rehashed ideas. There are some unspectacular sword fights. The martial arts gun battles are unusual and eye-catching, but they move so fast that it is difficult to actually see much of them. Christian Bale's performance as John Preston is probably the best thing about this film. Taye Diggs is unconvincing as his partner, an ambitious, smarmy young Grammaton Cleric. One problem is: smarmy implies emotion. The doughy Big Brother-like leader of this Brave New society seems more like a couch potato than a despot. And most of the story simply doesn't make sense. If you are a connoisseur of action flicks, the martial arts gun sequences are unique and might be worth a look. Otherwise, skip it. A word of warning: This film is very violent. It is graphic. And much of the violence is totally gratuitous. I don't normally mind violent movies, but the slaughter-for-its-own-sake attitude of this movie made me cringe."	2.0	Mildly Entertaining Matrix Knock-Off	2003-05-15	6	2	4

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Equlibrium is set in a futuristic society, where a strict regime has eiliminated war by suppresing emotion and destroying everything that causes it - books, art, music, animals, etc.. To keep everyone in line, the government administers a mind altering drug that hinders emotion called Prozium. A form of police called the Clerics, have been created to enfore the law, and anyone who breaks it by feeling or showing emotion is put to death. John Preston ( Christian Bale), is the highest ranking Cleric who is responsible for destroying anyone who breaks the rules. But John is soon effected by a prisoner ( Emily Watson), who claims that you cannot truly live life unless you are able to feel, and experience emotion. To test her theory, he skips his next dose of Prozium. Right away, John sees that the society that he helped create, has been wrong all along. John has been trained to enforce the laws of the new regime at all costs, but he is now the only person capable of overthrowing it. His partner (Taye Diggs)sets his eyes on John's position, and becomes determined to stop him...I was literally blown away by this film. Director Kurt Wimmer did a great job creating the future society, with the outstanding visuals. While the story is similar to &quot;Fahrenhiet 451&quot; in some aspects, the story still manages to keep your interest and seem original for the most part. &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, is also the best action film I have seen in recent memory. Even &quot;The Matrix&quot; pales in comparison. When I first saw this film at the theater, everyone in the audience was literally gasping and making comments about how original and amazing the action was. A totally original form of martial art was introduced in this film called &quot; The Gun Kata&quot;. It mixes martial arts together with gun play to create a more effective shooting technique. Watching this new type of self defense unfold on the screen was mind blowing. The ending to this film is great and features one of the best sword fights I have ever seen.Christian Bale puts in another good performance. He plays both sides of John Preston so well. The first is the Cleric who feels nothing, and kills anyone who breaks the law. He looks down right menacing! The second, is the man that comes to believe what he is doing is wrong. Watching him feel for the first time will amaze you, because he gave such an accurate portrayal of what it would really be like. Taye Diggs did an outstanding job as his partner. He is dispicable and a truly great villan. Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen and Sean Bean were also fantastic in their roles.&quot;Equlibrium&quot; raised the bar of action films to a whole new level. The gun play, martial arts action, and overall violence will blow your mind. It is fast paced, realistic, and extremely gory!! The visuals are stunning as well, and the performances are great. Once this film becomes more well known, it will have people talking for a long time to come!	5.0	This film blew The Matrix away!!	2003-11-18	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	Thankfully the DVD has been a top seller and everybody (including me) is discovering this gem of a film. Christian Bale is one of our top young actors. Just watch his performances in The Machinist, American Psycho, Batman Begins and one of the best child performances of all time in Empire of the Sun. Everything in this film fits perfectly. The futuristic style, brooding score and unique action scenes are fresh in a genre full of sameness. Equilibrium may bare resemblance to Gattaca and 1984, but it's like those films on steroids. And by the way, Gun Kata is about the coolest style of fighting ever created for a film. I really hope they make Equilibrium 2, but after seeing Ultraviolet (by the same director) I think a sequel will only diminish this already cult classic.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1NMUSODK9RHAT	Mr. Maybe	"I enjoyed this film, but make no mistake - it is a popcorn film, so take it for what it's worth.Not even being an avid film or literary buff, I could name half a dozen other films or books this movie borrows from - the action (the Matrix), premise of thought police (Orwell's ""1984""), mood control (Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"") and even the final scene (Fight Club).The biggest problem for me is the premise itself as I found it somewhat difficult to believe - the idea that to eliminate the threat of war, society has been reduced to the point where they all consciously (though under law) sedate themselves, lest they ""feel"", which is punishable by death with no due process or trial. I had a difficult time taking scenes seriously where cops are raiding warehouses where stereotypical thugs are moving illegal goods such as...paintings? Lamps? Trinkets? I guess Wimmer needed some physical representation for people being guilty of ""feeling"", but these types of notions just seemed like reaching for straws.Being such a far-fetched reality is problematic is more ways than just the suspension of disbelief of the viewer - it also makes it nearly impossible for the actors to remain true to the premise. There are times when the authoritative figures themselves show emotions of happiness, satisfaction, or anger. It really seems more like a drug that eliminates all GOOD feelings, not ALL feelings. This is also consistent with how the law is upheld.I felt the above problems could be solved in one of two ways:1. Set in an obviously DISTANT future. This is how the Matrix sells the idea of us being ""batteries"" in a completely dystopia earth. Yes, Equilibrium is clearly set in the future, but there is little to suggest that it isn't near future. There's really no futuristic technology, so again, the idea of ""feeling"" being illegal (something that makes up our very essence) is just too far fetched for most viewers.2. The other means of fixing it would be to have set the entire thing on an alien planet with an alien race. In my opinion, this would have been the best setting as it takes away from our innate rejection of such a premise and ultimately, a more original idea.Even given the above complaints, the film has great production value. Wimmer does a nice job of putting you in this world. I felt the pacing was good and it was as well acted as one could hope under the film's premise. There were moments that did their job, such as several ""crossroads"" scenes, where Bale's character is put on the spot, between a rock and a hard place and you hold your breath wondering what he'll do.In the end, if you're looking for a decent sci-fi futuristic action flick, this is certainly worth a viewing. If you're a film stickler and bent on original content, or something overly cerebral, it's probably a pass."	4.0	More borrowed elements than I can name, but still a decent action flick	2008-07-31	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2B79TA7RW397U	"Mr. Nc Shackley ""NatShack"""	Once again, I see a poor movie, and then come on Amazon to see scores of people who have writeen a briliant review of it. This is undeniably a rip off of the Matrix, an obvious cash in on a cult movie, but then again, I guess it was only a matter of time before that happened.Now I was actually hoping to be pleasantly surpirsed by Equilibrium, as the storyline seemed to be a very promising one. Set in the future in the aftermath of World War 3, a drug is given to people to keep their emotions stable, with the thought being that it is emotions that account for wars beginning in the first place, thus eliminating them would rid the world of war altogether. But one person forgets to take the drug, and so it goes...But it seems the storyline is only good thing about this film, as it drags on to become a total bore. It's main weakness being the action sequences, good on effects, but completely ridiculous on realisation, as we see one man wipe out a gang of twenty or so other men time and time again. The scenes are corny, and I found myself laughing at the stupidity of them countless times.There were only about ten people in the whole cinema when I went (which figures) including my friends, and even they, who had been eagerly awaiting it admitted afterwards that it was bad to the point of being laughable, so I honestly don't know where all these good reviews have been coming from. Then again. there were a few morons in the audience who seemed to be enjoying it, so I suppose they could have come from them .I'm not saying this a truly, truly, awful movie. As I've written in my title, it is the worst movie I have seen this year. I'm sure there have been worse ones than this, but I wouldn't know because I only try to watch quality movies. But compared to the rest I have seen this year, this is definitely the worst.	1.0	The worst movie I've seen this year	2003-03-27	27	6	21
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3KXFQQFBPJTQE	"Mr N Forbes-warren ""author of RESURGENCE and ..."	When I rented EQUILIBRIUM today, I was drawn in by the story and the trailers featuring the fight scenes. The story begins when World War 3 occurs in the form of stock footage. The dictators of the time blame the arts for humanity's ability to wage war against each other(clock the images of Saddam - are the anti-Iraq war brigade involved here?!) and for influencing human emotions; so a new drug, Prozium(!?) is invented which people take by law to repress emotion and form a collective like the Borg in STAR TREK. Christian Bale(REIGN OF FIRE) plays cleric John Preston, an enforcer of the repressed emotion policies who suddely and very predictably becomes disillusioned and joins the other side, a resisitance movement. His superiors take note and send their own men after him, and the slow pacing of the first half degenerates into MATRIX rip off fight scenes, which while well staged, were too short to add any true excitement. Just what was this movie trying to be - art house pretentious rubbish or a cut-price MATRIX? Jan De Bont produced this, too, in my opinion, his career hit a low with SPEED 2 and has been going downhill ever since, with the obvious exception of MINORITY REPORT, which is far far superior. If you want to see a better version of this story, try the original inspiration, FAHRENHEIT 451, which is a true sci-fi classic. EQUILIBRIUM is the perfect waste of one hour and forty three minutes of anybody's life.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AP50P603W4BA7	"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums"""	Equilibrium is a surprisingly good film and sorely underrated. Set in a future where emotions are banned, as is anything that may engender emotion such as music and literature, the storyline may conjure thoughts of 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. Make no mistake however; Equilibrium is no copy of those films.After World War 3, it is decided that emotions lead to war and the prevention of further war can only be achieved by preventing the population from feeling. Every day the population have to take their prescribed mood dampening pills. Christian Bale stars as Preston, a law enforcement agent, who seeks out and destroys `sense offenders', people who stop taking their medication and who actively read and listen to music. When Preston's partner (played by Sean Bean) is found to be a sense offender and he is forced to kill him, Preston starts questioning his world and the part he plays in it. He decides to take the dangerous path of skipping his pills and starting to feel.This is no fast action, special effects stuffed movie although there are a few high action scenes, involving some well choreographed martial arts fighting. However, for the main part, this film relies on its chilling mood and soulless scenery to create an all too realistic sense of menace. It has been well produced and the cinematography is first class.

Rather a good plot and story line with a good twist as well. There is a bit of suspense for movie goers as they watch their hero unfold emotional but find calm in the action packed fighting sequences in which our hero, Bale, faces unbelievable odds.

It might not be the most thrilling or complex plot, but premise is thought-provoking, the action is well done, and the characters are certainly believable.  As a sci-fi, it could explore its central idea further, but it doesn't preach - and I like that about my sci-fi...it respects the audience members enough to let them come to their own conclusions, unlike some more modern sci-fis that got a lot of hype (*cough*AVATAR*cough*).Highly quotable, thoroughly fun, and worth the watch!"	4.0	A Personal Classic	2012-11-04	1	1	0

Christian Bale is ten times a better actor, and possitively OOZES anger and frustration and uncertainty throughout his transformation.  He remains a quietly commanding presence and positively kicks butt in the flick's stellar action scenes.  The plot is a good idea - although slightly cheesy at times - but I think one has to look at the movie in terms of the overall message, to appreciate the film as it should be appreciated.I only gave it four stars because the ending is kind of cheesy - I got the feeling that the director was trying too hard to give it a happy ending - it's a little TOO happy."	4.0	BETTER than the Matrix ...but who's comparing?	2004-02-26	2	1	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3490VB3P87U80	N. Anwer	Equilibrium is basically a hash of famous orwellian inspired movies and books. Yet it falls short of any of those famous works.In the future people are mandated to take drugs that supress emotions. In this emotionless society, most crimes are eliminated, however, rebels exist underground, as there were rebels in Farenheit 451.To enforce all the rules of law there is a small group of gun totting Ninja policemen called 'Clerics'. Christian Bale happens to be the best Cleric there is. His acting performance is probably the best amongst the cast, which is not saying much. Although he certainly does do a respectable job with what he was given.Even those who are willing to forgive this movie of its numerous flaws, like me, may not be able to the ensuing laughter that occurs after the cheesy scenes.One scene is where Christian Bale realizes that there is something wrong with the society he lives in when the clerics try to kill a group of puppies. Puppies? Trust me it was as silly as it sounds.Asides from that another flaw was simply that many of the characters would oddly display emotions at times. Even though they were supposedly on drugs.The action scenes on the other hand were what made this film. Some of the kung fu was truly incredible. However, it was also problematic. In the Matrix it was explained how they could fight in such a manner, however, in this film ppl are fight similarly for no good reason. It just seems odd.Equilibrium just ends up being a run of the mill Sci Fi flick with good special effects. Definetly not even close to the great Sci Fi films ( not matrix ), such as 2001, Bladerunner, and Gattacca.Asides from all the problems, the action is definetly a huge saving grace.  Has you have probably heard it does feature some amazing fight scenes, however, the were quite short and not enough.  Bale also does a good job, and along with his acting, the score, there is moodiness to the film too.  In the end I ended up getting the DVD, just because of the mindless fun.Aslong as you know to expect self indulgent mindless actioner, you might be pleasantly surprised.	3.0	Melodramatic and Cheesy, with some Admitedly great Action	2003-04-19	1	0	1

Both are loaded with action, have unexpected betrayals, depict life in the future, and mankind as a shadow of its former self.In some ways I prefer this movie over The Matrix, and in some ways I prefer The Matrix over this movie.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	"Christian Bale gives an unbelieveably moving performance in this criminally underrated little gem where he plays a ""Cleric"" in a post World War III world.  In this world, all of the population is devoid of any emotions for the sake of no war and human survival, and Cleric's are the ultimate fighting machines who keep the law while their own emotions are repressed as well.  When John Preston (Bale), the best Cleric there is, accidently misses his dose of his emotion supressing drug, he begins to realize what it is to ""feel"", and when he does he knows that all along he has been leading the wrong path.  Bale's moving performance is one of his best, along with his roles in American Psycho and Reign of Fire, but that is almost overshadowed by some of the best action/fight scenes to grace the screen since The Matrix.  Using the ""gun-kata"" technique, writer/director Kurt Wimmer creates an almost over the top showcase for some ultraviolent fights mixed with incredible performances from Bale, Taye Diggs as Bale's new partner, Emily Watson as a doomed sense offender, and Sean Bean who, even in a limited role, plays a very pivotal part nonetheless.  What I can't understand is why Equilibrium didn't see the release time it deserved.  It was only released in limited theaters which I can't understand why.  I found 2002's big ""future shock"" film Minority Report every bit as good as Equilibrium, albeit more fast paced, and I would have liked to see how it would have done had it gotten a bigger release.  My only complaint is about the DVD itself, besides Wimmer's commentary, we get a five minute segment with some interviews and various trailers (including one for Quentin Tarantino's upcoming new film Kill Bill) and thats it.  I would have liked to see a documentary on the gun-kata fighting technique used in the film, but oh well.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2XXN4K8NMB4V5	"N. Field ""sanjayfield"""	Pay no attention to the opinions of semi-literates, or their landlords. This is quite a decent film - hardly groundbreaking stuff, but not just the takeoff of The Matrix/Bladerunner that you might expect. The camerawork was excellent, interesting use of light and shadow to illustrate the bleak setting. The acting was decent, the plot not completely predictable. Most amazingly of all, the fight scenes actually included (what I thought were) some unique elements, quite an achievement when so much has been done already by the Matrix etc. The irony of characters, supposedly incapable of emotion, shouting at each other and banging furniture with rage etc was obviously lost on the director, but this is my only gripe.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A272GPVC1Y2X1U	Nicholas Kentros	Star Wars is a (very creative) rip-off of Frank Herbert's DUNE. That is the greatest SciFi, and Greatest movie of all time, and its a Rip-off. Equilibrium is just as good of a ripoff, albeit there are a few plot holes. But considering the miniscule budget, it should be compared to Pitch Black, not The Matrix. (Pitch Black also had a micro budget, and no lead actor, and thats on of the best SciFi movies ever made).If you want a synopis of the movie, just read different reviews, i don't want to have to write one, but on the the pros:Pros:The Gun Kata is martial arts based on mathematics, kung fu, and Guns. Whats not to like?!?Christian Bale provides some great emotions and great stoic moments. Good actor, sounds exactly like Keanu.The Kid. Damn, hes scary.This movie is just striaght up bad ass, no one can deny it.the bad:When Preston stops his 'dose', he is so obviously feeling that its obsurd that no one can tell. I thought that was weakThe Equilibrium establishment wasn't expanded on, and i never figured out what it was for. This is probably due to Budget and Time constrictions, so its all goodThe last 40 minutes were kind of rushed, but the last fights were awesome. When the black guy steps up with the sword, you are expecting a long intense fight. You will be surprised, and just may laugh out loud.The last pistol fight was cool, and REALLY FASTgood movie, some plot holes, some rushing, but watch it anyway	4.0	Sure, its a blatant rip-off, but so was Star Wars	2004-09-25	4	2	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2DQ7SG9GCODCL	"Nicholas Sterling ""AmigoNico"""	I'm surprised by the 5-star reviews.  Really, is this movie among the best you've ever seen?I thought the fight scenes came off kind of silly; they seemed vaguely reminiscent of The Matrix but -- well, corny by comparison.  Even the premise, that government had managed to make emotions illegal and would hunt down anyone who got off the drug that makes you an emotional zombie -- it was a bit far-fetched.There were parts that were somewhat intriguing, so it wasn't a total loss, but this movie is nothing to write home about.	3.0	Mediocre	2013-09-01	7	4	3
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A20ZFWGBY4REFX	"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan"""	"When ""Equilibrium"" came to theaters on a limited release status on December of last year, I knew that I had to see it, but I never had the time, and it was gone before I even had a chance to see it. Now, fast forward to May 13, 2003. ""Equilibrium"" was released on DVD that day. I went out and bought it and when I got back home, I put the movie in my DVD player, and I sat back and watched what was to be expected in this film, and man, I was not disappointed at all! ""Equilibrium"" is, hands down, the best sci-fi action thriller ever made (even if it was on a limited budget) since ""The Matrix"" back in 1999! The direction by Kurt Wimmer (writer for ""The Recruit"") was top-notch and unforgettable! The performances by Christian Bale (""Reign of Fire""), Taye Diggs (""Basic""), Emily Watson (""Red Dragon""), Angus MacFadyen (""Warriors of Virtue""), Sean Pertwee (""Soldier""), William Fichtner (""Black Hawk Down""), and Sean Bean (""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"") were outstanding and flawless!""Equilibrium"" takes place in a future which has gone through a third World War. When the war happened, people from all around the world joined together to create Libria, a society that outlawed emotions, simply because emotions are what caused the war in the first place, and that they have let emotion and feeling control them for way too long. In order for people to not experience any emotions whatsoever, they take a day-in, day-out daily dose of an emotion-altering drug called Prozium. Anyone who triggers an emotion within themselves (they are called ""sense offenders""), had to be confronted with extreme prejudice. In order to keep the peace in Libria, these sense offenders are monitored and eradicated by a special breed of law enforcement called the Tetragrammaton Clerics. The main character of the film is John Preston (Bale), the nation's highest-ranking Cleric whose sole purpose is to seek out and destroy all those who refuse to submit to the will of Libria. Preston is the prodigal child of Libria's system of unfeeling. Since childhood, he has been trained in the ways of the gun-martial arts that has made him a tool of destruction. Where he goes, death is never far behind. During the film, Preston finds out that his own partner, Partridge (Bean), has been secretly reading books which, on the other hand, triggered an emotion inside of him. So, Preston dealt with Partridge with the only way of justice for Libria...death. After Partridge's death, Preston is assigned a new partner named Brandt (Diggs), a fellow Cleric who is looking to make a career for himself with Preston, etc. During the film, Preston becomes intrigued of both his way of life and of his victims (not to mention that his own wife was a sense offender). So, one day, Preston decides to skip one of his daily Prozium doses and he begins to see clearly that all is not right with the world as it is, especially when he falls for a fellow sense offender named Mary O'Brien (Watson). Before anyone realized that Preston was ""off the interval"" (stopped taking his drugs and could feel again), he was chosen for a mission of total importance, to seek out and destroy a movement called the Underground, led by its leader, Jurgen (Fichtner), which is the only organized opposition to the State rule. When they are destroyed, Libria will finally be victorious. But what happens next is a personal struggle that will make us all think a little on what makes us human. As the story goes, the audience is witness to a spectacular form of martial arts called ""Gun-Kata"" that is as entertaining as it is violent, and you'll see what I mean when you watch this movie!The DVD of ""Equilibrium"" features two commentaries, one by director Kurt Wimmer and the other by Wimmer and producer Lucas Foster, as well as ""Finding Equilibrium"", a behind-the-scenes documentary, and some sneak peek trailers. In conclusion, ""Equilibrium"" is a DVD must-have for your action collection. If you did not have a chance to see ""Equilibrium"" in theaters, then you must pick up this killer DVD, it will blow you away! I haven't liked an action film this much since ""The Matrix"", and with ""Equilibrium""'s powerful storyline and high-energy action, it will keep you entertained from start to finish! If you love action, suspense, Matrix-like special effects, or just an all-out, rockin' good time, then look no further than ""Equilibrium""!!"	5.0	"Forget the first ""Matrix"" film, ""Equilibrium"" is way better!"	2003-09-17	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2QEBNE96XF5KF	Nicketti	The premise of movie sounded like it would make a good story. However, it just didn't hit the mark. It's hard for me to put my finger on why. I believe part of the problem was, that the main character, John Preston, did not seem believable. Especially after he started to change (I won't give anything away here). Also, the ability of John Preston to defeat anyone he fought against was inconsistent. The end of the movie did not make sense, (the immediate effect that John Preston's actions had on the populous). There was alot of action (fighting scenes) in this movie. So, for those who are entertained by this sort of thing, this is a redeeming factor.	3.0	Not as good as I thought it would be	2014-01-07	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3AZ7LB80SCV1H	"""nightmare-six"""	The Matrix was a great film, but in many respects it has come to represent to modern viewers all that is modern and innovative in the realm of fight cinematography. What was in actuality the logical culmination of years of HK cinema coupled with the power of the computer age of film-making has become an figurehead of innovation to the narrow-minded movie-going public. While the Matrix will always be one of my favorite movies, in this respect it has prevented films which also take the same logical step from gaining any widespread support.Equilibrium is one such film that has suffered under The Matrix's shadow. This film, because of its use of martial arts inspired, CG-aided gunplay has been cast aside by most critics as a Matrix clone. This label does this film a great disservice.As if wrenched straight from the pages of 1984, A Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451, the story of Equilibrium is pure, unapologetic science fiction. While the plot is obviously somewhat derivitve in premise, the cast grants the film a great deal of legitimacy with their performances. Particularly of note are the performances of Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire), and Angus McFadyen (Braveheart, Titus). Bale's captivating transition from the haunting detachment of his drug induced complacency to the passionate recognition of the true value of feeling is brilliant, and perfectly brings to the fore the message of the film.The fight sequences of the film are nothing short of amazing. In start contrast to the drawn out encounters of The Matrix, the fights scenes in Equilibrium seem as if they last only a few seconds. However, Wimmer managed to pack some of the most explosive fighting seen in a film into those few seconds. The on-screen explanation of the martial arts form employed by the clerics, called Gun-Kata, was a nice added touch. It allows viewers to suspend their disbelief much more easily when witnessing a single man dispatch a room full of foes.The Bottom Line: A great movie. Its one of those films that you feel special for seeing and enjoying just because you know everyone else missed out on it. Solid acting on all fronts and great fight scenes come together to make the best movie nobody saw.	5.0	A great film, deserving of more credit then it recieved	2003-04-05	9	8	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A20NJAPECFGIR9	"nina ""Movie Maiden"""	"Maybe this film just wasn't my cup of tea but I didn't like it at all. The only thing good about it was how good looking the actors were. Christian Bale and Taye Diggs were as handsome as ever and Emily Watson has never looked this beautiful in any film before but that still didn't make this movie good.Basically you have Preston (Bale) who is a cop (or something) in a future world where feeling emotion is against the law. Yawn. This movie wasn't anything but Preston being confronted with emotions and doing his best to figure out what they meant. The only thing different about this film was it was in a Sci-Fi setting other than that, it's like a million other movies where people have to confront their emotions. Mainly you get a lot of slow, mundane scenes mostly with Bale alone in a scene looking at objects and getting flashbacks now and then. He spends his time staring at walls, examining photos and wondering what it all means. If it sounds boring, it is.I won't even try to go into what happened during the film because I didn't understand most of it. This movie is a ball of confusion, bad direction and tacky writing. One thing they didn't do was rely on special effects which I appreciated. There weren't any special effects in this movie I can remember except maybe the setting but nothing huge. It allowed you to focus on the writing and characters but not so sure that's a good thing.This movie was discouraging and sickening. It wasn't the least bit entertaining which was sad seeing the talent involved. This movie was so boring and slow it made two hours seem like seven. I kept going, ""When is this going off?"" Just when I thought something exciting would happen it dragged even more. Don't be fooled by the movie cover! They wanna make it seem like The Matrix or something interesting and it's not anything close. This movie is BORING. I don't understand why in the world Emily Watson was even in this movie. She was shown TEN minutes if that! I could not believe she'd have such a bit role. I would've rather seen more of her character and Bale's interact than anything else.I admit I'm not a big Sci-Fi buff but even I know good Sci-Fi when I see it. This is definitely not it. Skip it. There are many films in this genre that are better. If you wanna watch a decent Sci-Fi movie then watch Supernova. It might not be perfect but at least you will stay awake.If you gotta watch this, fine but beware. I wouldn't watch it too many times in a row. You might end up in a coma."	1.0	Hated It	2011-12-27	16	1	15

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A37ZIX0Z2O12UX	"""nobobdna"""	"I am merely writing this review in opposition to the negative reviews seen in many newspapers and magazines. I believe that many critics went into the movie thinking either a)""It's a Matrix clone."" or b)""It's a copy of a previous work."" What nearly every professional critic has said is, ""It's just a copy of Farenheit 451/Gattaca/Brave New World/1984, etc., and therefore is bad."" These people obviously weren't paying attention to the actual movie and just read the press release. Yes, Kurt Wimmer drew heavily from previous works for the overall theme of Equilibrium, but the movie transcends its ""source material"" and becomes its own entity. If you don't spend the whole time you are in the theater pointing out similarities between this movie and other works, you will enjoy the movie greatly. The scene in which Preston hears Beethoven's 9th Symphony nearly brings tears to one's eyes, and is one of the best scenes in any movie ever. Now, many people are quick to compare Equilibrium to The Matrix due to the similar characteristics of a dystopian future an lots of action. However, the future of the ship Nebuchadnezzer and the fight against the Agents and the future of Libria and the fight against Father's regime differ greatly. Almost no specific plot elements are shared by the two films. Also, the action sequences in Equilibrium blow away those in The Matrix. After nearly every action scene in Equilibrium, I was grinning and just astonished by the awesomeness of what I had just witnessed. And the action of Equilibrium is at least partway believable ;). In short, Equilibrium surpasses its influences and DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS."	5.0	Equilibrium- Best Action Movie of 2002?	2003-01-03	4	4	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3AT7TI6FXN6WM	Norman Davis	EquilibriumI've read some reviews and it seems I ran across a set of them who may be taking an exam in film criticism.  Not so fancy here.  I liked it. But let me play a bit...It started and dragged on for some time before I felt any action was taking place. A couple times I almost shut it off... there are lots of movies to watch, I would not want to waste any time on movies that are going to start and end on a yawn.Fortunately, I stuck it out.  You'll recognize the plot without effort, it is how we get to the climax and conclusion that we hope will surprise us.  Ray Bradbury would be proud of this outing of one of his notable plots.I think too much I suppose.  The whole emotion thing brought back John Hurt in the movie of George Orwell's 1984.  Perhaps we even have a hint of Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland pointing and screeching at the end of the movie at those who are different.  In this movie, &#8220;the different&#8221; are people who feel.  Sensors, Sensers... Whatever they're called, You get the idea.  The bad people who feel and cause wars and conflict.Enter Prozac Nation, and the 3rd Reich complete with an Adolf Hitler substitute to make sure everyone is on drugs to kill all sensations? Feelings?, etc., And then enjoy Pol Pot's indoctrination or 'retraining camps&#8221; except those were real and here it is just fiction to groom the population into Milo's (Phantom Tollboth) Doldrums.Well thank goodness this utopian? distopian? movie springs a leak with one of the &#8220;Terminator&#8221; substitutes called clerics.  Kind  of cool, the idea... I mean, &#8220;cleric&#8221; is the super SS trooper killing machine. It has a spiritual overtone and I think that is a nice creative twist.Then you're in for some some jaw dropping super special effects eye candy.  John Preston (Christian Bale) in this movie is no Neo (Keanu Reeves ) from Matrix, but they had the same &#8220;movie mother.&#8221;Ok, I'll stop being a dweeb like so many reviews I have read.  I liked it.  Really.  You'll need a little patience as the movie intentionally unfolds slowly.  The action scenes are really cool, but being ex-military I promise you it's all cinema magic.You might enjoy this move if you want to settle down with some popcorn for the slow uptake of the move.  Hopefully, before the popcorn is gone you'll be rewarded with an exciting bunch of scenes leading to the hooray of the movie...I'm giving 4 stars.  Start with 5, knock one off for the slow start, maybe kick another one almost off the board for several reasons that will be self evident, but leaving the 4th star because in the end it is a character driven science fiction movie with character growth and change.	4.0	Not Neo, but they had the same &#8220;movie mother&#8221;	2013-11-09	1	1	0

The only reason I saw it in the beginning was because Christian Bale and Taye Diggs were in it.  When I saw the film, I was completely blown away.  The plot wasn't original, but it was definitely intriguing and quite good.  The actors' performances were astounding, especially Christian Bale's.  I really liked the ""gun kata"".  Really original and much better than the gun-action sequences in The Matrix.  I think it's ridiculous that some people think it's a ripoff of the Matrix.  The script was made before Matrix came out.  And to the people that wonder why Christian Bale's character was hard to kill, pay attention to the little detail with the lie detector, where Preston shut off his emotions and became a cold blooded killer.  It was a great film overall...the plot was good...the actors' performances were great...and the action was great.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"Kurt Wimmer's vision of a city which has no feelings because feelings cause chaos and social unbalance, and so everyone takes an anti-feeling drug and remains under the control of ""Father"", is not a bad idea in a sort of ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"" fame (Hell let's even go one step further and include The Matrix there) and is certainly one we should be reminded about now and again, but Equilibrium never really does itself justice by the time the credits roll.A lot of the movie is fun, but also contrived and certainly the idea of Gunkata (a martial arts with guns) is a great idea but sadly there is not enough of it done well to really warrant watching this movie for that alone. So what else is there? Well there is Christian Bale's Cleric character who is an advanced Gunkata professional and Father's last line of defence in snubbing out the resistance (anyone who stops taking their meds and feels) who decides to see what all the feeling fuss is about. After half an hour of seeing Bale let his emotions pour out across the screen, as he touches window panes with water running down them and then cries to himself, you just wish that he will whip out the guns sooner of later or go back to taking his meds. Unfortunately the vast amount of running time is in the weepy department.Equilibrium simply fails because of a bad script and maybe a director who is a little inexperienced on this front (Wimmer is actually a screenplay writer and if his script is not good then what more can you say about the direction of the same?) and it shows. The film is not all bad and certainly is maybe worth viewing if there is nothing better to do, but does not live up to the hype or the great premise that it boasts. Even those who would give it credit as not being a Matrix-rip-off, and it isn't really... okay maybe just a tad... will still have to judge this film on its own merit. There are some good scenes but overall the movie is not a good one and certainly the ""cause"" for ""freeing the feelers"" is a little odd especially when they are mowing down the ""non-feelers"" by the truckload. I am not sure if Equilibrium really spent much time in Ethics 101.The acting is not bad though but the ending is silly more than the great twist that it tries hard to pull off. The city of Equilibrium and the society itself looks good but does remind me of the lucas movie - THX 1138 (And THX 1138 is a far better movie). In short, more Gunkata, less weepiness and a better finish would have saved this one from going the wrong side of three stars."	2.0	Falls well short for a good idea	2004-01-25	9	4	5

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3II1ACACC5MTX	Pastor of Disaster	"I have read the first couple of pages of the reviews and am surprised that no-one has yet made the comparison to Logans Run, the 70s sci-fi classic, where Michael Yorke is a Sandman, an emotionless cop tasked with killing ""runners"", people who try and escape the domed city the story is set in to avoid being forcibly terminated on their 30th birthdays. Logan tasked with infiltrating the resistance begins to empathise with them and becomes a runner himself. Sounds familiar?Equilibrium obviously tries to cash in on the Matrix but they are very different films, both in terms of budget and premise. This film looks very stylish and revolves far more around the characterisation, costumes and cinematography, as obviously the budget was limited. And the director does a fantastic job in creating the dystopic future and capturing the set piece battles. Even the startling way the film is shot, lots of black and white costumes with a lack of colour enhances the look and feel of the film. It really is a nice piece of work and you can watch and enjoy this even if you think the Matrix is the greatest film ever (and of course, it is pretty amazing.)The plot as many people have pointed out is a little shaky and the premise of the film doesn't really hold up to over scrutiny, but it is sci-fi, the ""fi"" bit being ""fiction"" which means we should allow the director to present his world and accept it for what it is. Personally, I like the ""gun-kata"", its one of those pieces of ""film-science"" that makes you think that ""hmmm, maybe its possible"". I remember at a job interview for the Defence Research Agency many years ago being told about some one who had attempted to break down aerial combat into a set of algorithms so that an aircrafts computer could calculate the probability of a successful engagement and inform the pilot. If this was true, the ""gun-kata"" might not seem so terribly far-fetched.Bale is of course immense, you could put him in the tellytubbies and he would probably binge eat for 6 months and paint himself purple to get into role. He is ably supported by a cast of British and Irish actors including ""Beaner"" who is the working mans Sean Connery.This film could have been crap, but it isn't. It is really really good, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."	5.0	Logans Run Reloaded	2008-12-23	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3GJOMQAZHZ3RC	Patricia Walsh	to compare this movie to the overhyped matrix, is a injustice.despitr it'swellian influences, equilibrium stands on it's own as an action sci-fi flick. no cheesy dialogue, but more like comic book noir. the fight scences were the best since the BLADE films.  the pacing of the story was slow and a bit dull but so was the matrix.at least you can identify with bale's character, the ending although predictable. completed the story, thus no need for a sequel. it's the best sci-fi b-movie since the terminator or escape from new york. skip senseless [stuff] like XXX or the borne identitiy and buy this movie.	4.0	not some poor man's matrix...	2003-06-19	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AZJTA95WSM0ND	Patrick Flanagan	The Matrix was a cultural phenomena, and like many such things, it spawned a variety of clones that took it and built off of it.  Some of those succeeded, and some not.  While this movie has its own different style, unlike the matrix its plot, while unique -from- the Matrix, is not in and of itself very unique.  It is uninspired, and the plot exists merely as a platform for further action.  This does not mean to say there is not excellent acting in it, nor even emotional character moments- however, the movie poorly develops these relationships and attachment to the characters leaving me, quite honestly, feeling rather like I had just had a 'dose' of some emotion-eliminating drug myself when one character supposedly a romantic interest died without them bothering to spend the time to really develop it to any degree.  The love-at-first-site Disney movies did a better job.If you simply like action, and what a slightly unique plot to justify it, then this movie is likely your cup of tea.  However, I do not find a story about a society of people who take drugs to loose their emotions and become mindless drones and a drone enforcer turning rebel - and a VERY uninspired and unsurprising attempt at a twist at the end- to be something I would recommend to any movie-goer who actually desires something truly creative or inspired.  Clearly, those that made this movie were ON the very drug this movie featured.If you already have Amazon prime, sure, watch it and see for yourself- but do not waste your money on this unless you are a loyal action-flick fan.	2.0	Equilibrium entirely looses its balance	2014-03-09	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A329U9CDUPKXAC	Patrick	I just saw &quot;Hulk&quot; today and I felt a bit depressed since it didn't live up to my expectations of what a good action movie should be. This movie more than made up for that. This is the best science fiction action movie I've seen in a LONG time. It's incredibly intelligent. Every time I thought I knew what was about to happen there was a twist. This movie is totally unpredictable unlike &quot;The Matrix.&quot; This movie is better than &quot;The Matrix&quot; in every way possible. The fight scenes in this are so brilliantly done. I've never seen gun battles like this. It reminded me of some classic Japanese Animes I've seen. But &quot;Equilibrium stands completely on it's own.

Based in a ruined dystopia world where art, music, literature, emotions and anything expressional are the causes of mankinds trouble (war love and hate) and are prohibited in the totalitatian state of Liberia which control the people with injections of prozium to make them into unemotional working zombies for Big brother who has his Grammaton Clerics busting down sense offenders who oppose the states tactics and laws.The gun fights (gun kata) is the first I've ever seen in years in action flicks and Theres also some nice quick sword-fighting aswell.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3UA40JOD3BE1M	"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!"""	Okay, the first thing I want to say right up front is that &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; is NOT some sad, skanky, &#65533;Matrix&#65533; knock-off. There&#65533;s no &#65533;Bullet Time,&#65533; no &#65533;Blue Pills&#65533; or &#65533;Red Pills,&#65533; no &#65533;Agent Smith,&#65533; no &#65533;Morpheus,&#65533; no &#65533;Neo,&#65533; no future-shocked Virtual Reality environment, and &#65533; sadly! &#65533; no &#65533;Trinity,&#65533; in full sprayed-on-PVC-fetish-gear mode! That the film is being promoted with the following blurb on the case, &#65533;Forget the Matrix!&#65533; does, I think, the film a HUGE disservice.Mind you, there ARE some similarities between the two; both films are set in the future, lots of people wear really cool black outfits, the good guys and the bad guys fight each other using martial arts, and there are, &#65533;Guns. Lots of guns!&#65533; That&#65533;s it. So PLEASE don&#65533;t pick this up expecting a &#65533;Matrix&#65533; clone, and you&#65533;ll give yourself a fighting chance of enjoying it on its own terms.&#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; is a Sci Fi film, just as &#65533;BladeRunner,&#65533; &#65533;1984,&#65533; &#65533;Soylent Green,&#65533; and especially, &#65533;Fahrenheit 451,&#65533; are Sci Fi films, in as much as the Sci Fi elements are but a framework within which the filmmakers explore the Human Condition. &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; is set in a dystopian far future society, after the Third World War. A prologue sets the scene; to save Mankind, to prevent a Fourth World War, a war the species couldn&#65533;t possibly survive, the decision is made, by a &#65533;Big Brother&#65533; type world dictatorship, to tackle what it considers the root cause of Mans problems&#65533; his emotions.In this Brave New World of &#65533;Libria,&#65533; the population is regimented in the extreme, endlessly watching and listening to sermons from &#65533;Father,&#65533; in which he explains to them the horrors that have been caused by feelings and emotions. Every man, woman and child takes an emotion suppressing drug called &#65533;Prozium.&#65533; The ultimate crime in this society is a &#65533;Sense Offence,&#65533; in which the perpetrator stops taking their Prozium shots and allows their senses to resurface and explore the world around them; a painting, a piece of sculpture, a music recording, a scent. Everything that can possibly register an emotional response in the population has been savagely suppressed, works of art, literature, music, even pets; this is a drab, dull, gray, emotionally barren world.But human nature is still a force to be reckoned with, even in Libria, and there is an underground of malcontents, people who refuse to take their Prozium and live in a world rich in feelings and emotions. As far as Father is concerned, these are dangerous subversives that society cannot tolerate, and to combat them the State has created an elite corps of hunter/killer police, the &#65533;Clerics.&#65533; The elite of the elite is a Cleric named &#65533;Preston,&#65533; played by Christian Bale; cold and emotionless, Preston is like a Vulcan, but without their well-developed sense of humor! He carries out his duties for the State with clinical precision, disposing of both people and offending artifacts with complete equanimity. He is also a Master in the futuristic martial arts technique of &#65533;Gun-Kata,&#65533; in which all the Clerics are trained.And it&#65533;s &#65533;Gun-Kata&#65533; that gives the film its spectacular action sequences. Just as in the ancient martial art of Kendo, &#65533;The Way of the Sword,&#65533; the sword becomes an extension of the practitioner&#65533;s body, in &#65533;Gun-Kata&#65533; the guns the Clerics use - and even the rounds they fire! &#65533; become an extension of the Cleric himself. This is spectacularly showcased in a number of superbly choreographed fight sequences&#65533; I can safely say that you&#65533;ll not have seen anything like this before!But this is NOT just a mindless actioner dressed up in Sci Fi trappings. The film has a heart and a soul, and it&#65533;s the journey that Preston embarks upon when he accidentally misses one of his Prozium shots, his discovery of his own humanity, that is the core of this film. We watch as slowly but surely Preston wakes from his self-medicated emotional stupor. We see him as he really &#65533;hears&#65533; - for the first time - a piece of classical music, reads a book of poetry, feels the softness of a piece of silk, breathes in the scent of a long forgotten perfume, and experiences the emotional rush of a perfect sunrise. We also experience with him his abject horror, when he realizes what he, and the rest of the world, including his own two children, have been denied&#65533; the opportunity to be truly human.As the film progresses, and as Preston&#65533;s emotions return, he is charged by Father to discover, and destroy, the resistance. Where will his allegiance lie, with the State, which has given him all that he has, and has made him all that he is, or with the Sense Offenders he has dedicated his life to eradicating?Completely mishandled by the studio upon its release - I think it was shown on a couple of screens in Milwaukee one weekend! - this is intelligent Sci Fi on a human scale, in the grand tradition of &#65533;BladeRunner,&#65533; &#65533;1984,&#65533; &#65533;Soylent Green,&#65533; and &#65533;Fahrenheit 451.&#65533; As long as you don&#65533;t expect &#65533;Matrix&#65533; style pyrotechnics, there&#65533;s a great deal to be enjoyed in this film; a solid story, good performances, especially from Bale, excellent and well choreographed action scenes, and a satisfying ending. Go ahead, check it out, I&#65533;m sure you won&#65533;t be disappointed.	5.0	NOT a Matrix knock-off!	2003-05-16	3	3	0

Art is burned. People that are caught having any sort of feelings are instantly sentenced to death. The masses are being brainwashed, being taught that feeling is the mother of chaos, of suffering, of war and destruction.Action scenes? Forget the Matrix!

With a plot based of some of the best pieces of classic literature (1984, Farenheit 451, Brave New World), how could it not be amazing. People said it was a Matrix ripoff to me, but then I actually saw it and realized it was so much better than the Matrix (which I love). The script is pretty much perfect. The special effects aren't perfect, but they still look really nice. The gunfight at the end in particular is amazing. Christian Bale's acting by the way is a pretty subtle example of greatness.

To put it quite bluntly, Equilibrium was that kind of movie.  My all-time favorite books of all time are Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit, and seeing the trailer to this movie immediately reminded me of The Matrix and Minority Report, two other great movies that brings fond memories.  But seeing Equilibrium did more than remind me of all those great novels and movies combined.  It paid homage to those great stories that successfully brought it to the widescreen as opposed to just rehasing a familiar plot.  To achieve such a feat is quite amazing.  Mind you, this is not a mindless action flick at all.  Equilibrium had a plot that was both refreshing and entertaining in the veins of its dystopian predecessors, and the fact that there were moments in the movie where my jaw would drop to the ground while saying to my friends, ""Oh my gawd, did you just see that?!?!"" is simply classic.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AX6HRSPO0N9TU	Pavel Simsa	yes, you are right, it's only a movie, sci-fi one what's more. you are right that sci-fi movies can be unrealistic. but only in terms of let's say technology, advanced science or principals (take startrek for example). but the events still need to be at least a little logical. i mean, come on. especially the lobby fighting scene when he's reloading. there are 10 guys with assault rifles in front of him; it's like he's saying &quot;wait a minute folks, i need to reload so don't shoot&quot;. there are too many contradictions in the main character's behavior... sometimes he behaves like a highly trained killer (that's what he's supposed be right?) and a scene later he turns into a stupid rookie who can't assess a basic combat situation. that's what makes matrix so different, even though the first look might suggest they are equally good. because in matrix (well, leave aside the &quot;beautifull princess kiss of life&quot; at the end) all the characters behave logically in each situation and the jumps and fighting skills are justified by the environment they take place in. that's the kind of realism i'm talking about - not considering 50 meter jump unrealistic. but it seems to me that in equilibrium, the characters take completely irrational and unlogical actions just in order to buy some time for next few scenes - it's like you don't check-mate your opponent in chess when you have a unique chance to do so just in order to play next few moves. but usually chess are not about life/death or fate of the entire city...	1.0	To Michael Hooper	2003-11-10	15	0	15

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2KNWP8S1B4H8Q	"Pete Falina ""Pete F,"""	"One of the previous reviewers wonders how this got by him (and by a lot of us).  Box Office Mojo says that the film's widest release was 301 theaters, and that it took in about $5.4 million world-wide, so it didn't get a lot of exposure.  I doubt that it returned the investiment either (though IMDB trivia says otherwise).This is a workmanlike film, with everybody involved giving it their best shot (with the exception of the music which sounds to me like bits left over from 1996's Broken Arrow).  The script is a genetic stew of chunks of The Matrix, 1984, Blade Runner, Fist of the North Star, and a parade of B and C films where the hero starts out as one of the trusted bad guys and gradually turns to the Resistance or the Revolution or a sexy Replicant, maybe.Apparently, World War III erupted early in the 21st century.  This film was released in February, 2003, according to IMDB, so I guess there's still time for things to happen in the early 21st century.  Think 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' where the MC guy says '...killing got to warring, and that was almost the end of us all.'  In this world vision, negative emotion is deemed the plague that must be eliminated.  The survivors all take 'Prozium' which suppresses emtion both negative and positive.  As the man from Missouri said, 'That's a tough cob.'  Bale is John Preston,a Cleric, one of the quasi-religious police who ferret out and take down people who insist on having feelings, which seem to be associated with old paintings and rooms full of 20th century bric-a-brac.  His first partner (Sean Bean) goes over to the light side early on (think Agent D from 'Men in Black'), and Preston winds up with a new partner, the openly devious and suspicious Brandt (Taye Diggs).  Much action ensues, as Preston stops taking his Prozium (didn't Richard Corben do a graphic story where everyone took a brain pill and a bod pill?).If you're a devotee of these post-apocalytic action things, you will probably find this film interesting.  There are some well-stage fight scenes, particularly toward the end as Preston fights someone who has had the same training as himself.  Equilibrium is not going to make you forget The Matrix, though, certainly not the first of the trilogy (Matrix II and III are forgetable without any outside help).If you've read Robert Heinlein's ""If This Goes On--"" (aka Revolt in 2100), Equilibrium will seem very familiar to you.  Most of the forward momentum in this film is quite predictable, but I have to admit I wound up rooting for the 'sense offenders' rather than the anti-feeling Clerics (though the film cheats, allowing the supposed cold-natured anti-feelers to get happy, upset and even angry).Christian Bale and Taye Diggs are more than serviceable, and look for a nice performance by Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce from Braveheart).  Plus, I'm still getting over Emily Watson's eyes!If it sounds like I'm trying to have it both ways, I am.

Then the stunts and graphics folks re-visit Matrix to get us to the final scene.  That the bad guy turns out to be a super fighter like our hero is a stretch but the scenes and action leading to the conclusion are fun. Once again love conquers all - especially when it is supported by superior weapons!!!.	4.0	STRANGE IDEA WORKS OUT IN ENJOYABLE MOVIE	2013-02-05	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3OM6YM926U6EK	Philip Pinsker	"The movie Equilibrium was a decent movie, not a great one, but not a movie you would regret seeing. It follows the plot of George Orwell's famous novel ""1984"" very closely with the idea of a distopian society and is extremely similar to the novel 1984. Like 1984, the main character in Equilibrium rebels against the established government and society. The movie's heavy action and ""Matrix"" like scenes add entertainment, but they do get tiring after awhile. The movie is interesting and the plot is well developed. The progression of the main character is also very evident throughout the movie. The important thing is that the movie stays interesting and does have any real slow parts. However, I was not a fan of the ending, which I felt was very unrealistic(even though dodging bullets is not very realistic either). The movie is better than average, but nothing spectacular."	3.0	Mr. Yochum's 5/6 Senior English Class	2009-04-13	0	0	0

It's intelligently done, it's got lots of cool action, it's got good music, it's got good dialogue, and it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience.  The acting by Christian Bale couldn't have been more perfect.  I've seen the movie three times so far and have loved it every time.  The action scenes are definitely the coolest thing in the movie.  The gun battles in this movie are ART. Yes, ART.  You have to see it to understand what I'm telling you.	5.0	Spectacular	2002-12-24	1	0	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1R5ZCXNK0L5XT	PithyTag	Let's be clear: I love sci-fi, both high-brow and low-brow, as long as it's semi-creative and has something to say. If you feel similarly, you'll be disappointed by this one. It's interesting only as the film that sold Batman's producers on the idea of Christian Bale as an action star. This film is a predictable, low-quality, poorly-directed rehash of themes that were much better explored elsewhere. Aside from the gun-kata and maybe one semi-creative action scene (the pistol fight at the end), it lacks anything resembling cleverness, surprise, or intellect. Visually, it was made on the cheap, and they've added nothing creative or new to the general idea of a monochrome dystopia. Patronizing to audiences who actually appreciate the genre. Sean Bean is perfect in his role, as is Emily Watson. Shame they both have so, so little screen-time.	2.0	A Formulaic B-Movie Mess with an A-Grade Cast Before They Got Huge	2014-06-24	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1OOQ94LR59IZE	"""pizzadeliveryguy"""	At first glance, Equilibrium appears to be a cheap knock-off of Andy and Larry Wachowski&#65533;s baby turned box-office smash, The Matrix.  However, Equilibrium is a cool flick in its own right (if a bit too violent for its own good), and very much worthy of sharing the stylized gunplay and black designer clothing with The Matrix.Written by director Kurt Wimmer, the script is solid for the most part, a rarity in the world of action filmmaking.  The acting is also convincing throughout, with both Christian Bale&#65533;s Preston and Angus MacFadyen&#65533;s DuPont standing out; Sean Bean&#65533;s brief appearance in the film is also quite good.  There are a few holes in the plot, such as why some of the other Clerics show both anger and pleasure (Taye Diggs&#65533; character seems to grin like an idiot just a bit too often for a emotion suppressed Cleric).  But as a whole, the acting and writing are both a cut above what you might expect from this unheard of movie.In all seriousness, however, the focus of the film is undoubtedly its action.  And what stylish action it is.  The karate-gun fusion that is Gun Kata is simply a marvel to behold, and really gives the film its own kick.  The film feels bigger and grander than its $20 million dollar budget (For comparison, The Matrix budget totaled somewhere in the $90-$100 million dollar range), and, according to the director&#65533;s commentary, several of the action scenes were shot in one take due to a lack of time, which is very impressive given their overall quality.Equilibrium is at heart an entertaining action flick, though its stab at bringing a little bit of intellect into the action genre is quite respectable.  It doesn't try to be anything more than it is, and that's okay because all it is is pure fun.	4.0	Not quite balanced, but very fun...	2003-06-22	0	0	0

Also, while the fight scenes were my favorite part, the plot had no obvious holes and was not lacking in any way.  When i saw it, Equilibrium immediately reminded me of ""Fahrenheit 451"" by Ray Bradbury, which is an excellent book.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AF08S2L8O9W6C	Praetorian	Expertly throwing the harshness of a society in which the good of every individual is sacrificed for the good of the society as a whole into sharp relief, Kurt Wimmer introduces us to his masterpiece Equilibrium.  This is a poignant and powerful tale of the consequences of sacrificing that which makes us human.  By using elements of George Orwell and Ray Bradbury, Wimmer draws his audience into a gritty hellish reality where the unexpected is a regular occurance.Several things that I loved about this movie are outlined below:The use of color, or rather the lack thereof.  Color evokes emotion, and so all the costumes are done in shades of grey and black.  Add to this the backdrop of a harsh limestone architecture and you have a canvas adorned in grey and black alone and yet it conveys the sense of a beautiful picture dispite its bleakness.The music.  The music is beautifully crafted to expertly counterpoint the emotional context of the movie.  Frequently you will find your emotions being manipulated by the beautiful imagery created by both original scores and classic pieces like Beethoven's 4th symphony.The cinematography.  This is one of the most cleverly shot movies ever.  The angles tend to communicate an emotional subtext which moves from harsh, ninety degree angles to flowing curves and even an absence of conventional corners.The writing.  The script for this movie must be experienced.  I won't even attempt to demonstrate how well this screenplay is written.The action.  The action sequences in this movie are awesome!  The visceral realism of much of the action makes The Matrix look like The Karate Kid.  Guns are used in an interesting way as they are considered to be simply an extension of the arm (like many melee weapons are) and the aesthetic ballet of the action sequences are reminescent of poetry.	5.0	Balancing the Unbalanced	2005-02-25	2	2	0

I saw this film after I saw American Psycho and again its because of Christian Bale.  If you want to see another great film by him try The Machinest.  I was a little disappointed that Sean Bean did not get to play a greater part in the film.  I would have like to know more about his character.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1KJYN7ZYYF87I	Rafael Kasinski	"Let me put it bluntly: to like this film is to confess to a complete lack of interest in originality and quality.  First off, the story is a rip-off of classic sci-fi stories such as Farenheit 451.  Moreover, the plagerism is pulled off so badly you could swear on you mother's grave a five year-old wrote the script. I mean, please: ""in the future, to avoid a fourth world war, humans repress emotion, which they believe to be the principle cause of war.""I would feel insulted if I were any of the actors.  The lines (which I have repressed forever) are atrocious, the stuff of the Sci-Fi Channel's worst series.In the end, like The Matrix, this movie (probably at the insistence of its producers) fails to deal with any part of the story per se.  There is only action and special effects.  That's it, fin, end of story, ponto final, made for the type of person who refuses, if even for a second, to utilize a single neuron during the film's presentation.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A16ATN0G3BC6PZ	Reader	My mate let me borrow this and it's sat on my DVD player for weeks. I have to say that like almost everyone else i thought it'd be a Matrix rip-off. It's nothing like the Matrix.Man has survived WWIII...just, and society comes up with a plan that emotions are the cause of man's downfall. If we had no emotions, there would be not jealousy, no greed, no anger, hate or war. So, the 'Father' (kinda goverment thing) brainwashes what's left of mankind into taking a drug to prevent all emotion and ultimately prevent another war.Despite this 'perfect' hate free society, it's actually one messed up place. There are considerable parallels between the city Equilibrium and the Third Reich...the state flag looking almost like an inverted Swastika. The use of brute force to promote this 'perfect' society are at times sickening. I honestly thought I was going to throw up when Mary O'Brian was sentanced to combustion for resising the drug. But then...cremation scares the hell out of me anyway so being cremated alive.... *whimper* :/The cast are excellent in their roles, in particular the lovely Angus Mcfadgen(Braveheart's Robert the Bruce...where's your Scottish accent gone mate?!) Like everyone mentions the gun kata kicks some serious ass.All in all, this is a fantastic film. I'm not going to decide whether it's better than the Matrix or not because they're nothing like each other.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1UDHO78BDBLEO	Rebekah	My husband and I rented this film after it was reccommended to us by a Blockbuster clerk who knew our taste: action, sci-fi, and great acting.  I had never heard of it before.  We loved it! I was so surprised after having watched it that it was so little advertised.  I don't believe it ever appeared in theaters in our city.  I've heard it was panned because of a weak and over used plot. The plot I admit wasn't too complex.  It is along the lines of classic Science Fiction dystopia fables like War of the Worlds, Time Machine, Planet of the Apes, and Kubric/Spielberg's A.I. etc., where the idea is more important than the story.  Its also reminiscent of books like &quot;The Giver&quot; and reminded me a great deal of George Lucas' film school break out flick, THX (some number).  But because the plot is so familiar it frees the viewer to concentrate on what the story is really about: the moral conflict and development of the main character, John Preston, masterfully played by Christian Bale.  Bale is the kind of exceptional actor who can convey a complex range of emotions in his facial expression.  Music, set design, costume, all compliment the age old theme of man's conflict against himself.  John Preston discovers that the discipline he's learned as a law enforcing cleric is the key to controlling his newfound emotions, and become the liberator of his world.  Besides the incredible performance of Christian Bale, the action sequences are amazing, a blend of violence and artistry that becomes a poetic experience.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A39W3263A9HCMN	"Renfield ""Up the Irons"""	Since this movie had so many rave reviews and quite a few friends of mine were telling me about how awesome it is, I decided to rent this movie because, for one, I love Christian Bale. I became a fan after seeing him in Newsies, which, while being a so-so movie at best, was worth it for Bale alone. Who thought he could sing very well? He was also in American Psycho, and a few other movies that I love. ALso, I love action movies, I'm a huge fan of dystopian stories and It seemed very matrix-ish.Let's get right down to the good: The action scenes are incredible. Some of the best I've seen in any movie. In fact, they alone save the movie from being downright awful. The action at the end was awesome too, and it was well shot and edited. No shaky camera, no rapid edits, the viewer can tell what's going on in the scenes. Also, no speed ups or slow motion, it's raw and down to earth. As for the visuals- the movie was shot on a very low budget, but even then they look great. The dystopian look really enhances the dark tones of the movie. Bale gives a great performance here, this is one of his better performances.However, that can't save the movie from being confusing and disjointed. The plot is really hard to follow. I had no idea what was going on, and at times it tried to echo The Matrix. Part of the reason The Matrix kicks serious ass is because the way it was done was incredible- when I watched the Matrix for the first time I was blown away, and I had not seen a movie like it. In fact, maybe had I not seen The Matrix before seeing Equilibrium, I might have liked Equilibrium more. Also, as much as I love the action scenes, at the same time I was wondering how it was possible that Bale's character had God like powers. The Matrix's scenes were more realistic in the sense that you knew why Neo had these godlike powers. Equilibrium offers no explanation, instead we're left wondering what the reasoning behind all of this is.Another negative point is the characters. None of the characters seemed to catch my attention at all. I personally couldn't care less if Bale died or not, and are we really supposed to feel sorry for Watson's character? I was just glad I didn't have to watch her anymore. As for Bale's character's kids, they were pointless and were out of place with the plot. Especially the son. In fact, when I saw that he was dressed like Bale, I laughed out loud. As for his acting, he sounded like he was reading off a teleprompter. Most of his dialogue was just him giving plot points away.In short, this movie is really a mixed bag. When it's good, it's good, but when it's bad, it's downright awful.	3.0	Great action, awesome visuals, bad characters, non-existent story, rushed movie	2009-09-07	2	2	0

I thought that Christian Bale was great in this movie. I also found his character John Preston to be very interesting. I found many similarities between this movie and the book 1984 by George Orwell. For instance they both have a figure that is all powerful whether it is Father or Big Brother. Furthermore in the movie and book the main character ends up having ""feeling"" which in there societies they are not suppose to have. Also in the book and movie there are children that work for the government and turn adults in for not following the government's beliefs. The only difference between the two is that in the book the government wins, but in the movie the government is overturned.  Lastly, I found the movie to be a great thrill."	4.0	Mr. Yochum's 5/6 Senior English Class.	2008-04-30	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A140SCX7I5M56K	"""rhodessedohr"""	A very good movie. This is an awsome action flick that deals with the necessity of human emotion, and it pulls it off. In a futuristic totalitarian government of the world, humans must take a pill that voids them of emotion or &quot;feeling&quot;. This is done for the effort of stopping the fourth world war, yes the fourth, because the third has already happened. Those who do not conform face death at the hands of the elite law enforcers called &quot;Grammaton Clerics&quot; who use a deadly form of martial art involving two pistols and a set of mathematically coordinated movements that optimizes the fighter. this martial art is caled &quot;Gun Kata&quot; which is a unique new action capability that captures the possibilities of future combat. This movie easily competes with &quot;The Matrix&quot; without using the new bullet time cliche. And, contary to popular opinion, there is not a gun fight over the rescue of a puppy dog, though a puppy dog is involved, it is completly justified. This movie kicks off when one of the Grammaton Clerics stops taking medication and finds out just how valuble human emotion really is.

But that's about as far as it goes.Equilibrium was all about realistic looking action choreography. To be honest this film has some of the best choreographed gun fights I have ever seen. And to my surprise and pleasure it puts anything in The Matrix Trilogy to shame.Christian Bale is one of the actors that keeps getting better and better in the movies I see him in and I am turning into a fan boy of sorts.In this movie Bale portrays a Paladin, the best of the best. Paladins are masters in the art of the Gun-Kata, a form of martial arts in which the user becomes one with his weapons and can statistically predict the trajectories and angles of return fire to maximize survivability and killing. Bale's character lives in a post WWIII society that has put a ban on emotions all emotions and a drug has been introduced to supress all emotions. Bale is void of all emotion as well and he is sent out to to remove all ""sense offenders"" or people who have emotions because they refused to take the drug. After missing a dose of his medication he realizes what he missed out on and begins to change his ways.Equilibrium delivers. That's all I have to say.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5	R. Kyle	"After barely surviving World War III, the human race decides that they will not survive another war.  Eliminating emotion is the accepted panacea for future wars. Each citizen is to take a dose of medication every day.  In addition, books, works of art, artistic embellishments, and music are all banned--a loudspeaker continually announces the latest ""bans for E10 content."" Their hope is to create a sterile utopia.  What they create instead is a totalitarian state run by the ""Father"" (Big Brother) of an order of Grammaton Clerics.John Preston (Christian Bale) is the chief of these clerics.  In the first scene, we see him verifying the authenticity of the Mona Lisa--and then firing it himself instead of allowing it to be taken in 'because some things manage to escape.'Preston is literally the 'cop's cop' and he's as straight arrow as they come.  When his partner, Partridge, begins to feel for the people of the Nethers, who are resisting being drugged and suppressing their emotions, Preston turns him in.Preston may well have eradicated the Resistance problem had it not been for an accidentally skipped dose of medication.  The next day, he saw the sun rise for the first time and began to unthaw himself.Preston begins to feel and consequently, his sympathies change.  He's thrust into a plot to overthrow the current government by killing the Father.Bluntly, I could pick this film apart--yes, few of the individual ideas are new.  However, the way the film's ideas are put together is very well done.  Battles are in my opinion, better than ""Matrix"" and martial arts fans really need to see the ""gun katas."""	4.0	Interesting concept and amazing action sequences	2007-10-19	4	3	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3258AIQI17ZEU	"R. Mastromauro ""Mommy Dearest"""	This movie features a bleak, emotionless future to resolve human conflicts such as war, interesting as it is, instead of just putting the 'sense offenders' back on medication, they choose to kill them.  I did not understand the meaning behind that, and how any society would ever find that to be a solution, however for the sake of moviemaker plot line, it was a pretty surrealist look into a world ironically not too different from ours... in some parts of the world anyway.Christian Bale did an amazing job, as he normally does, playing a top level agent that seeks out the 'sense offenders' and destroys them.  When he finds he has missed a dose of Prozaim, the 'it' drug of the times.... He starts to feel, as he begins to process emotions for the first time, he discovers there are 'feelers' all around him,  he joins the resistance and now has to fight 'Father' the leader of this non-feeling movement.It is a great story to remind us all why being human is important and special... though I cannot understand how Taye Diggs was supposed to be considered on those drugs.... he may have needed a stronger dose, since all I got out of him was emotion... more so even when Bale's character is supposed to be off the drugs...Anyway it is definitely a great movie, I gave it 5 stars, merely because anything that allows me to watch Christian Bale for an hour and a half has to be good :)	5.0	Atmospheric Movie..	2008-11-12	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Equilibrium (Kurt Wimmer, 2003)Matrix ripoff that's actually a good deal better than Matrix, but that's not saying much. In this one, John Preston (Christian Bale) is a member of the Tetragrammaton, a sort of secret police-style organization dedicated to the stamping out of anything in society that causes people to feel emotion (in the opening scene, for example, Preston and crew destroy the Mona Lisa). Preston and his partner Partridge (The Dark's Sean Bean) are Clerics, members of the inner Tetragrammaton circle, and rigorously screened to be above suspicion; Preston, however, discovers that Partridge has kept back a piece of contraband from a recent raid, a book of Yeats' poetry. Preston is forced to execute Partridge, and soon gets his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be even more fanatical than Preston. Preston, though, has his own secret: he's stopped taking the drug that blocks emotion, the drug that the entire society takes. And maybe emotions aren't quite as awful as he's always thought...The thing that stands out about Equilibrium at first glance is the cast, which contains a stable of incredible B-list stars--Bale, Bean, Diggs, Emily Watson, William Fichtner, Dominic Purcell, Sean Pertwee, John Keogh, Angus McFadyen, and more. Which is good, because Kurt Wimmer, writer of such classic film adaptations as Sphere and The Thomas Crown Affair and director of the immortal Milla Jovovich film Ultraviolet (just in case you didn't catch it, the first half of this sentence is rather heavy with sarcasm), is neither a good enough writer nor a good enough director to make this into the truly excellent movie it could have been. The strength of the cast saves it from being as horrible as The Matrix, but it does rely far too heavily on staged action sequences. There is a surprising amount of character development here, and it's very nicely acted, though it'd be nice if it were better-paced or had a slightly stronger plot to hang on. Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying, well, maybe more than it should. ** 	3.0	Better than the movie it rips off, but still not great.	2009-07-28	0	0	0

I happend to rent this film on the recommendation of my friend who said the film is absolutley brilliant and awesome so I gave this a try.  I must say this film was extreamly well done.  The plot was pretty damn good, the Actor were great(even Taye Diggs and I'm not a fan of him at all)and the action is amazing.  I've read some reviews saying this film is just mostly mindless violence and nothing els.  Well I must say you're just an idiot or you have not payed attention to this movie at all.The plot is really cool and I'm not gonna spoil it for you but it has some really great elements.  Christian Bale did an awesome job playing Prestan Cleric.  I don't think they could have gotten a better person to play him and I will say this to all those Matrix fanboys out there This film outdoes the whole trilogy!  That's right, Equilibrium has fantastic Characters and a great plot and I must say the choreographer did a great job with the action.  That's were the movie gets really good..The action in this film unlike the matrix which almost all CGI this film has some real action(atleast that's what I thought)and I must say Christian Bale did the job right.  Some of the best and Amazing gun fights I've ever seen(mainly the final battle with Preston and Father)and I must say it wont disapoint.  The action totally outdoes the Matrix and as previous reiviewers have said, you cannot compare this with the Matrix at all mainly cause the're just totally different movies!  Besides the amazing action and gun fights one of the coolest parts in the film are the characters outfits, very rockin' and cool to wear and it's even better then the Matrix outfits.The only problem I had was the film felt a tad bit short and there should have bint a tad bit more Action.Overall with a Cool Plot, Great costume outfit, amazing gunfights/katana fights/ect(though needed some more action)and cool villans like the Father I give it a4.6 out of 5 stars...Lates	4.0	Excellent film	2004-12-20	6	4	2

Its hard to describe the way this production is other than to say it's the type that you'd see direct to video or premium channel. The production is great for what their budget was no doubt.  I still felt like I was short changed since the quality of the actor ensamble in this film is insane!  I'd recommend a viewing but I don't feel like I want to watch it again for the grim style that it was shot in.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A29LNXUJP5ANAL	Robert Huffstedtler	Equilibrium shows the viewer a nightmarish future in which emotion is suppressed by drugs and incessant televised lectures from &quot;Father&quot;.  Anything that might induce an emotional response is prohibited (art, music, drama, and so on).  A totalitarian police force, the clerics, enforces this new world order by destroying prohibited material and executing those involved in emotional offenses.  This has all been done before.  One reviewer called it &quot;a thinking man's movie&quot;; the only thing I found to stimulate thought was the attempt to figure out which story a given plot element was being borrowed from.  Numerous candidates present themselves: Brave New World, Ayn Rand's Anthem, Fahrenheit 451, even a little bit of 1984.  The borrowing goes beyond plot - many of the visuals are very clear ripoffs of cinematic versions of the above and the Matrix.Because of the degree of &quot;borrowing&quot;, the film's plot twists are predictable in the extreme.  The exception would be the happy ending which is incongrously tacked on to the end.  One suspects that the writer and director did not think the average viewer was prepared for the depression that dystopian visions can induce.Despite all this, the film is at least moderately entertaining.  The various action sequences are all well done.  Bale and MacFadyen turn in performances that are better than one would think possible given what they have to work with.	3.0	A Predictable Mishmash of Dystopian Futures	2003-10-21	6	3	3

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3PEQ9I5TEOOPR	Robert Schell	"As many previous reviewers have noted, this movie is a combination of a ""Farhenheit 451"" or ""1984""- type dystopian future movie with a ""Matrix""-like action component.  Actually, the action is more like a combination of ""The Matrix"" ""The Terminator"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (without the flying, though).  In a short ""making of"" featurette included with the DVD, the director speaks of his desire to wed the two genres, but the movie doesn't entirely work on either level.  The non-action portion of the movie is actually fairly uninteresting and unoriginal, and nothing really surprises you as the main character makes his transition from fascist enforcer to ""sense offender"" outlaw.  There are no really especially surprising or original elements anywhere in the movie, really.  Even the opening narration/stock war film montage seems ripped off directly from ""The Road Warrior.""As an action movie, it suffers from the first major action sequence not occurring until a full hour into the movie.  And when the big action finale arrives, there is no real drama, because Christian Bale's character is just an unstoppable super-hero killing machine, like The Terminator (or Nicolas Cage in ""Windtalkers"" for that matter) who'll get out of any situation unscathed, no matter how many baddies surround him, or how many bullets are fired at him.As science fiction, it doesn't rate as highly as the original ""Matrix"" or ""Minority Report.""

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3LKA6MECRIZCR	Ron Suliteanu	"The premise of Equilibrium is so utterly dumb, the film simply can not rise above it. Okay, there's WWIII, so in the aftermath, a sociopathic dictator somehow comes to power and forces (convinces?) everyone to take a drug every few hours (a needle in the neck) that is supposed to completely suppress all of your emotions.Anyone found ""feeling"" is more often than not executed on the spot by dozens of cop-like goons. The highly trained Clerics are the most deadly of all. The point of all this killing is, uh, to stop people from killing. See what I mean?The ""feely"" resistence (or underground), rather than actually fighting back, hangs out in hidden dens full of emotional objects, like paintings, lamps, and photos of one's family.  When discovered, it is all burned on the spot.Really, the one redeeming quality of this movie is the action sequences. There are maybe half a dozen and they're pretty good. They're fast and a little choppy (frames removed). Christian Bale does a good job as the Cleric turned sympathizer that kills more people than anyone else.You'd think that movie producers would know by now that you can't make a good movie with just good action and a dismal story.

It is a brillant masterful work of modern cinema art.  A cross between the Matrix, 1984, and DarkCity this is one great movie.  It deals with a cold, emotionless, nazi like future society where emotion is outlawed and regulated by medication.  Sense Offenders are hunted down and killed along with horded art, music, and other precious antiques.  In one scene they burn the a very well known painting after confirming that it was the real deal.  A somewhat depressing movie at first grows into an exciting fun to watch drama.  The Gun Kata is something new and unique, executed in a brillant and fun to watch manor.  This movie bumped Empire Strikes Back off of my top 5 list.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A39S60VGN1NP7R	Ryan Merrill	"I am exhausted of blatant Matrix-style plagiarism.  So, when I saw Equilibrium on the shelf and saw the gritty, black-on-black dressed actors scowling at me from under the plastic wrap, I was on my way out of the shop. A fellow consumer heard me scoff at the movie and suggested that I buy it and then judge for myself. He was right.Equilibrium takes you to a post WW3 world where all the inhabitants of ""Libria"" (very much resembling a rebuilt NYC) are taking a drug to numb their ability to feel. The human qualities of sense and emotion are what allegedly caused the third World War, and consequently the requirement for a sedated populace.  To counter the threat of rebels refusing the drug and enjoying the innocuous libations of music, art, and film, the governing body (Father) has created an elite task force to punish the guilty.  This is done via two teams; the all-purpose foot soldiers dressed in class III armor and sporting high-end Austrian/German assault rifles, and Clerics.  Clerics are the most revolutionary characters in an action movie to date.  Clinically unattached to their fellow human beings, they can infiltrate a room full of armed criminals, and dispatch them with automatic Beretta pistols.What can I say about the action? It's like nothing you've ever seen.  There's no bullet time.  No Yuen wo Ping coordinating wire-fu.  No idiotic diatribes involving obligatory philosophy, and certainly no Keanu-come-lately pondering whether or not he is the one.  This movie shares no modicum with Wachowski storytelling or Gaeta vision.  It's plausible that some technology was incorporated to garner the visuals, but this movie is quite original in it's implementation of those tools.Can I tell you that I loved this movie? Yes, and I think of myself as a very critical, jaded movie guy.  I've come to expect a better usage of the technology given movie makers since 1999, and I can tell you honestly that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It does start with a crash and a bang, but the faithful watcher will be rewarded with a refreshing concept and awesome action."	5.0	Bang for the Buck!	2003-05-16	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AEPEZ9JPWT0T1	SAGP	I am going to write a rambling review..., my mind is too pissed off to lay it all out nicely, just throwing it out...Director/Writer is like 'My Plot' + 'Your Brain' = BOOM!!  - There is no development of core plot and of 'Libria' coming into existence.There was a War, Mushroom cloud and BOOM!!Libria was her namo,L, I, BR, I, A, and Libria was her namo!!Ok, Let me say what I liked about it, basic simple plot about importance of emotion and spin on non-emotional / non-empathic world view. I smell some anti-libertarian politics too, but that's beside the point.Too many things wrong here... to name a few.- Extreme stereotyping - From color of cloths for elites and non-elites to schooling system and religious symbolism- Mega-cities with walls of steel, metallic structures and yet very non-western flat cityscape- Typical relics of oppressive regimes (Nazi and Communist) - Destruction of Art / Mass hyphenation / brainwash and even things like walking vs. access to car (only American thing was lack of public transport!! Ha Haa!!)- Humans exterminating everything even pets (WTH?)- Symbolism against church (and villain 'the father') (I am not Christian but still bothers me)Too many inspired(/stolen) concepts from other sci-fi movies/books/psychology  but very poorly executed.- Fight sequence - Gun fu from HK's Woo movies and suddenly Japanese chanbara patches- 'The underground' / 'Resistance'- was so pathetic that it made me feel crappy about myself for seeing it. That's where I  decided to see it till the end just to know how bad it goes.  Feels like the director has never felt passion of resistance, it's all about passion and people. These folks are shown so subdued here that the only thing they are capable of is writing a writ petition.And this ever elusive 'underground' is so literally literal that it's just under the street that's not something I can even laugh about. Pathetic. (The director should read the whole Matrix script, not just the wardrobe details)- Violence!! Black and White world.Killing several men to save a puppy, really ? Even if puppy was cute and innocent... (I am all for PETA and totally denounce brutality against animals, but I can count number of lives lost in doing that). To show humans/lives so easily expendable in itself feels like violence. In the end suddenly as if all the gun-fu was not enough they throw in sword fight chanbara style, again very poorly done.And Finally Whole concept of being unemotional / without sense is such a BS within the plot itself that it is laughable. So much fear being displayed, how are you going to escape emotion of fear? Makes whole thing very unconvincing and you cannot feel anything but questions after questions about the movie as you watch it. BTW, did you notice 'painting/pictures' in the father's room at the end ?Huf!!... such a kitchen sink movie and leaky too, can hardly hold the plot that was not there. You will need a Prozium drip to level with this one!!(I didn't research this movie before seeing, all I wanted was see a nice movie while enjoying some Chinese food, that's out of window for sure now. What tricked me was the ratings on Amazon fooled me that's why I decided to write this review).And BTW, wardrobe was totally stolen from Matrix, period.*Updated to correct some language and tone down my anger, (actually watched another movie to un-watch this one).	1.0	ohh god god... kitchen sink movie (with leaky drain)	2014-01-05	3	1	2

I picked this movie to watch at random at the end of a hard day mainly because of star Christian Bale being in it. Didn't know anything abut it. Ten minutes into the movie I said to myself that if this is one of those with an ending that has a ""point"" but the ""good guy"" loses then I will be really disappointed. NOT!!! Like I said stay with it! The movie has a simple but POWERFUL plot, enough twists to keep it really interesting to us slow regular folks that work for a living, and an ending that makes you glad you watched it. But by the 30 minute mark you will be so into it you won't care - like that good book that you can't put down you will be on the edge of your seat to follow this one as the story AND the action gets better by the minute until the climax at the end ""sets you free.""Like I said - I wasn't even going to write a review - but I had to!

Except for a slight twist near the end, this was a simple, straight-forward Nazi movie with not an ounce of philosophy or thought. The ultimate resolution was to simply shoot everyone. The bad guys were like the Star Wars Storm Troopers, shielded, anonymous and thus easy to kill without remorse. If you like bloodless, almost antiseptic mass murder, this is the movie for you.	1.0	Really? Christian Bale thought this was a good idea?	2014-05-05	5	3	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AB07GJWJBDAQ2	S. Andrews	I'd actually seen this movie once before.  It stars Christian Bale (this movie was actually the deciding factor for casting him in the Batman movies).It is set in the future after WWIII.  Only unlike most movies where the world looks like a big junk yard, 2 distinct societies have arisen.  One lives in large, well maintained cities and the other is outside the cities just scraping by (however, some people may not be happy with this but they are just people...no zombies or disfigured mutants),Within the cities it is against the law to openly express emotions and children are even schooled (a.k.a., brainwashed) to believe that it was mans' emotions that let to world war 3.  So emotions and things that lead to their expression like art, music, etc. are outlawed.  If you are found with it they do take it to a little extreme...you are put in a furnace and burned alive.There is a special police force that has been created.  The people who live in the emotionless cities (at least they are supposed to be) can't even have things like a frame around a picture.  Which makes sense in a way since you aren't supposed to have pictures (again, of an artistic nature...like paintings).The special police are highly trained in &#34;flushing&#34; suspected people out as there are many pockets of people within the city walls who have hidden stashes of art, music, books - all from the pre-war days in various places.  These special police are referred to as &#34;clerics&#34; but are basically adults who, from childhood are taught to be emotionless, trained with highly developed fighting skills (and the fight scenes are some of the best choreographed I've ever seen in a movie) and are given a drug that must be taken every day to help suppress their emotions.  Anyone want to guess what the drug is called...okay, time's up...the drug is called Equilibrium.BTW, nothing that I've written to this point is a spoiler and I'll try not to give any. So, now I'll get a lot more general so as not to give anything away because if you like post-apocalyptic movies, movies with good fight scenes and surprise, movies that have a plot, you'll like this movie.  It is well paced and I think one of Christian Bale's better works.The people outside the cities are considered radicals because they are also ones who stash art, etc.  So the Clerics (along with regularly trained soldiers) do make trips outside the cities as well. Since sense-inducing things like poetry and music are illegal they try to find it anywhere and when they do the soldiers torch works of art and the like.Of course there has to be some personal conflict somewhere or there wouldn't be a movie.  Enter Christian Bale as more than just the Cleric orders number 1 Cleric (a.k.a., highly skilled killer) since the people who love those sentimental things are supposed to be eradicated so they don't spread those heretic ways around.***SPOILER ALERT***Christian Bale's partner, another Cleric, it seems has stopped taking his Equilibrium (that drug that suppresses emotion.  But to set up a conflict for Mr. Bale, his Cleric partner is discovered (anyone remember what the term &#34;red shirt&#34; from the original Star Trek TV series and what that implied would happen if you were chosen for a landing party...in short, once you materialized on a planet if your uniform had a red shirt you probably wouldn't make it to the next commercial...argh).  So once Christian Bale's partner is found to have developed emotion, well you can probably guess what happens to him and Christian Bale is the one who has to do it.I will leave it at this point because from there on Christian goes through many changes which causes a lot of action, shooting, really well choreographed fight seems and finding out who and what makes for a good person or bad, while a lack of emotion creates a society without everyone killing each other, no bank robberies or robberies of any kind...it begs the question is giving up emotion (what makes us human) worth giving up?Well, this movie tries to show you using and action packed drama.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	APEJ4UN2JQNSN	"Sasa Husaric ""sasa28"""	"Many people compared this movie to the ""Matrix"", which I love, so I decided to add it to my movie collection. When I watched it for the first time I was pleasently surprised that it was as good as the Matrix and maybe in some ways even better. But it wouldn't be fair to compare the two movies too much since Equilibrium deserves better.The movie's plot is set in near future after the third world war which nearly destroyed humanity. It was decided that emotions were to blame for the war so they were banned. Whole population is forced to take drugs regularly to prevent emotions. The government uses a religious sect called ""Clericks"" to find ""sence offenders"", ruthlesly kill them and destroy anything that can cause emotions. In this regard this movie reminds me of ""1984"" but ""Big Brother"" is replaced by ""Father"" and ""Fahreheit 451"" but instead of burning book they burn paintings, books, records...Movies action sequences are beautifully coreographed and, even though they remind me of the Matrix, manage to be inovative. The ""Clericks"" are warior priests who have developed the fighting style which is based on statisticaly predicting the possitions of the multiple opponents in any closed quarter battle. The ""Clericks"" then practise the moves, which almost look like dancing, that enable them to kill most of the opponent in the most efficient way.John Preston played by Christian Bale is the best of the ""Clericks"" and he kills ""sense offenders"" without remorse or regret. One day he accidentally skips his daily dose of the drug and is for the first time confronted with emotion. Every day since then his emotions are getting stronger and he even joins the underground movement he so diligently fought to destroy. The performance of mr. Bale is excellent. He manages to show the range of emotional confict his character is feeling with minimum facial expressions but to great effect.The movie is written and directed by Kurt Wimmer. This is his directorial debut but he has worked as a writer before on movies like ""Sphere"" and ""Thomas Crown Affair"".Even though it can be said this is a Science Fiction movie I believe it is best described as action movie with elements of science fiction. The story primarily deals with the conflict of the individual with the repression of the government. The individual is defined by his emotions which the government tries to limit and control.The world in which the movie takes place is grim and grey looking city which reminds me a little of the movie ""Dark City"" but is slicker, cleaner and more futuristic."	4.0	This is not Matrix	2004-10-13	5	5	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A34TI9P66QGT0N	SB	"Look, this movie was cook, ok?  But when it gets right down to it, the absurd premise and plot were recycled from nine million other straightforward sci-fi tales, and the action was a far, far cry from the Matrix, Kill Bill, The Killer...I could go on.The ""Gun-Kata"" was ludicrous.  The only convincing use of it was at the very end when Christian Bale's character finally confronted the ""big boss.""  The sword fighting scenes were better, as were the moments when the Bale character evaded armed opponents/stole their weapons/turned their weapons against them--that was inventive and convincing.  But even those moments where the action came alive were all too brief...most scenes of action lasting only a minute or so.After those fleeting scenes of excitement, the film sinks back into the utterly predictable drugged/Utopia/totalitarian-society sci-fi that's as familiar as the classic Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, or more recent fare such as Gattaca.The highlight of the film was certainly Christian Bale.  His performance was so engaging and controlled, he raised the level of an otherwise completely predictable clich&eacute; to something enjoyable.In short, I reccomend this film.  However, it is not the god of Sci-Fi-Action that some reviewers would have us believe."	4.0	very enjoyable...but not 5 stars, sorry!	2009-03-12	1	1	0

I do see now why this movie was overlooked and at points discarded...it is not for lack of effect.  Equilibrium does what a lot of movies do - it retells a tale that's already been told.  The comparison to THE MATRIX is a fleeting one, in terms of the story.  THe only connection this film has with the other is the look.  And while I have seen MINORITY REPORT and BRAVE NEW WORLD listed as reference to this movie, EUILIBRIUM's greatest source/inspiration has yet to be listed...1984.  From the daily propaganda speeches to FATHER to the love interest that sparks personal insurgence, this movie owes its greatest debt to George Orwell.  While I will not go so far as to call this movie a rip-off or poor man's 1984, the similarites to the two are incontrivertable.  The best summation for this movie would be what I have titled this review - 1984 UPDATED.If you want to see a (graphically appealing) retelling of 1984, then this is a movie that you should see.	5.0	1984 UPDATED	2006-12-03	3	2	1

I apparently like ""drivel"" because this movie amazed me.  The depth in Christian Bale's performance as he sampled sensing and feeling like a fine wine turning into a massive LSD hit...Taye Diggs' seething hatred and self-love...Emily Watson's desperation and resolve...It was excellent.Kurt Wimmer deserves a standing ovation for this film.  It was imaginitive and inventive, drawing just enough from other classic cinema, then infusing it with moody scenery and ingenuitive gunplay.  Even on this very site, the reviewer scoffs at the ""gun katas"" even though that seems to me like a very intelligent, natural evolution of martial arts weapon mastery.Bottom line, don't believe everything you read.

Fight scenes are creative and riveting.  Physical (animal) sensation is treated as the same thing as aesthetics, but who looking at the movie poster thought it was claiming to be deep philosophy.  As far as it goes, its well done - perhaps the warning about ""hate"" crime legislation and psychoactive drugs is too close for comfort for the critics.  Many of them just call it ""goofy"" and juvenile - or uninventive.  Drama for the masses has to be clear-cut and simple by it's nature.  A film worth watching more than once.

Don't say that a movie is ripping off the matrix when it ties much more closely to perhaps one of the most influential books in the last century.Back to the movie, nice touch of a utopian society as opposed to a distopia, that brings hints of Brave New World to the story.The story line was simple, but solid and without, I feel, loose ends.	4.0	Decent movie, people have their references wrong.	2003-10-08	1	1	0

Hollywood failed this movie in not rightfully promoting it to the ticket-buying public but word of mouth will not be contained. It's already on my 'must buy' DVD list and I'm sure many MANY more people like me will be looking forward to picking this one up in May.Disregard the nay-sayers who shove this off as a Matrix clone. I'm a huge Matrix fan and went into Equilibrium without any pre-conceived notions and after viewing it I realized I'd seen something so distinct and different emotionally than the Matrix that it was a crime to connect the two films.See this film, then make your judgment. You won't be disappointed.	5.0	Equilibrium	2003-04-20	3	3	0

Critics panned it, well I'll pan the critics then. Their ignorance clearly a result of over stimulation and a bubble gum culture dummed down for the masses.The matrix, among a few has done well to dull the minds of the critics (which they incidently panned in the UK as well)  but this alone proves the critics missed the point of the movie altogether.The superb action scenes were incidental to an excellent plot and a harsh social statement of the human condition. I find it ironic that the point of determining what matters in life was ignored by the critics in what mattered in the movie.	5.0	Critics Should be ashamed	2003-08-18	1	1	0

Sme"""	"I'd only seen a few sections of this movie previously and dismissed it as seemed too similar to the awful ""Ultraviolet,"" which was done by the same director. This morning it came on and I decided to watch it through  and was pleasantly surprised.The plot is a totalitarian future state banishes all emotion, including expressions of emotion such as music and art.  It's ultimately something you've seen before, but it has enough plot twists that you don't know completely how it will all play out.  The semi-religious society that aspires to plain concrete architecture and grey, white, and black clothing adds to a ""1984"" feeling, and Christian Bale carries the part well, seeming every bit the empty automaton society has made people into.What drags the movie down is what also is it's main claim to uniqueness; namely the ""Gun Kata"" scenes using firearms in the place of martial arts weapons.  Dozens of bad guys all wearing motorcycle helmets and tight leather trench coats stand shoulder to shoulder just to be mowed down, and the ""gun moves"" are superfluous, mainly to look cool while shooting.  It resembles a bit too much the dozens of Hong Kong Kung Fu movies where the hero's combat skills are so incredibly over the top it doesn't feel like there is any challenge to the victories, they're inevitable.Aside from that, ""Equilibrium"" is an interesting movie with an atmosphere that sticks in your mind."	4.0	"A good ""B"" movie"	2011-05-15	1	0	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A342ACZODD8W36	Scott Walldren	Equilibrium is a new film starring many people I never even heard of, and a few familiar face character actors from European cinema. All in all this movie was a shade better than the &quot;Brave New World&quot; miniseries that aired on the major networks a few years ago. That is to say it wasn't that good, but neither was it bad. It is a highly derivative work of past films, tv shows, literatute, and video games.  The acting was a tad cheesy, although I think it was meant to be given the SF premise that &quot;Emotion is Illegal&quot;. The wooden actor (Christian Bale) came across as fairly genuine in the parts he played &quot;emotional&quot;.  Kudos to him for playing it like Keanu in the Matrix. The movie wanted to be The Matrix (I picked it up as it was advertised to &quot;blow away the Matrix&quot;) so bad that it kind of stunk up the place with its more strained efforts. However, there were some really phenomenally great action scenes, and it's always good to see Sean Bean in another movie, even if he got killed off rather sharpish. As a major theatrical release? It stinks. As a B-movie or just a rental it comes off as amazingly well done (especially for fans of sci-fi television and classic authors like Orwell). So, with that in mind, I shall give Equilibrium a solid B rating, with kudos to Christian Bale and the director for creating a 2 hour version of an Outer Limits episode.	3.0	Not that bad, and simply amazing as a B movie (3 stars)	2003-07-03	5	5	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A31HGEUYT00I1C	"""sculptoris@aol.com"""	Equilibrium has been rightly compared to The Matrix, but whereas The Matrix is mass-market science fiction, Equilibrium is exceptionally rooted in the classic, masterful tales of Orwell, Bradbury and Huxley.  It is brilliant in its dystopian imagery and script.  Characterizations are spot on.  And the patiently told story is bolstered by well-timed suspense and incredible action sequences.  Ultimately, The Matrix is about mind-bending special effects, and those effects in the end can not cement the often shaky script.  In Equilibrium there are relatively few special effects.  Yet the action is visceral and thrilling.  The pulsing gunshots are profuse and hypnotic, enhanced by variable camera moves and speeds.  Imagine a Zen martial arts master, fluid and peaceful in his moves.  Now imagine him with two-semiautomatic pistols and hidden supplies of ammunition--this is a Grammaton cleric.  And that's all I'll say.  The acting is competent and believable.  Christian Bale sells the struggle of his character skillfully.  Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, Sean Bean, Angus McFayden and William Fichtner gracefully lend their usual skill and aplomb to director Wimmer's dystopian universe.  It is unfortunate that this is a limited release, and that very little has been accomplished in the way of marketing.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP	"Sebastian Sanjurjo ""mr.movie expert"""	"I remember clearly in 2002 I saw a trailer for this movie, somehow no one recalls this movie. I on the other hand could not wait for this movie to come out, I actually went to the cinemas to see it...unfortunately it had been taken out already. Anyway, I saw it as soon as it was released on DVD; and let me tell you that when I saw it for the first time it blew me away. The Story, the Acting and the out of this world action sequences.Now 7 years later...It didn't feel the same, the movie however still stands as an exceptional Sci-Fi film, but not as superb as I remember. The problems with the movie are mainly ""plot holes"" some are passable and others are as big as the Milky Way.The movie's premise is of a world commencing from start after a 3rd World War. According to the brief prologue we are supposed to accept that there is only one last remaining ""civilized"" society, known as Liberia. In Liberia, every citizen must take a doze of a drug known as ""Prozium"". This drug inhibits the effect of a robotic/non emotional being. So technically speaking no one can or exhibit emotions...""why""? well according to the story of the movie, emotions like hate, greed, and anger caused War. Yet without Emotions we seize to exist as humans beings, it is an essential part of who we are.shortly in the movie we are introduced to John Preston (Christian Bale) a ""Grammaton Cleric"" (futuristic officer) he exhibits the persona of a man troubled by lost of someone and himself, his emotions that have been repressed are demonstrated quite well in dream sequences and thoughts. As for what happens...Its quite obvious, he accidentally lets the dose fall on the floor...And voila he begins to ""feel""So, pretty much the movie is interesting and contains a potential plot. ""So what's wrong with it""? Unfortunately the problem with the movie is the plot holes. As I had said these plot holes are quite noticeable. I will write a short list of some of the most obvious mistakes. Anyhow, the movie borrows alot from Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and even the city looks similar to Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis.Now, all of these mistakes are not to be taken as a reason to ignore this movie; on the contraire, this movie has still so much more to offer. The astonishing ""Gun Kata"" the technique to fight with guns blew me away, it is by far the most original idea I have ever seen in an action movie. Not one scene involving the ""Gun Kata"" looks bad. The best asset in the movie is Bale, he brings so much to the role, he takes the Semi-Original story and gives it heart and a push that made the film a sleeper hit.This is a sci-fi vehicle at the most, but don't underestimate the directing of Kurt Wimer (who unfortunately directed a weaker film ""Ultraviolet) he directed this movie so well for so little money. The entire cast gave a little to the story so we could forget in a way the mistakes in the movie. As well the sets and wardrobe are amazing, Preston's white suit, which resembles the morning suit of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury, Gives a certain shine to action, it pretty much gives a splendor. With its Mistakes it still worth owning, classic modern science fiction at it's best.Some of the Mistakes***Warning Spoilers Ahead***1) Preston at the end can somehow dodge 1,000 of bullets and still kill everyone with out a scratch.--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Preston is the highest ranking officer, he is pretty much the best...but still come' on..Way to precise2) Partridge is reading a book of Yates; earlier in the movie it's much smaller--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- The angle in which we see the book the first time makes the book look tiny...hey it can be possible3) The character of Brent smiles all the time...Supposedly he takes the dose--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Brent could have not taken the dose at all or his smile is a senseless smile..a soulless smileTrust me it goes on and on with plot holes...but it still has alot of heart and potential. The vest is the acting and not to mention the music, which soars so triumphantly. Too bad there isn't a soundtrack. Anyway as I said, It's a must have even if it has mistakes.MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5"	4.0	""" I have spread my dreams under your feet.

Some say this movie is a rip off of things like Fahrenheit 451, and metropolis.  While in actuality it's a retelling of the story.  It goes like this.In the future, mankind has suffered a third world war.  Knowing that mankind would not survive a fourth, a policy is introduced to curb human emotion so that humans will no longer feel any of the extreme emotions which typically lead to violent conflict.  Or as the movie says, ""at the cost of the soaring high's, we cut off the plummeting lows.""  Now, people who don't take their mandatory emotion depressing drug are labeled ""sense offenders"" and are either summarily executed on the spot, or taken back to the city to be incinerated.The people leading this fight against the priests are the Tetra Gramaton Clerics.  These clerics have spent years mastering a style called the ""gun kata"".  The gun kata is derived from having analyzed thousands of gun fights, and then using mathematical probability to increase lethality of the person using it, while minimizing the clerics chance to be hit.I found the story very compelling as it shows the underlying lesson that without emotion, we aren't really human, as it's the emotion that defines us as human.

I can't think of the last time were I felt so fully immersed in the action on screen, or vested myself in the characters so completely.  The cast was top notch; Christian Bale and Emily Watson shone in the lead, and Sean Bean providing the maximum amount of quality work with a minimum of screen time.Often labeled ""derivative"" in its reviews, ""Equilibrium"" was definitely not a critical favorite; however, most of the criticisms aimed at it were unjust, as the film took a number of disparate influences (American westerns, Huxley, Orwell, The Matrix (itself derived from every HK wire-fu flick since the early 70's), and so on) and reinvented them, imbuing them with a signature that was clearly its own.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A319P50FFUV4RP	Sinthetik Devil	When this movie was released it was bashed by critics as a &quot;Matrix rip-off.&quot; After watching the film, you will find that it is nothing like the Matrix.The stories are not similar in the least bit, and the action scenes are quite different. The action in Equilibrium uses no bullet-time, hardly any slow-motion, and is edited using fast cuts. The introduction of the &quot;Gun Kata&quot;(martial arts using guns as extensions of the body) make the scenes fresh and break from the stale &quot;Matrix&quot; formula that has been ripped off countless times in other films.The plot in Equilibrium is simple, and deals with the concept of humanity. After WWIII, the nations agree that human emotion is what causes war, so all emotions and things that may incite them are deemed illegal. A drug called Prozium is used to suppress emotions, and a division called the &quot;Teragrammaton&quot; is created as a policing force, dispatching its &quot;clerics&quot; to eliminate all &quot;offenders&quot; who refuse the Prozium. Christian Bale plays Preston, a cleric who becomes conflicted between his duty and his humanity. The movie grabs pieces from many dystopian classics such as 1984 and Farenheight 451 and pieces them together to form a truly original work.Kurt Wimmer pulled off a miracle, considering he only had a 20 million dollar budget to work with. 20 million is probably how much Keanu's hairdresser got paid for the ridiculously over-budgeted Matrix Reloaded. This movie has far more substance and is a better film than Reloaded...and I was shocked to see Neo's outfit for the sequel. It looks EXACTLY like the Grammaton Cleric suit from Equilibrium.

The premise of the movie is that human kind decided to medicate itself into oblivion to bring about peace and finds that it's lost its soul.  Lots of story twists and well done violence, kung fu fighting and gun play.  The story line was well thought out once you get beyond the ignorant moral lesson they so badly attempted to make about the value of artwork.  Special note to Christian Bale.

I heard so many people say ""better than the Matrix,"" that I was thinking ""Existenz"" all over again.  Besides, though there have been unfortunate moments in the Matrix (i.e. orgy scene in second flick) it's a solid movie with overall great acting and action, and one of the most original treatments of the subject matter in cinematic history.To my surprise, I actually enjoyed this movie!  I fail to see where the Matrix comparison comes in, however.  The action is different, no one flies or dodges bullets (in the traditional sense), and the explanation for supernatural ability is scientifically precise martial arts (with guns!).  The subject matter is different; here people struggle with feelings, not machines.  Despite the potential for cliched dialogue (i.e. Bobby Robot: ""what's that wetness rolling down your cheek""  Cindy Human: ""It's called a tear""), they actually handled it with as much grace as possible.If you like sci-fi and action, check this out.

Instead, I became a huge advocate of the movie and have introduced numerous people to it. This movie is that based in a setting that's getting more and more common of the police state. The regime in this case has locked people down to the ""curing"" human emotion. Very well made movie, I highly recommend it. It also has very little ""inappropriate content"" (note though, it IS rated ""R"" for violence), although the sexual content is pretty minimal and all is in good taste.There are a few ""troubling"" scenarios that will elicit some sad responses, but towards the end of the movie you find yourself cheering on the protagonist while still attempting to understand where the regime is coming from. It really has you thinking (which I'd argue is a good thing... although it does mean that potentially you would have to be ""awake"" to enjoy the movie) but it has great replay value. I don't even want to try to figure out how many times I've watched this movie :) Just put it in, and watch it again!Pros: Quality movie, good acting, great story, well-written plot, decent ""real"" interaction between charactersCons: Low-budget film, and sometimes it becomes well, pretty obvious.Overall, I highly recommend this film, the low-budget issue discussed above ends up really not being important and is more of an ""Oh! I see what you did there..."" sort of moment. Doesn't detract from the film. Good film from a number of different aspects."	5.0	Brilliant!	2012-06-02	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2VCKKQ1RGGL7S	speak04	"Amazon recommended this movie to me and I spent a month trying to track it down at Blockbuster before I was finally able to get my hands on it.  It was certainly worth the wait!  I watched it three times before I returned it to Blockbuster, and I bought it soon after.  It quickly became one of my favorite sci-fi movies.This movie is beautifully made.  It's dark and largely lacks color, but the setting fits the tone and subject of the movie well.  The filming also serves to distinguish the lack of emotion expressed by a majority of the characters and the colorful world of the ""sense offenders.""  Although it's nigh impossible for any actor to pull off a complete and total lack of emotion (though if anyone can do it well, it's Christian Bale), I was thoroughly impressed by the skill of the actors.  Being the type of person I am, I watched the movie the first time looking for slips in character where the actors betrayed an emotion, and was disappointed to find some.  I was thrilled at the end to discover that they weren't slips at all, but clues to the complex personalities of the characters and all furthered the story.  Bale and Diggs make an excellent pair, and Watson and the child playing Bale's son were very effective characters.  The casting of this movie is quite good.I also loved the story.  The subject matter is appealing to me in general, but I was particularly impressed by the specific plot of this movie.  I loved the idea that people chose to suppress emotions, have propaganda spewed at them incessently, and kill their family members and neighbors when they didn't conform.  It's much like what's happened in the US recently or in the USSR 50 years ago - people giving up their freedoms for the illusion that they are safe and protected from harm.  The fall of Bale's character, the elite member of the policing agency enforcing the emotionless state, is particularly moving.  The scene where Bale discovers the basement full of sentimental objects and breaks down upon hearing Beethoven will stick with me forever.  I was so blown away by the display of emotion Bale managed in that scene.Aside from the great visuals and deep story, this movie is entertaining as an action movie.  The mix of gun fights and martial arts is fun, the special effects wonderful, and the story moves right along.  All in all, this is a great movie, and one I would recommend to anyone who likes post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies or is interested in seeing and intelligent action movie. You won't be disappointed."	5.0	an intelligent sci-fi movie for action lovers	2005-12-27	7	7	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A190ULBADVW4ZC	Spencer	Equilibrium is a great flick to pick up if you want to just kick back and watch a pseudo mindless action film.  Obviously, if you delve too deeply into trying to examine all the various nuances of the characters, plot, or action (ex. How come all the rebels die like flies in the beginning when they were supposedly some fairly well outfitted resistence cells?  After a torch is taken to the Mona Lisa [which is also a few square feet too large in comparison to the real deal] the painting sits as if nothing is burning?  How is it that the gun kata were to make any semblence of sense [being as a normally trained gun-wielding individual would probably not be trying to shoot at random vectors, but rather DIRECTLY AT a target]?)And the questions go on and on ...However, none of this really matters if you just sit back and relax, and take it as the mind-numbing action flick that it is.Enjoy!	3.0	Mindless Fun	2004-09-07	4	2	2
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2GGEGQN1GVZNQ	Spytap	"Today I had an epiphany. I invite all followers of cinema to join me.The way is simple. There is a movie out this weekend. You've probably never heard of it. You've probably not seen the trailer.The movie is called ""Equilibrium"" and it will knock you on your [rear]....I invite you to think of a fairly common scenario: You see ... [an awson} trailer and it convinces you to go see that particular movie. What disappoints you is that after the film, you realize that all the really good parts of the film were already in the trailer and you saw them coming a mile away. Here is a new one: The trailer for ""Equilibrium"" kicked your [rear]... You sit down in the theater. You watch the movie. It is something new. It is smart. It is shot in a way that resembles but surpasses ""The Matrix"" and the action sequences are of a kind you've never seen before. Before it even has ended you already want to see it again. You want to watch the opening sequence and almost fall out of your chair just like the first time. But then the end comes. The last sequence. The final showdown. You can't bear to have it end. This is amazing. This is surreal. This is everything you've ever wanted an action movie to be; Extremely well written, smart, kinetic without resorting to wires or bullet time: pure, physical movement that surpasses even the most scripted Jet Li movie. You're riveted. Enthralled. This is new, exciting and so far beyond even what you expected that it can't end, you don't want it. You have to see the rest, but yearn to watch it again already. This was my afternoon.This film is something special. Unique. It's science fiction, with the intelligence and character of ""Gattaca,"" but the stylings of the most hyperkinetic Hong Kong action film. It's low budget, shot in 20 days, and yet will make you think, react, and emote to the characters, plot, editing, and generally the whole film as a whole.What am I saying? I'm saying this: Most of you in the next couple weeks were planning on seeing a movie. You go often, but not all the time, and usually exit the theater apathetic, sometimes smiling, but normally underwhelmed maybe even asking yourself why you wasted the money. Here is a film that has little to no studio support and will blow your [rear]... back into your seat. It's what you've wished you could have seen on screen each time you plopped down those eight to ten bucks and walked inside. This film is different. Go see this film. ""Equilibrium"" is worth it, and since you're going anyway, go this weekend. Support this film, let it kick your [rear].... You WILL thank me later. It IS worth your money.Watch the trailer. See the movie. This is what you've been waiting and yearning for."	5.0	Equilibrium Theatrical Review	2002-12-09	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A188WS5DMQBGXC	S. Rook	I would describe this as Farenheit 451 meets John Woo (with some influence from Matrix and maybe even Total Recall).The Gun-Kadas are what make the action so engrossing (basically a martial arts/statistic fighting style taught to the Grammaton Clerics - elite troops of the Librians - which teaches how to use guns to maximize the damage while keeping the clerics safe from return fire).  Actually when you watch the fighting scenes you get the impression that it was also influenced by the fast-paced fighting within most Anime.The whole thing with everyone being doped up on an ultra-prozac was a nice message about our current culture (using drugs as an easy way to solve the underlying problems).This movie came out quite recently but the film 'looks' a bit older - not shiny but more grainy quality to it (looks like it was produced in mid-nineties I think), which actually makes it more effective.  The casting was well done, all the actors performed admirably - I was quite surprised by the number of actors I could recognize in the film especially considering how little press it got.I'm quite surprised by how little advertising was done for this movie.  I'm sure it'll be a sleeper-hit but they should at least show some commercials first.  I only heard of it through a friend, and I'm quite happy to have taken his advice and rented it (although I vaguely remembered seeing a commercial for this flick after watching the whole thing).Anybody who likes action or dystopia type movies should watch this.  It stands on its own, its got its own style which can't be said of all recent movies ...  This was a fun movie that I will probably own soon.	5.0	Excellent Action, Good Story	2003-05-30	0	0	0

I don't remember ever seeing any press on this movie, and I only picked it up after watching just about every other sci-fi ever made. I was very surprised to find that this is a movie I could watch over and over.One thing I found impressive was the creation of a very different vision of the future. The sets and costumes along with the culture combined to create a believable world. The story grabbed me in and kept me interested. I found myself really caring about what happened to the main characters. As the story unfolded I found the action sequences to be incredibly choreographed with a form of battle combining guns and movement that I've never seen anywhere else. It was a combination of really exciting action and good story telling.This is a movie that's easy to overlook, but I recommend it to any real sci-fi fan.	5.0	A favorite flick - highly recommended	2008-09-26	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"The future - in order to stop the negative actions stemming from certain human emotions like anger and fear, the powers-that-be have long since decided that emotion must be taken out of the equation.  And in the world of ""Equilibrium"", it's gone - not just the 'negative' emotions but all emotion and feeling - love, passion, joy, compassion, conscience - banned and supressed by the mandatory administering of emotion-blocking drugs.  A class of law enforcement officers known as 'clerics' are charged with tracking down and destroying books, films, works of music, paintings, 'interactive computer programs' and all other works from the past that are deemed to have the potential to trigger emotion.  These are designated 'Emotional Content' (abbreviated EC-10, in an apparent dig at the alphanumerical ratings - 'PG-13', '16-UP', NC-17', 'M', etc. - that currently adorn movies, CDs, video games, etc. and that will probably be applied to novels, groceries, and a host of other products in the near future) and they still exist in fair abundance in the ruined areas outside of the world's cities, and sometimes carefully hidden away inside the cities as well.  Outside the cities is also a refuge for a number of people who've fled the ultra-regimented society in order to avoid being forced to take the drugs which block emotion.Through a series of events - some of which is brilliantly left open to interpretation to distinguish between coincidence and sub-concsious intent - a cleric named John Preston (Christian Bale) ends up missing doses of the emotion-suppressant and quickly beginning to feel again; and with it, to question: another taboo in this future world.  Preston is to end up being a key player in the simmering war between ultimate authoritarianism and free emotion.The action is tremendous; sort of Matrix-styled but actually outdoing it; and very impressively the movie actually shows how the system of seemingly impossible fighting used by the clerics was developed through enormous computer analysis and simulation applied to the machine-like properties of an emotionless human mind.  The whole movie is eerily believable, with the possible exception of some aspects of certain events toward the end - not that they happen, but more the way they happen.  The ideas behind ""Equilibrium"", though, feel amazingly plausible all the way through."	4.0	Disturbingly Believable Concepts, Astounding Action, And Great Storytelling	2006-10-24	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A5LFTRW0IAJ9N	Stephen J. Carter	Every story has it. No movie can succeed without it. What am I talking about? A story's Inciting Incident. It's the setup that launches the characters on their journey. In Equilibrium, a perfect society is depicted, and the movie's theme asks whether such perfection will have extreme hidden costs. In this case it's the suppression of emotion through technology and police state tactics. No emotion, no discord or conflict, therefore peace in our time. The hero, Cleric's, recurring question, concerns the suppressed role feelings can have in his life, and whether a society that eradicates them comes at too great a cost.The Inciting Incident comes along when Cleric suspects his partner and best friend, Errol Flannery, of sense offenses. He apprehends Flannery in a factory reading a proscribed book of poetry by Yeats. Cleric executes Flannery, as per a new directive from Father. This changes his life as the seed of emotion (Yeats' poetry) has been planted in Cleric's path.Does the film fulfill the promise of such a setup? Overall, yes, but not in any startling or unusual way. I enjoyed this movie because it has big aspirations that are almost fully met. This is a competent bit of filmmaking, with well-drawn characters and a fairly good plot.	3.0	Brother's Keeper	2014-05-17	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"What would you get if you crossed ""Brave New World"" with ""Fahrenheit 451"" and shot it in the style of ""The Matrix""?  A capably made second-tier sci-fi flick called ""Equilibrium"".  It's the post-apocalyptic dystopian near-future and, as always, the tyrannical authorities are to blame.  This time, they've decided that human emotion is the cause of all our social ills, so the population is doped up on mood equalizers and a priestly crew of gun-toting clerics enforce the dose.  But what happens when one of their own starts skipping his needles and questioning his role?  ""Equilibrium"" is a reasonably successful effort, especially impressive when you consider it was shot for a mere $20 million.  It's helped by a strong cast and a solid pace, but let down by the single factor that usually undermines dystopian fantasies of repression and rebellion: it's all about what's going on inside the hero's head.  That's easy to explore in a novel, but in film it's harder to represent.  Bale can really act, which helps, and Yeats, Beethoven and a puppy are all called into play, but it's never quite enough.  Writer/director Wimmer and the Weinsteins obviously decided that teenaged boys were this film's audience, and so were more intent on delivering ludicrous (though spectacularly choreographed) action sequences and multiple plot twists than on building interesting characters or emotional intimacy with the crowd.  It's doesn't help that Kurt Badelt's score is insistently melodramatic when what this film really needs are a few quiet moments of emotional engagement; more well-written scenes and less musical montage.  It's fun, but for a film about the importance of emotion over slavish obedience, it's a surprisingly formulaic and unmoving affair.  So long as he can resist turning it into a cinematic Norman Rockwell painting (e.g. the appalling ""The Majestic""), Frank Darabont's new version of ""Fahrenheit 451"" should show us all how it's really done."	3.0	Derivative, but still fun	2003-12-27	6	2	4

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A6R8XUE6MJLMC	Stuart Winer	Basically this movie is full of flaws.It's derivative of a half dozen better films.  It kills off some of it's major characters before the ending - and not secondary ones - key ones who we care about.The premise is overly simplified and highly suspect.The fight scenes are so unrealistic that they border on ridiculous.  The formula and story arch are too obvious.I still quite enjoyed it. The movie had a consistency that really felt solid. The main characters are like Plato's cave-dwellers coming in to the light.  Their revelation felt real on a certain level.The film also had a philosophical statement that resonated.  Most movies are not so ambitious, and frequently fail because they don't say anything.  Godzilla and the Time Machine come to mind.The Matrix 3 succumbs under it's own weight because whatever it was saying has become too confusing and thus meaningless.Mr. Wimmer is not a great movie maker, but I enjoy his work.I hope he gets another project.	4.0	It Grows On You	2003-11-11	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1YTKOANOPL16H	StvnPrc	This film is so bad I do not want to bother to write bad things about it.I don't know where to start.Totally lacking in perspective and imagination.Premise: Eradicating all humans with emotions?REally? We need yet another reminder of how ghastly humans act?there is nothing else to being human.Not a bad question to start with but to frame it in nothing but wholesale slaughter and destruction is, well, sociopathic or psychopathic. Either way it is without emotion.the premise to me is grandiose and utterly absurd in every respect.Humans cannot understand the world without emotion.Humans, who are not mentally ill, cannot as a matter of reality, judge anything without emotion.This is another portrayal of the darkness of humanity with no redeeming quality. To me THIS is porn.I have no doubt you have something better to do than watch this film. A root canal maybe?	1.0	Derelict script and a plotless plot. . .	2013-08-01	2	1	1

That speaks volumes about the clarity of Ebert, and the obliviousness of mainstream movie criticism.Equilibrium is The Matrix with a brain, and a heart, and better action sequences, and better acting. It is visually riveting from the opening to the closing scene, and it includes at least 2 very surprising plot twists.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A36QIW5YNZZHZ3	Switchblade Metalman	"Christian BaleTaye DiggsDominic PurcellSean Bean""Equilibrium"" is a life changing movie and only God knows why it wasn't in the theaters.  For you readers out there, combine the ideology of George Orwell's ""1984"" with the combativeness of ""The Matrix"" and you get this excellent genre-defying  movie ""Equilibrium.""Summary:  Bale is a First Class Cleric of the ""Grammaton Cleric"" in the fascist world of our future.  His job is to eradicate any form of art or rebel that creates/encourages emotion, thus his job is also entitled the ""Thought Police"".  To help people to have no emotions, Prozium is made to have in the form of a shot everyday.  Of course, Bale forgets his dose and soon becomes one of the ""rebels"" he has once hunted.  His eyes have been opened to the loss of his loved ones, to music, and to friendship.  His mind has been filled with the meaning of music, art, and color and now he must avenge those he has sworn to eradicate...........Man, even my own review gets me pumped up about watching the movie again!!  There's amazing fight scenes that will displace images from ""The Matrix"" out of your mind, and a storyline that will have your heart skipping beats 'til the end.  In some scenes you'll think it's over, but you'll realize that it's not.  GET THIS MOVIE!!!!Sean Bean fans are not going to like the first ten minutes of the movie....trust me, I'm a fan of him.  But hopefully, like me, you'll get over it fast.John"	5.0	Finally  the critics are right - BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!	2006-01-21	4	3	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2A0ERUK2ETVNS	Sybarite	I'm not going to detail the plot, but this has honestly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Christian Bale manages to portray a man attempting to hide his emotions and yet racked with newfound feelings, sensuality, and guilt in a way that is both heartwrenching and joyous. This movie reminds us to be more aware of the beauty, art, pain, and even ugliness that surrounds us. It reminds us that without expression, interpretation, and awareness we are not really living, that we take for granted our senses and the things we enjoy and also dislike. Regardless of the flimsyness of certain parts, or the borrowing of familiar themes from novels and movies, this is a fantastic and honest attempt to make us aware of our lives, to renew discovery without and within ourselves. It emphasizes the yin & yang idea that there is a balance, and you can't rid yourself of evil completely without also losing what it is that makes things good. free speech and expression goes both ways, and the good can not be extracted from the bad as if it were some seperate entity.Beautiful movie.	5.0	Excellent Movie!	2003-05-28	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A5PF9QBTBIYYE	SYED-RAFAY AHMED	"I can understand the urge to compare ""Equilibrium"" and ""The Matrix"". Both films feature dark, foreboding cinematography. Both films are about rebellion against a warped reality. Both films feature a reluctant, messianic protagonist. And, finally, both films rely heavily on stylistic, hyper-kinetic combat scenes that can only be described as, well, reverent. That is where the similarity ends because while ""Equilibrium"" has a few moments of slow-motion it's action scenes are much more original than those of ""The Matrix Trilogy"". No Wires, just pure crazy choreography which makes the action feel all the more authentic. The environment is also a great deal more organic in contrast to the cryptic automaton of the Matrix.""Equilibrium"", in short, manages to be entirely its own movie. Where The Matrix relies on ""bending"" the rules of physics in an imaginary construct of a world, ""Equilibrium"" goes the other way and hypothesizes the ""Gun-Kata"", a martial arts ballet that allows it's practitioners to predict and anticipate close quarters gun fighting and hand to hand combat. Then, through a series of precise, dance like movements, a person  can take on several combatants, using exacting, fluid actions to eliminate his attackers. Given a decidedly artistic presentation within the course of the film, these rapid-fire rhapsodies are exhilarating and oddly beautiful. They glamorize death as an abstract expression of powder bursts and shrieking projectiles. The film features some of the best choreographed shootouts I have ever seen, and ends up putting anything in The Matrix Trilogy to shame.""Equilibrium"" is a film that explores what it theorizes to be the root of all worldly chaos, human emotion. The movie takes place in the near future after a third world war that leaves Earth on the verge of total destruction. From the ashes arises a government that regulates everything and everyone through mind control. The drug Prozium is hailed as the elixir to the world's problems because it suppresses human emotion and thus eliminates the possibility war. All art, music, poetry and any emotion are considered contraband and must be destroyed upon discovery.The primary clash is between individualism and collectivism -- the notion that each person is an end to him or herself and pursues his or her own happiness, and the theory that the individual exists only to further the interests of the state. In ""Equilibrium"", the side of ""feelings"" (the side that promotes painting, music, and literature) is the side of the sovereign individual.The film clearly suggests that emotions -- the ability to ""feel"" -- are what make life worth living; yet they are also the source of violence and war. At some level, this is clearly true. The joy of art, the intensity of romantic love, the pleasures of a touch or the sight of a sunrise, the fascination of a great idea -- these are the things we live for. ""Crimes of passion"" such as murder, domestic violence, and assault generally involve uncontrolled emotions.In ""Equilibrium"", murder and war among the civilian population have been wiped out. Of course, they have been replaced by state-sponsored murder and terror. Thus, the film points out the real purpose of deadening people's emotions is to perpetuate state oppression.This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father, and enforced by a quasi-religious order of ""Clericks,"" whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on ""sense offenders"" who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile.John Preston (Christian Bale) is the perfect Grammaton Clerick (the government is known as the Tetragrammaton). He kills ""sense offenders"" without passion or guilt ... until he inadvertently fails to take his prescribed tranquilizer dose and events begin to catch up with him. Little by little, he finds himself drawn into ""sense crime"" and then into the resistance. I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of ""Equilibrium"", jammed as it is with surprise and invention -- suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit.The creators of ""Equilibrium"" had to take some liberties with the very idea of emotion, of course. The drug really only eliminates the ""highs"" and ""lows,"" leaving enough emotive strength for the characters to retain ambition and a visceral hatred of their enemies. Plot means conflict and human conflict is impossible without emotion.The acting is excellent, and if you like Christian Bale as much as I do, he shines above all else. Bale is truly exceptional in bringing a real sense of emotional conflict to the character of Preston, and as the film moves on he gradually brings that emotion to the forefront. At the start of the film, and in it's many flashbacks, Preston is supposed to be this emotionless killer that doesn't realize he's actually feeling subtle emotions. Bale's performance keeps the perfect monotone voice of an emotionless character, but in his eyes shows the doubt, remorse and anger. Then as the films moves on he gradually starts changing his tone of voice, allowing the monotone to falter in key moments, until in the end he completely releases all of his emotions.As you can tell, Equilibrium's plot draws from a rich variety of sources. There's a lot of Orwell's ""1984"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"".True, there are a few minor plot problems, but any movie that treats ideas and symbols seriously these days is a find, and one that pulls off a serious treatment of life's most fundamental questions in the context of a gripping story is a rare jewel.""Equilibrium"" is not science fiction so much as political speculation. It's that mainstay of movies, the cautionary tale, twisted into a decidedly dense and deceptive action thriller. While it may not always deliver in the thought department, we sure get some wonderful visual flourishes. And if a sci-fi film can stir your imagination, it's won most of the battle.The creation of the enigmatic weapons battle dance, ""Gun-Kata"", makes the movie a see at least once exercise in speculative movie making."	5.0	A Superb Exercise in Speculative Film Making	2004-03-06	398	355	43
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3OMPSEVL59ZDK	"Sylo ""Sylo"""	"I read all the underground buzz about this film being a neglected scifi film that was excellent. I remember such films as Dark City and Donnie Darko receiving the same acclaim and to that I decided why not discover another unknown film to add to my collection and spread the good news about to others. Maybe I was a bit too hyped over it, maybe I expected more gun fights, or maybe it was the all too similar aspects between this and the Matrix that leads me to say it may not be all it's hyped up to be.The action IS really cool but don't expect alot of it, I did enjoy that it wasn't all karate like most action films today, it reminded me of the gun totin days of Chow Yun Fat in such films as Hard Boiled and The Killer. It certainly follows the Matrix formula. Philosophy + Action + SciFi = ??? Well I don't know what it comes out too, it certainly takes after such books as Brave New World and Farenheit 451. At times it works but with such scenes as the puppy scene you wonder if their trying too hard to make us understand what it is to FEEL.The acting was decent although inconsistent. If the Cleric (and everyone else) do not know emotion. How come Tay Diggs grins through out the whole movie, I wanted to slap him and say ""Hey your not supposed to feel emotion dummy stop smiling!"" Last time I checked, anger, wit, and suspsicion, are all EMOTIONS. The acting is not at all consistent with the idea of having no emotion. Even the villian shows anger, which again, is an emotion. Maybe their was too much Dashboard Confessional played on the set, who knows. Those little things did bother me but if you ignore them than the few moments of genius matched with the few and far between action sequences (which are very cool) than you have a decent movie that in no way matches the wit of Donnie Darko, or the gothic atmospher of Dark City, and let's face it steals alot of it's look from every scifi movie ever made.A noteworthy mention is a really great audio commentary by Director Kurt Wimmer. He honestly and boldly confronts all the criticism he's heard about the movie and even admits to many of the mistakes he made in the film. He addresses alot of my concerns with the logic of the no emotion thing and after hearing his explanation for them they don't seem to  bother me as much (Tay diggs smiling, the villian gettin angry). It's a great commentary for would-be film makers because he focuses on his first  time directing and the techniques he used. It's one of the most earnest and humbling commentaries I've heard in awhile and it's definetly worth hearing. (Unlike most directors  who seem full of themselves)It's worth watching at least once, but don't go in expecting to ""Forget the Matrix"" as the cover suggests. It's decent SciFi and I will enjoy it on repeat viewings despite it's flaws."	3.0	Equilibrium is a bit off balance.	2003-05-11	5	2	3

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1CP3DNC1Z3K6H	Tal	While movie came out around the same time as the Matrix, and as a result they will share some cinematic methods of the period that other movies used bits and pieces of, like Ultraviolet or Aeon Flux (the movie), it is still its own movie. If you're patient enough to look beyond the action scenes, you can see a much deeper storyline that gets into what sort of society we would be without the freedom of emotion, and how artistic culture that defines various world cultures and human history were just tossed aside for the sole purpose of continuing the species, and not actually enjoying life and living.The narrative style and camerawork that focuses on the protagonist's changing worldview after the first third of the movie does a great job allowing him and the viewer to realize the fallacies of this supposed utopian/dystopian society. The music in some scenes just matched right up as well.And yes, the Gun Kata of the Grammaton Clerics.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AMIOLJHCQHGBE	"T. A. Wauldron ""iamtoddicus"""	Take these films...Logan's Run (for the hero's ennui), 1984 and Farenheit - 451 (so very very heavy on the F-451), Matrix (for the special effects), and Dark City (for the cinetography), and you have `Equilibrium'.Christian Bale, is a Cleric. A Cleric arrests and kills people who have emotional responses (a la Logan's Run's Sandmen, they even have the same uniforms...). Bale is an excellent mix of Neo (Matrix) and Tom Cruise (he even has the Cruise look) from Minority Report.While the premise is rather weak i.e. emotions and creativity being illegal, punishable by death, citizens are forced to take Prozium, an emmotion suppressant. Any who feel, are exterminated by SWAT-style teams. .The movie is filmed in `blackened color', almost black and white, a la Dark City and Minority Report. Anything in `color' is destroyed (tres symbolic). The first 10 minutes are straight out of Logan's Run but updated (hero kills best friend in line of duty). The populous is surrounded by audio propaganda a la 1984.There is a sad depth when the hero's wife is arrested for `sense offense' because she actually LOVES him, and the portrayal of his emotionless children as products of the state, is absolutely chilling. Death is not remorse, or caring. It is a fast creamation, and a forgotten victim.The best scene, is when Bale realizes his windows are covered with a chromatic, light reducing film. and thears it off to reviel a full color city below him. Very blatantly symbolic, but effective. From there, it is Cruise in Minority report. But much better done. The action sequences are a notch above Matrix. The lighting effects are superb.If you are a fan of any of the films I mentioned, you have to see this movie. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars?- no DTS. And the sound effects would have been much better on my 7.1 system as DTS, than 5.1 Dolby.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3P7ERFJUWNXVN	The Birdman	ever since the matrix came out, anyone who wears long black coats and has gunfights is obviously trying to copy off that movie. no one seems to mention that the look of the Matrix is strikingly similar to the likes of the Crow and the first Blade movie, or that the idea that this world is not the real world was nicked from Jean Beaudrillard. No offence, the Matrix movies were good, but they are hardly the most original concept in the world.Neither is Equilibrium, but that is part of what's cool about it. right througout the movie, you can see that director Kurt Wimmer loves movies like Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and Logan's Run, and has taken elements from them to create a universe which, if you think about it, is not all that impossible. so in essence, it has done the same as thing as the Matrix, but it could not be more different.to begin with, the action is so different. whereas the Wachowskis action scenes were kung fu and gunfights slowed down, Equilibrium puts the two together with the fantastically high concept gun-kata, and uses it in tight little symmetrical bursts of violence that really grab the attention. the climax where John Preston (Christian Bale) goes to kill the main villain is an assault on the senses, and the prelude to the final fight adds in some unexpected but much appreciated gore to the mix.The performances are great, with Bale kung fu kicking Keanu Reeves to death in the acting stakes. He is abley supported by Taye Diggs, whose smirking evil henchman is the perfect contrast to Bale's more emotional performance. Emily Watson is underused as the love interest and there is some great support from Sean Bean and Angus MacFadyen, and Wimmer keeps the pace going while adding some nice touches and unknowing references to other classic films (the Beethoven 9th from Clockwork Orange)unfortunately because of the monster success of the Matrix, this was found to be playing second fiddle in theaters (it wasn't really released in mine), but it is a more than equal to the first Matrix, and is actually better in parts than the sequels. watch this before you take your Prozium shot and be moved by a rockin piece of action cinema.	5.0	For the 100,000,000th time, THIS IS NOT THE MATRIX!!!!	2004-02-25	7	6	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AM7O8PHCPU33P	The Cleric	This movie is my favorite movie of all time. Now you are probably wondering that I am crazy but I am not. This movie is a must see movie. When the matrix came out I was soo syked about seeing it but after I seen this movie I dont want to go see the 3rd matrix. This movie is crazy with the fighting scenes and the story plot are a deadly combination. Though at a point the story gets slow, but it actually helps because it makes you understand whats all that is going on. The fighting scenes are new and different but to be honest when people think its a matrix copy I get offended because its not! its one of those high-low budget films that never came out in theaters but its one of the best movies. And if you think you wont watch it because its on the high-low budget film dont let that fool you I highly recommend this movie to own and to view! Plus Christian Bale is one of the sweetest actors. Basically overall say bye bye to Keanu Reeves say hello to Christian Bale u Rock!	5.0	OMG WORDS CAN'T EXPLAIN IT!	2003-09-13	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ASYKUKD5MW46V	T	It's kinda a sci-fi movie with Big Brother determining that emotions in humans are bad, so it is more peaceful if everyone is drugged up and does the same thing. I did not know what to expect in this movie.  In the first part of the movie I thought it was similar to the movie -1984. but the it got progressively more interesting and it kept me guessing as to how it would end. Great action. Great acting. Great story. I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend.	5.0	Very Entertaining- great	2014-02-24	1	0	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A18XE07OSXB1CZ	The Partridge Family	This is a great movie no matter what other critics say.  When it was released critics gave it bad reviews except for a few.  The concept behind the movie is great, those other critics don't know what they are missing.  It is very Matrix esque, but is much better in my opinion.  The story is very compelling, and it is full of action.  Anyone who likes action movies should see this.  Gun-kata is so awesome.	5.0	Great movie	2003-04-10	2	1	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1AGGTLW74MEUW	The Poe Toaster	You have the plot synopsis from the other reviewers, so I won't waste my time on that. All I'll say is that this is a good film..... much better than I expected it to be considering the fact that it never saw theatrical release (for some reason unknown to me).The &quot;Gun Kata&quot; concept is brilliantly conceived. As a life-long martial artist and gun enthusiast, I have often thought that a martial art like this should be developed in real life to make military and law enforcement officers better gunfighters.The only thing I thought was a little wrong about this flick is that the writer/director doesn't seem to have really thought through the guiding principle behind the totalitarian regime. In this film the totalitarianism is based around the supression of all emotion for the purpose of preventing war, violence, crime, greed, etc. So if the regime is so bent on ending war and violence, why do its law enforcement officials go about gunning down all its criminals without so much as a howdy do?There are a great many things that this fictional totalitarian regime could have been centered on other than suppression of emotion, any one of which would have probably made this a better film. But as it is, this is a good film. This film borrows from other films/books like 1984, Farenheit 451, Brazil, etc. about the horror of technologically advanced totalitarian fascism. It's very disturbing to people who value freedom, because as our society becomes more densely populated and our technology becomes more advanced, we could very well wind up living with cameras and sensors watching our every move and law enforcement officers given the power to arrest, detain and interrogate people for even the slightest hint of disloyalty to the government.I definitely recommend this film to anyone who liked Brazil, 1984, Farenheit 451, or any other movie about futuristic totalitarianism.	4.0	Surprisingly good	2004-03-03	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3GA7T1CNSW09L	"The SciFi Moviebuff ""Piaget Moviebuff"""	"Although it is probably a result of parallel creative writing, this story is markedly  similar to This Perfect Day + Fahrenheit 451. Add in stop motion fight scenes (al a Matrix) and you get this moody cautionary tale. And it was actually quite an intelligent take on where our society seems to be headed... (ie. politically correct thinking and all that). I love the aspects ""borrowed"" from ""This Perfect Day"" the most... the bits about controlling emotions being a crucial step towards peace... because I believe there is an element of truth in that concept. The puppy really won me over though, coming at a slower moving part of the story, I really got hooked on the fate of this dog.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1Y2GZGBMICFG8	The Separator	This is one of my all time favorite movies, yet I have a hard time defending it now as a serious piece of cinema, and I&#8217;m not sure why. It gets low ratings on all the major film sites despite tons of great actions scenes, a huge overarching story line, great attention to detail, and a terrific performance by Christian Bale.The Story: The dictator ruled state of Libria force-feeds its citizens drugs to suppress their emotions, and in fact, feeling emotion is entirely illegal. Punishment is death.Overactive emotions have been known to cause many of humanity&#8217;s previous atrocities and wars, so to vanquish emotion is to therefore benefit humankind. There is a method to the madness; this film is set right after world war III, and emotion suppression is modern humanity&#8217;s solution for preventing world war IV.Of course there are those that do not see this repression as a benefit and so an underground resistance forms. Although the plot is excellently executed, the dystopian theme comes across as just a little bit too close (for some, not for me) to an exact replica of an Orwellian model. Equilibrium has been accused of being unoriginal, a mere mishmash of well-known various Sci-Fi stories.I was never bothered by this mishmash. Examining the film shows there are more than enough original features, features that people must be overlooking when judging, because the originality more than counter balances the borrowed material.The top ranking law enforcement officials are (I think very cleverly) called Clerics. They employ the use a fictitious fighting style called the Gun Kata. The Gun Kata a major part of the film and makes for some amazing scenes. The details about the world are so specific that it really is an amazing accomplishment on writer/director Kurt Whimmer&#8217;s part. Whimmer makes a living mainly as a writer, Equilibrium being one of only two major features he&#8217;s directed.As I said earlier, Christian Bale gives a great performance, handling almost all the fight scenes himself, and due to budget constraints, only being allowed a handful of takes to get each set of complex choreography right. Director Whimmer makes excellent use of light and space, pleading his case for humanity's right to &#8220;feel&#8221; as light peeks through the drab gray tones of the photography, rarely, but just enough.Equilibrium is the biggest box office flop of a film I can think of. For how epic it is, the 20 million dollar budget seems miniscule, but  its total to-date gross is $1.2 million, a totally pathetic ratio. Equilibrium appeared around the same time as the Matrix was doing its thing and so Equilibrium got very little press. The two films share a similar vibe and since Equilibrium came out second, it loses points for originality, and even though The Matrix is undoubtedly a great achievement, Christina Bale is hands-down the better lead (I'm not too fond of Keanu Reeves). Just based on that fact alone Equilibrium is worth checking out.9/10Get more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com	5.0	Totally underrated and misinterpreted	2013-12-31	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	API4RP4TJSS7R	"""thesurereality"""	"This movie was an amazing movie. The entire theatre jumped and cheered in awe of certain ""gunkata"" scenes. The story of the movie was an adaptation of some old classic movie scripts and books but in a very original way. They seemed to be working under a tight budget for scenery but it just added to the cold hard feeling of the set. Also what may at first seem like to be a hole in the movies plot turns out to have been a clue to the real situation. This movie is definetly worth owning and make sure you show it to everyone you have over because unless you tell them they probably will never even know of it's existence.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2X22D5D7BJPZ7	Thomas B. Talbot	This film, a real sleeper, portrays a future totalitarian regime where human emotions are pharmacologically excised and creations that trigger emotions are outlawed.  The protagonist is a 'grammaton cleric', a super-martial artist SS-officer type who enforces this creed.  Our protagonist misses his dose and then explores a new path in his life.I loved this movie for the very interesting martial arts and &quot;gun-kata&quot; action.Equilibrium is not as improbable as the matrix because it is more grounded in realism.  It's premise of a Bradburian Farenheit-451 / Orwellian regime is a bit shallow compared to those works.It you like films about totalitarian regimes or futuristic martial arts violence, you will not be disappointed.  If you are disturbed by movies where body parts are sliced off, look elsewhere.	4.0	Amazing futuristic martial arts action	2004-06-30	2	2	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A34XA75MLU3APY	Thomas B Watson	Equilibrium is basically a modern mix pulling from the motif of Fahrenheit 451 and the action of The Matrix. I enjoyed this film  because it hits on the philosophical argument of what causes man to commit acts of violence against fellow man. Equilibrium is basically a satyr of where humanity would have to go in order for man to stop this primal urge that spawns violence, and how we would have to live in a society that strips away our humanity. Emotion would become a crime because it is the primary factor that leads to violent crime. The protagonist battles with himself through out the movie to determine if the price of emotion and feelings out way the consequences that he realizes they can lead to.  I also enjoy the fact that the action is good but is there to support the plot development, rather then the other way around.	5.0	Equilibrium is a must see	2003-08-26	1	1	0

The fundamental premise of the plot is contradictory. Human emotion causes pain (i.e., war), so we must eradicate everything that stirs emotion (e.g., art, literature, music, etc...). However, it is perfectly acceptable to feel some emotions, such as joy, pride and enthusiasm. Maybe by the end of the movie it is recognized that all emotions co-exist, but I couldn't stop thinking about how it was okay for the &#34;government&#34; to emotionally persuade the populace, but not the individual.	1.0	Nonsensical premise	2013-11-28	2	1	1

Taye Diggs was unconvincing; he showed lots of emotion for someone who wasn't supposed to have any.  And how did Angus MacFadyen's character get so power-hungry?

At first, I wasn't really interested, because of the name...but then I got to see it when one of my friends had me over to watch movies.  I remember being hooked from the first scene on.  I had never seen a martial art with the gun as the central weapon, like the gun kata, before, nor have I seen it since.  What drew me the most to it, however, was not the gun battles or betrayal...it was the immense emotional conflict in Jon Preston, the main character...here was a man who, however accidentally, stopped his dose, and then saw the world with open eyes for the first time...and saw that the world he was loyal to was not what it should be.  He experienced anger, passion, frustration, humor, sadness, suspicion, shock, disgust, happiness, and absolute conviction-being that he knew what the right thing to do was, and then went and did it.  I definitely think that this movie was shafted out of awards, and should actually be recognized as a standard for emotional conflict and action."	5.0	This movie rocks!	2004-10-24	6	5	1

Although the dreaded subject of 'feeling' is considered a crime in this flick, the idea of what positive feelings are is totally ignored. It's as if Libria is more of a cult than a society attempting to quell man's hatred and disdain for his fellow man.The problem with this movie is that it shows one faction of the human race (doped up, unfeeling, murderous automatons) remorselessly killing people who hang out staring at art, when according to ""father"" they should be eradicating despots like Hilter, and racists who commit hate crimes. The makers of this movie either left out or cleverly avoided religion and all its historical crimes thus leaving the true message of the movie vague, if not incomplete.This is a good movie, is well done with solid acting, unpretentious sets, and the necessary tension required of such a tale, but its message is far from clear."	3.0	Good movie, but a lapse in ideology.	2009-08-04	3	1	2

My teenage son brought this movie from the library.Judging from the cover, I was concerned that this would be a low-budget rip-off of the Matrix. (As an aside, some reviewers have protested the comparisons to Matrix. Please. Just compare the jacket covers.)It wasn't a blatant rip-off. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. But it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.To his credit, Christian Bale had some interesting scenes. IMHO, Sean Bean was wasted in this movie. The 'Gun Kata' was, as several other reviewers have pointed out, simply silly.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	Equilibrium is an underground Sci-Fi film with a huge cult following. If you ask any other Sci-Fi geek, they'll probably have Equilibrium in their top ten list, but I couldn't tell you why. The film is vintage Sci-Fi, with a semi-original idea, unfortunately, the cast just didn't pull it off. I've never been a huge Christian Bale fan and this movie is a prime example of why. He's given a role that suites him perfectly and he mumbles and relies on the rest of the cast to carry him. In the future, emotions and things that evoke emotions are outlawed, and Bale is one of the men responsible for enforcing these laws, but he soon turns to the other side, when he accidentally feels an emotion for the first time. Bale is a cold guy to begin with. He never shows much emotion even when his role calls for it, so aside from Keanu Reeves, he was the best choice for this role. The story was a little out there and the effects were over the top, but it's Bale himself who puts the icing on the turd cake. He's completely dependent on his fellow cast members and the ridiculous special effects his character is given. Maybe I'm just not that bright, but I really don't understand why so many people are so obsessed with this movie.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A3O6XJ5BXYPI3M	tommy	I just saw this movie an hour ago..First let me say, I saw that it was on sale on a swedish order-page, so before I ordered I had to read some about it here.It was kinda weird, because I had never heard about it, and that weird considering Im a kind of a movie-buff... movies are my life..The mixed opinions were one thing, but what shocked me was that people either REALLY loved it or REALLY hated it.. rip of matrix and stuff like that..Well this is my opinion..Yes I rated it to be 5, because I simply loved it.. I honestly can't understand why people even compare it to Matrix. I found very little that was Matrix styled. The only thing I can remember was the underground rebells, which you see on a lot of movies, so why bother the compare there?The first movie that struck my mind was Gattaca, it was the same atmosphere.. and wow, what an atmosphere..im NOT gonna go into details about the movie, and i recommend that you just see it without reading any spoiling reviews.This movie was really original, it was kinda original like when I first saw Matrix(but im not comparing the stories) im just saying that it was as surprising as matrix.There is lots of action in the movie, mixed with emotional thoughts. It was a very deep and intense story. It was kinda dark to. This movie has a lot of style. The very crazy and original GunKata was amazing as well, but what really had me hooked was Christian Bales intense and cool acting.I dont care if Neo was the one, I think Christian would have KICKED SOME NEO ASS!!!	5.0	saw it an hour ago!!	2004-05-21	6	5	1
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A38QJ7JUUTVLKX	"Tom Servo ""Robot"""	Love this movie. It's wonderful. A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein, Equilibrium takes a respectable stab at a Fahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic, Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston, a top cop who busts &quot;sense offenders&quot; and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner. The action scenes are extrordinary. This film is so underated, it's unbelievably good. See this. This is what Sci-fi should be.	5.0	Amazing!	2003-10-26	7	7	0

For the longest time I said to myself, ""Self, I enjoy novels of dystopian fascist futures, and John Woo style gunfights, when is someone going to combine the two?"" Finally someone has done that with the marvel that is Equilibrum. The movie, creates a world that pays homage to dystopian novels, example the ever present T is taken out of Brave New World, and Sean Bean's book is the same tha tthe Protagonist in Farenheit 451 first read. The gunfights are amazing and the swordfight at the end is one of the best I've ever seen (so good I enjoyed it again when I saw the same fight in Underworld a few months ago)'Tis a damn shame this movie bombed at the box office, so do yourself a favor and buy this NOW!!!"	5.0	Freakin AWESHOME!!!!!	2003-11-11	2	2	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2EUW3NRLZ210Y	Tony Wolf	Yes, Equilibrium is, overall, a terribly derivative movie (1984, Farenheit 451, etc.) but it contains some truly original concepts and moments.One of director Wimmer's real masterstrokes is the sequence in which the villain DuPont carefully explains the theory behind the Gun Kata - in terms just plausible enough to allow the audience to accept the stunning action choreography.  It's a seductive idea, beautifully executed by stunt choreographer Jim Vickers in all the action sequences.Another particular highlight is the leadup to the final confrontation between Preston and his nemesis, played by Taye Diggs.  Wimmer has carefully established their rivalry to the point where the audience is salivating to see them go head to head ... then he surprises us with a twist ... then stuns us with ANOTHER twist that is, in itself, one of the most original applications of fight choreography I've ever seen.	4.0	Flashes of brilliance	2004-11-25	4	3	1

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1YUZ3PFNAILHW	Traderkos	I loved the original Matrix and violently hated Reloaded because of how good the original was.  The load of philosophical mumbo jumbo in Reloaded made we want to run for the exits.  Any movie where it has to spend long sections explaining itself...well it has issues.  Talk about taking itself too seriously.  For fans, read the Philosophy of the Matrix, let's you appreciate all the subtle nuances of the original.So I had an extreme &quot;Matrix&quot; void, with all the expectations I had waiting for the $300M sequel, that never got satisfied...until Equilibrium.  I agree wholeheartedly with a lot of the reviews that I've read so far on this thread, so I'll try to add to it.This movie was emotionally powerful.  I had wanted to see more movies with Emily Watson after I saw her performance in Punch Drunk Love.  Equilibrium is an excellent love story.  In fact, the director said in the DVD that Equilibrium actually tested better with women than men.For those who haven't seen the movie I might ruin some of the best parts with what I'm about to say, so stop here.I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where the protagonist doesn't successfully rescue the damsel in distress.  When Christian Bale failed to rescue Emily Watson from termination, I was devasted.  Greek tragedies are so rarely a Hollywood friendly script.  I also can't remember the last time I emotionally flipped my view of a character from the son of Christian Bale who most likely reported his mother as a sense offender to his later action to actually save his father from being found out as a sense offender.  Wow, I was also floored.Like many, I had issues with some of the low budget aspects of the film but after you get engrossed (and you will be) in the plot you forget the superficial aspects, like enjoying an episode of Dr Who.  Lastly, the fact that no one knows about the film and it has been a real find has really enhanced it's appeal to me.  Blade Runner was never mainstream when it first came out and it was a financial flop.  It existed as a fringe cult film for the longest time.  I was one of the people who lined up to see all the director's cuts of it when it was first re-released to a limited audience in San Francisco.This was a wonderful film and is definitely one of my favorites.  I so rarely see movies more than once and most movies I wish I didn't see the first time.  However, I continued to review Equilibrium every day 2-3 times until I had to return it...I guess I should buy it.	5.0	What reloaded should have been	2003-07-25	3	2	1

The world rulers learn that the reason for war is overwhelming bursts of emotion and decide that the only way to alleviate the problem is to nullify the ability to feel emotions or attachment to personal items and make it illegal, a crime called a ""sense offense"" that is punishable by death.Those who live in this New World Order, known in the movie as the Tetragrammaton, take a senses-numbing drug called ""Prozium"" (hmmm...sounds like a rather well-known drug that does the same thing now)and the law is harshly enforced by specially trained officers known as Grammaton Clerics, who are trained in the art of the ""gun kata"" (think martial arts with some serious firepower in your hand instead of swords/nunchuks).The most senior Cleric is John Preston (Bale), a father of two whose wife was a ""sense offender"" and was tried and executed for the same crime that he is a fighter of.  One day Preston accidentally misses his dose and while investigating a case, begins to find himself feeling emotions long thought dead and assigned to take down the resistance fighters that want to take down the leader of this Order.  However, the more he gets into the case the stronger his emotions get and he begins to join the fight against the ones he once fought for in the Clerics, all while trying to resist the prying of his new partner (Taye Diggs) into his possible defection.The action sequences are amazing, especially when Preston shows that you can do so much (virtually take down at least 6 people surrounding you) with so little (a space about the size of a manhole cover to stand in), and in the final battle with the leader of the Tetragrammaton, Preston's partner, and Preston himself (let's just say that at one point, someone will learn a whole new meaning to ""face-off"").Bale shows that he can definitely convey a wide range of emotions and actions, and can definitely hold his own in a field of movie that has seemingly been out of his range in the past (Although I assume that this may have been the role that earned him the role of the Dark Knight in the upcoming ""Batman Begins"" next year).And I will admit that there are definite plot slips throughout the movie. How are you going to be able to be angry at someone/smile at someone if you take a drug that is suppress the emotions that would cause you to do that (A seemingly slight slip committed by Diggs twice in the movie)?Nevertheless, if you want to see what the Matrix would look like if the world that it took place in actually existed outside of a computer, then check out Equilibrium."	4.0	Makes you wonder why Christian Bale wasn't in The Matrix...	2004-09-09	4	4	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"Sci-fi flick with stunning visuals, ""Equilibrium"" deserves much more attention not only from fans of genre, but also from general audiences.  Sure, its flaws are too visible, borrowing Orwellian ideas from other films like, say, ""Brazil,"" but it is not that ideas themselves but the way they are put into practice that really counts, and on that score ""Equiliburium"" is a winner.  (And critics, please let me know, why do you all praise Steven's ""Minority Report"" which actually borrows ideas from other films of this genre?  So, why not give this one a due respect?)Well, I admit the opening chapter of ""Equilibrium"" is a bit weak, introducing us to the dystopia world after the WW3, but soon you will forget that.  The totalitarian government established after the war decided to eliminate anything that might possibly make humans emotional, forcing the people to inject a certain doze of [chemical substance] to be unemotional every day. Moreover, it decrees there should be no more music (not only hip-hops, but classic music), no more motion pitures, and no more decorated interiors.  Those who love them hide underground, becoming rebels while the authroity set up a super-cop troop called ""Grammaton Clerics.""Christian Bale (""American Psyco"") is John Preston the best of the Clerics, and dedicates himself to the job until he arrests a woman Mary O'Brien who possessd illegal stuffs.  But her strong creed and perhaps beauty make their way into the sleeping heart of Preston, who has been long fighting for his cause.The film's philosophical messages are in themselves not new at all, and director Kurt Wimmer might have kept his idea a little too long.  I say so, because today, in the 21st century, it is not this Orwellian society that we are afraid of most.  The story has enough twists to surprise us, but maybe one too many, I think, and the wrap-up part of the film feels a bit hurriedly done.However, those are noting before the film's sensational action scenes, which can make up for any flawed part of the film.  The ""Gun-Kata"" fighting deserves special mention, using [weapons] like Japanese swords, and its hyper-kinetic movement is very violent and very beautiful at the same time.  Incredible it might sound, but Christian Bale shows excellent action star quality here, displaying the beauty of ""Kata""s -- and ""kata"" means in Japanese ""style.""  Yes, there are lots of styles in ""Equilibrium.""Other plsyers are also effectively cast, and most unexpected is Emily Watson, who quite naturally becomes the Joan D'Arc-like character.  Taye Diggs is good as Preston's partner, and though short time, Sean Bean, cast against type, is also perfect as Partridge who plays a key role in the story.I was quite surprised and satisfied, and even thrilled to see this neglected film, which should have been more pushed.  Again I say, its actions are sensational.  Not that this is ""Matrix""; rather, it is more unique and has its own ""kata"" = style, which means a lot these days."	5.0	You Should Not Miss These Sensational Action Scenes	2003-04-10	272	241	31
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"After telling a friend about Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451, my friend told me about the movie EQUILIBRIUM and suggested that I see it.  Upon this recommendation, I watched the movie and was not disappointed.EQUILIBRIUM is a movie that takes place in the not-so-distant future. After years of war that have wracked and scarred the planet, a new government has taken control and from all appearances things seem at peace.  The new government keeps order because all forms of Art: paintings, music, literature, etc; have been outlawed and made illegal. To ensure that no Art is produced, a group of specially trained officers known as Grammaton Clerics are trained to find hidden Art, destroy it, and kill those who produce it.  Needless to say, an underground rebellion rises up to fight against the oppression.  The resistance finds their hero in the most famous of the Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale).  Preston was forced to kill his partner, Partridge, when Partridge refused to turn in a book of poetry that had been confiscated.  Through reading those poems, Preston, like a futuristic Apostle Paul, begins to realize the oppression that he has had a help in creating and seeks to set things right.EQUILIBRIUM borrows many elements from the best of sci-fi. The dystopian society reminds one of George Orwell's 1984 or Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451. Preston is in many ways a conglomeration of the firemen in FARENHEIT 451 and Harrison Bergeron from Kurt Vonnegut's famous story. The ""Gun Kata"" martial art that is introduced in the film reminds one of fighting scenes in THE MATRIX.  However, despite all the similarities, EQUILIBRIUM does an excellent job of incorporating this various sci-fi themes and molding them together into something that is original.It's hard to believe that the film went unnoticed in theatres.  The movie has some great acting, good special effects, and great plot and character development. It's a sci-fi movie worth watching."	4.0	The Beauty of Art.	2005-08-28	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AM7FRM994GYOJ	Tyler	I read the reviews and expected something different (of course I am 12-years late to the party..). Still, any comparisons to 'The Matrix' are ridiculous, as this movie is not even close in intention (script) or special effects ('The Matrix', though a few years earlier, was a light year or two more advanced). If comparison must be made: 1995's 'Judge Dredd' was a precursor. Later, 'V for Vendetta' (2005) actually took quite a bit from 'Equilibrium' and did a better job with writing, character portrayal and acting.A note on acting: Christian Bale is always amazing, from one of his earliest 'Empire of the Sun' to 'American Psycho' and did you see 'The Machinist' - dedication to one's craft is not a phrase I commonly use, but WOW!Perception over reality; opening credits forecast a mediocre movie - the font alone. It could have been better, yet it was certainly entertaining and worth the time. If anything I would say that this movie is ripe for a remake.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A38TC59GM2WW1X	"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts"""	"""Equilibrium"" is a visually and psychologically stunning film that nearly puts ""the Matrix"" (which came out around the same time) to shame.  Alas, due to a low-brow marketing campaign (no doubt stemming from lack of studio faith in the movie), Equilibrium is a sadly under-appreciated work.Equilibrium can be enjoyed on two completely independent levels, as either a fascinating, dystopian look at the future, or as an exquisite piece of action par-excellence.  And it is this duality which allows the film to transcend both the standard sci-fi and action movie fare.  Equilibrium combines the very best of both genres, whilst avoiding many of the stereotypes and pitfalls of either.Even the laziest viewers who are most unwilling to work their brains will thoroughly enjoy this movie at its ""basest level"", due to two words:  ""Gun Kata"".  Quite simply, Gun Kata is mesmerising and unbelievable.  I cannot describe it to you in words; you have to see it for yourself.  I don't know how the budget of this movie compares to the Matrix, but the special effects of this film compare favourably, and in some ways put Neo to shame.  According to the film, super law-enforcers known as ""clerics"" have perfected a deadly, nearly invincible art of combat called ""Gun Kata"", which essentially does for guns what martial arts did for other more traditional weapons such as swords.  Think of these clerics as Jedi-enforcers, but for an evil ""Empire"".By using statistical analysis of likely bullet trajectories, combined with full integration of the gun as a martial arts weapon, a gun kata master is able to take down dozens of armed opponents unscathed whilst seeming to not move from his original standing spot.  Onscreen, gun kata will unavoidably earn comparison with bullet time from the Matrix.  However, gun kata is presented in real-time, and that is its strength; it is far faster, more furious, and visceral than bullet-time could ever hope to be.  Prepare to be amazed.Viewers with a bit more brain fluid to spare can ponder on the film's intriguing sci-fi premise and taut, well-paced plot.  After the Third World War, most of civilisation was apparently destroyed, and the surviving government decided that humanity could not possibly survive a fourth.  It was determined that emotion is the root of all evil and war.  Thus, to eliminate war, humanity must eliminate emotion; by sacrificing the ""good"" emotions of love and euphoria, we gain peace and order because we have also eliminated hate, anger, and intolerance along with them.  This starts to sound like a perverted version of the teachings of the Jedi Council from Star Wars.  The citizens of this city state of ""Libria"" are thus forced to take an emotion-suppressing drug called Prozium.  All works of art, literature, etc. (including the Mona Lisa, incinerated in the opening scene of the movie) which could potentially encite emotion are judiciously destroyed, and all ""sense-offenders"", those who either traffick these illicit items, or refuse to take their medicine, are hunted down by the clerics and ""processed"" (executed).Enter a pre-Batman Christian Bale, who portrays the top-ranking cleric of this police-state, whose Prozium capsule breaks one morning, and decides to skip a dose.  This of course changes his life, and determines the plot for the rest of the film.  Bale is perfect in this role, starting out as an (understandably) wooden ""tin man"" who slowly regains his ""heart"" through the course of the movie.  Emily Watson, Bale's ""obligatory"" love interest, is likewise a strong addition to the cast.  Their love story is done in a very subtle and undercut way, one that furthers both the plot and character development, which is more than I can say for most movies these days.  Bale's partner is played by Taye Diggs, who is brilliant in this film, if for no other reason than his enigmatic, Cheshire-cat grin which makes you wonder how much he knows, and what he's up to.  Diggs' arrogance grows throughout the film, until he too, like Bale's character, becomes ""feeling"", but with very different results.  Character development is exceedingly strong in this film, and all of it is exceedingly delicious to watch.The world of ""Equilibrium"" is one filled with hypocrisy, lies, and dirtiness.  However, like most dystopian scifi films, there is also hope behind the grime.  In the end, the human spirit triumphs, and that is what gives this movie its heart and appeal.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2NGP8D4WDTTQA	Vlad	Equilibrium was a surprisingly good movie. It does borrow elements from 1984 and other dystopian future stories, but it has a fairly good plot, good acting (Christian Bale) and some kick-ass fight scenes. Although overshadowed by other sci-fi blockbusters (ex. The Matrix), this is a good way to spend two hours.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	I am not a huge Sci-Fi fan but I must admit I enjoyed the message this movie contained.Christian Bale does an excellent job in this film as the one intelligent person in a dead society who is willing to question an authoritarian system. His acting is found within his eyes, the only bright spot on a face tightened by a society that kills emotion. Some of the fight scenes are a bit &quot;Matrixey&quot; without all the over-priced special effects. Bale's scenes with the puppy will grab at your heart!The concept of this film stays along the lines of the &quot;Matrix,&quot; &quot;Metropolis,&quot; &quot;1984,&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; exposing the horrors of controlled societies. The government controls people in this film by a drug that removes all emotion from their lives, no anger, no fear, no sadness, no laughter and no love. Great art is burned and hidden by the underground who would rather die than live without beauty and emotion. Everything is mechanical, clothing is uniform and dull, relationships are for the growth of the species and crime is punished by a horrible cremating death. The story is facinating but don't fall into line with the robots instead fight for passion, like Christian Bale, without the guns of course!	4.0	Rage Against The Machine	2004-06-19	7	5	2

Apparently, Equilibrium has gotten hammered pretty mercilessly by the so-called professional &#34;expert&#34; critics out there, but all I can say is that, despite the rather typical post World War III Dystopian sci-fi setting, I enjoyed Equilibrium a lot.  Christian Bale brings his wonderfully dark, intense presence to his character and, of course, kicks some major butt in the process in ways that are, of course, impossible for even the most magnificently trained martial artist.  Despite that, it is just a lot of fun to watch the imaginative action sequences.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A196VF41WPAUSM	"Wes G. Coon ""ph4yke"""	Ok, So I just read 10 perfect reviews for this movie and figured I'd put in my two cents.There are so many similarities between this and the matrix that it's hard to ignore, and made it difficult for me to take the movie seriously. Considering this movie came out right after the matrix, you think they could have gone out of there way to separate it a little better. Lets see what we have.Protagonist with dark slicked back hair? Check.Black main character with shaved head and black suit? Check.Gunfight scene in a long hallway with people blasting bullets through pillars? Check.Obligatory sword fight scene for sake of looking cool when guns would have worked just as well? Check.Plot revolving around the human race being mind controlled after the apocalypse and the hidden network of people who resist being hunted down? Check.Obligatory hard electronic music playing during fight scenes? (It seemed a little out of place, nothing any of the characters would listen to.)Ok, basically you're watching the same movie. The fighting scenes were good, but over the top. Nothing really new, though lacking the effects that propelled The Matrix. There's also a really cheesy scene with a puppy.There's also something else, since this movie is based around emotion being outlawed, that's what you get through the movie. All characters are more or less one dimensional. Nobody laughs in this movie, no bickering, no reactions or real exchange of dialogue outside of the action. I know this was the point, but perhaps it was done a little TOO well, because in the end I had no attachment to any of the characters.All in all it's a decent sci-fi movie, but there are so much that I've enjoyed more. You would probably enjoy this alot more if you hadn't seen the Matrix, but in that case, you'd enjoy the Matrix better. It's done this before, and got it right.PS.

This film is unfortunately compared to the Matrix too often, when it stands on it's own.  The movie contain much of the story line from Fahrenheit 451 and overtones of A Brave New World.  A futuristic glimpse at tyranny, a nod to classic literature, good actors, and a good action director make this film well worth seeing.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A15U46ZENEHGTH	Wicked_Smaht	"It's hard to understand, exactly, why this film has so many supporters and not enough detractors. This film attempts to mix together every half-handed, lazy attempt at ""deep"" sci-fi ideas into one incomprehensible (and staggeringly ridiculous) film. The plot is essentially a mash-up of Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, 1984 and silly fight scenes ala The Matrix (a film that this piece of crap is destined to be endlessly compared to). While neither The Matrix nor Equilibrium is entirely original in its presentation of original material, this film suffers from a severe heavy-handedness that The Matrix largely avoided... that is, until the two miserable sequels were created in an attempt to completely bombard you with pseudo-religious allegory. But anyways, The Matrix has its own problems, none of which are as severe as this film's problems. First, there's the basic premise: that human emotions are the cause for all of society's ills and, as such, must be controlled and maintained in order to avoid any further outbreak of war. How is this accomplished? By having society endlessly doped up on ""Prozium"" (which is as thin as a metaphor for any film-related item I've heard until James Cameron dropped ""Unobtanium"" on us) which neutralizes all human emotion. However, so many of the characters in this film react emotionally that it busts this premise right from the get-go. Several characters are shown smiling (Taye Diggs' character in particular seems to really be enjoying his job), reacting angrily (the government appears to be pretty bloodthirsty when it comes to ""sense offenders"" - yet another term I can't stop laughing at whenever someone mentions it in the film) and acting surprised (one guard drops an f-bomb when he realizes the fit is about to hit the shan). These are all emotions. Already, this simple premise is doo-doo. Next up is some gun-fu, which admittedly, does look pretty cool, but is entirely dependent upon the targets standing motionless in a line or a circle for it to work properly (speaking of, what military personnel in their right mind would stand in a circle in order to shoot a suspect? Apparently, the concept of crossfire has been lost in the future. However, since these guys are mostly cannon fodder, it doesn't really matter. Seriously, I haven't seen a military force this inept since the stormtroopers from the original ""Star Wars"" who also couldn't hit the broadside of a barn.) Want some other gaping plot holes? This film's got a-plenty: ""Father"" is so paranoid of assassination attempts that almost no one is allowed to see him directly without being disarmed or at the mercy of snipers - however, since a pat-down is also a foreign concept in the future, no one bothers to actually make sure that Christian Bale has no weapons when meeting with him. Also, there are no snipers present... ever. Additionally, all of ""Father's"" elite guards are pretty easily dispatched (they also subscribe to the tactic of lining up in a circle, waiting to be killed.) The entire premise of an emotionless society is pretty loosely enforced, considering most people have to take their ""Prozium"" themselves and it's pretty easy to pretend like you are even when you aren't. Books, music and artwork are considered outlawed and are immediately destroyed in this dystopian future... that is, unless you work in the department that decides what is outlawed, in which case statues and ornate architecture are okay for display in your central offices. In the future, most of the sense-inducing outlawed art, books and music are pre-1950, with very little of the last 50 years having survived (which seems highly unlikely considering that there's not an incredible abundance of that stuff now.) However, it is incredibly easy to obtain any of this on the black market and most citizens who are off the ""Prozium"" don't do a very good job of hiding what they get. I could go on, but you get the picture. At the end of the day, this film is pretty terrible despite the plethora of people on here who say otherwise. This is one of those movies that defines the ""style over substance"" genre of filmmaking that is so prevalent nowadays (you know, that genre that says nothing needs to make any sense, just as long as it looks really cool) and the film doesn't really say anything new in the sci-fi, future dystopia genre that hasn't been said elsewhere in a much better way. From the costumes to the fight scenes to certain story elements, it's pretty much unavoidable to compare this film with The Matrix and it made me wonder how much better The Matrix would have been with Christian Bale as Neo while having the naturally emotionless Keanu Reeves tackle the role of Cleric John in this film. I guess the world will never know and trust me when I tell you, you won't be missing much if you don't know about this film."	1.0	"Like ""The Matrix"", Only More Derivative and Superficial (if that's possible)."	2010-06-05	32	13	19
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1KTCSRQW3SM6D	Wickus Martin	It's a shame this movie wasn't advertised better. I only saw it because the movie I originally intended to go watch was sold out. The fighting scenes are some of the best I've seen without becoming overly unreal. Christian Bale's performance is intense and brilliant; his character radiating an aura of deadliness. It probably wouldn't be fair to compare Equilibrium to The Matrix, but I'll compare leading actors: Christian Bale is a delight to watch compared to Keanu Reeves. When I watch Keanu's performance in Matrix I can't help but feel I'm watching a male model (with all the associated connotations) given the power of god and told to go save us all. Keanu looks cool, but the guy is one-dimensional as an actor.	5.0	Blew me away!	2003-12-21	1	1	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1QF10TB8AYTA3	"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja"""	Equilibrium is certainly a very interesting movie. I'm not a big fan of &#34;gun porn&#34; which this movie absolutely is, but the sci-fi setting in which this is based was just fascinating. To live in a world where you're not allowed to feel emotion in order to live a peace, and for it to actually succeed? Very cool.My main problem with this movie is that it is extremely anti-climactic and the protagonist is too powerful. Under no point was his life in danger, it was the equivalent of watching Superman vanquish enemies without the threat of Kryptonite. He never bled, he was never exhausted, he merely executed everyone with ease. Sure this made him into a bad ass character, but there was no drama. It's fine to watch a character perform flawlessly during the beginning stages of a story where they haven't met their match. It's different when the character is about to face their final confrontation.I was really hoping for an epic battle with his partner, but instead the character just gets killed off immediately. Everything just went too according to plan, and left the movie severely lacking in drama that compelled you to root for the character.Either, still a very cool movie to watch if you're interested in a dystopian sci-fi world.	4.0	Very cool concept, but very anti-climactic.	2013-06-26	0	0	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1K7X23UDT0R7V	Winston D. Jen	"Although presented as a choice between feelings emotions and being soulless automatons that can accomplish anything pragmatic, the central theme of this film is the problem of free will and whether it is worth all the pain, suffering and misery that go along with it. The creators go for a simplistic, cookie-cutter cop-out ""resolution"" that ruins the suspenseful, action-packed and thought-provoking buildup. There is also one scene in particular with a character behaving out of character, given what we are told about this dystopian society.The action is exemplary and smooth, using gun-fu and the science of predicting gunshots to defeat overwhelming odds. Nothing to fault there.Spoilers follow.The cop-out I referred to has to do with how the creators believe emotions (and free will) are more crucial than being free from suffering at the hands of one's fellow man. I think most people, especially victims of violent crime, would gladly sacrifice their emotions if it allowed them to live life free from the risk of being murdered. The use of a drug to suppress destructive urges also flies in the face of book burning - why do both? Surely the drug would suffice.

Police or guards (guarding what? from what?) are everywhere, in beetle-black armor with opaque beetle helmets. This inhuman environment is filled with people. The question is, are they fully human?This world's answer to war, crime, and violence is to flatten all emotion, in every one, with ""Prozium"". Our hero, Preston, seeks out the people who skip their doses and dare to feel. It's a capital crime, and he summarily executes the penalty more often than not. One day, his dose breaks on the floor. He is delayed in replacing it, then stops taking it altogether.That, of course, is where the movie really starts. It's also where tinges of color start to appear on screen, as Preston's mind opens to the figurative colors of emotion. This is a very good dystopic story, oddly similar to Brave New World even in its differences, but more like THX 1138. The action isn't as wild as comparisons to The Matrix would suggest, but this movie is a lot more thoughtful. And keep your eye on Preston's children. They are un-nerving throughout the movie, perhaps most of all in the last scene.I like this one a lot. It's got fair action, but it's a lot more than that.

I was looking for some quality science fiction movies, with higher ratings, that I had yet to watch. After reading about Equilibium, I decided to rent it.To be honest, I didn't expect much. I wasn't familiar with the actors, and I am always leary about movies that feature alot of action scenes. With that said, Equilibruim exceeded my expectations.It is the story of a ""future cop"" who is at the top of his game. The twist? Feelings are not allowed. World War III has turned mankind into haters of all things artistic and expressive, and even things as laughter or grief will bring about the death penalty. This ""cop"" has the job of moping up the criminals; those who express feelings, or possess such forbidden objects as books, music,paintings, etc.While the movie does have some awesome actions scenes, it also has captivating characters, above average acting, quality directing and a good story. There are many bad action movies on the market, but Equilibrium will not disappoint. It is sci-fi/future/martial arts/action will a unique story twist.Total Score (out of 100) = 4525 (out of 50).

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A38QEATH3NODFM	Wiseguy 945	"This film is a great action film, a must see if you love fight sceens.  A film that slipped by most radars in late 2002, Christian Bale (Batman Begins, Reign of Fire, the Machinist, American Psycho) plays a Graviton Cleric, a futeristic officer used to enfore the laws against sense crimes.  This movie is based off a ""1984"" plot in a post WWIII world in which people take a drug, prozium, to prevent feelings.  It also has the ""Father"" government figure as well.  It also carries a flavor of Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 as well.  Although this plot has been used and abused in the past, and again can be tiresome in this film, the action sceens in this film toast any prior film like this.  It starts off with arguably one of the best gun encounters in any movie, and goes on from there. The final scenerio is something that makes any guy feel like a ten year old, wanting to imitate the moves that the cleric does.  The camera work was also well done, and the sets were nice, not overdone with to much computer backgrounds.  Christian Bale plays the part exceptionally well, and Taye Diggs does fair as far as the action, but fails on the flattness of Affect needed in this role. His acting did seem to give the plot away early if you pick up on the hints quickly.  So if you want to see a good action movie, this is a must see. I believe it was this role that landed Christian Bale his role in Batman Begins, so if you like Batman, then you'll definitely like this."	4.0	Just a great action film, A must buy for just the fight scenes.

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	AFZNJHDGE0DUJ	Zadius Sky	"The ""Equilibrium"" film takes place in a futuristic world where a regime has suppressed emotions by ridding of any objects, including books, art and music and by drugs which suppressed feelings. The central character named John Preston (played by Christian Bale) is a Cleric who enforce the laws by hunting down those who are having feelings. Then, came to the point when Preston himself missed his dosage and began to feel a spark of conscience. He then turns to face the regime head-on in a hope to destroy the laws that prohibit emotions and to let the world to be freed of rigid controls.I do admit that this film seemed to have borrowed from films/books like ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""1984,"" and ""Brave New World,"" (also similar to a film like ""V for Vendetta"") but it is primary focused on a world of emotions-suppression. This film is mainly an action film rather than further intellectual understandings of ""1984""-themes. Perhaps, it's a reminder of our present society where people are increasingly shut off from their feelings and look down on people who express their emotions, even if it's subtle.I think it's a good film to watch, and quite enjoyable."	5.0	Good Movie	2013-01-08	1	1	0
B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A1S1BJFTA644TU	Zalmorion the Fantastic	This movie is quite simply well-done: entertaining, thrilling, and action-packed.  It makes its own statements about society now, warning us a la 1984.  Its action reminds one of movies like Priest and the Matrix series.  Unique and complex--fun to watch.The cast is star-studded.  Every role done well.  You really cannot go wrong with this movie.Worth buying, if you are a sci-fi nut, into dystopian futures, and enjoyed the action scenes in movies like Underworld, the Matrix, Priest, Ultraviolet, Resident Evil, the Expendables.	4.0	The Matrix Meets Priest Meets 1984	2014-02-25	0	0	0

B00005JLWN	Equilibrium	A2D0S86NTHCQZG	Zephaniah	"this movie for not acting in the typical vein of a horrible hollywood action flick.you know, there are actors (and actresses) like christian bale, emily watson, and taye diggs that always try to get involved with the best films (we can forgive taye for brown sugar, he of course has to pay his bills as well). the computer animation of the ""metropolis"" like city is quite nice... the cinemaphotography, plot, and setting are all very well done. the setting i think was done quite nicely.i mean, when the scene comes down when christian is going to fight taye you think they are going to get into this huge fight... but he (christian/preston) just slices him into three peices. i just love that sort of thing... i'd rather see him cut him into three peices with one swift move than the typical ten minute hollywood fight where each one has the other at one anothers mercy about four different times and fails to kill the other.take the concepts of gattaca, fairenheit451, the matrix, and dark city and you have this movie... and i know, for most people that would sound like a bad thing... but here it works quite well.and if that doesn't intrigue you the action scenes are still pretty cool... but keep in mind that christian (preston) doesn't even come close to losing a fight even once... and sometimes his victims look like crash test dummys :P"	5.0	godbless	2003-05-24	4	2	2

But if you have seen the matrix ( and liked it ) this is just as good. I thoght Chritian bale was great. ( i saw this after i saw ""batman Begins"" and thought he was good in that too ) great movie, and great buy."	5.0	WOW	2006-01-19	4	2	2

Well-organized plot? Never-before-seen bits of entertainment?Equilibrium just so happens to have all of this.It starts by taking a few aspects from the revolutionary film, The Matrix. Then it blends these aspects with bits of another revolutionary work, Fahrenheit 451.The result is this film. Bale and his fellow actors nail everything down perfectly. The plot is undeniably intriguing and gripping. And one can--and should--NOT miss the action of Equilibrium.You will all but forget The Matrix."	5.0	Obtaining Equilibrium	2005-10-16	4	2	2
