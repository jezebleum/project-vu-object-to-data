0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1C0C9IJO2HS03	A Customer	I love, love, love this movie. Maybe I'm biased because I saw it for the first time when I was 10 with all my older cousins who loved it, and then I've seen about a zillion more times in the following 6 years. I'm 16 now. Tom Hanks is genius in this role, and it made me add him onto my list of &quot;favorite actors.&quot; (He was good in Castaway, too.) I also love the soundtrack - all the relevant songs from the time period. The special effects that put Forrest in all those different events were impressive as well - I can't say enough! This is one of the best movies ever made.	5.0	...you never know what you're gonna get	2002-05-31	2	2	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	"In my mind, I had the bare bones of a scathing review that would showcase my slyness and writing skill. I was ready to hate this movie. Dumb guy juxtapositioned into great moments in history? Life is like a box of chocolates? Tom Hanks? Much to hate. However, I enjoyed it. If you ever see a guy in a white suit waiting for a bus, don't sit with him or he'll tell you his life story. I jest. It's a fine movie.My dislike of Tom Hanks goes way back to a sitcom called BOSOM BUDDIES, built on the unbelievable premise that the only way these two guys could find an apartment was to dress as women. What I noticed, week after week, was that Tom Hanks' lack of talent dragged down Peter Scolari. I've also seen Hanks in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE GREEN MILE and APOLLO 13, and he did nothing in any of them to raise my opinion of him.(APOLLO 13 works because a skilled ensemble cast and a wooden ""hero"" to lead them can be a highly effective device. Schwarzeneggar built a career on this, and I don't fault him for it.)But I can't conceive of anyone except Hanks as Forrest, Forrest Gump. He was excellent. I'm also proud that I immediately recognized the young actor from THE SIXTH SENSE when he was but a brief flash of hair. He has a presence that we'll enjoy for many years.The marketing department dropped the ball on this movie. They made it sound like I'd learn some deep life lessons from a guy with half my IQ. An offensive premise, and I don't even believe in IQ tests. It's not like that at all. It's such an unusual juxtaposition (there's that word again) that nobody knew how to pitch it accurately. Sometimes it's like that. We're authors. We know this better than anyone. I may hunt down the book."	5.0	Forrest Gump	2006-08-27	6	4	2
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"This film is a parody on American culture. Think of it as a comic book with actors instead of cartoon character. Does it remind you of Voltaire's ""Candide""? It starts by telling you it is who your Mom knows that is important, not what you know. We see how a mentally handicapped boy can get a college education through physical superiority (running). What else matters? Sending Forrest into the Army provides another way to reference the events of the 1960s. Jenny tells Forrest to ""run away"" from troubles; he does take her advice even if she doesn't. Forrest arrives in Vietnam, and rescues many of the wounded. After being wounded, Forrest recuperates and learns to be a ping-pong expert.Forrest gets the Medal of Honor and moons LBJ! [Some sort of comic touch?] The scenes of anti-war protest were re-created with some historical scenes. Next we wee Forrest as part of Nixon's historic flip-flop in recognizing Red China. Another amusing spot is putting Forrest on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon. Forrest celebrates New Year with Lt. Dan, but things go awry. In another joke Forrest is at the Watergate Hotel when he reports men with flashlights in a dark room! So Forrest buys a shrimp boat and does well. His money is invested in an apple company and he becomes so rich he can work for free! Jenny returns and finds her old house an abandoned derelict. [Does this foretell her future?] Forrest's cross-country run parodies the jogging craze and the bumper-sticker mentality. Reporters ask whats its all about? People follow him like the lemmings of fiction. Then its over.Forrest gets a letter from Jenny, visits her and finds a little Forrest, the smartest boy in his class [mocking the ""science"" of eugenics?]. And then they marry, but don't live happily ever after. {A subtle joke?] The ending show little Forrest getting on a school bus, and Forrest sits and waits. This film is too comic for a drama, and not all that funny."	2.0	Parody on American Culture	2006-03-01	17	5	12

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1AXHNRDJEQ0B	Adi Adler	And this movie is not a very good one...One of my teachers in high school told the class that a plausible story isn't necessary a true one, but can also be something that technically MIGHT happen in real life. Forrest just had TOO many strokes of good luck and situations where he was at the right place at the right time to make it a good story in that respect. This might not be anyone else's definition of a good story, but it is certainly mine...Also, all the characters in this movie, especially Jenny's and Lt. Dan's, are just a huge cliche of amateur psychology and kitch... Nothing original or unexpected about them - two dimentional in other words.Many people here speak of the movie's great message of the triumph of human nature. But everything Forrest did was not because he knew it was the right thing to do at the moment, but just because he was there and he reacted to the situation in the only way he knew how to. I've read a review that brought his shrimping sucess as an example: the only reason Forrest became successful was because everyone else's ship sank, not because he did something extraordinarily well... Forrest did not think about the great task of representing his country while playing ping pong in China - he just did what he knew how to do, play ping pong.... And there are numerous other examples.But the worst part of this movie experience was Tom Hanks. I think that he has great potential as an actor - see Philadelphia, for instance. But since then, he seems to be acting out the same character over and over again: the basically good guy who'll eventually win - I couldn't tell the difference between any 2 parts if they weren't in different customs and situations. The fact that Hanks is potentially a great actor just makes his type casting even worse to watch...	5.0	Life is like a box of chocolates...	2001-05-25	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks is still a sweet, tearjerker, and honest film about a man who may not have all his marbles intact but his sweet nature and common sense make him special wherever he goes. Great performance by Hanks, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise. I can see why the Academy Awards gave this movie the best picture nod.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1DTCJV6KOMJOA	A*	Some people confuse this film as an all out sugar coated love fest but their are some hints of all out grim reaper in here! For some reason where ever Gump goes so does tragedy! From Jenny, Lieutenant Dan or Bubba to name a few they al seem to have some kind of physical or emotional problem after they meet Gump! I know a story hast to be propelled with drama but to give the central chracter all the best lines and all the best expressions to deal with the ordeals is just plain wrong! Forrest Gump leaves a little murmur in the viewers heart after its all over. But to its credit Gump is a tear jerker at its best. Zemeciks uses digital feathers and faux handicaps to paint a depressing, dark and dank world with only one bright spot and his name is Forrest &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; Gump. The film plays on every emotion from adolescence to childhood that the viewer has no choice but to root for the cinema's ultimate dim-witted hero! A good film in its own Gump-ish ways.	3.0	Angel Of Death!	2001-09-04	12	0	12

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A103AZLY78GMZW	A & J	"A: 5/5 StarsThis movie was an excellent blend of tears, laughter, and music.  Tom Hanks gives an Academy-Award winning performance as Forrest Gump, a man with an I.Q. of 75.  Forrest makes up for his low I.Q. with a good spirit, a big heart, and a ""moral compass that never wavers"".Forrest goes from football star to Vietnam war hero, international ping-pong champion to shrimp boat captain.  In the midst of all of this, we also see the change of American society over the three decades the movie covers.This movie is very moving and inspiring. The story doesn't explore much into the lives of the other characters, but it's not supposed to.  The movie ""Forrest Gump"" is about Forrest Gump and what even a simple and mentally challenged man can accomplish. What if we unchallenged and blessed people tried?  What could we accomplish?Winner of six Academy Awards, this movie is definitely one of the best movies ever.J: 5/5 StarsWhat a passionately magical movie. it is the kindof movie that you want to hug yourself while your watching it.and when your finished the overall essence and feeling is so profound that you know you will remember it for a long time.forrest gump was one of the best movies of 1994.it is the story, or legend, of a man who manages inadvertenty, to land in every major event from the 50's through the 80's. He may not be the smartest of people( his IQ is 75 but he is honest and innocent. kind of a memory of the time when we were all ignorant but still pure. over those years he meets the president no less than three times, becomes a ping-pong champion, receives the medal of honor, and even "" gets stocks in a new fruit company""(apple). And he walks out of it all as a kind, uncynical person.it is also ultimately about his relationship with his childhood girlfriend, and how all their experiences lead them to a conclusion both heart-rending and sweet.their experiences trough each decade might differ in many volumes but together they are a symbol and reminder of that time.Tom hanks shows again that he is one of the greatest actors of our time and generation. He is able to evoke th essence of forrest gump and not over sentimentalize his being. As for the rest of the movie, each scene shines with the love and care of the people who created it. Forrest gump is a landmark for the years passed and to come and it will remain in the hearts of viewers forever."	5.0	Sent from Heaven or somethng...	2003-07-03	3	1	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A20LY8E9NGYA4M	Alejandro Cortes	&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a marvelous movie because it has it all: comedy, drama, romance, fantasy, tenderness, suspense, etc.The movie tells the story of Forrest (Tom Hanks), a kid who seems to be the most retarded creature in the world; everybody thinks that, everybody but his momma (Sally Field) and his friend Jenny (Robin Wright); they are the center of his universe. As Forrest grows up, we learn that he might be a little goofy, but sure his heart is giant; also he is fast as the wind, an ability that will lead him to witness a lot of the most important USA historical events.The movie's running time is 142 minutes, but those must be the fastest 142 minutes in movie history, because the movie is very, very amusing. Technically &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a masterpiece; every scene was filmed with great detail, the special effects seem to be very simple, but actually they were really hard to do. The DVD is just AMAZING, the extras help to understand every aspect of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, you will be delighted with the extras, because they are great.&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is simply a beautiful movie with a heart of its own.

He probably got it just so he could be one of the actors who got back-to-back Academy Awards. The film is good, but not great.  It does have an excellent  soundtrack going for it, but music does not make a film(unless it's a  musical!)The different phases of his life are interesting, as are the  special FX.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1RE7M7NPEQHU4	"Amazon Customer ""cereberal"""	Difficult to categorize this film's appeal.  Gump is not very smart, yet manages to do so many things right in this film, including becoming a football star, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, a Ping Pong champion, a distance runner, and eventually a multi-millionaire, etc.  Yet his romantic advances to the free spirited Jenny, capably played by Robin Wright, misfire.  But even here, he stumbles from success to success while she becomes caught in a declining death spiral that almost leads to suicide.  However miraculously she and Forrest click in a way that will satisfy the viewer.The history of a turbulent era in American history and some of its leaders and failures make the film worth viewing.  Watching a naf like Gump serve as both catalyst and pawn in our history is far fetched, but still fascinating to watch.The actors are terrific and make the film one we will remember.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A37P1C6UNBMA6G	Amazon Customer	"Is there room on here to fit all of what Forrest Gump means to me and possibly others? Probably not!  Forrest Gump mixes so many styles of film in one movie it is incredible.  It is a comedy, drama, war movie, love story, one of spiritual enlightenment, but most importantly it is about a life.  We all walk this earth and from the beginning of our life, we grow, we laugh and love, we have pain and heartache, and eventually we die.  How will others remember us?  How in a positive way have we touched others during our life?The Blu-Ray version of this film is like watching it again for the first time.  There are little things in the background that stand-out unlike the regular version.  The battle scene is visually striking.In the play Hamlet, Hamlet is in the graveyard and comes across Yorrick's skeleton.  Yorrick was the king's jester and Hamlet spent a great time with him when he was younger.  As he holds his skull, he speaks the lines, ""My gorge rises at it (his skull)"" meaning his throat rises at it.  I always took this to mean his spirit was moved to the point of being choked up!  There are quite a few scenes in this film that bring me to that point.  To me these aren't superficial feelings, as in other films, but touches the spirit, and that is why I feel that Forrest Gump is more than a film, but a life lesson."	5.0	"""My gorge rises at it"" -- Hamlet"	2009-11-07	11	10	1

Forrest over comes challenge after challenge and shows such grace to others it is hard not to completely love him.  Hanks showed that he is one of the greatest actors ever to hit the screen in this movie by portraying Gump in such a way that the viewer loves him and  knows him but never feels pity for him even though his circumstances may seem to warrant it.Gump gives us a vision of true loyalty in friendship, he is patient, kind, doesn't hold grudges (doesn't keep accounting of wrongs suffered), he believes all things and hopes in all things.  This movie is very enlightening and a true pleasure to watch.It is fun to watch, it is entertaining, it is a good family movie (older kids) and it is definitely a &quot;thinking movie&quot; and a challenge to how we all live.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AXGZIUUVTKWEK	"A. Minutella ""mystery buff"""	"This has to be the most overrated movie of all time. How people were so easily lassoed into its cheap sentimentality and utter banality is beyond understanding. Forrest is supposed to represent the simple kindness we all have inside of us, and its told to us in the movie with all the subtly of a sledgehammer. The scene of Forrest running and his leg braces breaking into pieces is particularly heavy-handed and laughable. Movies like this pander to artificial Hallmark-like sentimentality and makes the characters and situations as deep and fulfilling as a damp dish rag. The rambling tour through the decades, where Forrest is computer enhanced into various events in history, seems more forced and corny than remotely believable. And the whole ""make lemonade out of lemons"" psychobabble spewed throughout the film is more insulting than encouraging: in real life, most people hardly get the opportunities to make a drop of lemonade, let alone go through all the historical extravagances that Forrest does. Shameless, sappy, boring, and clumsy, FORREST GUMP (a Best Picture winner, no less!) is an insult to any humane human."	1.0	Absolutely Awful	2005-11-03	118	41	77

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1GOI8745FGIDN	"""an_avid_book_reviewer"""	"One interpretation of the movie is that of having opinions and siding one way or the other on issues. Forrest Gump doesn't seem to have an opinion about anything, except for a general optimism. When he runs across the country, reporters catch up to him and ask whether he is running for the environment, women's rights, or world peace, or what. He replies, ""I just feel like runnin'!"" He wins the medal of honor in Vietnam yet loves a girl who is mixed in with people who oppose the war. When Forrest makes a speech about the war, the plug is pulled and we don't hear a word he says about it. A Black Panther gives him a stern lecture about his group's ideology, but Forrest is tuned out, only paying attention to Jenny. Forrest explains many things as ""and for no particular reason at all..."" for example, the shootings of several famous people in his lifetime. When Forrest meets the president all he has to say about it is he loved how there was free Dr. Pepper and free food.He goes through many turbulent times in our nation's history and is tuned out of them but by no means totally tuned out of life. He has fierce determination, as when he runs with all his might on the football field for the touchdown, then continues into the locker room at full speed. Although stupid, he is still a very dynamic character who succeeds at everything he does, and still remains a nice guy. With all his success adding up he does not become cocky or corrupted or lose vision of what really matters. He inspires many others and spreads his good influence around very well and doesn't even realize how great he is. Forrest moves through a world which is increasingly becoming less moral, more violent and confused. Yet he manages to leave the world a little better than he found it.I can't totally agree with the thought that the film portrays sexuality as immoral. Recall that Forrest's mother had sex with the principal to get her son into a mainstream school. Also, Forrest has an illegitimate child to which Jenny assures him he did nothing wrong. The kid turns out just fine and Forrest turns out to be a great father. Some think the film tells us that conformity and following orders unquestioningly will lead to success. Why, then, does Forrest blatantly disobey Lt. Dan's order to leave him in the woods and instead, save his life? Also, when Forrest prepares to buy his own shrimp boat, everyone tells him he's stupid to do that but he simply replies ""Stupid is as stupid does, sir"" and goes ahead with his promise and his dream to go into the shrimping business.Despite the inspiring action throughout the movie by Forrest, the movie ends sadly. Also, being that Jenny apparently died of AIDS which was a new disease back then, there is a strong possibility Forrest has it, too being that Jenny is his wife. But one message of the movie is that we all die sooner or later and that dying is a part of life.Will the story of Forrest Gump make you feel inspired? Probably. Will it actually change your life?

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I know that I should love this movie since everyone else in the world does, but I can't help but get this overwhelming singe of disappointment every time I sit down to watch this movie (which isn't often, but I recently watched this for the third time thinking that maybe I was harsh on it the first two times).  `Forrest Gump' is what I consider, as my title suggests, mediocrity done extremely well.  It's what happens when you take a clich&eacute; ridden story and fill it with gimmicky characters who speak mind-numbing (albeit entertaining) dialog.  There is a layer of originality that spreads itself thin over the film, but overall the film is bogged down by its own aspirations.  It is trying way to hard and failing most of the way.  It is not a bad film, but it is no where near the top of the pack, not even in 1994, which was a sub par year in general.I know that `Forrest Gump' has its rabid supporters (thus the reason that every review under a five-star gets trashed by the next reviewer) and I am literally stripped of my dignity every time this movie is brought up among friends since apparently I am the only person I know who sees that there is simply nothing here to get excited over (actually I do remember one time that one of my friends nodded in agreement with me, and then his wife let us both have it).So I don't get yelled at, there are some spoilers below, so be forewarned.So, here are my issues with `Forrest Gump'.  The story is actually good in my opinion, or at least the idea behind it.  Having one man make an unintentional impact on the entire world and be utterly clueless to it is actually interesting.  If the plot hadn't been muddled with clich&eacute;d characters from the very beginning then it really could have been worked into genius.  But that wasn't the case.  The character of Forrest isn't the biggest clich&eacute; (although he is clich&eacute;d, don't get me wrong) but all the people around him (from his mother to his war buddy to the love of his life) are so `been-there-done-that' that I can't understand why someone didn't stop production and ask why they couldn't create something a little different.  The performances for the most part work to elevate the familiarity (especially Wright, whose character is probably the most clich&eacute;d in the bunch) but it doesn't really help much.Another problem that I have with `Forrest Gump' is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is kind of like the king of gimmick for me.  I don't think he is the strongest actor and it feels as if he relies to heavily on his characters gimmick's to elevate his performance and acceptance.  He won back to back Oscars for barely doing anything.  Really, he played a man dying of AIDS and then he played a man mentally handicapped, the two biggest Oscar bait gimmicks out there, but his personal performance was nothing spectacular.  The final frames of the film are truly the strongest, and yes, when he realizes that he has a child his reaction is raw and real and heartbreaking, especially when he asks if his son is smart, but honestly that is one scene (the best scene in the film mind you) and one scene does not make you a good actor.  Robin Wright Penn and Gary Sinise are actually very good here (Sally Field cannot step out of her character clich&eacute; long enough to do anything decent here) but there performances are muddled down by the mediocrity surrounding them.  I am not for one minute saying that no movie should be made about wounded war vets or the mentally handicapped or the drug addicted floozy, but when so much of it is thrown into the same pot it begins to feel as if no one involved with this project has an imagination.The film feels very force-fed at times, like it's spoon feeding the audience mouthfuls of manipulated sympathies.  I know that I am like the last person to complain about that since I cry every time I watch a Ron Howard film (talk about emotional manipulations) but Ron Howard has a way of making all that syrup go down smooth; and Zemeckis doesn't (at least for me).I just don't buy it.I don't know, maybe I am really harsh and maybe I take life way to seriously as some angered reviewers have claimed anyone who doesn't rave this movie must do.  I'm not saying that it isn't entertaining and even enjoyable.  This is just not an Oscar movie.  It's more of a C+ than an A+ in my book.  Like I said, it's done well, really well, but that still doesn't make up for the lapses in judgment on the part of the writers, directors and lead actor (at least he tries in some scenes here as apposed to his horrendously mediocre `Philadelphia' performance the previous year).  When I look back at the films that `Forrest Gump' beat out for the top prize (namely `The Shawshank Redemption', `Pulp Fiction' and the un-nominated `Heavenly Creatures') I am dumbfounded that the world fell for this living breathing clich&eacute;, wrapped in a feel good package.	3.0	Mediocrity at its finest...	2008-08-08	15	10	5

What I cannot stand is all these people saying it's really sentimental and unrealistic - THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT! You do not watch a film like this to criticise and sneer at how dumb  it all is. You sit down, suspend your poor, angst-ridden cynical 20th  century minds for a couple of hours, and enjoy a beautiful, touching, funny  and wonderfully acted feelgood movie. The one scene that even I would draw  the line at is the &quot;running&quot; sequence, where Forrest decides to  run across America, just because he has nothing better to do. Apart from  that unnecessary section, the film is a delight to watch, and the scene  where Forrest turns away from Jenny and says &quot;I'm not a smart man, but  I know what love is..&quot; brings tears to my cynical angst-ridden 20th  century eyes every time.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	"What makes this film so irritating is its pro-American propoganda and religious undertones, which reaches levels few films dare to trot.It's a fictional story of someone who was born mentally challenged. As a school kid he has a crush on a girl (who later becomes his wife). He is good at running (which gets him into college). He becomes a war hero and meets the president. He fulfills a promise he made to his dying best friend (who died in his arms) and enters the shrimp boat industry. He asks God to help him succeed and God (instead of making more shrimp) helps him by destroying every other shrimp boat (you can't make this stuff up) and Gump becomes super rich. He has a child with his future wife and the kid is the ""smartest"" in his class. And all throughout this improbable story, he remains blissfully ignorant at how extraordinary it is.I want a film about the real world. This film does the mentally challenged no services. Rather, it patronizes them. If they decided to make a film based on a true story of a REAL mentally challenged person, I think I would have liked the film.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	When Forrest Gump first came out, a lot of Americans felt embarrassed by its portrayal of them.  Well I can sympathize with the feeling. After all, Australia has produced some pretty embarrassing lifestyle movies, including  Muriel's Wedding, Strictly ballroom and Crocodile Dundee. The thing is, no  one outside of your own country can see anything to be embarrassed about.  So I guess we should all just relax and enjoy the film.Forrest  Gump was an adorable piece of cinema. Tom Hanks was up to his usual high  quality, but the star of the film had to be the script. Every now and then  a movie comes out that is simply refreshing, and this was one of the best.  Forrest is a character permanently in the role as underdog, not because of  his failures but in spite of his successes.  It is not possible to feel  jealous of this good natured simpleton, no matter how many presidents he  meets or how much he earns. We always cheer him on.I had fun with  the movie on many levels. The script was full of double meanings and clever  references. The special effects were flawless and yet unnoticed. The  winding, serendipitous path Gump's life took was surprisingly believable.  And finally the characters were heart warming. The very lack of pretension  in Forest only served to highlight it in the &quot;normal&quot; characters.  Forrest Gump is the sort of film that leaves you feeling good but also  prompts you to wonder about the true meaning of life. No one should feel  embarrassed by this great film.	5.0	Simple and strange but never stupid.	2000-05-07	7	5	2

Forrest has no guile, is completely trusting, and his childlike wonder and limitations make him an endearing and enduring character.Be advised that there are some scenes that may prove offensive to some viewers...there is a smattering of foul language, amd there are scenes portraying drug and alcohol abuse, as well as war violence, etc.All in all, this is a great show.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3D4ZIEM6OZ98A	Atrab Aon&lt;3	"A GREAT MOVIE""Forrest Gump"" (1994) is about an ignorant man who, trough out his life, either does or experiences monumental things and major historical events. The main character of the movie, Forrest Gump, is played by Tom Hanks. He is excellent at portraying himself as an ignorant southern man. Also, Tom Hanks does an amazing job imitating a southern accent.The visual effects of the movie are very impressive. Whether the directors are portraying Forrest Gump as an American soldier in the Vietnam War or as a football star on the Alabama Crimson Tide. The movie makes it seem as if Forrest Gump was actually there when those events took place. Also, throughout the whole entire movie the visual effects make it seem as if the filming crew was filming the events as they took place.The rating for this movie, PG-13, fits the movie very well. There is barely any inappropriate language or other inappropriate things. Also, the movie has such an exciting plot. Forrest Gump goes through so many remarkable things in his life that it is so hard to get distracted from watching the movie. Whether he is a ping pong champion in china, a shrimp boat captain, a soldier in the Vietnam War or when he, for a short time, is part of the Black Panthers. The plot and the movie, as a whole, are so interesting and a great movie to watch that it is so hard to get distracted from watching it.Also, this movie conveys a message. I believe that the message is no matter how ignorant or stupid you are; you can always do or experience substantial things in life.Overall, I think that Forrest Gump was a great movie. Whether it was the amazing visual effects or the extremely attention-grabbing plot. It is a great movie and I encourage everyone to see it."	5.0	A Great Movie	2012-01-11	2	2	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AT94ICL01YHU0	"Automated Message ""estrus jones"""	"More like Forrest Chump. And damn if Gump and Co. don't set out in righteous fashion to dumb down American society, perhaps to its rightful place in the discarded fish pile. Christians, more than any other ethnic group, should take great offense at this ripoff of their Jesus Christ mascot. A hollow shell sucking up all the limelight. A guru made out of papier mache. &$#^$*#!! And people, I recall, went nuts over this sunken dung rag when it turded into theaters. Viewed in a certain light, Forrest is nothing more than the bible-soaked fantasy of the meek inheriting the Earth. Perhaps that's the allure: Weak, midwestern church zombies shuffling through the ticket line and staring up at a screen in which they've substituted their bloated, watered-down personas in place of Gump, himself a talking stuffed-doll acting as masturbatory extension of Americana. Like an apple pie that confers, ""So how about that weird weather we've been having?"" or ""Go Niners, right?"" when you take a bite.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A12YVS06GZEFZE	Barbara Farr Kelley	I am a great fan of Tom Hanks, although a couple of his movies I have not seen because of the subject matter.  However, Forrest Gump is my favorite of all the Tom Hanks movies.The cinemetography is exclusive and  brilliant, from the point where young Forrest runs out of his braces to the  look of terror on his face when he is carrying Bubba out of the enemy  fire.This is a beautiful movie, showing the tenderness and the courage  of one young man who can doing anything he sets his mind to do.  He ran  across the United States, and when he was done, he had nothing better to do  than to run across it again, and again, and again.He even fell in love  with a woman who totally did not deserve him.  Jenny was a beautiful child,  why couldn't they get someone equally beautiful, maybe like Melissa Sue  Anderson, to play the part of Jenny as an adult?  The makeup artists could  have made her look hard, and then soft.  I didn't much like Robin Wright in  the role, but then I'm not a fan of hers.The little girl who played  Jenny was spectacular, especially the part where she runs to the fields,  hides, and prays to God, &quot;Dear God, please make me a bird, so I can  fly far, far away!&quot;  It made me cry great big crocodile tears.The  little boy who played Hanks as a child was great, too.  I understand he  chose this child out of like 2000 kids or so to play the part.  I believe  Tom Hanks has a brother like Forrest, which made it easy for him to play  the part.Haley Joel Osment, who played Forrest Jr. has always been a  favorite little actor of mine.  I liked him in the Jeff Foxworthy Show and  other shows I've seen him in.  I haven't seen the Sixth Sense yet.  I know  this little boy is going to go a long, long way in his acting career, and I  just hope he doesn't turn out soured like a lot of really great child  actors and actresses have.It did not mention what disease Jenny got that  made her real sick and die in the movie, but it was just about that time in  history when AIDS was first brought to our attention.  She got her illness  from sleeping around and using drugs, so I reckon that must be what she  had.  Of course, it never said, so we don't know for sure.Tom Hanks  deserved his academy award for Forrest Gump.Isn't it amazing that one of  Sally Fields' first movies was playing girlfriend to Tom Hanks?  Yet, she  did a tremendous and wonderful role as his mother in Forrest Gump.  Sally  Field has got to be one of my favorite actresses.  I've seen her in just  about everything she has ever been in since The Flying Nun.Gary Sinise  played Lt. Dan, and he made a promise to Forrest that if Forrest ever owned  a shrimp boat, that Lt. Dan would come be his first mate.  Well, if you've  seen the movie, you know Forrest got his shrimping boat and it was the only  one to survive a hurricane because he had it out in the Gulf instead of  tied to the dock.Well, if you haven't seen Forrest Gump now, I hope you  watch it.  It is worth every minute.  The music is great and all the actors  are fit for their roles.	5.0	My favorite Tom Hanks movie!	2000-07-07	5	2	3
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"OK, I know what you're thinking: what's the matter with me that I didn't see this long ago? Well, in 1994, when it was in the theaters, I would not have gone to it without Steve, and he wasn't interested. And we never owned a DVD player. So I've really only had about three years or so to have come across it. Nobody who told me about it told me enough to appreciate that I probably would like it, including that Tom Hanks (the guy from ""DaVinci Code,"" but I didn't know the name then) was someone I would love as a terrific actor. Anymore than I would have believed I'd love Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" until I saw him in ""Titanic."" In fact, he was so convincing in Grape that I thought it really was played by a retarded guy, just like the mother really was played by a morbidly obese woman. I mean, no actor can fake it that well, can they?Apparently some can.Forrest is not seriously retarded, after all, he's just ""a little slow,"" as his mother (Sally Fields) puts it. She's determined to see that he gets the best education possible. Very determined, as the principal of the school finds out. The other thing is he wears braces on his legs. Why? The quack his mother took him to acknowledges there's nothing wrong with his legs, but his back is ""as crooked as a question mark."" So why do braces on his legs have anything to do with curing his back? We never do find out. But one day when Forrest was being chased by bullies on bicycles, and is running as fast as he can, the braces just break and fall off, and he's running like the wind.Forrest also has a friend, Jenny, the girl who let him sit beside her on the school bus the first day, and they were ""like peas and carrots"" after that. Always together. He figures she's his girl, but she doesn't quite see it that way. In fact, as they go through life, they keep finding and losing each other.I won't go into all the details, but the basic premise of the story is that Forrest is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus, and gets talking to whomever sits next to him, whether they answer or not. Most of the story is thus told in flashbacks while he tells his experiences in a simple, straightforward way. He's met three presidents, the first one Kennedy as he was on an all-star football team, the second was Johnson as he was awarded the medal of honor for bravery in Vietnam (great story there; I'll let him tell it), and the third was Nixon, because of his central role in the ""ping pong diplomacy"" with the Chinese.In fact, he seems to always be involved in something which we remember from the news, one way or another. Not for anything he figures is all that special, but just for doing his job or for sheer coincidence. For example, when he meets Nixon, the president asks him how he likes Washington, and does he like his hotel. I don't remember what Forrest answered, but Nixon says he'll be more comfortable in this nice new hotel that only recently opened. That night he's in the Watergate and calls the front desk to report that ""they must have had a power out over there because there are people walking around with flashlights and everything."" Next thing you know, Nixon is resigning.He makes friends here and there, and these people keep popping up in his life in unexpected ways. Still, coincidence is never strained too far, because Forrest has gotten famous, so people who want to can find him.There's a lot of humor, and a lot of pathos, and they are mixed together just right. You won't pity Forrest, but you will learn to see the world through his eyes to an extent you would not have thought possible when the movie began. It's artfully done, and I'm not at all surprised that it earned six Oscars, including best picture. It's one of the best I've ever seen."	5.0	Deserves All Those Oscars	2012-05-13	2	2	0

The DVD has done a great job in preserving its great quality.  First, the picture quality is superb.  The colors and definition are crisp.  Take a look and you'll notice great clarity in each scene.  The 5.1 sound is decent.  It doesn't employ all 5 channels of sound to the fullest extent, but it'll do for most people.Now for the special features.  Disc 1 offers great, comprehensive commentaries by the producers and the director, Robert Zemeckis.  While other directors provide useless information, this commentary is actually informative and pertinent to what's shown on screen.  Disc 2 is simply amazing.  Do you want to know how Forrest Gump was made and then some?  Disc 2 is all you need.  Considering how great the special effects were, this set of bonus features are very welcome and entertaining.If you own an the older, original copy of the Forrest Gump DVD, set it aside and get this new one.  It's worth the money.  If you don't own Forrest Gump, get it now.  Not only is the movie great but Disc 2 provides an amazing set of bonuses that other DVD's should live up to.	5.0	Great Movie, Great DVD	2001-09-09	2	2	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AH1KJ45IQTM4T	Benjamin	"I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. This is one of the 100 Best America movies of All Times (#71 to be more exact) and it is included in the 1000 Best Movies in DVD by Peter Travers. The movie won 6 Oscars, including Best Director for Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future""), Picture, and Actor (Tom Hanks speech went like this: ""If Forrest Gump was here tonight he'd say: ""I went to the Academy Awards AGAIN, and they gave me the Oscar AGAIN!"" making reference at his Oscar for Philadelphia the previous year), and Best Effects (there is a great documentary on that in the second DVD on this edition), Best Film Editing, and Best Writing based on Material from Another Medium. Special mention deserves the music on the film, going over most of the hits of the late 50's and the 60's. So if you like R'n'R, go and buy the Soundtrack as well!The movie depicts the story of Forrest Gump, a mentally retarded kid who makes it to the top. That can be understood in, at least, two different ways: 1. Any mentally retarded can do good in America. 2. America is the land of opportunity where anybody who tries hard can make it. But this is a movie, a very good movie. So it's a piece of entertainment, and I just watched the movie today (I just watched a couple of times when I came out 12 years ago), and I had a lot of fun. As an example, when Gump goes to the Army, he is very good just following orders, not even thinking about it, so his Sargent tells him ""You must have an IQ of 160!"". That, in my opinion, is really funny, and a very witty critic to the Army, where all they need is ""robots"" who can just obey without even thinking. There is also something remarkable. When Forrest Gump comes back from Vietnam, he happens to be at Washington D.C., where there is a huge demonstration against the War. The city is taken by hippies and pacifists. Jenny, the woman of his dreams, is there. They meet. And her boyfriend smashes her in fornt of him. Forrest Gump, the ""baby-killer"" from Vietnam, as he is called, defends her violently. But it's obvious that the guy who is a ""pacifist"" was using violence with her, using bad language and in acts. That is nothing put there by chance. It has a meaning. There was violence in Vietnam, in the war, at home, by the police, but also by the protesters. And that is something that has rarely been told. They were using drugs to ""liberate"" themselves, but that was -in my opinion- another violent way to express themselves. There are a lot of details like that in the movie, that no one could miss. For instance, when the mother of Forrest Gump tries to enroll him at a Regular Elementary school, the Principal is trying to explain her that Forrest's IQ is below normal, and that he should be going to a special school (there was no inclusion at that time). The mother thinks Forrest should have the same opportunities as anybody else, so she offers herself to do ""anything"" possible to allow Forrest to go to a regular school. And the Principal takes advantage of her. That is another very intelligent critic to things that, unfortunately, are still happening today. Another thing is when Forrest goes to college. Once he graduates, he tells us in plain English ""After 5 years playing football, they gave me a degree"". So, after 5 years doing nothing, I graduated anyway. Does it sound famiiar? Read between the lines!To end with this review, I will just say that this is a GREAT movie, very entertaining, well done (the sound in the war scenes is just superb!), a pleasure to watch, with a lot of fun moments, some tender ones, and it tells us a little bit about the history of the US from the 50's to the 80's. It's not that ""retarded"". It is a very witti one, and it deserves the place it made in the History of Cinema. This is a special edition with 2 DVD's, very CHEAP and highly recommended. If you don't have it in your collection, your collection is ""crippled""."	5.0	Retarded? Not that much ...	2006-06-25	7	6	1

Get this movie but stay away from the chocolate box set, totally lame and useless.	5.0	Great movie, terrible gift set	2010-01-30	10	7	3

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ	"Bill Lively ""Bill"""	For everything this film lacks, Tom Hanks more than makes up for with a brilliant performance that only he could pull off. Forrest Gump is a simply Alabama mamma's boy, with a 75 IQ. He befriends Jenny, who he soon sees as the love of his life, becomes a football star, and so on and so frth through history. In fact, it turns out that Gump has been involved in just about everything from American history from 1950-1980. Its a fun movie, with help from a great performance by Sally Field as Gump's mother, and another one from Gary Sinise as the disabled Lt. Dan. There's some great visual effects, and its a fun movie with a little bit for everybody.	5.0	Hanks ties the loose ends	2005-04-04	4	3	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AWMXF7FDATJC1	Bradley D. Percell	The key to your liking this movie will be if you can accept Tom Hanks as a  slow-witted guy (who happens to have an incredible number of things fall  his way.)  He rolls through the decades and manages to become part of a  great many historical events.  The Vietnam conflict, Watergate, meeting  Elvis before he becomes famous...  If you get into the spirit of which this  movie was intended you'll enjoy it immensely.  There are some good laughs,  some tear-jerking moments and some scenes that just make you roll your eyes  and say &quot;Oh, Brother.&quot;  Don't start watching the movie with an  intent on scrutinizing every little thing or you won't enjoy it very much.

I found  the film entertaining even though in reality, this kind of life led by  someone like Forrest Gump would be highly improbable.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2IJX5MGRQCKKY	Cassie	What can I say about this movie?  Nothing bad that is for sure.  Tom Hanks really out did himself in this film.  He was definitely perfect for this part.  He really caught your attention throughout the whole movie.  It starts out as him just being a young boy living with his mom who is played by Sally Fields.  He has a learning disability and is fitted for braces on his legs.  Because of all of these things he has wrong with him he is treated differently by everyone except on little girl.  Which in the movie becomes his best friend and at some point more than that.  Her name is Jenny and she goes through a lot of different things with Forrest.  After school he goes into the army, to try and show people that he really isn't stupid, as he says in the movie, &quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot;  He ends up falling in love with Jenny but she doesn't really feel the same way about him.  Although, she loves him as a friend, she doesn't feel that it could ever be more than that.  They end up gettin together one night and she ends up getting pregneant and names the baby after the daddy &quot;Forrest.&quot;  Towards the end of the movie some pretty sad things happen to him in his life.  Things happen to people that are really close to him, but he doesn't let that get him down.  He looks at it just like the famoust quote from the movie, &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.&quot;  I believe this because you never know what is going to be in the center of the chocolate, just like you don't know what the next day is going to bring you.  I reccommend this movie to people who like films that get way down deep inside your heart and make you look at life in a whole different perspective.  If you haven't seen this movie I reccommend you go and rent it.	5.0	Life really is like a box of chocolates	2001-03-07	2	1	1

Actually, I was not interested in this moive at all when I watched at the first time. Fortunately, I watched it again as my friend kept telling me that it was a great movie. Then, I watched it more than 3 times. Everytime I watch, I cry and laugh at Forrest's Character. I got to like Tom Hanks at that time. I think Forrest's character is well reflected to Tom Hank's own character as I  observe his role in other films.I admire him because  he is true to his nation, his friends, and his family and himself.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3B5RLQPDIL81C	Cheh Carmen	This is a truly a amazing movie.You'll howl with laughter when you understand all the jokes in this movie.It seems like the movie only lasts one hour instead of 2 hours.&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is about a man who is a bit mentally retarded.When he was on a bench with a few people,he tells them about his past.You might think that this movie is boring but you are wrong.When you get a bit further in this movie,you will be so engrossed that you will not hear anything around you except the sound of the movie.This man who is telling his story to people is Forrest Gump.His mother and a girl,Jenny are the only people who treat him well.He had an I.Q of 75.When he was older,Forrest Gump joined the army force.He was the fastest to load a gun,fastest runner and many other things.His sergeant said that he had an I.Q of 160!!

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2EJ7NMKOXH9V3	Cheryl	I dub this movie as the &#34;Must See American Movie&#34; of all time. If you are an American, you need to see this movie. It captures the american spirit.Forrest Gump is a nobody who turns into a somebody but still keeps his old values. He has adventures in bullies, love, war, politics, sports, running a business, and being a father.It's a heartwarming tale of an underdog but with lots of humor.Harsh views of reality are peppered with a light note as Forrest's personality shines as the light of innocent American dreaming.This is one film I can watch again and again and still feel just as enthralled by its charm.	5.0	Classic American Must See	2014-03-01	1	1	0

She was the brilliant black actress who played the reporter who followed Tom Hanks cross-country in his epic run across America.  Her acting prowess was only exceeded by the amount of eyeliner she wore.  I almost came when I heard her say one of the all-time classic lines, &quot;Are you doing this for world peace?&quot;  The only fault was her lisp when sounding out the word &quot;peace.&quot;  I would give Miss Mack six out of five stars for her part.  It is only too bad that she cast an extremely large shadow over Tom Hanks' character, whatever his name was.

To make a long story short he serves a term in Vietnam and recieves the medal of honor. he comes home to his girlfriend Jenny who he has never stopped loving, and at the end of the movie finds out that he is the father of Jenny's baby.

There is a 60-year gap between us.  How can I explain to her how horribly torn the country was about the Vietnam War, what conflict there was about Civil Rights, how truly noble Forrest is when he saves &#34;Lt. Dan's&#34; life, both physically and metaphorically, and how his love for Jenny remains pure and innocent, no matter what she has been through?My granddaughter didn't live through that period of history, so the movie can't possibly be as powerful for her as it was for me.  And this is a tragedy, because I feel it defines part of who I am - a part that I can't explain to her because she wasn't there.This film is simply brilliant.

I have to say that while Tom Hanks did extraudinary the film still left me somewhat cold and just never really seemed to keep my interest.  After heavy debate I decided to watch the movie again and after my second go through I am slowly starting to see what all the hype was about.  It truly is a beautiful story mostly because you really start to care about this man named Forrest.  The film itself, a plot very poposterous, is moved through by performances by Hanks and Robyn Wright-Penn as well as Gary Senise (hysi)...I think that most people are touched by this film and I was after concidering it deeply.  I guess I just was prepared for somthing different and looking for something different that I couldn't see the greatness that was in front of me.  Thats the problem with hype...you walk into a film expecting so much that you fail to see what everyone saw because your looking in all the wrong places.

In one sense, it makes no sense whatsoever, yet in another sense, it is a very deep movie.  Forrest is a slightly retarded person, who falls in love with Jenny.  Jenny seems to take advantage of Forrest to fulfill her own feeling of desperation.  Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, decides at one point, to start walking.  As he walks, thousands of people follow him.  He has no real reason for walking.  It is just something he decides to do for no particular reason.  Then one day, he decides to stop.  This movie has no real meaning, and rambles from one place to another.  It is not good for family viewing, as it has some risque scenes in it that are not appropriate for younger viewers.

While all of the &#34;smart&#34; people around him are doing drugs, having uncommitted relationships, etc. which leads them to despair and ruin.

To be honest I really don't like it because unrequited love makes me sad. This is a sweet story about Forrest and his undying love of his friend Jenny. Forrest has a handicap in which he has to wear leg braces until the age of 9, and he's also slow mentally. Jenny is a poor girl who is molested by her single father until she's taken away from him. The roads that Jenny and Forrest end up taking are different as night and day. Jenny ends up in a world of drugs, sex, and rock and roll while Forrest now having shed his leg braces has gone onto college to play football, and enlist in the Marines, and goes to Veitnam, and becomes a successful entreprenuer, but still longs to have Jenny by his side, but circumstances keep pushing her away from him, and then Forrest does something that I wish I could do if I could afford to, and that's run back and forth across the United States. He runs to get rid of all the demons within him; meaning all the hurt, rejection, and anything that was bothering him. I know I'm carrying alot of baggage around within me, and I also have alot of responsibilities that I wish I could just run from, but I couldn't abandon my son, so I consider writing reviews on here as my way of running back and forth across the United States. I write about how movies, music, and books affect me, and hope that there's an understanding audience out there to know what I go through. I know some of it doesn't make sense, but I have to get my feelings out somehow.Anyway after Forrest gets back from running back and forth across the United States he finally gets Jenny as she comes home to Forrest, and introduces him to his son, and Jenny has AIDS, so Forrest loving her still marries her, so he gets her in the end, but it's a short, but sweet marriage as she ends up dying. I know that my wife died, and I'm left to raise my son on my own, so that's another way this movie speaks to me. It's good, but I don't know if I will ever own it as I still don't like unrequited love, but I guess none of us do. I also feel that the line ""Life is a box of chocolates...you never know what you'll get."" is overused here, and while there's probably a note of wisdom in this I just think it's lame. While it deserves the best picture Oscar I was pulling for ""Pulp Fiction""."	4.0	This movie speaks to me	2009-08-25	3	3	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"""Forrest Gump"" is a prime example of how good acting can overcome a mediocre script and OK direction.  This film does not so much contain a story but a series of random events that our hero stumbles into(Stupid is as stupid does).  What is most impressive about Robert Zemeckis' direction is how CGI is utilized to integrate his characters into historical events.  What least impresses is how these techniques detract from the characters.  What distinguishes this film is the acting, particularly Tom Hanks as Forrest.  Yes, Forrest has an I.Q. of 80, but he's nobody's fool.  What ingratiates you to this character is that he has a heart a mile wide.  This is a tricky bit of acting that Hanks does here because playing somebody who is mentally challenged is a slippery slope(If you want an example of how not to play the mentally retarded,see or don't see Cliff Robertson's performance in ""Charly"").  The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with Gary Sinise as the embittered Lt. Dan, Robin Wright as Jenny(though I thought it too much that she had to suffer so many indignities), Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, and Sally Field as Forrest's mother.  This film in subsequent years has been criticized, fairly or unfairly, as sappy or condesending.  What I would add to that is the public took this character into their bosom.  I think it's a fair assessment that you can fool at least some segment of the theatre going public.  I don't think this film would have been the phenomenon that it was if the public thought they were being taken for a ride."	4.0	Hanks Elevates a So-So Story	2004-09-26	3	2	1

In this role, he disappears as Tom Hanks and becomes Forrest Gump.  And when a great actor does that--watch out!!  In some of Hanks' movies, he overshadows the movie and you are aware of Tom Hanks playing a role. (I think this happened with some of Meryl Streeps movies.)But not in this one.  He is pure Forrest.The supporting roles are very engaging also and are well-acted:  I loved Sally Fields' mother--Sally never misses the right ambience, tone of voice, etc.  She nails the mother.  And Bubba, I will never forget the scenes during which he is listing every shrimp recipe in the world--especially the one where they are cleaning the floor with toothbrushes.  Jenny is also spot on.  She got each decade just right.  And Gary Sinise screaming his lungs out at God during the hurricane--great scene.I rank this as one of the top ten movies ever made.	5.0	One of Hanks' best!	2003-09-07	2	1	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2ETYAVC89ITML	"d_didonato ""d_didonato"""	"There are actually 187 things in this film that bothered me, from the core concept right down to Forrest's haircut.  I don't have the space to list them all, but here are a few ways that this film insults its audience:Historically.  The trivialization of major historical events into (already outdated) '90s ""bites"" is an unimaginative premise for a movie to say the least.  The pandering to baby boomers' sense of self-important nostalgia is as shrewd as it is nefarious.  They don't even have the guts to say the word ""AIDS"".  Jenny died of AIDS.  Didn't everyone who experimented with sex and drugs?Philosophically.  Chuang Tzu is rolling in his grave.  The ""go with the flow"" tenets of Taoism have been poisoned by this awful film.  Gump's character doesn't question the world around him, and blindly does exactly as he's supposed to.  Let's all join the Flat Earth Society, or maybe we should just go back to being cavemen.Emotionally.  As Forrest runs away from bullies, his leg braces dramatically break off!  This is just one of many examples of the film's ""subtle"" pulling of the old heartstrings.Politically.  The film's treatment of the Vietnam War would be laughable if it wasn't so tragic.  Anyone that leans to the left is seen as being a woman-beating fanatic (i.e. the Black Panthers).  Blind patriotism can be a bad thing.  Ask Germany...Musically.  The ham-fisted soundtrack only contains the most obvious, lowest common denominator tracks that everyone over the age of 7 has heard a billion times.  Also, can someone please, PLEASE make a movie that has a helicopter flying over Vietnam WITHOUT Creedence's ""Fortunate Son"" playing in the background?  Just once?!?Intellectually.  It's well-known that it's easier to tempt a fly with honey than a flyswatter.  Tell people not to think, a la 1984, and they will resist.  Gently persuade them not to think by showing that you'll come out just fine if you follow orders, and you'll be much more successful.Cinematically.  Poor character development.  Bad dialogue.  As far as the special effects go, I'm sure it took plenty of time and effort to put Gump on the Dick Cavett show or erase Lt. Dan's legs.  It would also take effort to watch someone balance a bowling ball on their nose.  Does that mean I want to see it?It's as impressive and cutting-edge as Mr. Ed, the talking horse was in the '50s.Financially.  I was lucky enough to have seen this movie for free.  Others have not been so fortunate.  Zemeckis & Co. know that the demographic with the most disposable income are baby boomers, and that if there's anything they like, it's a film that affirms how wonderful their generation was.  Bling bling!  What, do you think these people have never taken a marketing class?  Buy ""Anaconda"".  Donate to the Red Cross.  BURN $20 to keep warm!  Anything!  Just don't buy this movie!This movie isn't funny, either.  Telling the President that you have to go to the bathroom?  And this movie won AWARDS?  Whatever potential Tom Hanks had with the old sit-com ""Bosom Buddies"" or the excellent movie ""Bachelor Party"" is gone.In the future, will this movie be seen as a back-patting homage to a generation that sold out its ideals for a new SUV and a wide-screen TV?

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2A7AA32QEAJY2	"""defranco26"""	"""Forrest Gump"" is a movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. I remember seeing it when it first came out in the theaters and now I am glad to own it on the DVD. Tom Hanks (Oscar-winner) is Forrest Gump, a non-intelligent, but an innocent man, who was a runner, a college football player, a soldier in Vietnam, a ping pong player, and a shrimp boat captain. It was from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s and it is based on a novel. ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best and most important movies of the 1990s.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2BKIYLTAV36FD	"Demonskrye ""Animation Nerd"""	I think the merits of Forrest Gump as a movie have been debated enough by now.  If you're reading this, you probably already have a pretty good idea if the movie's digitally enhanced nostalgia and praise to the virtues of simplicity will appeal to you or not.  So I'm just going to talk about what I thought of the DVD.  The film enthusiast and the Gump fan will find a fair amount of interesting stuff to peruse, but the bonus feature are unfortunately kind of hit or miss.  It's neat seeing exactly how all of the special effects were done or how sound and makeup were used to enhance mood in particular scenes.  The screen test are nice enough, if only because you get to see Tom Hanks playing Forrest before he had worked out the accent.  And the Zemeckis/Starket/Carter commentary, while lacking the fun and spontanaity of some I've heard, provides enough good tidbits and insights to keep you interested.  But these pretty good features run alongside some really poor ones.  The Finerman commentary runs out of steam very early and lapses into the producer repeating herself (apparently there are at least TWO seperate scenes where Forrest first becomes a man) and talking about what she thinks the audience is feeling or thinking at that point in the movie.  (I don't need to know what the audience is thinking.  I AM the audience.)  Add a photo gallery that is half stills from the movie and a pretty bland documentary and you pretty much have the disc in a nutshell.  I guess if you really love Gump or absolutely need to know more about the effects, you'll really enjoy the disc.  But the rest of us are left a little unsatisfied and wondering why a movie that supposedly relied more on a great script than visual effects has a disc of extras which touch so little on the former and so much on the latter.	3.0	Life is like a disc of bonus features.....	2001-10-14	48	36	12

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A16MOKLNXTBZHH	Dennis Smith	Well, I suppose that I will be going against a WALL of disagreement here, but I feel that &quot;FORREST GUMP&quot; is one of the most overrated movies I have seen in years. The story is empowering to some, I'm sure. To me, it's embarrassing.The concept is as trite as the worst of television show scripts. To concoct the &quot;Best Picture&quot; of 1994, the writers/studio simply took most of the pertinent social issues of the 1950's through the 1980's and exploited them; fashioning yet another heart-warming, &quot;feel good&quot; movie for the masses. The turn of events here is as predictable as any soap opera.The much-ballyhooed special effects sequences, whereby our affable, developmentally-disabled hero is seen meeting JFK and LBJ were cute. However, I could have done without the vulgarity of the &quot;scene&quot; with Lyndon Baines. To put it simply, such Hollywood wizardry fails to impress this viewer. By the time this film was done, cimematic special effects had reached a point where anything could be created on film. When hearing how majestic this -or some other- film is (because of it's computer generated effects), I say now what I said back in 1994......SO WHAT?Tom Hanks, who plays the lead in &quot;FORREST GUMP&quot;, has become one of the premier male actors of the New Millennium. His work in films such as &quot;APOLLO 13&quot;, &quot;PHILADELPHIA&quot;, &quot;CAST AWAY&quot; and &quot;ROAD TO PERDITION&quot; has gained him his rightful place among the top male actors in Tinseltown. Fortunately, these films were something more than gushy, &quot;feel good&quot; flicks, such as &quot;FORREST GUMP&quot;.	1.0	Gumpy	2004-01-27	74	23	51

Forrest would have been eaten alive in any neighborhood in America by swindlers or exploiters.People love the fantasy of a good simpleton getting along on his goodness but it ain't going to happen.There are a lot of fantasy fulfillment movies like this. ET. Close Encounters.People frequently are not aware that having their fantasy fulfilled does not necessarily make a good movie. They are so delighted to have see their fantasy come true they think that makes it a good movie. It's sort of like having someone around you who curries your favor by agreeing with everything you say. At first it might feel good but eventually you know the person is lying. In fact you can't believe anything they say because they agree with everything you say. Then they become annoying or even pathetic or sickening. Sort of like this film.In this case what they want is to curry your favor so they get a chunk of your money not your friendship. In other words they'll pander to you, give you what you want for money even if it's an absurd story.As for Hanks, ask yourself this: Is it his character you love or is it that he's tackled a difficult acting job and done it well? Is it hard to play a moron? Is it challenging to the audience? Has he challenged you? Or do you just like the characters he plays? Has Tom EVER challenged you to THINK about a character? Has he ever gotten you to like an unlikeable character or dislike a seemingly likeable charater?He's too smart for that. You make money in Hollywood because people like you not because you do what's right. You kiss up. Kiss up to producers. Kiss up to audiences. Kiss up to Opra. Kiss up to Leno. Get famous because people like your charaters. Don't challenge anyone's preconceived notions.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the ""not helpful"" button, and the smart people can, at least, consider what I've written.

It's a timetable of events in US history that are seen through the eyes of a less than smart FG played by the versatile Tom Hanks. Segregation, race riots, JFK, Vietnam, war protests, LBJ and Watergate are all covered here in new perspectives. Gump achieves greatness as a football hero, war hero, ping-pong champion and a shrimping millionaire but the love of his life, Jenny, shuns him until the end of her life when her abuses catch up to her. Sally Fields plays his Mother and is wonderful. FG is a great blend of comedy, drama and sadness.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a very special movie, a movie in which so many values, traditions, historical events and occurrences are all seen through the eyes of one man who is affected by all of the above mentioned aspects of life. This man is the very embodiment of American innocence in a time when that innocence was fading from sight, with such events as the Vietnam War and segregation issues plaguing the country, and through his simple words and actions, we are able to appreciate the lives in which we live on a much more elevated level.The film is a complex and stunning journey that involves many characters, all of whom represent a separate and unique stereotype of the 50's, 60's and 70's. The events portrayed throughout the movie are handled with such meticulous detail and through the eyes of Forrest Gump, we see everything in a whole new light. His simplicity and limited education seem more of a blessing than a curse, and it may cause viewers to look at their own lives and take stock of themselves as well.Forrest's journey begins in his early years, as a skinny child who must wear leg braces for his crooked back. His mother will do just about anything for him, including giving special favors to the public school principle in order to get her son enrolled. On his first day of school, he meets a young girl named Jenny, whom he falls in love with at first sight. He will carry this love with him for the rest of his life, protecting her from her abusive father and staying by her side through their school years. His high school career offers him a position on football team, which leads him to college, where he becomes ensconced in many different cultures and beliefs, as well as his first taste of segregation. Jenny begins to branch off into more risqu&eacute; lines of work, evolving into the drifter hippie that so symbolized the 60's.Forrest stays in touch with her, even after he is drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight in the war. There, he meets Bubba Blue, and they become fast friends due to their ostracization from the rest of the group's men. Their commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, is harsh and strict, so it comes as no surprise that when a battle goes terribly wrong, he loathes Gump for pulling him out instead of leaving him to die. From this point on, Forrest will become a national hero as well as someone that every human being, decent or loathsome, can come to admire.Forrest's simplicity and small outlook on life is such a blessing for him, and that is shown through the plot of this movie. He sees everything going on around him, but none of it ever really registers in his mind the way it would someone of a higher IQ. Forrest lives his life the way a child would that has been taught by his mother the values of life, and Forrest holds extremely true to those values, never breaching them for a second. His small outlook on such a vast melting pot of societal woes becomes the way in which we would like to look at the world, and at ourselves.The movie also places Forrest in slight interaction with historical figures, ranging from John F. Kennedy's congratulating of the All-American football team, to Richard Nixon's resignation from the White House. Even though his involvement with these events is purely fictional, it offers much needed comical relief for such a serious film. This is where the film gets to use some very effective special effects in order to incorporate Forrest into real footage taken of the events portrayed within the movie, and it does so seamlessly and without flaw.The story's characters all act as a representation of some stereotype from the decades the movie covers. Forrest is not a conservative, nor is he an activist, but rather one of the people that watches from the sidelines as the country falls apart before his eyes. Jenny becomes the hippie, the rebel of society who does drugs and men, following what is considered cool even when it puts her in danger. Lieutenant Dan is the wounded Vietnam officer who is forgotten by his country and the government and left to fend for himself. All of these characters give us diverse looks at the events at hand, while also providing an emotional outlet as we feel their pain and emotions.Tom Hanks gives his best and most memorable performance ever in this film. He plays Gump with all the simple-mindedness and naivety that the movie needs, and brings such vivid and emotional life to the movie. We believe in his ability to create such beautiful images with his simple words. Robin Wright plays his girl, Jenny, who has a profound effect on us despite her many mistakes in her life. Throughout the movie, she seems to be wanting something more than just the popular scene and lifestyle, and Wright brings all of that out with vivacity and excellence. Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, and his embittered attitude towards his country prove to be quite a challenge for Sinise, who readily accepts and makes the role his own. Mykelti Williamson is Bubba Blue, who is a bit smarter than Forrest in terms of understanding the country's upsets. And Sally Field plays Forrest's mother, sweet and charming, loving and warm. This is the Field we all know and have grown to love.&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; works on so many different levels of emotion, intensity and passion for life that it becomes a success many times over. It will not soon be forgotten, so long as we all look for a way to better simplify the events of our lives, seeing things with the naivety of a small boy who rose to such heights of fame yet never really realized his social status. To him, it didn't matter; he was just living life.	5.0	A perfect 10!	2001-02-23	5	4	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2YQCWZ66PY16Q	"D. Mesirow ""Dolphin Songsmith"""	I have not seen every film made in the 20th Century, but I sure have seen many of them.  My favorite film has consistently been Forrest Gump.  The reason might be because it affected me so much.Forrest Gump changed my life.  It was the first film that I saw that really made me understand the importance of cinema in American culture.I was taken through a story that I didn't completely understand, because I was so young and didn't know much of the history presented in the movie.  I was interested by the way the film used special effects so that the character of Forrest would appear in different important historical events in 20th Century American history.Also, though I didn't realize it at the time, it was beautifully made from the cinematography to the set design to the music, and perhaps most important, the acting and directing.Tom Hanks makes you believe that he is Forrest, which is so hard to do.  The acting in some of the scenes is monumental.  There are so many quotable lines.  The acting by so many of the supporting characters is so effective that you can take the characters' performance for granted and concentrate on the stories and themes.  Gary Sinese, Sally Field, and Hayley Joel Osment fit right into the story.	5.0	20th century classic	2003-04-19	13	9	4
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"I don't know why I waited so long to review this movie.  I fell in love with FORREST GUMP (metaphorically speaking, of course) the first time I saw it in the theater; I've enjoyed it numerous times since.  I suppose I have been intimidated to review it because this film leaves me challenged for words (and for me, that's saying something).  I attribute this to the ""simplistic complexity"" Tom Hanks brings to this unforgettable role--an oxymoron that sums up a lovable, mentally challenged Alabama man.Forrest Gump the character is slow, innocent, naive, honest, sincere, devoted, patient, loyal, and loving.  Hanks brings all these attributes to vivid life in his portrayal; again, he is able to portray a simple-minded man who happens to possess a wellspring of complexity.  Few actors, in my humble little opinion, would be able to pull such contrasts off, but Hanks triumphs, and he makes it look easy.Set in the South, FORREST GUMP is also a powerful critique of America in the mid-20th Century.  The film's agenda is decidedly left leaning as it depicts a status quo under duress from civil rights, to Vietnam, to political corruption, to corporate greed, to a declining culture.  Some of the criticism is on the mark, some of it over the top--but that's Hollywood.  Yet the film's darker political side is conquered by the unpretentious Forrest as he lives his life, seemingly oblivious to much of the ugliness surrounding him.FORREST GUMP is an exceptional, well-made film that looks good and feels good.  It sports a stellar supporting cast, including Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright Penn (to name but a few).  But Hanks is the consistent forte; the movie succeeds because the actor excels.Guess I wasn't at a loss for words, after all.--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON"	4.0	A Hanks Triumph	2006-04-13	4	3	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A29J9M127RCC1U	DoKeUS	"Academy Award winner Tom Hanks, accompanied by Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn, delivers an emotional roller coaster of a performance in the 1994 Paramount Studio release directed by Robert Zemeckis titled Forrest Gump.Forrest Gump garnered six Academy Awards including Best Visual Effects, Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Tom Hanks.Mr. Hanks portrays a man whose lack of intelligence is overshadowed by the size of his heart as he deals with the circumstances that is his life.As a young boy, Forrest is diagnosed with Scoliosis and is fitted with braces for his legs. Little did young Forrest realize, that those braces on his legs would change his life as they helped correct his posture. They helped him meet Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn, who provides many firsts for Forrest as they continue their friendship through the film. As Jenny provides the famous three words, Run Forrest Run, to Forrest's first encounter with manhood, she becomes the main inspiration for Forrest as he makes his way through college and into the Vietnam War where he encounters Bubba and Lieutenant Dan which earns an Academy Award Nomination for Gary Sinise in his portrayal of the man who wanted to die on the battlefield but ended up being a man with ""New Legs.""The special effects that are used for the battle scenes and the brief encounters with President Kennedy, President Nixon, John Lennon, and into the middle of desegregation in the south provide for a humorous and light-hearted break from the otherwise tense scenes into which they are intertwined.I give Forrest Gump a four and a half out of five stars for the special effects, the soundtrack, and the emotional content that each actor and actress is able to bring out in their characters. For young and old alike, this movie is definitely worth the one hundred and forty one minutes that is Forrest Gump."	4.0	Is It Fate or Maybe Just Destiny	2005-03-13	6	4	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A21LUO9789UG39	Donna Davis	This movie is masterfully crafted gentle satire with a huge heart -  funny, sad and some beautiful, magical moments.I have heard it compared to a modern day Candide, which is a good way to describe it's political satire. Without that edge it might be considered by some to be too sentimental or silly, but it is carried out wonderfully. Who can't relate to Lieutenant Dan, on the mast of the ship, confronting God, looking for answers to his destiny and existence. Unforgettable.The feather is a beautiful touch - a metaphorical version of Forrest, blowing whimsically on the wind of time - so we can wonder about the places it lands -destiny or accidental?

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1YBAG1F39W7B7	dr_frightmarestein	Forrest Gump can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama, but it doesn't really matter, since it fails at both. A mentally challenged man (Gump) gets caught up in increasingly improbable situations throughout the 20th century. There's no real overall story arc.... just a bunch of random situations strung together. I didn't care about any of the characters at all; Gump doesn't evolve as a person, and goes through the movie spouting terrible one-liners. Most of the other characters are just jerks.I went into this movie with an open mind when it first came out, and boy was I disappointed. I honestly never saw what the appeal of this movie was, as I thought it was literally one of the worst movies of the '90's. The only bits I enjoyed were the scenes in Vietnam, and the special effects are pretty good. That's why I gave this two stars instead of one.	2.0	A cinematic mess of a movie	2013-01-23	11	1	10

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A278BOLVX1FHVA	DR. Umentary	I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10.	5.0	My Name's Forrest...Forrest Gump...	2011-02-16	2	2	0

Gary Sinise is also excellent.  I just loved all the actors.(I watched this movie again because of Gary Sinise.  I saw him on GMA.  They had the story of him and how he honors, respects and supports our wounded soldiers.  He truly shows us what respecting our soldiers means to everyone.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1WMKEJHJLSGUB	Elizabeth	Aw I just about love this movie. When I was younger, I thought this movie was beyond stupid. And I think it's because I didn't understand it. This movie is about LIFE. Forrest is slow in his mind, but he has a big heart. He does many things in his lifetime too. I think he is one the most inspiring characters yet. He shows the human vulnerabilities that we face in life, and triumphs over them with his heart.  I can watch this over and over. Tom hanks did a WONDERFUL job playing as Forrest. I think the greatest thing about this movie, was that Forrest continued to live his life despite his love for Jenny. He loved her with all his heart, but that didn't stop him from 'living'. You know what I mean? Jenny lived a sad life, but Forrest didn't get drowned in it. All the characters in the movie set the stage for Forrest. Lt Dan was my favorite, haha. Even though the movie had a religious tone it in it (not so absorbed in it), it sent a beautiful message nonetheless. And I'm Atheist.	5.0	Forest Gump is love	2013-04-02	3	3	0

So did what i left in the toilet afterwards. If you havent seen this film count yourself lucky.So if your family is looking to get out a film and want to get this, deny them.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2KB14WCZ1DVE3	elvistcob@lvcm.com	This film has so many little things going for it.  Little things that add up to one big masterpiece.  The story of the slow-witted man who triumphs works, of course, because of the performance of Tom Hanks.  But there are a lot of other things that contributed.First was the script.  I have a big problem with books being altered for movies, especially when they change the physical appearance and essence of the character.  They do that in this film, but I still make an exception because it took the character to new levels.  The book was funny and somewhat farcical, but that character was basically still a Southern hick.  This move adds a lot of dimension to this by showing the feelings this man has.But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.  He ultimately triumphs because of his basic decency.  His determination to do the right thing, and stick with those he believes in gives him his ultimate rewards.  A world full of Forrest Gumps would not produce super-computers, but it would be a world where people get along a lot better than they do in the current one.	5.0	Salute to human decency	2002-10-28	14	13	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	"The first time I'd seen this film was on December 1994,when I was in the middle of the 12th grade. It left quite an impression on me; I felt that I understood the phrase that said ""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump&quot;. And indeed I did, for a long period of time, I've had it's messages, and it's new-to-me way of looking at every day's life on my mind. I guess it still wonders around, echoing inside my head from time to time, reminding me, when I forget, to take things more lightly.The movie itself is one of the saddest I'd seen to that date, and even six years after, I consider it one of the touchiest. This doesn't mean it lacks amusing, funny and joyful moments,on the contrary.This not so common combination is what makes this film so great and recommended.  Myself, I haven't met anyone saying he didn't like it ,except a columnist that had resented the fact that one of the messages of the film can be - you can be a laggard ,but it doesn't matter if you're lucky ! I must admit that it's true according to the film, and it's a misleading and false too, but maybe it's not the main purpose of the film ,maybe a sly way of criticizing and stinging the American content society.One thing I earned from watching it was the love for the run. Sometimes I still reflect at Forrest running anywhere he wants to go, instead of walking, and ,my god I want to run to, or keep on running myself ! I can't forget his insane runs across the U.S. with all the nutcases joining him, this was brilliant !Another unforgettable scene was his second reunion (if I'm not mistaken) with Jenny in Washington D.C after nobody'd heard his speech ,but nevertheless used the `F' word. Seeing this for the first time was a real blast-off, and even on the video it hasn't lost its entertaining-then-heart lifting touch.What's more to say? It's a guaranteed bargain.This movie can be seen over and over ,yet the pleasure remains."	5.0	Delightful .	2000-11-25	8	7	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A7RM685PHBK20	Eric	1994 featured the two most interesting central characters to ever grace the silver screen.  They were Andy Dufresne (The Shawshank Redemption) and Forrest Gump, played respectively by Tim Robbins and Tom Hanks.  Both films  from which the characters originate I consider to be in the top five best  movies of all time and it's the actors that makes the characters come to  life that makes the films so magnificent.Forrest Gump is a drama and a  comedy.  It tells the tale of a mildly retarded man who becomes involved  accidentally in the biggest events of the sixties, seventies, and eighties.  All throughout his life since he was a child, Forrest has been in love  with a girl named Jenny (Robin Wright Penn).  However, she refuses him only  because she loves him too much and doesn't want to hurt him.Underrated  by audiences, Forrest Gump is simply an amazing film.  I was surprised by  how hilarious and moving it was.  The film generates many big laughs that  involve how Forrest initiated and inspired many events in recent history  such as how he was the one who taught Elvis Presley to dance and the time  he unknowingly ratted on the Plumbers of Watergate.The performances are  what make this film memorable.  Tom Hanks gives one of the best leading  performances of the decade (and possibly of all time).  Coming in almost as  good is Gary Sinise as the misanthropic lieutenant whose life is changed  after becoming involved with Forrest in the shrimp business.  The  supporting cast which consists of Wright Penn, Sally Field, Mykelti  Williamson, and Haley Joel Osment (of Sixth Sense fame) also deliver good  performances.Forrest Gump is a great film that has to be seen to be  believed.  Cynics might find some problems with this film but they would  just be missing the entire point.  This is essentially a film about how the  most innocent and kind person on Earth has a low IQ and how he views the  world.  His journey is simply breathtaking.	5.0	Forrest Gump is a magical, moving, and funny film	2000-01-12	114	95	19
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1PEKEZTSDJAVH	Eric San Juan	If you're reading this, you probably already know the film, so there is no need to regurgitate the plot. You likely already know that you like the movie and are simply exploring the idea of buying it to own.And if you haven't seen it yet, well, you probably WILL like the movie. Most people do, and for good reason. Forest Gump has a little something for everyone - love, humor, action, happiness, sadness, and everything in between. Despite interpretations to the contrary, it's not a movie pushing a message or driving an agenda; it's a charming fairy tale about a sympathetic character. Key words: &quot;fairy tale.&quot; Destined to be a classic for many years - unless you're prone to taking fairy tales too seriously.For the price, this is a great package. This is a nice looking, crisp transfer of this modern classic that should look pretty good on high-end TVs. The cinematography deserves the widescreen treatment. The sound is superb. The second disc of extras is not all-encompassing, and the main documentary relies a bit too much on fluff rather than taking a hard look at the making of the film - I certainly would have liked extras with more substance - but it's an enjoyable watch nonetheless.A good buy? Yes. For the price and the quality of the movie, this should be an easy decision to make.	5.0	Destined to be loved for many years	2004-06-01	1	0	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A33Z8L75OXCP78	Eric Schenk	"This movie celebrates one of the worst possible perspectives on life and does it by exploiting all of the good will and energy of music of the Woodstock generation.  Think about it:  Tom Hanks portrays a pure innocent who presumably is to be seen as an American Buddha -- detached from everything except pure love.  Meanwhile, Robin Wright Penn is portrayed as an idiot because she invests herself in silly causes such as opposing the Vietnam War.  We are manipulated into sympathizing with the figure who remains utterly detached from life instead of the figure who cares about the world around her.Meanwhile, we are further manipulated by a soundtrack carefully assembled so as to have us associate all the good feelings and hopes connected to the songs with what we are watching:  a phenomenal bit of film making that successfully transposes the audiences associations with the highest ideals of the sixties and seventies on a film that belittles commitments to those beliefs.This is a truly insidious, reactionary piece of work.  At the end of the movie, ""Nashville,"" Robert Altman cleverly decries the ease by which an audience can be seduced into acquiescing to feel-good nihilism by having everyone leave the theater singing ""You may say that I ain't free, it don't worry me."" with gospel abandon.  The raves that the movie Forest Gump got proves Altman's point.No one can deny that this movie is a well made film with some sweet and wonderful performances.  But, at its core, it is spiritually bankrupt.  While it is not as powerful a film as ""Triumph of the Will"" and the ""philosophy"" it attempts to manipulate the audience into buying isn't as remotely evil as that of Leni R's patrons, it is nonetheless of that ilk -- a successful attempt to bypass the audience's frontal lobe."	1.0	a spiritually and intellectually bankrupt enterprise	2007-06-15	73	23	50

Maybe somewhere in the product description it should tell that it is not an actual box of chocolates, but rather a scratch and sniff card.  How dumb is that?  I thought I was sending a thoughtful gift and instead just looked stupid for thinking they were real.  No where in the description does it say anything about the chocolates, and the title definitely leads a person to believe that they are actual chocolates.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1WHSCGT8AR7BW	"E. Romano ""Hi"""	I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man. Alas, Forrest Gump's mental handicap is much more than an edge for characterization, it's a gift offered to the audience from which they can understand the world as Gump sees it. From there, the world is transormed to a less torturous place, one that isn't remembered for it's cruel wars and its petty insecurities, but for its beautiful landscapes and attachments to love.His conclusions are less childlike than they are optimistic and forward-looking; he's less oblivious than he is empathetic. His ability to focus on the simple beauties of life instead of its horrors is way past what we're capable of. Forrest Gump is a man way ahead of our time, and if we're lucky we can all see the world as he does.If you dont already agree, watch the movie one more time, and keep these assertions in mind. I'm sure some of you will figure him less ignorant and more insightful than most.	5.0	See the movie once, see the world again!	2003-03-21	2	1	1

(Great quotes for all occasions:  Dieting? ""Wanna chocolate?"" ... Someone cut you off on the freeway? ""Stupid is as stupid does."" ... You're an executive subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury? ""That's all I have to say -- about that."")Forrest Gump, a loveable innocent with an I.Q. of 75, stumbles through life pretty much without a clue (""Would you believe it? After five years of playing football I got a college degree!"") -- yet he somehow manages to become a football star, a war hero, and a successful businessman.Only in America.The special effects in this one are absolutely amazing.  Forrest shakes hands with JFK, peeks over George Wallace's shoulder, and shows Linden B. Johnson his butt-cheek.  It's all totally first class stuff.Adventure addicts will love the war scenes (which were bloody, but not nauseating)... Comedy buffs will love Forrest's ability to be funny without meaning to... Romantics will love the unconditional adoration Forrest showers on Jenny (a confused and often abused girl who only too late realizes that what she was looking for was there all along)...

From the day we see him teach Elvis how to dance, up to the point he runs across country, he is constantly part of or making history. However despite everything he has accomplished whether it is in Vietnam, playing ping-pong, or in the shrimping business, Forrest still is humble and seemingly oblivious to it all. His innocence is heartwarming amidst all the turmoil around him in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Hanks is supported wonderfully by Robin Wright, Mykelti Williamson, Gary Sinise, and Sally Fields. This film is funny as well as touching, making it wonderful to watch. The soundtrack also helps to transport you back to the different eras.	4.0	Forrest Gump (1994)	2013-06-01	1	1	0

It follows the unbelievable life of Forrest Gump and the humorous and heartbreaking journeys that he endures in war, love, and life. Hanks is wonderful as the slow, but innocent Forrest and there are so many great and powerful moments in this movie.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"This film reminds me a lot of one of my other all-time favourite movies ""Being There"" starring the comedic genius Peter Sellers but it is even more than that as it incorporates themes present in the outlandish myths of the tales of Paul Bunyon stretching the imagination with amusing whoppers all done so expertly interweaving important social and political issues spanning the 50's to the 80's coinciding with the growth of one simpleton Forrest Gump from childhood to adulthood.  The screenplay is excellent but what makes this film work so well is how well it handles the other major aspects of film-making such as sound effects, cinematography, lighting let alone the usual acting and directing that most people are familiar with.  If you look at this film from a purely technical aspect, this on all accounts is an excellent film and will certainly age very well over the years.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised to see this climb subtantially up any list of best films of all time as more and more people appreciate just how great this film is.Without being judgemental, this film manages to remind us of important historical events in a humourous manner also without being disrespectful of the subject matter.  There are many themes here but I liked the Lt Dan sub-story the best about how a person finds redemption and peace with himself and his faith.  The overall theme which addresses the question of whether life is a series of chance occurrences or the work of an invisible hand I found to be very interesting and is what will make this film as timeless as the answer to this central theme of this great movie.The second disc of extras which includes documentaries and interviews is very well done and the main disc has excellent picture (except for white spots in a few frames) and sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround options.Great film, great picture and sound quality and great extras make this a great addition to your movie library.Highly recommended!"	5.0	"""Being There"" Meets ""The Adventures of Paul Bunyon"" With Extremely Pleasant Results!"	2009-08-07	3	3	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is.It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13-years-old son.  We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.When I rewathed the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump.	5.0	..And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump	2010-02-14	6	5	1

The thing i love the most about this film is forrest's down to earth and innocent personality.  it's  hard to beleive this is just a film and it is greatly down to Tom Hanks's  exceptionally performance which I think can sit comfortable amongst the  best ever.  To me the music also plays a big part in the movie with classy  tunes from the last 50 years.My favorite scenes in this movie are when  Forrest begins to run for no reason and when forrest is introduced to  forrest junior.

It's not my first time watching it, so I knew what to expect.  Forrest Gump is a classic, what else can I say.  Case in point:  they're calling the new Ben Stiller film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (sp?) this generation's Forrest Gump.  The AFI should consider preserving Forrest Gump if it already hasn't done so.	5.0	One of my favorite films	2013-12-15	1	1	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	Forrest Gump, based more or less on the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, is my second favorite film of all time. It always manages to cheer me up, or make me laugh, or make me think. Plus I love all the retro footage and sets, being a big fan of all things 1960s and 1970s.Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a young man who isn't that smart, but still has gone on to lead an interesting life. His life leads him to all sorts of places, and he gets to meet all sorts of people, some of them celebrities of the day. He goes to college, he goes to war, he goes on TV and even to China. He loves his mama (Sally Field) and a girl named Jenny, who he has known since the first day of school (Robin Wright Penn). Sometimes it seems as if he has a destiny, other times its like he's floating round on the breeze. Maybe it's both. Whichever way, it certainly makes an interesting ride.There are so many things I love about this film. I love the character of Forrest, the way he looks at things, the way he talks and interacts with people. I love the soundtrack, a mix of songs contemporary with Forrest's adventures in the 1960s and 1970s. They really add to the mood of the film, plus usually are relevant lyrically, which is a nice touch, I thought. I love the look of everything in the film, which helps the atmosphere just as much as the music. I love how this movie can make me laugh, make my cry and make me think. I love how there's always something thematically I haven't noticed before. Though it's about a not so clever man, I do believe it's a very clever film.Since I love the film so much, I find the special features really interesting. Between the featurettes and the commentary, you'll discover where Lieutenant Dan's legs went, where Tom Hanks picked up Forrest's accent from, why director Robert Zemeckis chose the music he did and how they managed to get so many famous people of the past to make appearances (even though most were dead). It's pretty thorough.All in all, highly recommened. It's a great, colourful film with plenty to look at and consider.	5.0	An Intriguing Forrest	2006-09-17	6	6	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a film of this sort, but I find it so damn irritating that I've gotta say my piece, though I'll bet many others have said approximately the same thing.  From a sheer entertainment standpoint the film isn't too bad, at first.  Forrest goes on adventures, they are passably amusing.  The second half of the film is incredibly dull and all that sh*t with his stupid hippie loser girlfriend is unbearable. Also, though there's no denying that Hanks is an extremely good actor I'm not especially impressed with his performance here.  Everyone seems to think that affected, gimmicky performances are the most impressive thing, but I don't buy it.  Hell back in 6th grade there was this semi-retarded chick that I used to imitate for my friends and lemme tell ya my performance was spot on AND hilarious. Gimmie an Oscar, I rule the acting I do.But what I really hate about this movie is how it's such a major example of the baby boom generations love affair with itself.  Chuck Klosterman summed up the problems with them pretty neatly and I'm gonna quote him as best I can from memory: 'Baby Boomers are convinced that they are the most important generation ever.  THEY ended the war, THEY had things they believed in.  There is nothing more pompous and condescending than a nostalgic baby boomer.' I wish I had the exact quote, but that's the gist of it, and he goes on to note how baby boomers are obsessed with how revolutionary they are and yet they inherited the establishment and ended up keeping pretty much everything the same.  And it's not just that it's about the generation.  That's not necessarily a problem it just reeks of the whole 'God are we amazing attitude'.  I've heard it all before and I'm not interested.  However, if you're a narcissistic baby boomer, knock youself out.Grade: D+	2.0	Hopelessly self-important, dull	2005-11-29	27	8	19

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2HVDZM5S5CA81	"George ""george_goodall"""	Why is it that Forrest Gump makes my cry while George Bailey's Christmas epiphany does nothing? At some level, I realize that I'm being manipulated and played as a chump. By reclaiming the symbols and events from an American history that I'm vaguely familiar with, Zemeckis has tampered directly with my brain. I know this but I still cry when Forrest's best friend Bubba dies...  or when his mother dies... or when his true love dies.Jenny was Forrest's true love. They grew up together and her life was a shadow of his. It seems that the story of her wayward life provides the negative space for the luminence of Forrest's puritanical life style. Despite this analysis, she's not the villain of the story. She's the victim. The villain is her father. It seems that the abuses that Jenny suffers at a young age set her on the path of self destruction. Despite his best efforts, Forrest only becomes a protector and father figure when it's too late. Is the message that fathers can't protect their children or that parents can be the cause of much pain? Does this make me cry? It should but it doesn't.Sally Field plays Forrest's mother. She always believes in Forrest's future and ability and makes considerable sacrifices to ensure that her son recieves an appropriate education. She stays at home to raise her son and supports all of his initiatives: playing football, joining the army, buying a shrimp boat, etc. Is the message that the value of mothers lies only in the succes of their children and that they should sacrifice their own aspirations for those of their children? Does this make me cry? It should but it doesn't.Forrest is a dim witted southerner. Despite his limitations he attains every accolade of success that American society offers: he's an All American football player, a war hero, an entrepreneur, he meets the President several times, and he is featured on the cover of the National Examiner. Really, Gump is the bizarro-Schwarzenegger. He's a contradiction. His best friend is Bubba- a dim witted black southerner. Is the message that a white southerner having an African American best friend is a contradiction? Does this make me cry? It should but it doesn't.I cry because I've been programmed to. Zemeckis marks the time of the movie with the occurrence of political events and assasinations. He uses these events to invoke emotional responses i.e., JFK Dead = Me Sad. Zemeckis also makes use of common narrative archetypes that invoke an emotional response i.e., Mother Dying = Me Sad; Jenny Dying = Orphan = Me Sad. Only the addition of a debtor's prison and a momma deer being shot by a hunter could complete this sensory assault.The brilliance of this movie isn't its politcal message but the manipulation of my programmed responses......it still make me cry.PS- Forrest Gump also features an early performance by Haley Joel Osment. Time can only tell if appearing as a replicant in the Spielberg picture AI will elevate his career the way Blade Runner did for Rutger Hauer and Sean Young.	4.0	It makes me cry: Gump as bizarro-Schwarzenegger	2003-01-15	4	1	3

Forrest Gump makes his way into all of our hearts by weaving himself into real American events so that we can relate to him. An innocent man sitting on a bench telling the story of his life. He may not be all there, but he touches all of our hearts. The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on. It tells the tale of a man's life, and how he changed America. Tom Hanks brings so much to the role of Forrest, being able to express many emotions and feelings. The DVD is really good, great everything. I wouldn't even think about complaining at all.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	"Forrest Gump is the story of the life of a retarded man who lives through epic events in American history: JFK, Nixon, Vietnam War, etc.  His life touches most of these significant ways, such as by accidentally discovering Watergate.  He becomes famous after rescuing several soldiers in the Vietnam War, and achieving remarkable success in international ping pong.  But his heart's desire is his childhood friend Jenny, who is one of the few who shows compassion to him.The insight into the life of a retarded man is wonderful.  And the acting, particularly of Tom Hanks in acting Forrest Gump, is remarkable.  Some of the special effects (eg the ping pong playing, the inclusion of Forrest Gump in real newscasts of US presidents, John Lennon, etc) are astounding.  The DVD features an explanation of how these special effects were accomplished, and they truly are outstanding.  The concept is great, but the way it is worked out is a typical Hollywood disappointment.Because these are the only positives about the movie.  Several concerns:1. Adult themes.  The rating is only PG 13, but there are many scenes with violence, drugs, nudity and sex, themes inappropriate for children.  The language is mostly reasonable, but there are multiple incidences of strong blasphemy and foul language.2. Lack of moral absolutes.  Forrest Gump represents innocence and naivity, but yet he is corrupted by Jenny, whom he eventually sleeps with.  Even after he fathers her child outside of wedlock, she assures him that he has done nothing wrong. Jenny's death is apparently due to her lifestyle (due to her drug problems, STDs or AIDS?), and yet the dangerous consequences of an ungodly lifestyle are never connected or clearly spelled out.  She seems to represent all the dangerous things of the sixties.3. Atheism.  Gump is one of the few individuals who believes in God, but this is presented as part of his retarded thinking, which like in other areas, is out of date and inaccurate.  This is especially clear in a blasphemous scene where his friend challenges God to sink his boat.  As it turns out, God loses, because every boat is sunk except theirs, and they become millionaires as a result.  Christianity is clearly presented as irrelevant for modern life.4. Self-determinism.  The movie starts and ends with a fluttering feather.  It's a very religious symbol, as the movie itself explains with several discussions about ""destiny"".  Destiny is partly the random fluttering of fate, and what you make of it yourself.  Forrest partly triumphs by his character, but also the whims of fate (eg the success of his shrimping company is pure ""chance"" after all other boats sink).  God's involvement in the world is clearly rejected in favour of self-determinism.  This is a strong theme in the movie, and a dangerous one.5. Trivialization.  Key events of American history are presented through Gump's eyes.  While it gives insight into a retarded man, at the same time these key events are downplayed and presented as trite and almost laughable.  Some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century are trivialized.  This reflects the failure of most Americans to treat life with the seriousness it deserves.All in all, while this movie had aspects of warm humour, it also showed the spiritual bankruptcy of a modern America that has rejected God and is no longer rooted to moral absolutes.  The fact that this was awarded the Best Picture in 1993 and received a bag-load of Academy Awards just proves that it is indeed representative of modern thinking.  Interestingly some critics believe that this movie is an attack on liberalism, lambasting promiscuity, atheism, and the entire counter-culture of the 60s.  I wish it was, but the very fact of its immense popularity among modern viewers suggests that - sadly - this is not the case.  It's a sad reflection of modern American, and its popularity just confirms how accurate this portrait really is."	2.0	Typical Hollywood.  Typical America.	2002-03-06	40	11	29

I think it was nothing special. But when I watched it again,  I found Tom Hanks has taught  us how to be a good person in our life . Tom Hanks shows out his pure human  nature and personality, do and decide all the things by his own first  judgement. Does he care  about others thinking ?  No. However in our world,  we always think of others, we are totally controlled by the people. We  can't be ourselves anymore. We seem not to be happy. This movie give me  inspiration. I must try  to be myself all the time. Do the things I want to  do, show out all the talents that God give me, at last, I will not regret  and I will find my way out successfully and automatically.	5.0	Pure Nature Of Human	2000-02-27	8	6	2

Mixed in with in an interesting journey through the events  that make up Baby-Boomer generation history, Forrest Gump is a movie about  friendship, love,and loyalty.  But most importantly, it is a movie about a  man who, though mildly retarded, has a heart of gold and who manages to  make a huge impact on everyone around him - including anyone who watches  the film!

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	"This was mildly entertaining.  It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them).  Why this won so many awards is highly questionable.  The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice.  The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?).  Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging.  It's a rather simple performance where he's just playing an ""aw, shucks"" kind of guy.  The special FX were really no big deal (even though the press told us they were), and look quite ordinary today.  Reportedly, the original novel was much more satritic and darker.  I should read it.  It's probably better than the film."	2.0	Not particularly good, and certainly not worth all the accolades it received...	2007-01-20	21	6	15

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	"I've written over two hundred reviews, I never wrote one for this film. I thought I wouldn't do it justice. I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role.I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.Forrest Gump is special. In a wierd way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldnt want anybody rushing to see me.The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is compareable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.My favourite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny ""Cause you're my girl"" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says ""I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now"", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too. This, and American Beauty are the two best films I have ever seen. I pray I watch a film I like almost 60% as much."	5.0	BRILLIANT	2006-07-26	5	4	1

The story has  a lot of senses, it's not  a simple movie. It tells us  a lot about the American history too!I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man.The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on.But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.So I very enjoyed it and I highly recommended it!	5.0	More than wonderfull!	2003-07-05	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2ET57MBW92YE4	"""hotballerina18"""	"""Run Forrest Run"" was my favorite line in the movie!  Tom Hanks played the main actor Forrest Gump.  The actress that Forrest Gump was in love with was Robin Wright who was Jenny Curran in the movie.  In the beginning of the movie Forrest had many problems with his legs, and he wasn't considered ""normal"" in his school.  He had an I.Q. of 75, which is considered to be dumb.  Forrest was not smart, and even when he had bad legs, he still turned out a great man.  He met many presidents, and many famous people.  He was named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who started the Ku Klux Klan.  Forrest Gump was a wonderful movie with the great soundtrack put into the movie.  I think that without a soundtrack the movie would seem long and not as interesting.  I loved the movie Forrest Gump.  Although some parts I wish would not happen.  At the end, I wish that Jenny would live so Forrest could be so much happier with her.  I wish she had done that kind of stuff she did in her past, which ended up with her receiving HIV and dying at a young age.  In the end, she has a child Forrest Jr., she marries Forrest, then she gets sick, and she dies.  Many times, she was with Forrest and she became scared and left.  Many times Jenny gets scared and so she just runs, because she thinks running away from your problems is better than facing them.  Which is not true, I believe that if you keep running away from your problems they are going to build up and then in the end whether you want to or not you have to face them.  You problems will always chase you until you solve them and figure them out and live out the consequences.  Especially one of the times Jenny left him, he ran off.  He ran across the United States four times, which took him 3 years 2, months, 14 days, and 16 hours.  He had some tough times but he also had some great times.  Some of the tough times he had to face was growing up without a father, getting picked on by bullies, having leg problems, being considered ""dumb,"" and most of all losing his best friend in the army Bubba Blue.  Forrest had rough times but also had some great times.  He met many famous and great people like Elvis Presley, who is the King of Rock and Roll.  He met George Wallace one time while he was picking up Vivian's Malone's book as Wallace was standing in the schoolhouse door at the University of Alabama.  He met Abby Hoffman who was an anti war demonstration person.  John Lennon and Dick Cavett, when on Cavett's television show.  He met a few presidents like John F. Kennedy when he was a member of the all American football team.  He met Lyndon Johnson receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Richard Nixon as a member of the All-American Ping Pong team.  I would be the happiest person ever if I got to meet people like Forrest Gump did.  The actor who played Forrest Gump was Tom Hanks who is a wonderful actor and is so amazingly awesome, was the best actor to act for the film Forrest Gump.  Not only is he a great actor, but he lived the part of Forrest Gump.  The movie racked up about 500 million at the box office. At the time that the movie was going on their was also a war.  Forrest Gump and his best friend Bubba Blue were also in the Vietnam war, and Forrest saved everyone including Lieutenant Dan.  He got mostly everyone except Bubba Blue, who was too injured and died.  He then later owned a shrimp boat company because he made a promise to Bubba Blue that he would.  So he did, and became highly successful in life."	5.0	Life is Like A Box Of Chocolates . . .	2004-01-12	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AMF5LHI9IOIH1	Irishgirl	"Wow, this is one of my all-time favorite films and in my opinion, one of the best made. I remember when this movie first came out and my mom, grandmother and I went to see it in the theatres. Being a very young teen at the time (around 13), there were some things about the film that I missed or didn't quite understand, but I nevertheless loved it. As the years went by, I watched it several times and it got better and better. It's one of those timeless movies that should be put in a time capsule. ""Forrest Gump"" was the winner of ""Best Film"" in 1994. I still can't believe it's been 13 years since this movie came out. Everyone at my junior high at the time loved the film and even voted it as their favorite for 1994. There was even a popular guy at school whose nickname became ""Gump."" There was quite a ""Forrest Gump"" craze after the movie came out, from ""Bubba Gump"" shrimp hats and shirts, to cookbooks, to Gump documentary books. The movie spawned popular phrases such as ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" ""Life is like a box of chocolates....you never know what you're gonna get,"" ""Sometimes there just aren't enough rocks"" and ""We was like peas and carrots.""For those of us like me, who never grew up in the 1950's and 60's, ""Forrest Gump"" is the perfect way to lead you through a decade of some of the most important events and people of that time. We see these events through the eyes and life of Forrest Gump, as this extraordinary man seems to come across some pretty historical marks just by living his innocent life. Imagine meeting Elvis Presley in your own home, or sitting next to the likes of John Lennon? Tom Hanks (one of the best actors you could watch and one of my all-time favorites), plays Forrest Gump, a challenged man with a rather low IQ who has always been subject to discrimination since he was a boy. His adoring mother, played by Sally Field (another one of my very favorite actresses and one of the best around), with her gentle personality, is always there to remind Forrest that he's no different, and refuses to let anyone treat him differently. The only person other than his mother who accepts Forrest is Jenny, an innocent girl with her own demons at home, whom he met on the bus as a boy. Together, they grew up and even though they led separate lives, they still remained close and had a good relationship. Forrest played football for Alabama and got to meet President John F. Kennedy. In Vietnam where he endures the hardships of war, he befriends a challenged, shrimp-obsessed soldier named Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and a rough talking, bitter Lieutenant named Dan Taylor (a magnificent and intensely real performance from Gary Sinise). And he gets a special medal from President Lyndon Johnson after some heroic efforts during the war. Oh, and he also becomes an expert ping pong player, a shrimp boat captain, a witness to Watergate and he makes a seemingly tireless run across the states gaining faithful followers along the way. Jenny (a stunning performance from Robin Wright) meanwhile, has become a bit of a drifter and a druggie, hanging around with the likes of hippies and men who enjoy beating women. She frequents clubs, sells her body and plays folk music. Though she and Forrest's worlds seem to lead in totally different directions, they still seem to find their way to each other. And keep your eyes open for a very young Haily-Joel Osment who plays Forrest's little boy.""Forrest Gump"" is both a comedy and a drama. It has a lot of everything in it from the poignant, emotional scene of Jenny throwing rocks at her childhood home where she was abused, to Forrest showing his buttocks battle wound to President Lyndon Johnson, to Jenny's fight with a terminal illness, to Forrest's bulldozing over of the Alabama cheerleaders in the endzone after his touchdown run. This film is all about destiny and handling that destiny no matter what the outcome of each event is. It's a story of heroism and loyalty, of love and acceptance, of trial and error. It's about tackling complexity with simplicity. There is so much going on in this film that I could write a novel about it. It covers so much ground; such huge events from the past as seen through rather innocent eyes. Forrest seems to tackle each challenge in life with his innocent ease and is the type of person who just takes it like it is; just do it and don't turn back. This film has so much to offer that it truly begs you not to become engrossed. And the acting is so real, you feel like you're in the film. It is a great ""period"" film, as you can see all the styles from the times; the peace signs, the side-burns, the cars, the old south. Everything is captured so nicely. And the film has extraordinary special effects that involve real footage from the time period wrapped around Tom Hanks as Gump. You can see how all the special features were done on the second disc ""Behind the Magic of Forrest Gump;"" a disc loaded with extras including screen tests, the making of the film and how they wanted it to appear, all the work to do the props, all the special effects with amazing computer technology, how the makeup was done, and on and on. They cover just about everything. And of course, I must mention the soundtrack, which I believe is a two CD set since there is so much. There are awesome tunes from the war period of the sixties such as ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" by The Byrds, ""California Dreamin'"" from The Mamas and The Papas, and ""Fortunate Son"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Later on into the late 70's and early 80's, we hear such hits as The Doobie Brothers' ""It Keeps You Running,"" Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way"" and Bob Segar and The Silver Bullet Band's ""Against The Wind.""Okay sooooo my fingers are out of breath.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2H1WNB30JNAWU	Jack D. Lowry	Forrest Gump is by far a really great movie with a great actor by the name of Tom Hanks.  The story is pretty basic and no matter how many times I have seen this movie I have yet to get tired of watching it, because I enjoy the acting job Hanks preformes in it plus all the great music from they used to make the movie come alive during the whole 70's.  I watched the bonus features long time ago but anyone intrested in how the movie come about made the specials very intresting main thing being how they did the special effects inculding how the legless man scenes were filmed.  I personally enjoy the movie for the history lessons within the movie helps me remeber what happened in the past and being a history major in college I enjoy mutiple history lessons and topics.  But every actor did a great job in the movie and made the movie so much more believable.  I think most people already own this movie if not then defently buy this movie not just for the amazing acting job Hanks does for the storyline and character but also the great soundtrack it has from the 70's.	5.0	Great movie with a great actor on top of great music tracks in the movie	2013-01-27	2	1	1

Forrest Gump is dumb, yet he is extraordinarily persistent and virtuous. His character strengths allows him to achieve extraordinary deeds, such as becoming a world class ping pong player, a famous marathon runner, and a war hero.The antithesis of Forrest is an intelligent Berkley anti-War student. He is against the Vietname War because it violates his conscience. He also beats his girlfriend and is the antagonist of the movie.Why protest a war which the historians will conclude as the most indefensible in American History? Be like Forrest, don't think, and just do as authorities tell you, even if it means killing others. The fact this movie came out in mid-90s when the Vietnam War had all but been condemned as an unneccessary mistake makes this point even more disturbing.To be sure, Gary Sinese played a pivotal role of glorifying those who heroically sacrificed in Vietnam. But I felt the anti-war protesters should have been given their credit for the sacrifices they made in the name of justice and humanity.Americans should never strive to be like Forrest. Being dumb and ignorant is not a virtue. Blind submission to authorities will often lead to demise of the freedom and democracy in the society. Just read what the Founding Fathers of this great country had to say about the subject. In this sense, this was ironically a very Un-American movie with a sinister theme.	2.0	The underlying sinister theme is disturbing	2006-02-04	25	9	16

The acting is great from Tom Hanks(oscar winning role) as Forest Gump, Robin Wright Penn as Jenny Forest's only one true love and then there is Gary Sinise who dose a great job and is  a scene steller. The sotry follows a man who's lfe is shown from the 50's to 90's. We see him meet Elvis as a young man, meet all the president's, go to vietnam and amny more. The film is also good history lesson.

His travels; from Greenbow, Alabama, through college, playing football for Bear, and becoming a war hero in Vietnam, Forrest sets an example for everyone, even though it is a movie. I can watch this movie anytime and be satisfied. It is a movie for the heart. His love for the people close to him, his mama, Jenny, and his son, Little Forrest, evidences his good heart and mind.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A356LDMO4BTFQT	Jamie A.	"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Forrest Gump is a movie that is held dearly in the hearts of audiences. It has won six Oscars, and has also claimed 38 other wins as well as 44 various nominations. Forrest Gump is an endearing story that follows the life of a man with a low IQ as he goes through a series of random of events. The movie's spans over several decades of Gump's life as the audience are also able to catch a glimpse of some of the defining moments of the latter part of the 20th century such as the Vietnam War. Forrest Gump is able to capture defining events in American history with surprising accuracy without losing its wit and charm. According to Newsweek critic, David Ansen, ""For all its ambition, the movie ends up using great historical events in the service of a dubious sentimentality."" Forrest Gump has intrigued and won the hearts of many with its lovable characters and simple plot. Set in the backdrop of one of America's most tumultuous times, Forrest Gump provides accurate information without sacrificing its appeal to audiences.SummaryThe movie begins as Forrest, the main character, is sitting at a bus stop. A stranger sits next to Forrest, prompting him to begin telling his story of how he got to that bus stop.Forrest's story begins when he is a young boy. On his first day of school, he meets Jenny, a prominent character, on the bus. As a young boy with leg braces, the other boys constantly tease Forrest as they throw rocks at him. However, one day, as he is attempting to escape his tormentors, Forrest discovers his knack for running, landing him a football scholarship in college. After college, Forrest then decides to join the army where he is sent to Vietnam to fight in the Vietnam War. There, Forrest meets a significant character in the story, Bubba. Together, they formulate a plan to start up a shrimp boat once they leave the war. However, in a turn of events, Forrest's platoon is attacked, Bubba is killed and Forrest is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving his friends and colleagues.While recovering from injuries sustained from the war, Forrest discovers his ability to play ping-pong, gaining him both riches and fame. With the money he earns, Forrest lays the foundation for him and Bubba's `shrimping' company. While his business is initially unsuccessful, after a series of events, his business eventually flourishes, leaving him with copious amounts of money. Forrest then returns home to attend to his mother's final days. While at home, Jenny returns back into Forrest's life and promptly leaves after he declares his love for her. Her departure prompts Forrest to begin running and he continued to run nonstop three and a half years.Back in present day at the bus stop, Forrest reveals that he is there to visit Jenny, who has written him a letter. When he meets her, she reveals that they have a son together, Forrest Jr. and that she is dying of an incurable disease. Together, Jenny, Forrest and Forrest Jr. move back to Alabama, where Jenny and Forrest are married. Shortly after their marriage, Jenny dies.Characters and ActorsWhile some critics may be divided on issues about the plot, there seems to be a general consensus about Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump. There is no doubt that this may be his best performance. Hanks not only personifies Forrest, he embodies the character, becoming one with him. He creates depth for a character that on paper is so simple. He makes Forrest lovable and extremely believable. He is able to portray this simple-minded man with perfection, all down to Forrest's strong Southern accent and absentminded stupidity. According to Peter Travers of the Rolling Stones, ""It's Hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of Forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pound bruiser of the book."" With no doubt, Tom Hanks is the shining star of this film as ability to portray such a character with such grace is equally astounding and worthy of applause.Another character of importance is Jenny, played by Robin Wright. While Wright's performance appears intermittently throughout the film, her presence cannot be forgotten. As is required, Wright definitely exudes the strength and the resilience that the role requires. However, while Wright does well to bring the character to life, her performance is overshadowed by her colleague's, Tom Hanks', performance. Wright's performance delivers what is necessary to portray the character, but it is definitely not the dazzling display that Hanks has appeared to give.Historical AccuracyForrest Gump is not only a movie with a great plot, within it, great history woven within. Set in the latter part of the 20th Century, Forrest Gump is able to give audiences a glimpse into the historical events of the time with surprising accuracy.One of the first historical events to occur is the integration of races in schools all across America. The movie depicts a mob surrounding several African American students as they shuffle into the school. Just as what occurred in real life, the movie shows the military assisting the African American students into the school as the mob attempts to resist their admittance into the university.Hurricane Carmen was also mentioned in the movie. While on the most part it is quite accurate, there are a few discrepancies. While the film accurately depicted the damage the hurricane brought upon the `shrimping' industry, in reality, the hurricane itself did not actually damage the industry. It was actually the ecological effects of hurricane. When Hurricane Carmen hit, the consistency of the water where the shrimp lived, causing stress to the shrimp and an eventual depletion in the population of shrimp. The movie was right about another thing however; Bubbagump Shrimp Company was actually established around the time of the hurricane.A big chunk of Forrest Gump is actually dedicated to the Vietnam War. While it does accurately depict the events, the movie made it seem like the war was just another war. In other words, it did not really depict the severity of the situation. In reality, the Vietnam War was the longest war in U.S. history and it was a war where many men didn't know what they were fighting for. However, overall, the film quite accurately portrays the Vietnam War. There indeed was a lot of heavy rain and there were many ambushes as well. Very briefly throughout this segment of the film, the word `humping' was mentioned. This word was actually a very common word amongst soldiers of the Vietnam War. It's meaning is to walk, march or carry things. Moreover, the film also accurately portrayed Nixon's escalation of the war as well as the American public's response to the war. When Forrest returned to Washington D.C., he found himself in a public rally against the war. The film correctly shows the public sentiment against the war, as well as the people participating (Hippies).Another event that occurred within the movie was the infamous Watergate scandal where a break-in occurred at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex. Nixon's administration tried to cover up their involvement. However, the scandal led to his eventual resignation. In Forrest Gump, Forrest actually discovers the scandal while complaining about lights keeping up him in the Watergate office across from his hotel. In the film, Forrest makes a call to the security guard, Frank Wills, who was the actual guard on duty that night who discovered the break in.In the movie, Forrest Gump is depicted as a celebrity ping-pong player. While some of the events in both the movie and book are exaggerated, it is true that the ping-pong team was the first group of Americans to visit China since 1949.Overall, Forrest Gump is great story, woven in with some of America's greatest historical events. While there are some inaccuracies, such discrepancies are few. According Todd McCarthy of Variety, ""A picaresque story of a simpleton's charmed odyssey through 30 years of tumultuous American history, Forrest Gump is whimsy with a strong cultural spine."" For those hoping to watch an exciting and humorous movie intertwined with history, Forrest Gump is the movie for you."	5.0	Forrest Gump: A Timeless Classic	2013-03-24	2	1	1

His girlfriend, Jenny, reminded me of that woman in Of Human Bondage. Jenny decides to marry Forrest iat the end of her life because she needed someone to take care of here while she was dying of AIDS.  There are interesting historical events woven into this story and the sequences of the fighting in the Viet Nam war were engaging.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A16G3MNFCHI0N6	J. Brinkerhoff	"I went to see this movie in the theaters in 1994, and as I recall it was one of those ""just pick a movie to go see"" type of nights. Picked this movie for no particular reason, heck I don't think I even knew what it was about. Theater was packed though, and I believe it might have been the opening weekend. I remember sitting there, watching it, and really being incredibly moved. I hadn't expected that, and the rather long movie just flew by. I'm now 43, which would have made me what, 20-something back in 1994. 20-something GUYS don't get emotional in movies. Right? Well, this was the first movie I ever shed a tear in. Tears of sadness, tears of joy, it was quite an experience. I'd never connected with a character in a movie like that before (or since).Last weekend, 2012 now, this movie was on TV and I happened to cross channels with it. I had forgotten about most of it, and it was like watching it again for the first time. Complete with the emotions. Really, if for some strange reason you never watched this movie, watch it. But sit down and watch the whole thing, no distractions. It is definitely one of the greatest pieces of work Tom Hanks has ever done, and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time."	5.0	Saw it in 1994, and for the 2nd time a week ago..	2012-02-02	3	2	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AX11CD4P4VXPX	"jcb02 ""jcb02"""	Forrest Gump is without a doubt an effective film.  Only the hardest heart will fail to be moved by its emotional crescendos, of which there are many.  Several scenes have become American film classics, emblazed in our consciousness.  Also in praise, Tom Hanks does a fine job as Forrest, who embodies many of the qualities most prized in the United States; honesty, loyalty, and courage. There is, however, a seamy underside to the movie and it is this message: it is better to be a half wit, oblivious to the vagaries of reality; than to understand what is going on and be corrupted by the resulting despair.  To drive home this message, we are presented the parallel lives of Forrest, the innocent, and that of his lifelong love, Jenny.While Forrest valiantly serves in a war he does not understand, Jenny proceeds down the path of the anti-government reactionary of the 1960s.  We are invited to believe that Jenny takes this path in part because she was abused as a child, and we see her devolve slowly into anti-Vietnam protest, partying with the Black Panthers, drug abuse, suicidal tendencies, and perhaps worst of all, sexual promiscuity with unsuitable men.  AIDS is her punishment for wandering off the moral reservation, for Jenny is the anti-Forrest, a morally conscientious yet wholly immoral liberal.  In case the message is lost on you, the paths of Jenny and Forrest cross throughout the movie, and the audience can only conclude at every meeting that Jenny should forego the social conscientiousness, and retire to the plantation house with Forrest to enjoy a simple life.  Yet Jenny refuses to be saved, and the religious parallels are obvious.America follows the path of Jenny- her turbulence matches that of the political period.  But we are invited to wonder whether or not if we as a country would be better off as Forrest- perhaps chastity and innocence engender honesty, loyalty, courage, and the ability to be remarkable.  The only expense, however, is our intelligence, or at the least, a renouncement of ideological responsibility, an idea that is wholly discomforting.	4.0	Good, but somewhat disturbing	2005-01-13	10	8	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A39LO2MPCWS4EO	Jeffrey C. Zoerner	"Did you know that a kindly simpleton was responsible for every cultural phenomenon from the 1960s through the 1980s?  His name was Forrest Gump, and by merit of his below-normal intelligence, there was nothing he couldn't do.  We've all heard Aaron Copland's stirring ""Fanfare for the Common Man.""  Well, this movie could have just as well been entitled ""Fanfare the Sub-Mediocre.""If you think about it honestly, among serious movies, ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the dumbest ever made.  I don't want to give away the plot to the uninitiated, so I will limit myself to one fr'instance.  Imagine a beautiful, intelligent woman singing folksongs nude in front of a hundred rowdy, drunken men.  Now imagine this sensitive artist's heart breaking because no one is listening to her music.  That scene in a nutshell captures the mentality of the film; it is one of a hundred scenes very much like it.Quite simply, ""Forrest Gump"" is two hours of non-stop tugging at the viewer's  heartstrings.  Like the comedy that throws non-stop jokes at the viewer without any meaningful cohesion, it stops working after a while.Now to give the devil his due: you will enjoy this movie in spite of how dumb it is.  Three stars.  It's fun.  Gump is a sympathetic character whom you will want to see succeed.  The film is fairly funny. The movie REALLY gets carried away, however, when this boob's achievement level goes through the roof.  The viewer is left scratching his head in bewilderment. Which brings up an interesting point: what is the point of this movie?  Plain and simple - it is to exalt the superiority of the lowly over the mighty.  I've spoken with several people who find that very inspiring.  I don't.This is NOT one of the best movies ever.  It's not even particularly good.  That movies like this and ""Titanic"" win the Best Film award on Oscar night only goes to show how ridiculous the Academy Awards really are.  Still, it's not a bad way of spending an evening, even if just to be able to perfect your dead-on impression of the lame-brained main character.  (Mine is quite good.)

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ATA4191XF55YF	Jeffrey O'donnell	This has always been one of my favorite movies, charting a course through post-WWII American history and showing how a simple man with a solid heart and strong values can be an example for millions.  I have never liked Jenny who rejects Forrest throughout the movie (despite his undying love for her) and dates a series of losers and ruffians.  Only at the end, when she has a child and is dying, does she decide to commit to Forrest.  Seeing it in Blu-Ray made it all the more special	5.0	Great movie	2012-10-30	2	1	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"Once in a great while, a movie comes along that captures your heart and imagination.  Forrest Gump is one of those rare movies.  Led by an all-star cast including Tom Hanks (Forrest), Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan), and Sally Field (Mrs. Gump), the viewer is treated to a view of Americana through the eyes of a simple young country boy.Through three turbulent decades, the movie describes events that were capturing headlines throughout the United States, as told through Forrest's eyes.  The viewer gets a unique look at such events as racial segregation, physical disability, war protests, and the onset of AIDS.  Through Forrest's unique perspective, the viewer is shown each of these controversial topics.The viewer also gets to see the ups and downs of Forrest's relationship with Jenny over the years.  From young children riding a school bus together to facing the uncertainty of AIDS, a lifelong bond is shared between them. Although leading very different lives, Forrest's love for Jenny never waivers, and in the end, Jenny finally realizes that she is ment to be with Forrest.The scenes in Vietnam are some of my favorites.  Gary Sinese's portrayal of Lt. Dan Taylor is simply perfect.  A by-the-book soldier who teaches Forrest how to stay alive, it is ultimately Forrest who saves Lt. Dan's life (over his protests) during an enemy ambush.  Forced to have both legs amputated, Lt. Dan slips into a life of alcohol and self-doubt, but Forrest remains his true friend, and after buying a shrimping boat, Lt. Dan joins Forrest as his ""first mate"".  It is here that Lt. Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life.The most touching scene of the movie is near the end where Forrest is speaking to Jenny at her gravesite.  Forrest tells Jenny how much he loves and misses her, all the while gently crying.  He also explains to her how proud he is of their son Forrest Jr.  In the end, Forrest and Forrest Jr. are waiting for the school bus, just like Forrest and his mother used to.I would give this movie six stars if I could.  Tom Hanks won an academy award for his portrayal of Forrest, while Robert Zemeckis also won for best director.  Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The acting is impeccable, and the viewer gets an interesting history lesson about life in the United States during the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  I guarantee that you won't have a dry eye after watching it."	5.0	The Story of a Lifetime	2005-02-01	8	7	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1YIWDKM1292L4	"jenbird ""book and classic movie fiend"""	Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is endearing, interesting, and amusing. Watching Forrest go through life, inadvertantly participating in and making history, makes for a wonderful story. Sally Field, Robin Wright, and Gary Sinese also give great performances.The second disk of features is a real treat. We get an extended behind the scenes glimpse of how the many special effects were created, from erasing Gary Sinese's legs to inserting Tom Hanks into newsreel footage. The FX are a big part of what makes this movie so memorable, and getting to see how they were created is fascinating.	5.0	I never get tired of this movie	2002-12-27	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A15RB66290XLRH	Jessica	People like the &quot;vile pile&quot; reviewer underestimate the message of this warm, kind movie. Don't people like you understand that there is not always a necessity for complex messages? The message is simple, like Forrest Gump himself: &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.&quot; Such wisdom, because it represents the sponaneoity and mystery of life.  We need more people like Forrest. Sure, he's simpleminded, but he has a huge heart. And I stress &quot;HUGE&quot;. He doesn't care what anyone thinks of him-because he doesn't know the difference, but that's what makes him so likable, because he can adapt easily under any kind of circumstance. He is never mean, stands up for the people he loves, has more determination than any one I've ever seen. He has such love, and he doesn't hold it all in. He is honest, but not insulting. There are more than enough scenes to show that Forrest is a rare spirit. Such as the little scene most people seem to have overlooked- the one when two black students are accepted into an all-white school and one of them drops her book while entering the building, and Forrest runs up to her and hands her the book. Who else would have had the chutzpah to do that? He also gives up a whole load of money to buy a shrimping boat, just because he promised his best friend who died in combat that they would have a boat someday. Most people might find this ludicrous, but I found it unbelievable. I, for one, would have never done that. And he's so modest about it, too- a quality that most people do not possess.  He is also overcome by compassion and love for his best friend, Jenny. I was asking the exact same question myself when Jenny said to Forrest: &quot;Why are you so good to me, Forrest?&quot; Jenny leaves him a number of times during the movie, but unlike many people, Forrest doesn't become hateful and bitter. He just keeps on thinking about her and loving her.Forrest, a simple minded man, with an I.Q. of 75, holds the key to all noble, shining parts of life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and a love for simple, but memorable messages of life.	5.0	A whole lot more than five stars!	2001-04-29	13	10	3

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2GVJ83F092MIS	J. Hayes	When I say greatest of all-time that is my opinion of course, but there are many others who would agree with that statement. For those who dont think it is the greatest it has to rank in the top 10 right? Well to me this is a pure cinematic masterpiece in every aspect, from the great cast(Hanks, Fields, Wright, Sinise), the great storyline, the camera work and great directing from Robert Zimeckis. There are also so many memorable quotes in this movie that today, 10 years later I still remember and quote lines from it like &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates...&quot;Forrest Gump is the story of a man that is not very bright but still he sees the world in a way few others ever have or will. We see the progression from the young Forrest who barely makes it into a normal school and is constantly bullied by his peers, to the man who had come to experience so much in life like being on a national champion football team, meeting the president, serving in Vietnam and starting his own shrimping business. Along the way he meets some interesting characters such as Jenny whom he loves his whole life but she follows the wrong path in life, and his best friend Bubba. Bubba was his best friend in the world, and they planned on a partnership in the shrimping business since Bubba's family had always been in that business. You see real emotions that life brings when Bubba dies in Vietnam, when his mother and Jenny die, and when he learns he has a son, Forrest Jr. Forrest lives life to the fullest and I think it is a great message because someone may be considered to be slow but that doesnt mean they can't accomplish so many things in life.The dvd is great and truly does this movie right. The extras are very good like the commentaries and deleted scenes, but to be honest I have not watched all that disc 2 has to offer. I could have gone into more detail about the plot but most of you reading this know what it is about. And if you have never seen it, I really think you will be amazed at what a great film this is. This is a great price for those who don't own this yet so do yourself a favor and pick this up if you havent already. It is truly the best movie I have ever seen and I can't imagine anything else like it ever happening in cinema. It is my favorite and I doubt anything will ever take its place.	5.0	The Greatest Movie of All-Time	2004-06-02	1	0	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1Y6CE9HHZVBDP	"""jhunsel"""	I've watched Forrest Gump for the first time since its initial theatrical release and was quickly reminded just how great a film it really is. The film itself has been critiqued many times, so I will instead concentrate on the DVD contents and presentation, as usual.Disc 1 contains the movie as well as two different running commentaries. The first commentary by director Robert Zemeckis, producer Steve Starkey and production designer Rick Carter is full of details and never lags, but I couldn't escape the feeling that I wish that they had answered a few more questions about specific scenes, etc. That's not to say that they didn't divulge interesting information about the making of the film, or that I didn't enjoy it, but I expected a bit more from a commentary by three people. The second commentary is by producer Wendy Finerman, and is fairly insightful. There are a few extended moments of dead air, but for the most part she offers information about characters, their development and the subtle visual and verbal cues used to convey that growth. She occasionally resorts to describing the action on the screen and stays away from the technical info of the first commentary, but provides a nice analysis of the film's emotional undercurrents.Disc 2 contains most of the good stuff about the production that was omitted from the commentaries, and as I felt with Zemeckis's Cast Away DVD collection, it was probably planned that way so as not to be redundant. The &quot;documentary,&quot; Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump, is actually just a promotional fluff piece that was also included on the original laserdisc. There are a couple of screen tests which only underscore the acting abilities of Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, as well as some great breakdowns of makeup, sound and production design. An extended section on visual effects is the centerpiece of the second disc and includes some unfinished deleted scenes and disections that are very informative and entertaining. As Zemeckis says in his commentary, if you notice the effects, then he hasn't done his job, and as with Cast Away, you'll be surprised just how often visual effects were used besides in the obvious circumstances.All in all, this is a good, thorough DVD package. It's not quite as good as some (Fox's &quot;Five Star Collection&quot;), but better than most. And that's all I have to say about that.	4.0	A Special Edition DVD is like a box of chocolates....	2001-10-31	2	2	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A202IBIG7TYKRD	jmk444	"Forrest Gump is the '94 mega-hit based on Winston Groom's novel that remains both a well loved and widely misunderstood film. Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is a slow-witted (perhaps mildly retarded) southern boy with ""crooked legs"" who has two great gifts - the first is always looking for the good in any situation or in any person he meets, and the second is the ability to so totally focus on the task at hand that he completely immerses himself into whatever he takes on. His childhood friend and the later object of his affections, Jenny (Robin Wright) is a woman of average intelligence who is very unfocused, or ""into everything.""The computer generated newsreel footage that splices Gump into so many archived moments is worth seeing this film for, but the gentle humor and poignant story of a love that endures great divides of time and distance make it an awesome experience.Both Robert Zemeckis (Best Director) and Tom Hanks (Best Actor) won Academy Awards for this film, which I still think is one of the most powerful movies of our time."	5.0	A timeless classic...	2002-09-04	2	2	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AJQHXI2KCDVP9	"Jodi Dougan ""Jodi"""	Two people, Forrest Gump and Jenny Curran, form an unbreakable bond as children. Forrest, although lacking in the brains department, manages to witness and play his part in some of the greatest events in American history. He meets JFK, wins the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and manages to accidentally start the Watergate investigation. Forrest lives the American dream whereas Jenny lives the American nightmare; she has an abusive father and grows up to have a string of abusive boyfriends, works as a stripper, takes narcotics and ultimately contracts AIDS. Despite the pair going in completely different directions in life, they are still drawn to each other and Forrest and Jenny's story is one that will make you smile, laugh and shed a tear.Every once and while, you see lists of the worst films to win Best Picture Oscars, and usually Forrest Gump makes that list. I think the reason for this is that we live in quite a cynical world and the majority of people do not really warm to lead characters that are innocent and pure of heart. This should not be the case. We should adore characters that are completely honest and very insightful despite their low IQs, and Forrest Gump is one of those characters that we should love. People who watch this film should check their cynicism at the door and just enjoy a film that is about the everyman battling the world using only truth and a deep-seated sense of what he believes is right. After all, this film has a noble tradition, it follows in the footsteps of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's A Wonderful Life. If Frank Capra were alive today, he would make films like Forrest Gump (if he could come to grips with all the CGI) and that's all I have to say about that...	5.0	The American Dream meets the American Nightmare	2007-08-09	3	3	0

I believe those are what the rest of the reviews are truely applauding without realizing it.Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and, seems like a nice guy, but, he needs to figure out what movies he is 'right' for, and, which ones he should turn down.Tom, Tom .... that accent...ouch!  Sounds like you NEVER tried actually talking to someone from Alabama.  If you really did...well, honeychil', accents just aren't your thing - don't do no more of 'em!They should have asked an English actor - they do spot on southern accents.  Maybe, it's time for a re-make with Jude Law.  Forrest was not a handsome man in the book, but, apparently, that doesn't transfer to the screen, so, get a hottie who can do an accent.

In fact, I thought it sophomoricly boring and silly. But, with a good shooting script and Tom Hanks (bless'im), I think I've watch this movie in it's entirety at least a dozen times, and will watch snatches of it on TV anytime it's on.Since then, I have read several of Winston Groom's Civil War books, and especially enjoy &#34;Shrouds of Glory&#34; about the Battle of Franklin (TN) and &#34;Shiloh, 1862&#34;.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A9TG2NFA614S9	John F. Rooney	"""Forrest Gump"" (1994) is a classic, iconic American movie I think will live on. It's about a generation (about 30 years) from John F. Kennedy through the L.B.J. and Nixon administrations and beyond. Much of the early movie is comic. At the beginning and end of the movie we see Forest waiting and a feather floating through the air: life goes on, the circle of life persists and endures. Forrest, mentally challenged, learns to run like a house afire to get away from his enemies and his demons.Through a groundbreaking process we see Forrest's image merged with the real images on newsreel footage of the American presidents he meets. He isn't greatly impressed by famous people, fame for himself or money. He's loving, extremely loyal, kind, gentle, nave, trusting, courageous, and a lot smarter about life than most of the people around him.Tom Hanks, the quintessential American movie star of the last thirty years, does a fantastic job as Forrest. The movie is full of adages and sayings (like ""stupid is as stupid does"") that Forrest repeats and lives by. He and his mother (Sally Fields) have a deep connection, and he has one love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, Jennie. She's a sixties love child who deeply disappoints Forrest by becoming part of the 60's and 70's drug culture, but their love triumphs.Because of his ability to outrun everybody, Forest Gump becomes a football star and an accidental hero in the Vietnam War saving Bubba Blue, the shrimp fisherman he's befriended. He also saves Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who eventually becomes his business partner and life-long friend. He goes into Bubba's shrimp business after the Vietnam War, and he becomes successful along with Lieutenant Dan.The movie reaches into pathos, but it can be excused for those excesses. It's a classic. Life just happens to Forrest, everything is accidental, not due to his planning, but he endures as an American icon."	5.0	An American Icon	2010-02-26	5	3	2

I realize that make me very America-centric, but at this time, in history, ours is the leading culture on earth. It's been many years since I first saw this in a movie theater, but I still watch it every so often. Forrest Gump is proto-American. He's dumb, but honest,loyal, brave, stubborn & unsophisticated. I like to think that most Americans have integrity. The incidents in his life are history, spanning the most dynamic years of the American century.

Those themes are timeless and probably expressed better in this film than any other of the last twenty years.On first and on last viewing, though, I was disconcerted by the ""run, Forrest, run"" motif.  The moral message seemed to be that there are circumstances where we should just run from adversity.  This is first shown where a truckload of young men are chasing teenage Forrest in Alabama, throwing rocks, etc.  Robin Wright shouts at him to run, and, since she's the one who tells him to run, he runs.Of course, Forrest's running later leads to repeated heroism.  But I was still a little thrown off by this, because we're not always supposed to run, are we?Well, you never know exactly what you're going to get.  I guess sometimes the wisest thing to do is run rather than stand and get killed.If Forrest were now in Iraq instead of Viet Nam, what would he do?"	5.0	Run, Forrest, Run	2005-09-30	0	0	0

The film, designed to appeal to the Rush Limbaugh crowd, implies that &quot;dumb is good.&quot; Jenni, Forrest's on again off again girlfriend, represents all the evils of the '60s, while Forrest represents all that is good and true--what a clever binary opposition.  Not only is this &quot;film&quot; completely odious, you can't imagine how long and drawn out it is unless you've actually had to sit through it, which I don't recommend.

Cardwell ""ghosthead101"""	"Ok, so it's not Mean Streets or some other REALISM-based story that you can watch and be like ""oh, I can see how that could happen"".  Has half the population been deprived of a pleasure that us daydreamers like to call ""fantasy""?  Sure, you might expect a film in the drama section of your video store to not be so idealistic and goofy, but it's not the filmmakers' fault this film is in the drama section.  You COULD put this in the comedy section, the fantasy section (if your video store has one), the FAMILY section, or even the ACTION/adventure section.The fact of the matter is that if you can stop nitpicking at the film while you're supposed to be enjoying it (in other words, commit the ""horrendeous"" deed of ""suspending belief"" which I think is a stupid term 'cause movies are almost always dramatised to the extent of fantasy and they shouldn't be taken seriously, since even the most realistic films are quite trivial when you look at the big scheme of life), you will find that this film is the most extreme tearjerker b/c of its heart-pounding idealism and romance.  All throughout the film I couldn't keep from shedding a tear of...well, I don't know why I cried through so much of the film...I guess the previous statement would explain it better.The simple fact of the matter is if you loved Mean Streets (the Scorsese film that pre-dates Taxi Driver) you probably won't like this film.  If you've never seen Mean Streets, then whatever.  I personally wasn't able to watch the majority of Mean Streets, so I think it makes sense that I liked this film.  The visuals are creative and lushious, and the story brings to mind a gigantic field of flowers.  In lamen's terms, it's pure fantasy!Also, on a little bit of a different note, I should say that in all scientificness (unless your view of science is based on cynicism), the story COULD happen!!!  It is not entirely impossible for a simple-minded man to experience several pieces of history and become a multiply-talented celebrity.  It doesn't happen most of the time, if at all, but it COULD happen!!!  Also, Tom Hanks is not ""going for the cheese"".  He simply recognizes good screenwriting when he sees it.  IF you don't like idealism, then there's no need to misrepresent the filmmakers for doing the best they could with this particular KIND of story/film.That's all I have to say about that."	5.0	BEST ROMANCE!	2004-10-18	4	3	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1F4MP0FF9180H	Jon Jonz	"Robert Zemickis is no stranger to making films that go back in time. Whether it be through time travel in ""Back To The Future"" or through the accounts of a simple yet intellectual challenged man named Forrest Gump. In Forrest Gump Tom Hanks takes on the title role of a Alabama man who overcomes odds only to face more as he grows older. While many will give this movie 5 stars and critics and movie goers alike loved this movie, I will give you an honest opinion that differs. This movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster with some laughs thrown in otherwise it would be unbearable.The visual effects are excellent and were state of the art at the time of the films release in 1994. This movie is very far from being a comedy though. It has some comedic elements but they are there only to neutralize the impending doom that comes to most of the characters throughout the movie. Forrest Gump also unabashfully reeks of a conservative message that the person who obeys and belives in God first and foremost, believes in his country no matter what and has morals no matter how unintelligent he might be will survive over everything and everyone else. At what price though one must ask?, When this movie and the main character must deal with abdonment from just about every character. Anyone who has experienced abdonment issues should be warned this movie will definetly bring these issues to a head. It is anything but a feel good movie. While the character Forrest Gump must be looked at as commendable and a good person you cant help but feel sorry for him ( not because he has a low IQ but rather because of all the people that leave his life). You simply walk away from this movie feeling bad overall yourself. I'm still confused as to how this movie could ever be labeled a feel good movie. It's tragedy is what it is. Here is a man of humble means and intelligence who goes on to experience the 50's through the 1980's in America, helps shape popular culture by pure accident, has run ins with president and celebrites, by pure chance, becomes successful in the shrimp industry with the help of a hurricane, by pure chance becomes finacially stable for life because he invest in Apple Computers, but what does any of this success mean when all the people he cares about leave him or die? This movie sends the message the opposite of what's really important. Forrest becomes rich in materialism and noteriety but is he really rich in spirit and personal life when everyone he cares about is gone? The movie winds down and concludes by trying to soften this blow with the revelation that Jenny who now lives in Savannah Georgia after years of promiscuness and drug use now has a son who is actually Forrest's very own biological child. This even comes off sad and confusing. And for me was the final straw for this movie having any redeeming qualities. Did Jenny really get pregnant by Forrest that faithful night she decided to hop into bed with him? Only to leave the next morning abdoning Forrest once more? The movie only hints that Jenny and Forrest had sex together. Yet by having a scene where Forrest and Jenny's son both tilt their heads the same way while watching tv we are to believe without a doubt he is Forrest son.Based on Jenny's track record for sleeping around the odds are pretty high that other guys she was with could had passed a gene on to the kid that makes him tilt his head. Titling ones head is not uncommon at all and most certainly doesnt give proof positive evidence that Forrest is the father. If Jenny found out she was pregnant soon after in her transient travel assuming she hadnt slept with anyone else how did she know for sure Forrest was the father? Regardless of Jenny's troubled past I would think if she cared at all about Forrest she would had contacted him before the baby was born to tell him it was his child.  If she was sleeping around as the movie hints at throught out her adult life, then the story and movie leaves an unexplanied gap. How did Jenny known Forrest fathered the baby? The second scenerio which i'm afraid is even sadder, Is Jenny got pregnant sometime after she left Forrest's house by some other guy, and when she found out 6 years later she was dying she decided she could call upon good old dependable Forrest and use his lack of intelligence and good naturedness against him and tell him the kid is his knowing he would raise the child and would do anything for Jenny. Either way the motives of Jenny which go unaddressed is heartbreaking none the less. and in my opinion leaves her character with no redeeming qualites whatsoever. Afterall she could never give her love to Forrest his entire life, even though he offered unconditional love to her, but only when she is dying and needs her son to be raised by someone she knows is dependable does she give her love and self to Forrest. As the movie ends and Forrest is sending his ""son"" off to school just like his momma had done for him you get the sense of sadness. Not because things have come full circle, but because the movie leaves many things untied as to whether or not Jenny lied to Forrest about him being the daddy. And if she didnt lie then she selfishly prevented Forrest from knowing his only child until she was close to death.And robbed the boy of his first 5 or 6 years of life knowing his daddy. After watching this movie you will feel you invested 2 1/2 hours of your life only to feel cynical, angry and empty all at the same time. This is no American Classic it is an American Tragedy at best. For some reasons many years ago I opted not to go see this movie as a teenager even though my entire family and some friends all went into the theatre together for the same showing on opening weekend. As I went several rooms over to watch ""Wolf"" starring Jack Nicholson to a near empty theatre and thought I was missing out on pop culture history perhaps.. Years later I watched Forrest Gump numerous times on tv, cable and video, and realized I was glad I never saw it on the big screen. In closing for this review then I'll give some advice based on my experience. If your thinking about buying this movie, go buy Wolf on dvd instead. Trust me you'll be a hell of lot happier and not depressed afterwards."	1.0	A different and honest point of view of a movie beloved by some and loathed by others	2010-02-22	47	9	38

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A34KBX6VF28QYN	Joseph Jordan	When I first saw this movie, I was moved--it was funny and sad.  I felt that Tom Hanks' performance was one of the best I'd seen.  I was dazzled by the idea that so much of the film was done through computer manipulation.  I was 14 years old.  Five years after the fact, the film has not aged well.  There are inspired notes--I still enjoy the sequence where Forrest runs  across America several times--but they are outweighed by bad puns and  clunking dialogue.  Forrest stupidly showing his rear end to LBJ, or  serving as the inspiration for John Lennon's song &quot;Imagine&quot;, or  telling Jack Kennedy that he needs to evacuate his blatter--these things  are no longer amusing.  The film has lost its lustre.  I still admire  Hanks' nuanced and subtle performance, but he was better as a little boy  trapped in a man's body in &quot;Big&quot; and as rock-solid James Lovell  in &quot;Apollo 13&quot;.  Gary Sinise pumps as much as he can into the  cliched Lt. Dan, but he, too, has been better elsewhere (see his  magnificent performance as George in &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; which he  also directed); the effort is honorable but even his considerable talents  cannot redeem the part.  The film is not a total waste; if you can get past  the conservative sloganeering disguised as liberal babbling, and the  occasional idiocy of the script, the film has its moments.	3.0	This film has not aged like wine	1999-09-14	12	4	8

Sure, Tom Hanks gives a noble performance, and his one liners rank with other classics from the world of film, but this sweeping tale is way too ludicrous to be believed.  Certain scenes are astounding acheivements - especially the editing of monumental historical moments that put Forrest front and center.  Yet, where is the movie's heart?  Personally, I found it in Sally Field's performance as Gump's mother, and in Gary Sinise's terrific Oscar-worthy moments as his platoon leader.  Overall, the movie really asks an awful lot from its audience - you must suspend all semblence of time and space, reality and history in order to be taken away.  Yet, in the end, it's a soft melodrama, on the order of other Hollywood blockbusters that deserved less praise (think &quot;Terms of Endearment.)	3.0	Terrific Hanks, but Falls Flat	2002-02-05	11	5	6

Tom Hanks is marvelous in the role, and the colorful character is complimented by Robin Wright as Jenny, Forrest's life long love, Sally Fields as Forrest's &quot;Mama&quot; who &quot;always had a way of explaining things so that I (Forrest) could understand them&quot;, and Gary Sinise as the legless Lt. Dan.The film is even better on this 2 disc DVD set.  The special features on the second disc are in no way lacking.  Production featurettes and behind the scenes footage combined with sound design, visual effect detail (Lt. Dan's legs were quite interesting!), and screen tests were quite impressive and satisfying.

This is my favorite movie and will continue to be unless they make a Forrest Gump 2, which I think they should do.  They have little Forrest go off on the bus and I think that is where Forrest Gump 2 should start out.  I would make the 2nd movie somewhat similar but make it from the events from the 90's, 00's, and now 10's.  They should have begun making this movie by now but I guess they just want to leave Forrest Gump rest as one of the best movies of all times.	5.0	Best movie for all genres	2010-03-27	7	2	5

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1KRG7M10M4JAV	J. Summers	Recently, we ate at a Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant (which I also recommend).  Our young son had a lot of questions about the movie, Forrest Gump.  We struggled to accuratly answer the questions since we had not seen the movie for a long, long time.  So, the next time we settled in to watch a movie as a family, we chose Forrest Gump.  Our son, loved the movie and my wife and I admitted we had forgotten what a great movie it is.Tom Hanks is at his best, which is saying something.  The movie is sweet, but not syrupy.  If you have never seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to see it.  If, like us, you saw the movie several years ago, you owe it to the movie to see it again.	5.0	A Modern Classic	2013-01-01	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1N02PIQQFWF7S	Juan E. Bello	Forrest Gump requires no further review as a movie. In my opinion a true classic of the 90's and the crown jewel of what I would personally label as the American Magic Realism. It reminds me the novels of Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende and Mario Vargas Llosa were a non-sense story is perfectly seamed in a fluid, consistent  realistic narrative.I watched the movie streamed from amazon in HD with almost no interruption using a Samsung Smart TV and a 30Mbps wireless internet connection. Both the picture quality and the sound had DVD quality. Maybe I was lucky, but in this particular case, I have to report a perfect broadcast.	5.0	Smooth Stream	2014-03-10	1	1	0

The story began with Forrest not beingallowed to attend public school due to an IQ of 75.His mother convinced the school officials to allow Forrest toattend public school.

I love how they used the special effects to make Forrest meet some famous people of the past.I bought in to every part of the storyline, except where he runs across the country for years.  I don't know why - I could buy in to everything else but that.Overall I thought the story was touching, well-written and well acted.  Every actor was perfect for the role they played, especially loved Tom Hanks as Forrest and Sally Field as his mother.

The great thing about this film is the realisation that he is not a very clever guy, and at the start of the film he would seem strange and pathetic, but at the end of the film you will realise that he is an incredible kind, tough and deep man. This is amazing the acting is spot on with a great albanian accent from Hanks no other actor could suit the role better than him.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3B0GW9MXVQR19	katie	Forrest Gump is a film that contains a perfect amount of drama and comedy.  The movie stars Tom Hanks who does a fantastic job as Forrest Gump and wins the audience&#8217;s heart by playing a not so smart but loveable man.  There are historical events that Forrest takes part of that gives the audience a good laugh with the twist that is added to the events.  Even though Forrest might not be the smartest apple of the bunch with the way he talks but the audience learns how inside he has a good heart and teaches others that everyone has good within them even rough people like Lieutenant Dan.  Forrest never gives up on the thing he loves, like Jenny, which leads the audience through an emotional rollercoaster. If you like a movie that gives you a laugh and a character who wins your heart Forrest Gump is the movie for you.	5.0	A classic film for the ages	2013-12-06	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A52MLPY4I3VYV	K*Baby	'Forrest Gump' is undeniably a groundbreaking movie, well deserving of its Oscar wins. This is quite possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. And don't even say this film didn't affect you in some way, either, because I KNOW you'd be lying! haForrest, played BRILLIANTLY might I add by one of the most influential actors of our time (HANKS), can be described as gentle, warm and sincere. He, despite his mental incapabilities, is what all of us truly desire to one day become.In the film, Forrest innocently goes through the majority of the second half of the 20th century and somehow becomes a part of America's most noted events. He goes to war in Vietnam, witnesses the Watergate Scandal, meets several presidents and cultural icons (i.e. Elvis Presley, John Lennon), becomes a shrimp boat captain and pro ping-pong player, and runs across the country for 'no particular reason'. Aside from all of this, there is one thing in his life that he has longed for since childhood. That is Jenny (WRIGHT), who takes a more self-destructive path through life, such as becoming involved with the disco/Studio 54 drug scene of the 70's... which affects her in a tragic way later.Notable actors in the movie include Sally Field (love her!), who portrayed Forrest's mother brilliantly; Mykelti Williamson aka 'Bubba', Forrest's best friend who planned to be a pioneer in the shrimping business but died in Vietnam; Gary Sinise, or Lt. Dan, who loses his legs in war and eventually becomes Forrest's first mate in the shrimping industry; and, of course, Robin Wright, who captured Jenny beautifully.Also... the soundtrack and score to this film is amaaaazing. Definitely check that ish out if you're into classic rock or music general.Ok, I'm definitely rambling now, but if you ever find yourself down... pop this movie in. SERIOUSLY. Although it sounds cheesy and completely pathetic, it truly will lift one's spirits in terms of realizing the simplicity of life and all it has to offer.	5.0	Wonderful.	2005-07-09	5	4	1

It looks crisp and clean as you would expect, but for some strange reason, the rock music soundtrack has vanished. The film's normal soundtrack is there, but when the rock music is supposed to kick in (Vietnam for instance), you hear about half a second then silence. I have to say that it totally ruined the film for me and my wife, as this was such an integral part of the emotions that this film can evoke. I do have this film on normal DVD and I compared the two, just to be sure. I will be returning this copy to Amazon, and will let you know what the outcome is.

Just go through life in a haze and you'll achieve more than the guy who spent his life learning and working hard.  Forrest Gump was such a half-wit he barely knew he was alive.  Everything was made light of in this movie.  Everyone who ever worked hard to accomplish anything was viewed as a joke and worst of all I couldn't figure out if this was a comedy, drama, or parody.

This movie is where I got the little history I know from.  One of Robin Wright's 2 breakthrough performances (along with Princess Bride) and another of Hank's Oscar winning roles (greatly deserved).  And you can't mention great performances without mentioning those by Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field.  Too bad they all couldn't have won Oscars.I was really excited about the special edition DVD and was not disappointed.  Highlights include 2 commentarys, audition footage of a 5 year old Haley Joel Osment, a documentary and special effects footage.  The technological advancements made with this film are spectacular and it's really interesting to see just how difficult things that may only appear on screen for a few seconds were to film, take after take.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AJQ3599SGO7F5	kim gitae	To be honest, this is the first time I ever write a review of a movie. And this beginning is a tough one&#8212;with an Oscar winner as its subject, surrounding which there is considerably controversy over the values it has questioned, the thoughts it tried to implicitly convey, and the art of the movie itself. Forrest Gump mould incarnation of virtue is honest keeping one&#8217;s word , conscientiously , brave paying attention to motioning among film. In the film, Forrest Gump is a very pure image, but Jenny has become the degenerate symbol . And write the great discrepancy originally in this. To all that narrated, since beginning all behave with a kind of tender feeling and well-meaning attitude after all for the film, having even joined poesy composition, this makes the film seem soft and have no injury. The film advocates to traditional moral concept and embodiment. Make film apt to accept by people, director superb lay out skill and film application of language make the film very attractive too. Success with commercial for film content of the film has given security.so you have to watch this movie!recommend.	5.0	Great	2014-07-03	0	0	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2BDJOIXPR2AYU	King of Controversy	I didn't dislike Forrest Gump, but I didn't really like it either. I only review it to note my atypical experience. For me it just was. It was Ok. I'm 'conservative' and supposedly this is a conservative movie. At least it's wholesome, and some of the counter-culture figures on the show are held up to be less than perfect.A friend of mine noticed something odd about this movie. He says the film is simply about the day dreams of the kind-of dumb character in the movie, Forrest Gump. He's just a regular guy, kind of dumb, I guess, and he imagines all this stuff could have happened to him, probably while day dreaming. Perhaps his fantasies begin early in the movie at the point he's being chased down by the bad kids. Whether this is true or not (the basis of the movie being Forrest's day-dreams), I donno, but it is possible.	3.0	the film is about the daydreams of the kind-of dumb character, Forrest Gump?	2011-05-17	17	1	16

Forrest, tells the best example of all by sharing his stories from the bus stop bench he's sitting on.This movie, will make you laugh out loud but there are times when this movie makes you sob silently too.There are no such words as to describe what this movie really is.You must see it yourself if you didn't so far.	5.0	WOW	2004-02-08	1	1	0

This is the Tom Hanks movie, other than ""Big"" (we'll see what happens with ""Polar Express."")  You feel for Forrest throughout his life, particularly when he discovers he has a son (who's smart in IQ terms).  The ""holy fool"" Forrest gets a boost from sarcastic Gary Sinise (who's got a reason to be bitter), Sally Field, and the terrific Robin Wright Penn.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3KB1H0S7T6JX1	L Gontzes	An OUTSTANDING film, Forrest Gump, follows the life of a young boy from Alabama as he grows up and through him sheds light not only on his life, but on modern American history as well.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, innocence, friendship, and inner strength.Tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention quite a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!In short, Forrest Gump is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!	5.0	SIMPLY WONDERFUL!	2005-05-08	4	2	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"In a world where so many movies are cookie-cutter, Forrest Gump stands out about having a very distinct storyline that is rarely found elsewhere. Most movies are about the bravest, the strongest, and the most beautiful / handsome as they plow through their lives. In Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks is instead a man who has many challenges in life. His legs won't work properly. He is not smart enough to be allowed in a traditional school. But through the perseverence of his loving, single mother, he gets the foundation in life, the moral strength, and the perseverence to thrive.Forrest absolutely does not have an ""easy life"". His mother was abandoned by her husband and runs a boarding house. She pours all her love and dedication into raising her son to be able to take care of himself and to be content. She sleeps with the school's principle when he tells her that Forrest can't go to school. She tells Forrest repeatedly that he is just as good as anyone else, and that life is unpredictable and that that is normal. The line in the movie is: ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" It's become so popular that it is now almost cliche. It's important to remember that it GOT popular because so many people relate to its meaning. You might like the flavor of a chocolate, or dislike it, but it's all part of life, and you go on and have another one.Hanks shines in this, as does Sinise, and both are well deserving of the many awards they won. Forrest is not one dimensional. Yes, he is not a genius. But he is still a complex character. When Jenny turns down his marriage proposal, he stares at her for a moment, then tells her, ""I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is."" With the conviction in his voice, and the emotion in his face, you know absolutely that he does.Some of the movie is a bit heavy-handed. The repeated insertions of Gump into seemingly every single important moment in American history - including teaching Elvis how to dance, meeting with multiple presidents, and so on, can seem a bit much. He invented the smiley face. He happened to invest in Apple. The music soundtrack suffers from this ""club on the head"" issue. When Jenny leaves an abusive boyfriend, the sountrack sings ""don't you love her madly as she's walking out the door"" just as she does.But then there are moments when I am powerfully affected, every time I see this movie. When Jenny was little, her father abused her. Forrest doesn't quite understand this, but later in life when they're both adults they return to her childhood home. Jenny starts throwing rocks at the house, furious at what her father had done, and then collapses. Forrest feels her pain, and says, ""Sometimes, I guess there just aren't enough rocks"". He knows exactly what she's going through, inside, and gets to the core of the emotion.It is a bit sad that, even though the two most important people in his life are his mother and Jenny, the two never interact at all. And those two women never seem to interact with any other women. So this movie is all about Forrest, all his male friends, and then the men around his mother and Jenny. So we have an entire movie full of men and then ""the mom"" and ""the love"". I would have appreciated greatly a more rich world.But, still, this is a problem with just about every movie, so it's hard to fault Forrest Gump too much for this flaw. And the movie does embrace a wealth of issues. Dan deals with life with no lower legs. Forrest deals with his mental challenges. Jenny is a survivor of child abuse. Forrest's mom struggles as a poor single mom. Together they all make it through their challenges.Well recommended."	5.0	A Different View of Life	2012-07-18	2	2	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2AKFJOWF71WGV	liveon14887	"Forrest Gump. I could name a million reasons why this movie is considered one of the best. Could it be because of the storyline? The fact that is was wonderfully written? Or could it be because Robert Zemeckis managed to get the crowd really thinking, ""is that President J.F.K?"". Whatever reason it is, it has definately got me hooked on this movie for life.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (who also directed the movie ""Contact""), it is set in Alabama where it focuses on a very special boy, a boy who has many changes to come. His name is Forrest Gump (played by Michael Conner Humphreys). At first, Forrest had to wear leg braces to straighten out his back. But what the eyes of the other kids saw in Forrest was just a ""retard"" except for one, who could see right through Forrest Gump and see just another kid trying to live. This one went by the name of Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall), who would soon become Forrest ""very best friend"". The movie starts from scratch, where Forrest is a kid right until the time he is a grown man. Forrest soon goes to College, graduates, enters the Army, where he meets his two other best friends (Ben Bufford 'Bubba' Blue, played by Mykelti Williamson, and Lt. Dan Taylor, played by Gary Sinise), owns a shrimp company, becomes a table-tennis professional, becomes a war hero and soon marries Jenny. All this happened because Forrest believed he could make it happen.To me, Forrest Gump is the story about survival and belief. To believe in yourself, believing you can achieve anything you want to achieve if you try. To achieve goals, you must set them out but Forrest never set his goals out, he just made them happen which is another reason why this is one of the best films ever made.Forrest Gump managed to earn an Oscar for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemickis), Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing. Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan, managed to earn a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. What I found amazing about this endless film is the way Zemickis brought back alive the past. If you have seen the movie, you will definately remember the live footages of President John F. Kennedy, John Lennon of the Beatles, President M. Nixon and the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace. It was really interesting and impressing how Zemickis made it look like Tom Hanks was really there with them all.Memorable scenes? Of course there is. You'll definately always remember two very catchy pick-up lines in this film- ""Run, Forrest, Run"" (as said by Jenny) and ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"". The scene where Forrest's leg braces break off while running away from the bikers, where young Forrest unexpectedly says ""HUH HUH HUH HUH"" to the principal of the school, where older Forrest surprisingly ejaculates when his hand is placed on Jenny's breast, where Forrest rescues at least 6 soldiers from the battlefields, where Forrest introduces himself to Bubba saying ""My name is Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump"" (LMAO), where Forrest jumps off his boat surprised to see Lt. Dan again, where Forrest plays football, where Forrest runs miles and miles, where Forrest asks Jenny to marry him, there's an endless list of memorable scenes.Forrest Gump. Who else knows a movie that EVERYONE can enjoy? A movie with much power, enough power to bring tears to your eyes? A movie that is unforgettable? A movie that has that MANY memorable scenes? I, for one, sure can't think of any, which is why I rate this a definite 5 star movie. Get it or watch it, it is truly reccommended."	5.0	RUN, FORREST, RUN	2004-07-06	6	5	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1ZB25QEUB155Y	Maayavan	How wonderful a place the world would  be if even 10% of men were like Forrest Gump - amazingly simple, astoundingly perfect and alarmingly good.Love and committment have such universal chord that it brings in tears spontaneously when two people destined for each other, eventually get married too. I had not read the novel before watching the movie; it felt so good to see Jenny finally deciding to marry Forrest.. it seems almost a perfect reward for Forrest's life time contributions of being a good man.The best part of the movie is that it does make one shed at least one undesirable trait of one's persona, rather uassumingly. The power of love and humanism, and the demands it makes on one's emotions, is indeed the only reason for every human being to be born and stay alive.Tom Hanks is brilliant and uarguably the best actor around in our times.PS : If the movie evokes nostalgia and longingness for your childhood sweetheart from neighbourhood of long past, as against marriages of urban convenience, remember to thank Jenny !	5.0	A must see for all	2003-03-14	4	3	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AVHLQZQH22XKW	mabus	The best word to describe this movie is, magical. To enjoy it, one must suspend reality for a bit and simply, let it work it's magic on you. The story begins with a pan of a feather delicately falling from the sky to forrests' feet. Forrest is sitting at a bus stop and we see him begin to talk to a stranger. He begins telling them his life story, and the movie takes off from there. Forrest it turns out is a man with below average intelligence who was born with physical disabilities. Despite these disabilities his single mother raises him to be &quot;just like everybody else&quot; and he grows up to be as normal as possible. But he is different. Despite all his attempts to be just like the other kids he is a very unique individual, and that is his magic.As it turns out his disability is not physical, nor is it intellectual. Rather, his disability is his heart. His heart is unable to feel any bad thought for anyone and his purity is the driving force of this movie. His innocence, like the symbolic leaf that falls in the beggining of the movie, makes him casually sway with the winds of change and he casually falls from one circumstance to another.Free of any pretension or hidden agenda's no one can believe that he really is as open a book as he really is and this sets off a chain of events each as implaussible as the next. The film is a brilliant next step to the classic Peter Sellers hit &quot;Being There&quot;. It's a sarcastic romp through our past that critiques our society in a way Voltaire would be proud of. Taking naive Forrest through all sorts of insane situations where he blunders through and looks brilliant no matter how badly he screws up. A charmed life indeed. This isn't slapstick comedy, it must be said. It's very subdued and intelligent humour that needs to be taken with a small smirk rather than a loud gaffaw. This is Dennis Miller, not Andrew Dice Clay. This is Bill Cosby, Not Eddie Murphy. The scenes delicately set up the humour and the circumstance is the punch line. The joke is intricately woven and expects you to pay attention to get it. But if you do, you are well rewarded for your efforts.In one scene Forrest simply decides to run, and because he's running he just keeps going. The worlds disbelief at his audacious running just to &quot;do it&quot; inspires a whole generation of people to &quot;just do it&quot;, sound familiar?Suddenly he's leading a jogging craze across america, and when he finally stops, no one knows what to do. It's brilliant bitter sarcasm that puts society and all it's pretensions in it's place.If you can sit back and take the movie for what it is, without allusions or expectations you will absolutely love this. It's brilliantly written with an endless stream of double meanings and subtle jabs at social conventions. This is a movie you can be proud to introduce to your children and inspire them to think critically about what they are viewing, or it's also a movie you can watch for yourself and have a smirk at how strange real life can be. It's a very intelligent movie that deserves a good viewing. This is the apocalypse now of comedy. Brilliant.	5.0	Brilliant Magic	2003-05-15	8	6	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A17NVM7IAPF2NS	Maek	You know, it is a sweet, endearing movie and yet at the same time it kicks us while we're down.It seems that all of the characters that have fallen on hard times due to the bad decisions that they make SHOULD be pitied because quite frankly, Forrest Gump NEVER should be.What am I driving at?Let's face it--this movie is not a triumph of human will over adversity.  All of Gump's successes and triumphs are more about circumstance than actual effort.  Case in point:  Gump's shrimp outfit soars...only because every other shrimping vessel was laid waste while his ship miraculously survived.  Is this something that we should applaud--Gump's triumph over the misfortune of others?  Like I said, it's hard to find a story likeable about someone who doesn't know any better succeeding where other WHO DO TRY fail...and fail miserably.  That's not to say that those who failed didn't deserve to.  Jenny is an example of that, but for crying out loud, she was REAL in her intentions and decisions.I don't think the film deserves the same amount of success that Gump himself experiences.  Hanks is a brilliant actor and this film is no exception...but if life is a box of chocolates, then this film is a 10-year old nougat left in a puddle on the road.	1.0	Human fallacy	2001-05-29	92	30	62

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AB1F9U3TJL9CW	Manuel E Orellana	the movie is about all that can be good in us, human beings. By looking at things in a very simple moral way Forres Gump becomes a success without really wanting to be. he is not conceited, he's modest. Of course one can quickly determine he might not be capable of 'forming the intent' as they say. he is everything one should try to be. He falls in love, but to his dismay; it's not reciprocal so he patiently waits for his love to come back to him.Very few movies tap into these particular feelings, and this movie does it very well without being religious.	5.0	the hero that didn't want to be	2013-11-13	1	1	0

""Life is like a box of chocolate: you never know what you are going to get."" Oh so true! Fatalistic? Not really, as a strong implication of the movie is that you have to work hard at your life, no matter what you find in your box of chocolates.It is just a ""feel good"" movie as many have written? I don't think so, it goes deeper than that. And in fact it did not make me feel good at all. In the end I could not help but feeling angry at Jenny for what she did to Gump. Of course, most of us men have had our ""Jenny"" in our lives. Mine (now history, thanks God!) even looks like Jenny in the film!I could not help but smile at discovering that Bubba, the black shrimp fisherman in the movie, inspired a real company that is now very successful!The Blu-ray disc is very good, containing interesting interviews with Hanks and the director, as well as other ""behind the scenes"" material, including the making of special effects which were painstaking to produce and quite advanced for the time.

Put simply, I was blown away.  I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of the film didn't interest people.  A guy on at a bus stop tells people about his life.  But it is so much more than that.  Forrest Gump, although long, is never boring.  There is always something, whether it be humorous or heart-breaking, going on.  Out of all the Tom Hanks films I've seen, this one is by far the greatest.  Actually, I'm prepared to say that this is the single greatest performance by an actor I've seen (and I've seen some good ones!). When it's over, you immediately want to watch it again.  It's that good.  If there's one thing I've learned from this movie, it's this:""Life is like a box of chocolates.

I was amazed to see how some of the shots and scenes came to be in Forrest Gump.  Such as when Tom Hanks had to go in front of a blue screen with X's on it to be able to nail the JFK/White House/Handshake scene.  The 2nd disc was worth the purchase of the DVD.

I can't stop watching it. I love the twists and turns, and I also like how Forrest's deeper feelings are shown. Friends, enemies, and lovers are combined into this film. In this movie, Forrest Gump, a seemingly stupid man who does whatever people tell him to, is telling the story of his life, starting when he is six. His story goes through high school and college, and then goes to the army. Through his story he meets Jennie and Bubba, the love of his life and his best friend. He meets enemies, and is devastated by loss after loss. I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed a lot, but afterwards I had to sit and think about what Forrest had gone through. This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion.  Forrest's deeper feelings will really make you think hard about people who are different or dumb. Quotes like ""Stupid is as stupid does"" and ""mama always told me life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"" make you laugh at first, but then make you ponder about what Forrest is thinking and how true his thoughts are. His friendships are very emotional as Bubba dies and Jennie refuses to marry him. He goes through hardships that make you think of your own.

Like Garp, Forrest Gump follows the life of boy into man but never labours the point here about Forrest's disabilities which is one of the really cult aspects of this film.  Forrest is allowed to shine as an eccentric and wonderful character with a real life in which, whilst his disabilities get in the way, the same disabilities equally save him and those around him on a multitude of levels.  But don't think disability equals tragedy.  This film will catapult you equally into as many laughs as tears.  If you like the rollercoaster effect, this is your film.  Nothing drags here and you are not let off the hook till the feather floats again at the end of the film.  Its almost not a film but trully a filmic piece of art.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	FORREST GUMP is one of those magical movies that not only demands your attention during its run of 142 minutes, but it also causes you to ponder it long after the closing credits. Director Robert Zemeckics forces the audience to view world events through the supposed inadequate viewpoint of Forest Gump, played by Tom Hanks in the role of a lifetime. Gump is first introduced in the quietest of ways, a mentally challenged man sitting on a park bench, talking to whoever happens to sit by him. His memories of a life twisted by the evils of the outside world but strengthened by his own iron core of solid values form the basis of the film.  His low key introduction that has since become immortalized in our lexicon--My name is Forrest Gump. My friends call me Forrest Gump--first implies that Gump is a mentally deficient nobody with nothing of value to say.  But as he leads his first listener into his life history, both that listener and then we in the audience quickly realize that Gump's deficiencies are limited to high scores on the SAT.  In all the matters that count, Gump sees with a blinding clarity that seems to be lacking intellectual content mostly because of his hesitant drawling speech rhythms. Gump suffers plenty at the hands of an uncaring society, collectively symbolized by the mean children on the school bus who deny him a place to sit.  Yet even there, Gump learns that there are those who can see his essential goodness: Jenny, whom he learns to love; Bubba, the shrimp king whom Gump dedicates his future shrimp business, and Lt. Dan, a man who lost legs in combat reduce his physical mobility in a manner that parallels Gump's social immobility.FORREST GUMP allows Hanks to portray a critical period of American history in a series of vignettes that brings to mind Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES, with each tale of both epics ranging from comedy, to pathos, to stark tragedy.  Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan are essentially good people who have blind spots that prevent them from seeing the world as clearly as does Forrest. One of the central ironies of the film is that director Zemeckis wants the audience to believe--at least at first--that it is Forrest Gump who lacks the capacity for clear thought.  The astonishment that I felt at the end was to wonder why it took so long for Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan to even approach the clarity of thought that Forrest so effortlessly achieved.  FORREST GUMP is one of the best pictures of all time and repeated viewings merely confirms that.	5.0	Watching World Events Through the Eye of a Storm	2005-09-03	3	2	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1BOHPO4AXI8YY	Martin Mazanek	"This Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture 1994 and Best Director-Robert Zemeckis, based on a novel by Winston Groom is still considered as one of the greatest and most beautiful movies ever made.Tom Hanks gives an outstanding and powerful performance as Forrest Gump a disabled and mentally challenged boy that grows up to be a  successful man accomplishing things most people never do and proving to the world that anything is possible when you have a big heart, positive mind, and people that love you.The story is told by Forrest himself sitting on a bus stop bench telling it to anyone who listens.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ABCPSSKGKS3EI	MARTY E. MCINTOSH	Really, not a bad film at all. The movie is to long in some places. we all are slow and mistunderstood sometimes, and I think that people should stop judging us. It is an insult to us less-fortunate that these morons jack asses can use us as escape goats. and we should not be the ones to blame for other's insane mistakes, and there is no reason for it. so I think that this movie depicts some of the elimants of humanity and hope for me for you, for all people. so my rating is and will be a 5***** rating for this film. Forrest Gump KICKED BUTT. It's almost like we are being treated like kings for the moment, and then being treated like crap. it's basically par-from the course as far as I am consernd.	5.0	Forrest Gump. don't be so judgemental.	2005-12-21	5	1	4

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1IDL0RY0K1MRA	Matt Dedinas	The tale of the simple man Forrest Gump from his boyhood in the 1950's to his adulthood in the early '80s, was very well written and done. Tom Hanks was very convincing. One of the messages of this movie is that there are some moral absolutes in this world, and that even a simple man can see that. Forrest loved his country and obeyed his God. He put to shame all around him who thought of themselves first, while he gave all he had for others. Forrest shows us the difference between wisdom and intelligence, having little intel, but practically Solomonic Common Sense. His story was a very touching story, with romance and passion. It is a true American tale, with history passing before our eyes. It was also very funny. You get it all in two hours and love it! Check it out!	5.0	It really was the Best Picture!	2001-08-25	1	1	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	It's hard to believe that Forrest Gump is 10 years old this year. The amazing tale of a mentaly challenged man and a passionate love story.Forrest Gump(Hanks) lives in a small town in Alabama. He has no father and lives with his mother(Fields). Forrest is mentally challenged, but his mother won't let that hold him down. He has only one friend besides his mother and her name is Jenny(Wright). The two are best of friends, but as they get older there lives take different paths.Forrest has huge success. He ends up attending Alabama where he is an All-American in football. He goes to Vietnam and meets Lt.Dan(Sinise). He also meets Bubba(Williamson) who he later names his shirmping company after. He becomes a war hero and a millionaire through hard work. He is missing one thing though and thats Jenny.Jenny takes a much differnt path after high school. She gets into drugs and goes through the hippie movement. She does disco and does more drugs. She realizes her life is the pit, but theres one thing thats always been constant in her life and that Forrest.This movie is a fantastic tale of two people who take different roads but can't get away from each other. The love has always been there, but commitment wasn't. Will the two end up together, you'll just have to watch the movie because I wont spoil everything.Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is captivating. It's one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. He won the Oscar that year for Best Actor and it would have been a sham if he haven't. His peformance as the mentally challenged man in all the big events will bring you to tears. You leave the movie wishing you could be full of life and innocent like Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is the man and In my opinion this is top 5 performances ever. You can't help but love him. No one else could have been Forrest. Nobody.Robin Wright gives the performance of her carear in this movie. She's awesome as Jenny. She displays the emotions of the character so well. We can all relate to her character in a way.The two characters cover almost all the major of events from the 60's on to the early 80's. They stir up memories and everything looks authentic. It's magical and funny as you think back about these two love birds and the situations they are in.Gary Sinise gives the performance of his carear as well. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost. He should have won it over Marin Landua. Lt. Dan brings more emotion to the movie as he relates to Forrest in different ways. There friendship is special and the two change each others lives.Robert Zemcki's established himself as a Hollywood elite with Forrest Gump. He already had hits like Back to the Future and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit under his belt. Forrest Gump is the icing on the cake though. It's a special movie and the way he made it is beautiful. He deserved his Oscar for Best Director.The movie is so well made. It won Oscars for Editing and Effects and you will see why. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and it won six. It could have easily won any of the others as well.The DVD extras are great. There is a second disk jammed with stuff. The stuff on the making of the movie is great. The documentaries are great as well. If you love DVD extras, then pick it up. It's worth it.This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a passionate love story and an awesome tail of a man, just being himself. Everybody should see this movie at one point or another in life. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a teenager. It deserves it's PG-13 rating and some people argue an R rating, but I think thats stretching it. Buy this movie and experience the phenomenom that is Forrest Gump.	5.0	One of the greatest stories and performance ever	2004-08-02	1	1	0

However, I was quite disappointed to find outthat the English Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is badly mixed.There's very little use of the surround channels - and theypop in and out abruptly. During the big battle scene inVietnam, there's no surround sound until two-thirds of theway thru the scene, and then the surrounds come on abruptly with some background music. Someone at Paramount was asleepat the wheel when they mixed this one. I hope there will bea recall.	4.0	Some sounds problems on Forrest Gump DVD	2001-08-29	5	4	1

This is not an action-packed tale of good guys vs bad guys or anything like that, but wow, it's still an awesome film!It follows the life of the titular main character through his childhood and adulthood (as narrated by Forrest Gump) while various people sit with him at the bus stop and listen to him. There's plenty of interesting things and events in here - his time in Vietnam, his tenure working on a shrimp boat, etc etc. If you like action, this might not be a good film for you, but if you like a good story, then definitely give this movie a try!	5.0	fantastic and memorable	2011-01-31	2	2	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I'm going to disagree with a couple of other reviewers on here, and say this is a great movie. Why do people have to over-analyse things? And another thing: does Forrest really get the girl in the end? Cos if you watch right to the end, technically, he doesn't. In a way.My mum is a big fan of Tom Hanks, and watches Green Mile over & over, but whenever I suggest another Tom Hanks movie to her, she doesn't fancy it. I managed to sit her down in front of this, and she really enjoyed it! I love this movie, despite the length, and it has a great many stars in it: Robin Wright Penn, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise, to name but a few.I especially love how when Lieutenant Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, how it's done. It's fantastic! At first I thought, particularly when he was in the bed/wheelchair, that they were underneath him, or put through a hole in the bed, but apparently, his lower legs were wrapped in a special blue fabric that allowed them to be optically removed from the film by computer later.Lieutenant Dan tells Forrest that the day Forrest works on a shrimp boat is the day he'd be an astronaut. This is a reference to the book, where Forrest actually becomes an astronaut, and the following year, they appeared together as astronauts in Apollo 13.The Doors have more songs in the movie than any other band with a total of five. These are, ""Soul Kitchen"" (in one of the Vietnam scenes), ""Hello, I Love You"" (first song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), ""Break On Through"" (second song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), ""People Are Strange"" (third song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), and ""Love Her Madly"" (when Jenny is leaving the hotel room with a black eye after presumably resorting to prostitution).I love Jenny's character in this, played by Robin Wright Penn. It's the way her whole look changes constantly throughout the movie, while Forrest stays the exact same. I think the character of Kayleigh from Butterfly Effect was loosely based around Jenny's character, as both characters change so much throughout the movie.There's a lot of historical events in this movie, including meeting Elvis and teaching him how to dance, he met John Lennon and gave him his inspiration for Imagine (and two presidents), he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous. I think the Watergate scandal went straight over my head, didn't understand that bit at all. Everyone knows this stuff wasn't likely to ever happen, and I hate the fact that they used old news reels, and someone attempted (albeit badly) to change the words the people were actually speaking! The lip movements are very wrong.It's hard to believe this movie is now 10 years old, and fingers crossed, in another ten years, it'll be considered even more of a classic than it is now. If you liked the Back To The Future trilogy, and any other Robert Zemeckis movie, then you'll love this. The book's quite different from the movie, but that's worthwhile picking up cheap if you can."	4.0	Stupid is as stupid does	2004-11-18	5	4	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	When I first saw the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in a theater in 1994, I knew that director Robert Zemeckis had created a heart-warming masterpiece that would more than likely earn it Oscar recognition, and it certainly did.  The endearing film follows the life of an educationally challenged man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) from the time of his childhood (played by Michael Conner Humphreys) until early middle age.  His mother (Sally Field) made sure that he would be treated just like everyone else so that he could take care of himself once she was gone.  In addition to his learning disability, Forrest was required to wear leg braces as a child that made him the target of ridicule from other children, except for one girl named Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall).  However, Forrest quickly discovered that his legs weren't that bad when he found an innate ability to run.  When Forrest decided to join the U.S. Army, he meets his two best friends: a fellow recruit named Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).  Bubba loved to talk about shrimp and Lt. Dan was raised to be a soldier.  Forrest's relationship with Jenny, as well as his relationships with Bubba and Lt. Dan, led Forrest down several unexpected paths that allowed him to meet several pivotal historical figures.Tom Hanks' superb performance as the loveable Forrest Gump earned him his well-deserved second Oscar for Best Actor.  (He had previously won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and has been nominated three other times.)  Robert Zemeckis also earned the Oscar for Best Director, and the film itself won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.  Gary Sinise earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, in addition to six other Oscar nominations that included Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound.  Part of what &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; so endearing was Zemeckis' use of superimposing actors into actual, historical film footage.  This footage included the late Pres. John F. Kennedy, the late John Lennon, the late Pres. Richard M. Nixon, and the late former Alabama Gov. George Wallace to name a few.  (Robert Zemeckis used this same archival footage technique again in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;.)  Other memorable characters in the film include school bus driver Dorothy Harris (Siobhan Fallon), Bubba's mother (Marlena Smalls), Abbie Hoffman (Richard D'Alessandro) and Forrest Gump Jr. (Haley Joel Osment).Some of the many memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes, running with leg braces, running across the football field during practice, scenes at the University of Alabama, boot camp, Vietnam, D.C., NYC, the shrimping boat, running across America, and the scenes with Jenny (both as child and adult).  I regard &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as one of the best films ever made and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's the kind of film that draws the viewer into its story and keeps the viewer engaged throughout its 142 minutes.  I highly recommend the DVD version of the film to everyone, and the second DVD is good with its various documentaries and other material.  Tom Hanks went on to star in many more memorable film roles, including his roles in &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000) to name a few.  Unfortunately, many of Gary Sinise's film roles that followed have been far less memorable.	5.0	&quot;There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,...&quot;	2003-12-08	67	54	13

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3KUW7BHBJG4FL	"Michael F. Brown ""mikeyb"""	"The highly acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, the genius behind the cult classic `Back To The Future', can add another feather to his cap with this summers box office smash Forrest Gump. This epic of human proportions, staring Tom Hanks as the smartest dumb person in America, will capture hearts world wide with its warming feel good story line.The chronicles of a young man who's accent comes straight form his back bone, following Forrest from his first day at school, to Vietnam and strangely shrimping. This film is the story of one mans accident through life. He may not have the highest IQ... or even an average on for that matter, but he still manages to become one of Americas most successful business tycoons. He meets many famous icons of our time, some by accident, some by luck by most by stupidity along his ride to the top, including J.F.K, Elvis, president Nixon and John Lennon.But who or what is Forrest Gump? Is he a simpleton? An idealist? A moral paragon? In this movie it's more appropriate to describe him as what he isn't. Forrest lives in a world that derides him as stupid but, as Mrs Gump says, ""stupid is as stupid does"", and in this movie it's everybody else who seems to cross that behavioural line, it's not Forrest that's `retarded', it's the rest of the world.But what's special about this film is that it goes against all conventional rules of film production, there are no heroes or quests to complete just the irrepressible spirit of Forrest Gump. He may not know much but he definitely knows how to treat people right. But having said this, what's a film with out a love interest? Provided by the fantastically talented Robin Wright, this impossible relationship only fuels the love story making a classic cinema romance. As kids Forrest and Jenny shared a common purity but as the couple grow, Jenny sheds her child hood innocence leaving Forrest behind. Jenny stumbles from one bad trip to another and while everybody else seems to engage in acts of relentless, well, stupidity, forest maintains his carefree attitude that is the life blood of this cinematic triumph. Trough all this Forrest is the constant: he sees the world in simple terms, intent on doing the right thingForrest Gump addresses many of the crucial American wounds of the 20th century: Vietnam, relationships with African-Americans, drugs, capitalism and the mistreatment of women. Naturally Forrest himself takes the morally right line on all of these. However just beneath the surface Forrest Gump could be little more than an ideological fairy story to keep Americans believing in the cause. If only we could have a world where the best-intentioned half-wit could pop up at opportune moments in history, winning hearts, amassing a fortune and becoming famous. Sadly, the world generally belongs to those who have screwed over someone else to get there - and that isn't Forrest, he's too nice a guy.The acting is strong, the narrative is compelling and its semi-documentary style direction is consistent and provides clarity and pace. While Forrest may look to be only primary colours, Hanks gives him all the shades of the 64-crayon box; humour, rage, suspicion, doubt, longing, all swirl in his mesmerizing performance. Much of the film is about the country's pain over having its innocence ripped away in that era by war and civil strife and how, in Forrest Gump, the child lived on. But in no way is this film another tabloid version of history, what it depicts is done right with class and style"	5.0	FORREST GUMP	2005-01-24	7	5	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	The power of this film is truly incredible.  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his time-hopping and person-changing ideals that he captured in films like Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Spanning over 30 years of history, Forrest is literally oblilvious to the changes of America, riding them out as we take witness to his brushes with greatness (3 presidents), and his accomplishments.  Tom Hanks makes Forrest such a memorable character because we believe his character is real.  Probably not until &quot;Chuck Noland&quot; in Cast Away has Hanks been able to recently pull of a live-action role so well (Toy Story's Woody is also well orchestrated, but Woody is a computer actor). This film holds a firm place in my top 10 for a number of reasons, but mainly because it is a reminder of my mom.  I was never like Forrest, I could not run like the wind blows, or my IQ did not register a 75, but it was the type of encouragement and moterly love that Sally Field put into Momma Gump that made her so believable.  Sadly, 8 months after I saw Forrest Gump, my mom passed away due to cancer, on Tuesday April 4th.  To this day, no matter what, Forrest's final scene with his mother still gets me inside.  It is something that will stay with me always.	5.0	One of the most moving pictures I have ever seen.	2001-03-14	14	12	2

Well I wasn't. Im 22 years old, and after 5 years of trying to get around and watch this movie. I finally got around to it. I finally see why people thought it was strange that I didn't watch this movie.This movie was probably the best one I have ever watched. I have always liked Tom Hanks, but in my opinion this was his best film. Enough to even write a review about it. Its heartwarming, funny, and sad all at the same time, and there are some quotes in the movie that will definitely stick to you.

Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance and the movie consistently provides something to chew on.  You would never think that a person like Forrest Gump could be involved with so many things in his life, but he is, perhaps oblivious to the significance of it all, but you love him nonetheless.  There is hardship, but Forrest conquers all, and it ends nicely.  You are probably going to want to see this movie again at some point, so buying it may be a good idea.	5.0	You Haven't Seen This Movie Yet?	2006-09-18	7	7	0

MESSINA	"I was about to begin this review with the statement that I don't understand why this film inspires such intense adulation - but unfortunately, I understand all too well.  Mediocrity and cheap sentimentality has always sold well in America; a ""feel-good"" movie wins the audience every time.But what are you ""feeling good"" ABOUT...?This movie sells the premise, ""It's DESIRABLE to be mentally deficient.""There is NOTHING desirable about being mentally challenged.I think this film could be called subversive, perhaps even dangerous, in its glorification of simple-minded ""innocence"" over rational, thoughtful consideration of what's going on in the society around you.  This film makes light of many serious events in America's history for the sake of some ""gee-whiz"" special effects.Come to think of it, it's probably the PERFECT movie for the G. W. Bush era.Definitely NOT entertainment for any thinking, rational person."	1.0	I don't buy it for a minute	2005-06-09	78	24	54
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	"Forrest Gump, is the story of a man who is not that smart, but not ""stupid"" either.  He has no agenda, no plans, just a love of life and all that is in it.  He is the modern symbol of innocence, and that is why he became such a symbol after the movie release.The director traces time from the 50's I'd say all the way to the 70's, with tons of music along the journey.  The film was highly effective, although was often seen more as a comic endeavor.  Too many young people overlooked the overriding tale of innocence in a crazy and sin-filled world.Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is contrasted against his life-long love Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn.  Jenny experiences all of the mood swings of American culture, i.e., hippie culture, drug life, and so on.  However, Forrest, although he is much more face to face with the most gripping of realities, such as Vietnam and presidential assassinations, never strays from his half-minded yet picture perfect view of reality.I really liked the attempt that this movie made with the story of everlasting innocence and love; however, too many were distracted by Forrest's many guffaws, specifically his speech impediment.  In addition, many believe this to have a great soundtrack, but combining a vast variety of songs that were popular is not original, instead a score could have been extensively used throughout the entire film instead of using clippings of 60's/70's popular hits no matter how much we liked them.Also, we probably got the message way before the film was over and thus could have skipped parts of the film and been just the same.  Lastly, I did not like the hype, and was sick of all the people quoting the film.  Now, I only saw this film a few days ago, and for many that is shocking; however, this film was not as powerful as people pre-suppose.Yes, this film was good.  Maybe it will one day be a classic, but right now this is just a quality shrimp in a more-or-less lousy catch."	4.0	Waiting for You Know... Forrest Gump.	2005-01-18	5	2	3

I mainly purchased it because of music I have heard over the years and couldn't find the source anywhere. After much searching and finding the answer I was amazed to find it to be the Forest Gump Suite by A. S. (don't want to go back and look as it is on my iPod) The music quietly plays an integral part.I was also quite surprised to see that the movie has as timely a meaning pertaining to  the economy and government now as it did then. However, it seemed to have more meaning to me this time.The more things change the more they remain the same.I didn't have to buy it it blue ray but thought I would to see how much of a difference there was.  Still won't know unless I rent a regular, but updated, version so that digital will be factored into the clarity and possible the sound.	5.0	Forest Gump; timeless and meaningful	2009-12-28	4	2	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	This movie is probally in the top ten of my favorite all time. Hanks gives  a breathtaking performance as Forrest Gump, as does Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan.  The soundtrack to this film is great old fashioned rock n roll(which I  like). The movie is very sad in many scenes, but there are also many scenes  of joy and humor. Why am I explaining this? Who has not seen this movie  before? Bottom line is that if you want to see a movie about a simple man  accomplishing every thing imaginable, this is what this film is. My  favorite part is when President Nixon asked Forrest to stay at the Water  Gate hotel, and you can guess who is responsible for discovering the  scandle in the hotel. A definite movie to buy, but if you have not seen  this, you better see it as soon as possible. I mean now!	5.0	Great Movie!	2000-08-09	3	2	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ	"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003"""	Forrest Gump, starring Academy Award Winner Tom Hanks (Cast Away), Academy Award Nominee Gary Sinise (Mission to Mars), Golden Globe Nominee Robin Wright (at this time Robin Wright Penn, Unbreakable), and Acadmey Award Winner Sally Field and directed by Academy Award Winner Robert Zemeckis, is and will probably be the greatest drama that ever existed.  It is a magnificent movie with an all-star cast and a wonderful sceenplay based on the novel by Winston Groom.  Winston Groom truly created a phenomenon when he created the character Forrest Gump, a mentally retarded man, who tries to live a normal life.  As Forrest tells his life story to several people at his bus stop, he shows us that he's not at all different than any other person and that he has accomplished more than others despite his problem.  Thrown in his story is his childhood friend Jenny(Robin Wright Penn) who becomes a drug-addicted prostitute , Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) a lieutenant in the Vietnam War in which Gump served in, and his caring mother (Sally Field).  Forrest Gump is truly a classic and will always be remembered.  Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks won Oscars for this while Sinise was nominated for one and Robin Wright Penn was nominated for a Golden Globe.  Forrest Gump is a must have for everyone.Extra:  Haley Joel Osment makes a couple small cameos as Forrest's son.Time:  141 minutesRated PG-13 for mild language and some scenes of nudity	5.0	"""Perhaps the greatest drama ever made!"""	2002-09-15	1	1	0

When I first saw it in 2001, It touched my heart.  I watched the first few minutes of it, and I couldn't stop.  I watched it downstairs and stayed their all night to watch it.  And it was spectacular.  Tom Hanks is perfect as Forrest Gump.  Won 6 Oscars for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemekis), Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay.  Went to this touching story about a simple man named Forrest Gump who, even though isn't very bright, accidently ends up getting involved with some of the biggest key moments of the 19th century.  It's funny, touching, heart warming, and sad.  I read the book, and the first line even touched me.  I highly recommend watching this.  It deserves a chance.  I've seen it 14 times in counting too!

It is also one of the best 90's movies ever made! I remember seeing it in the theaters 8 years ago. The movie tells the story about Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow-witted but good hearted man from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s being a college football player, a soldier in Vietnam, a ping pong player, a shrimp boat captain, and a runner. He fell in love with his childhood best friend Jenny(Robin Wright). The DVD is great with all the special features including the trailers, the documentary, photo gallery, and screen tests.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2Z9FXHC1L66EW	"Mr. ""alan5973"""	You never know what you're gonna get!Forrest Gump is without a doubt one of the best films of the 1990s.  Very unique, very original, very wonderful!  And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.  Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability.Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump	5.0	My Mamma always said that life is like a box of DVD extras..	2001-09-02	3	1	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A37UVD1ML4WIMJ	Mrs. H. L. Little	Some critics slated this film because they hated the way it wiped the floor with their own favourite 'Pulp Fiction' in the major awards in 1994. However over the course of time I think it's now acceptable to praise Forrest Gump for what it is, the best feelgood film since 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Gump was pretty much the opposite of Pulp Fiction but it stands the test of time much better in my humble opinion. Pretty much a perfect film. This film sets out simply to entertain you and make you forget about all of your troubles for two hours. There's no need to pick it apart, just let yourself enjoy it, after all it's only a film.	5.0	Just let yourself enjoy it.	2000-11-20	1	1	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2N9UJMSYNV7Y	"""mrswoogie"""	Due to all the hype with the release of this movie, I avoided it like the plague.  I was sure it would be a chick flick (hey, not all chicks like them) and didn't want to waste the time.  I came across Forrest Gump while  sick in bed one day and GRUDGINGLY sat through the first 15 minutes, only  to find myself hooked.  Tom Hanks is absoulutely amazing, making the viewer  believe he is Forrest - the supporting cast (Sinise, Wright) is great.  Nothing can compare to Forrest meeting his son for the first time (a soon  to be VERY well known Haley Joel Osment).  Needless to say, I now own this  video, and I recommend it without reservations.	5.0	Magnificent!	2000-01-10	3	3	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2TKSKI7AYVZ8P	MusoSteve@wang.com	The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what  they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the  powers that be for their troubles as well.This movie depicts them as  shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people  (there's irony for you!) who were &quot;Unamerican&quot; in every sense of  the word.The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss.  Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will  be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is  close enough.It's enough to make a person gag.Oh, and the fact it  beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar  doesn't help either.	3.0	Revisionist History	2000-01-03	17	8	9

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2TZ6SQK8O649R	Natalie Kilpatrick	"THE STORY OF FORREST GUMPForrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sits on at a bus stop on a bench in 1981.  A black lady gets off of the bus and Forrest begins talking to her, even though she's ignoring him the whole time.  He starts out by talking about when he was a kid.  Before he begins school, Forrest visits a doctor helping out with his spine, which ""Is as crooked as a politician"" notes the doctor.  He then goes into talking about how he got his name, by an Uncle who started the Ku Klux Klan (of course, he IS telling this to a black lady, don't forget).  Afterwards, while walking home with his mother, people along the street stare at Forrest, as if he's wrong and shouldn't even be alive.  Mama (Sally Field) makes sure to let him know that everybody's different, and ""If God intended everybody to be the same he'd have given us all braces on our legs.""  Going on away from the storyline, Forrest tells the black gal about how the house he lived in had been in the family throughout Grandpa's, and the house had been there about a thousand years (remember, this guy's slow).  Mama then tries enrolling Forrest into a public school, however, his IQ isn't quite what they need to get him in.  Mama demands that Forrest get the same education as everyone else.  Mama does get him into school alright, by doing what every woman needs to do when it comes to getting higher up in the food chain.  Next, young Forrest gets on the bus to go to school for the first time.  Later the next day or so, Forrest is caught by Mama pestering a man with a guitar (supposedly Elvis Pressley).  Forrest ends up to show him some moves while dancing to the sounds of the guitar, which were later used by Elvis in concerts.  He explains to the black lady that ""that young man"" died for some reason, but it must be hard being a King.  After not wanting to get on the bus because of the bus driver being a stranger, they introduce themselves, and they're on their way.  However, nobody will let Forrest sit with him.  They know that he's different, and nobody wants a thing to do with him, except Jenny.  They began a conversation all the way to school.  After school, kids start throwing rocks at Forrest, Jenny tells him to run, so he does.  Forrest's leg braces break off, and he begins really running, faster than the kids can pedal their bikes.  He runs through town, where the people in the beginning of the movie gave him dirty looks saw him, they looked on in amazement.  Later on, a few days later, he goes to find Jenny because she didn't go to school.  Forrest begins knocking on the front door, runs around back, and finds Jenny there.  He begins asking Jenny questions, but Jenny doesn't want Forrest talking loud because her father's sleeping.  When they find out that he has been wakened, they begin running through the corn field to hide.  They begin praying that God turn her into a bird so that she can fly far, far, far away.  Instead, she moves into her Grandma's by order of the police.  She snuck out often to see Forrest because she was scared.  Forrest assumed that it was because of her Grandma's dog.HISTORICAL EVENTSAlthough I'd like to tell you the rest of the story, this is only the first 3 chapters in the movie.  After this, Forrest has grown up.  Forrest meets many celebrities along the road of his life, including Elvis Pressley, many Presidents, etc.  He ""accidentally"" steps into some of the most important aspects of History, including when the first blacks were enrolled into a white college, playing on the All American Football Team in college, the Vietnam War where he meets Bubba and promises to start a shrimpin' business with him after they get out of the war, and many others.  You'll have to find out to see for yourself.  Most all of the historical editing is done superbly, with Hanks being inserted into many of the scenes.2001 TWO-DISC DVD SETThe re-release version in 2001 contains ""Through The Eyes Of Forrest Gump,"" Outtakes, and how they made special effects work.MY OPINIONIn my personal opinion, this is a great movie.  It has no plot, there is no evil, just Forrest, his Mama, and the friends he meets along the way.~Natalie Kilpatrick"	5.0	Wonderful film for everyone to see!	2001-09-05	4	1	3

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A11HG876A03OBN	"N. Curts ""lala loof"""	As one of Tom Hank's greatest achivements in the movie-making industry, Forest Gump is a movie that can be appreciated by people from nearly every age group--which is something few movies are able to accomplish-- It is hard to say with any specifics what happens in this movie as it would spoil a wonderfully written plot. The one thing that I do think a review is able to say without giving to much away is how the movie created a sence of far a person can really go in life--especially those who start out with an immediate disadvantage in comparison to the general populace.	5.0	What's life like again Gump?	2001-08-24	2	1	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ	Negative Comments	Give me a break, this is nothing special. The only reason this movie has the kind of reputation is does is because of the proven fact that it is impossible for someone to play a leading role in which a character is mentally handicapped and *NOT get a nomination, let alone have the movie received well. Think about that for a second and you'll see that's true. There are no movies that weren't received well where an actor played a *main character with a *mental handicap. (keep in mind the asterisked words, that's what qualifies my statement)There are movies like this I do like, this is simply not one of them. This was boring because the film had no direction, it simply feels like you're watching the biography of a person from some historical text played out on the big screen. It's just one episode after the next depicting the heroic acts of Forrest and showing the relationships between him and the people he meets, but all these events don't build into any storyline you can care about. Each individual episode presents its own challenges to Forrest, but these feel isolated and doesn't build to any kind of payoff.If you like stories like this, go watchSling Blade, it's a much better movie that doesn't put on a facade of being some grand spectacle of our time.	3.0	FACT: mental handicap = nomination	2005-07-12	20	4	16

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1	newfound32	Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a southern boy who is not so much bright. He is in love with a girl name Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn ) who is Forest's friend, but just likes him as a friend. He's known her ever since they were little. She then moves on in war and peace marches of the Vietnam War, which then leads Forrest to go to fight in the Vietnam War. His friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) gets killed and Forrest promises to help Bubba's family with the mortgages. He then meets Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who gets his legs blown off in the war. Which then loses his money and Forrest invests with him in a fishing business. Forest then sadly loses his mother by a fight against basically old age. Jenny then comes back to his life and realizes he has a kid. Jenny then loses a fight with a bad cold which then dies. A very sad film with Forrest Gump has to move on.It is a very sad tragic movie that can really move you. It can be very touching, which can make you drop a tear. It is very moving which if you haven't seen you got to watch this film. It is a must see if you haven't. I don't really think it should have won best picture, I liked it but I liked Pulp Fiction better. Tom Hanks's performance is very great and truly deserved the Oscar. It also can be very heart warming in a sensitive way. The cinematography in this film is very breath taking. It can blow your mind. This movie can touch anyone and when you stop watching this film, it's just a feeling you can't explain.This DVD includes commentary by Robert Zemeckis, Steve Starkey and Rick Carter, but it would have been better if they had commentary by Tom Hanks. It also has behind the scenes, art design featurattes. This is a 2 disc set DVD, and widescreen. It also has the trailer and TV spots of the film. It also has interviews with the cast and crew. With Tom Hanks, Robert Zemeckis and more. This could have had better features though like the backstory they had on AMC. Other than that these special features are pretty good. You have to get this film or if you haven't seen it you need to watch this spectacular film. A definite must.	5.0	instead of walkin. I was RUNNIN!!!!!!	2004-03-16	4	3	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A249OV75R95DPX	Newt X	There's willing suspension of disbelief, and then there's this.  If you can accept that a developmentally disabled man with a talent for running and ping-pong can personally meet several presidents, George Wallace, John Lennon, and pretty much everybody else worth meeting between 1963 and 1979, this pat parable is right up your street.It's all about how dumb luck and a good storyline can solve all your problems for you, and it's about as credible as the fairy tales your mother read you when you were this high.  The first time you watch it, it bilks you into thinking it's just a high-spirited fable, but the more times you watch it, the more you realize it's based on broad twists of fate and extreme leaps of logic, culminating in a moral so simplistic that Aesop would have laughed out loud at it.Its success rests primarily in its having been made in the 1990's, a time when we believed we could accomplish anything by simple skill and sheer force of will.  We've moved past that time, and we have a more cold-eyed view on the world.  We now believe some things are beyond our control.  And this dusty leftover from the yee-haw Clinton era seems like a relic from the 1950's, for all its lyrical sophistication.Go back to football, Forrest.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"""Forrest Gump"" is the sweeping story of a simpleton (Tom Hanks) whose view of the world is both clairvoyant and poignant.  After being told that he will never walk without the aid of leg braces, young Forrest breaks free of his irons, goes on to become a college football star, a decorated war hero, the CEO of a lucrative shrimp business, and finally, a husband to the ill-fated girl of his dreams (Robin Wright Penn) and a father (Haley Joel Osmond in an early role). What makes the film so remarkable is its handling of the central character. Like Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, Tom Hanks brilliant performance as Forrest is thoughtful, introspective and fine wrought with compassion. Director, Robert Zemeckis never allows sympathy or stereotyping of the mentally handicap to override the poignancy or expanse of his narrative. Gary Sinise is magnificent as Lt. Dan Taylor - a hot shot military man until war robs him of the use of both of his legs. Sally Fields excels as Forrest's mother, a woman determined to see that her son lives a full and useful life.The transfer from Paramount Home Video is somewhat disappointing. Sourced from a print rather than the original camera negative, colors are generally weak though sometimes nicely balanced. There's some age related dirt and scratches present throughout the print that, for a film of this vintage should NOT be an issue. The anamorphic framing is consistent but fine details are lost in many of the darker scenes. There's a considerable amount of film and digital grain present for a picture that, at times, is smooth, but at other times is rather harsh on the eyes. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced with a real kick in the musical score and special effects.  The extras include a documentary on the making of the film, some interviews with the cast members and director, the film's theatrical trailer and some television spots.  Overall, this is a less of a stellar visual presentation than it should have been."	3.0	GUMP IS AS GUMP DOES - THE EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW!	2004-06-09	6	1	5

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	I am biased when it comes to talking about &quot;Forest Gump&quot; the movie. To start with, Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are two of my favorite actors. On top of that, I have been taken with Robin Wright ever since her role as Princess Buttercup.I was a much different person when &quot;Forest Gump&quot; was first released. I held to a world view that looked down upon its blatant appeal to sentiment. For the obviously good acting job that Hanks did, I did not then feel that this film deserved to win best picture. Over time, my views have changed. While I still view &quot;Gump&quot; as a little too sentimental, I have to admit that it is one heck of a picture.Great performances abound in this movie. Hanks is the most obvious. He is indeed Forest Gump. I doubt any other actor could have pulled off this role so convincingly. Sinise is outstanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. He manages to be over the top without becoming absurd. Wright's Jenny is a moving counterpoint to Forest. Mykelti Williamson does a great job with what he is given.The world as seen through the eyes of Forest Gump is definitely not &quot;reality.&quot; That said, we get enough &quot;reality&quot; every day. Zemeckis &amp; company took what could have been shallow escapism and instead they fashioned it into a lens with which to view different parts of ourselves more clearly.I recommend &quot;Forest Gump&quot; very highly. All the bells and whistles on this DVD version only make it more attractive. Get it.	4.0	a masterpiece of sentimentallity	2001-10-04	0	0	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2GHTSBU7IHIBO	Owen Hughes	I guess a lot of people have thought hard about this film, which first appeared nearly a decade ago. What the range of conclusions might be is hard to say: I mean, what is Gump trying so hard to tell us? As he strides  back and forth across America, becoming hairier by the minute, are we not  walking in the crowd behind him, trying to get a grip on what it's all  about? It seems to me that that is Gump's mission, to get us up and  thinking; certainly not following gurus from coast to coast. If Gump can  figure it out (and it seems that eventually, he had just about everything  figured out), then maybe we can too. Maybe we don't all have moms who  believe in us that much, but even so, maybe we could all try just that much  harder: like Gump.It's a fascinating look at America, with its odd  historical background and the tendency for the underdog to somehow win  through. Still, we must not forget that Gump is a white American and a  member of the most privileged race on Earth when it comes to getting hold  of the world's resources and running with them. That's what Gump did, but  maybe he was just silly enough not to be able to see the big picture like  everyone else, so that instead, he could take off on a voyage of personal  discovery. Maybe we could do something that simple ourselves....	5.0	Thinking hard about the world	2000-05-10	6	3	3

Forrest, Forrest Gump shows us that,while we are distracted, fumbling with our strivings for bigger,  better, faster and more, the &quot;stuff&quot; of life may very well be  drifting by us undetected.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2YYNR7VU2DS8T	Patrick	"One of the first movies I ever saw in theaters, ""Forrest Gump"" has to be one of my favorite movies ever.Winner of 6 Oscars including Best Picture, Actor (Tom Hanks), and Director (Robert Zemeckis), ""Forrest Gump"" tells the story of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted young man growing up during the 50's and 60's.  His life spans over many fruitful events: he teaches Elvis to dance as a child, wins the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, competes in a world-championship game of ping pong, opens a successful shrimp business in memory of a friend who died in Vietnam, and invests blindly in Apple Computers, making a fortune.  He also meets three Presidents, witnesses Watergate, and runs across the country.  And all this is happening while dealing with the love-of-his-life Jenny (Robin Wright), and his cancerous mother (Sally Field).  Gary Sinise also gives an excellent performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's commander in Vietnam, who turns out to be a life-long friend.""Forrest Gump"" is definitely one of the best movies ever made.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3V61K0EF38GP4	Philip Scholz	"This is a film that will never die.  Tom Hanks captures our hearts as Forest Gump, the loveable man of low IQ who convincingly just happens to find himself in some of the most historic moments of the last fifty years of our nation's history.  Robin Wright brilliantly plays his love interest Jenny, a character who, despite all her flaws and mistakes, is someone you'd like to be next to, like in the dorm room (wink wink.)  Sally Field and Gary Sinise both portray Forest's moral compass, doing an excellent job before, during, and after their times in his life overlap.  Mykelti Williamson comes in as Bubba, a friend and fellow soldier who serves as the inspiration that sets Forest up for the rest of his life (so he could mow that lawn for free.)  And let's not forget the ""special guest stars""...the presidents, talk show hosts, and other historical figures who Forest interacts with in his life.  CGI effects, ground-breaking for their time, make this possible so it really looks like Tom Hanks is shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy in 1994.  A timeless classic without any flaws...I'd recommend it to anyone.  Enjoy...I know you will."	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2013-09-07	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Forrest Gump is a rare movie that succeeded on all levels.  It was a box office smash ranking among the top five highest grossing movies of all time.  But it was also a critical darling, garnering across the board praise and a truckload of awards.  The movie became a cultural phenomenon, spawning cook books, quote books, a top ten soundtrack album and lines like &quot;stupid is as stupid does&quot; and &quot;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get&quot; have permeated our dialect.  The movie has a nostalgic, feel good vibe thanks to the dimwitted Forrest's trek through 60's and 70's touchstone events.  Underneath all those warm feelings lies a darkness.  Bad things happen to just about everyone Forrest comes in contact with.  His best friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam, his other friend Lt. Dan loses both his legs, his mother dies of cancer and his beloved Jenny dies of AIDS.  Even the famous people Forrest comes across meet with disaster, President Kennedy &amp; John Lennon are assassinated, George Wallace is shot and Elvis Presley dies young.  There are superb performances all around.  Sally Field is feisty as Forrest's mama, Mykelti Williamson is funny as Bubba, Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan is a perfect rough edged foil to Forrest and Robin Wright as Jenny portrays the confusion that young people of the times felt perfectly.  While all those performances are of high quality, Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks' tour de force.  He is utterly brilliant as Forrest.  He is in virtually every scene of the movie and never once does he fail to astound.  He becomes Forrest and makes you care what happens to him.  Mr. Hanks deservedly won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar for the role and cemented himself as the best actor of his generation and one of the best of all time.	5.0	Hanks is Brilliant	2001-10-03	267	230	37
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1PRQPGBFBKS1Z	PM	"This novel is simple, but it is a great story. Forrest is an idiot and sometimes he could not do some simple things as other people do. Jenny is Forrest's best friend since their childhoods. Forrest has a strong feeling to Jenny, later Jenny becomes his girlfriend. Unfortunately, they are not together by the end of the story. Forrest's mother always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" This is a simple sentence, but it has influenced Forrest a lot. This sentence represents not to focus on the result because we never know what we're going to get. Also, this sentence implies that life is full of surprise like a box of chocolates which make Forrest expect to enjoy having his life. According to this novel, we have seen many things that Forrest's mom does for him, and he cannot succeed his life without his mom. For example, his mother sent him to public school because she believes that it would help him to be like everybody else. She does her best and gives everything she can. she is a great mom. Forrest's story encourages many people because he is braved and he is not easy to give up his life even he has low IQ. This is an encouraged book, so people who luck confident or complain about their lives should read this book to cheer up. Many people like to complain what they don't have, but they always forget what they have. However, Forrest is different from other people because he never focuses on his disadvantages. Dan is Forrest's commanding officer and he lost his legs during the Vietnam War. Then, Dan was sent back to the United States, and lived with the government welfare. It is hard for him to live like that because he used to be an officer, but now he has to rely on government welfare. Many times he wants to die, but he did not do because he still has some hope for his life. At the end, he worked with Forrest and they run shrimp business successfully. In conclusion, this is a good book, and everyone should read it because one can always learn something from this book."	5.0	simple but fabulous book	2011-03-30	4	3	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A8ZI6RRQZSB83	"Pooja Sadhwani ""navin sadhwani"""	Forrest Gump, a 1994 American epic award-winning movie about the Vietnam War centers on the life of Forrest Gump, a boy with an IQ of 75. The movie starts off with a white feather falling to Forrest Gump's feet while he is sitting on a bench near a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia. He proceeds to pick up the feather and places it in his book, and then begins to tell his life story to various people sitting next to him. He starts telling the story way back to when he was a young boy. Throughout the story, we could see that because of his low IQ, he tended to live life very simply, however we could see that he had to deal with and go through some of the hardest times in American history. One of the events in history that Forrest had to live through was the Vietnam War, which we have focused on a lot in American Studies this quarter.In my opinion, this movie was outstanding. There is nothing that I disliked about it. It was very heart-warming, well acted, and definitely worthy of its many Oscars. One reason that I particularly liked it so much was that it helped me gain a clearer understanding of America and its people during the time of the Vietnam War. For example, one of the interesting things that I learned was about the state of people when they got back from war. One character that really showed me this was Lieutenant Dan. When being shot in the war, he was saved by Forrest but had to live the rest of his life as a cripple, without any legs. This caused him to go in a state of depression and caused him to become an alcoholic, which were two relatively prevalent problems in the United States back then. For the longest time, he blamed Forrest for putting this burden on him, however slowly towards the end of the movie he realized that Forrest did him good, and that he could actually move on with his life. One other interesting thing that I learned that was not really directed towards the war was that the famous quote &#34;Life is a box of chocolates&#34; actually came from this movie. This quote signifies that you just have to accept life as it is, because you never know what is coming your way. To me, this quote is very important and is something to live by. As well as this, I learned a lot about the history and relationship between China and the United States. In American Studies class this year, we have learned that during the Cold War, China and the US did not have a very good relationship. However in the movie, it showed that they were able to arrange a friendly Ping-Pong competition on a goodwill tour, a tournament in which Forrest participated in himself. This really surprised me, as it was still during the war and China was on the side of the Communists.Not only did this movie give me insight on many new things, but it also had many connections to what I have learned this year in class, which helps me understand the era in which the movie was set. One connection I made was to the book we have read this quarter, which is &#34;The Things I Carry&#34; by Tim O'Brien. In the book, Tim O'Brien describes all of the tangible and intangible things that the soldiers in the Vietnam War had to carry. In the first chapter, the author mentions that the soldiers had to carry Scholl's foot powder, and in the movie, when Forrest first joins the army, Lieutenant Dan warns him to always carry foot powder and socks to make sure that nothing happened to their feet. That was one of his biggest concerns during the war, which is ironic as later on he lost both of his legs in a shooting. Some other connections that I made with the movie and what we have learned in class is with the movie &#34;Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam&#34;, where we saw real footage from Vietnam, and heard voiceovers of people reading letters from real soldiers serving in the army during that time. In that movie, they mentioned that the letters they wrote had to be approved before they could be sent. I saw the same thing happen in the movie Forrest Gump, when Forrest realizes that none of the letters he wrote to Jenny ever got sent, as he gets them back when admitted in the hospital. This helped me understand the era more in depth, as during that time many governments were hiding information from their civilians back home.Overall, the movie Forrest Gump directed by Robert Zemeckis is an amazing one that depicts the life of a man who has been through so many important historical events in his lifetime, and shows how he dealt with all of the problems, in the simplest of ways.	5.0	Forrest Gump Movie Review: Pooja Sadhwani	2014-03-18	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3B1XRW9HIGYQB	P. Woods	&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; has to be one of Ton Hanks' best pictures he has ever produced. 1994 was difeinately his best year, when he won back-to-back awards for his role in &quot;Philidelphia&quot; and this. He plays a man, born in a place called Greenbow, Alabama. The film starts off with him sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus to meet his girlfriend. While he waits, he has a nice chat to people who pass by and he tells them about his life. That's when his story begins. Forrest (who he plays) is a very strange person and isn't very smart. But he becomes a war hero, top football player, ping-pong champion, shrimp fisherman and a whole lot more. But he also has deep feelings. He has a special someone that he is deeply in love with. Jenny.Most of the time, the film concentrates on Forrest and Jenny. It shows how they meet, what they do together, how they split up, how they get back together etc.The film is very touching, as it nears the end, but it also is very funny, with stupid things always occuring. It also contains some action when he is in Vietnam. The film has everything almost. The cast is excellent. I liked Gary Sinise as Forrest's caption in Nam. The beautiful Robin Wright played Jenny, and Sally Field played Forrest's helpful mother.When you haven't a clue what type of movie to see, see this.	5.0	Touching and very funny!	2004-06-17	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A319YRDK8Y39N	"""qmlhcb"""	The film Forrest Gump is a wonderful modern day fairy tale. It is the story of a simple man stumbling his way through life, but because of his ability to run, leads an extraordinary life.The greatest strength this movie has is how it tells the story spanning a lifetime in only two and a half hours. Nothing feels rushed; the audience just goes from one stage of Forest's life to his next on his quest to find happiness, and to be with his love, Jenny. We feel like we've lived his life along with him. Telling a story spanning almost 40 years effectively like this is not easy, and this movie should be a case study for anyone wishing to do so.The film doesn't try to deal in depth with many of the issues which come up, such as the protest of war, child abuse, woman battering, or AIDS. Some reviews I've read here have criticized it for not dealing with them. But it isn't trying to discuss them. Instead, it's showing how this simple, innocent man is lost in a sea of confusion, not understanding these issues, and so not thinking about them. The audience is shown the world through Forrest's eyes, and to Forrest, there are no issues in life beyond happiness, friendship, and Jenny.Forrest's life is a magical journey like that of Odysseus or Frodo Baggins, but set in our modern world. Yes, the audience has to suspend their belief of a simple guy making it so far in the cruel world. No, it isn't likely, but that's what makes it extraordinary. And it's never meant to mimic probability. That's what makes it a fantasy. And a lovely one at that.The world could use more Forrest Gumps.	5.0	A beautiful fantasy film set in our world	2002-08-11	7	5	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1UKUU8O5W74NC	Rachel	"Before I begin, I'd like to address the negative reviews given to this movie. I've read quite a few of them, but none of them have had me change or even consider changing my opinion. Most were written by people with issues. Whether it be the presidential jokes, their lack of appreciation for the special effects or Tom Hank's &quot;poor&quot; portrayal of a mental challenged man. Yet, most of them complain about the film's lack of realism. How all of these events from the 70's to present day could ever possibly happen to one man.These people have yet to discover the magic of (and not to mention, the biggest reason for) movie making. Why does reality matter? The point of capturing the life of a man who lived through so many trivial events is because no one real person could possibly ever achieve it. And by sitting in your seat and joining him in his tears and laughter only lightens your heart, as this movie was meant to do. Those who can say that this movie almost made them vomit, have a lot of nerve and very little understanding for ""art"".The movie is about a man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) who is born to his mother (Sally Field) with a &quot;below normal&quot; IQ of 75. To add to his challenges in life, his crooked back burdens him to wear braces on his legs. While running away from bullies at the advice of his #1 girl Jenny (&quot;Run Forrest, run!&quot;), they break off revealing his ability to run like the wind.This ability lands him playing football, which lands him a scholarship to college, which leads him to the army where he learns to play ping pong and meets his best friend, Bubba, who teaches him all about shrimp. Place Forrest at a bus stop with a box of chocolates telling his whole story, and you have magic.This is one of my top 10 films by far. It is the true full body experience. It makes me cry and laugh. The all star cast is one of the film's best points. Taking you through and unforgettable and dream-like journey. What a film."	5.0	100% Magic	2003-04-09	5	3	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A6JNT4GGRGIF3	Ralph Kramden	Why do people love this movie?  Because it is about a guy who, despite being absolutely clueless about all of the history of our country for the past 40 years, manages to sail through all of that history with the aid of a few simple homilies.  I guess people find it very comforting to know that they don't really have to try to understand the complexities of the world around them, because everything will turn out ok anyway.This movie made me absolutely squirm in my seat when I saw it in the theatre.  I found it completely excruciating.But people love it.  I gues that is why this country just re-elected Forrest Gump, I mean George Bush, as President.  And because people think they are voting for simple moral values, and don't really want to understand what is going on, their social security is going to get privatized, their health care is being taken away, interest rates are going up, the dollar is going down, the land is getting raped, the rich are getting richer, and everyone else is getting screwed.  Wake up, people!  This is a dangerous movie.  It is meant to make you complacent while the forces of evil take over.  Stay away!	1.0	Why is this movie so popular?	2004-12-04	87	28	59

I saw this film as a poor excuse to make fun the handicap, having a Father that's handicap, I really didn't find much about this film to my liking. First you've got Jenny who sheilds Forrest in the beginning, shuns him through most of the picture then after realizing she's got A) no where else to turn B) that she's dying, she returns to him. his friend Bubba is slow just like him, what a crazy Idea?

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2HJB9J5O5CLPB	R. A Rubin	"This film is a denunciation of generational excess.  The film spotlights some of the traumatic disasters and cultural phenomenon, the curious history of the 60's and 70""s, a watershed for boomer youth; God help us; it has marked us all.I guess if your top button is buttoned and your pants are hitched up, and if your hair is cut severely, then you have the Tom Hanks look for a Southern fellow that's mentally deficient, though he can run fast enough.  I agree with other reviewers, it's a Tom Hanks career highlight.  He is the good-hearted bumpkin that bumbles his way with honor.  The plot juxtapositions Hanks solid, folksy morals versus raw evil or angry ambiguity.  He knows there is his mother and there is a God.  That is powerful life-fulfilling fuel.In contrast, Forrest's childhood friend Jenny is lost.  Robin Wright plays the sexually abused cracker's daughter.  She's plenty smart and is perceptive enough to realize that Gump is a sweet friend, loyal.  However, she's on the run most of her life, drugs and 60's rock and roll and then LA and disco coke parties.  Naturally, after each of her prodigal returns to Forrest, she loves him physically, but she cannot love spiritually.  She does not find peace till she exorcises her lifestyle demons, seeking comfort in Forrest's arms; then there's the bittersweet finale.To booster my theory, Gary Sinese as Gump's Vietnam Lt, loses his legs in battle.  Gump wins the Medal of Honor by saving his platoon and Sinese too.  Lt. Dan is from a military family and is bitter that he has lost his legs rather than dying heroically.  Again and again, Sinese's post-Vietnam life is in turmoil as he is flabbergasted by Gump's successes.  The good Lt.is bitter in his cups.  Later in the shrimp boat storm scene, Sinese finds the Secular Hollywood God; literally he is baptized.  (Does Sinese really have legs or not.  Amazing special effect or they used an actor with stumps.  Ya got me?)Yes, there is a religious message:we are ruled by destiny and we float in the air like a feather simultaneously,an obvious Christian message that is never spoken as the PC crowd grapples with eternity."	5.0	Very Sly, but PC God at Work	2005-12-18	6	4	2

The storyline is great, with lots of period historical connections that are funny and poignant.

Forrest Gump covers topics that in most cases would make parents uncomfortable to discuss with their children, approachable.  You will find that the movie covers topics such as judging people, sacrifices parents make for their kids, war, discrimination, determination, following through with a promise, donating to a good cause, and above all unconditional love.Next time you watch it, keep all of that in mind and you will see the movie in a whole different light.	5.0	Don't run from Forrest!	2013-10-30	1	1	0

Quite simply we begin with Hanks. From start to finish hanks is gump, every move every emotion ever distant look hanks is gump. He makes you laugh and cry and he does it all without breaking a sweat, some my call him a `natural' I think I will label him officially a God.The music in this film deserves a paragraph all on its own, its perfect, the soundtrack combines classic tunes with original orchestral masterpieces that, have you weeping before the film begins (once you've seen the film once). The music in many ways is the continual strand of the film, the backbone on wish Gump and jenny flesh out with various shrimp meals!!Every character was focused and played a part in the complete story, they were realistic and believable but also representative of every guy who never forgot his sweetheart. Gump being somewhat simple aloud the character to show emotions rather than thoughts. Making him honest and loveable creates a vital empathy, the audience connects directly with the thoughts of this childlike man, worrying about him and wishing him the best from start to finish.I will buy this DVD the day it is released and I will take time to study every special feature because this is a movie which, though its quality, deserves attention. Hanks entered a new time in his career after his wonderful performance in this movie, a turning point for such an influential member of Hollywood is surely a turning point for Hollywood?	5.0	With this DVD you know what your 'gonna get'	2001-05-24	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A29USREMPRFAEJ	Rj	Forrest Gump is one of my favorite films; it was a surprising film to me when I first saw the genre of its kind in the theater. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Forrest and only one time do you see him break in character. Robin Wright (Jenny) displays a tragic rendition of a woman who has been molested and abused. Forrest and Jenny are the light and darkness of American society and represent children whom are really fatherless and without privilege. Gary Sinese does a wonderful job as Lt. Dan and represents hope and peace that can occur after one act of courage. And the tragedy of Bubba played by Mykelti Williams is unspoken.	5.0	No Senator's Son	2011-12-19	2	1	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AMKZHBOK7VMQR	R. J. Marsella	Forrest Gump is an absolutely brilliant film that captures the 60's and the early 70's in the same way that Frank Capra's wonderful film did for the WWII generation.Seeing events through the eyes of a simple man like Gump allows the film to explore the entire social revolution, vietnam war, race relations and everything that made the 60's so volatile without being judgemental or preachy.Ultimately Gump though simple remains grounded in his values and his worldview that he largely got from basic moral teachings his mother gave him while the world around him goes more than a bit crazy.Forrest Gump is just a great film and the acting of Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Sally Fields and others couldn't be better.

The movie chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted Alabama man who has been present during significant historic events in the 20th century. In his life, Forrest Gump has been an All-American football star, a Vietnam War hero, a champion Ping-Pong player, a successful fishing tycoon and an inspiration for a whole generation. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkably uplifting smash hit that ranks as one of the best films of the 1990s. Tom Hanks delivers his most entertaining acting performance. ""Forrest Gump"" features an unforgettable story, great special effects and terrific performances by Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field. The 142-minute blockbuster opened with overwhelming positive reviews, grossed over $650 million worldwide and earned six Academy Award wins including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.""Forrest Gump"" Collector's Edition is an absolute must-have for any DVD collection. The 1994 blockbuster is presented is its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-Disc DVD contains an enjoyably well-defined video transfer and an excellent 5.1 Dolby digital sound.

This movie really moves you inside. It makes you think about your life and the people that you effect. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1994. There was not a dry eye in the movie theater. I still get all misty eye when Jenny passes away and Forrest is standing in front of grave site and he speaks to her about when she died and how little Forrest is doing and how much he misses her so much. Why don't they make movies like this anymore. I also found it rather impressive to see how they placed Hanks in with the past presidents when he would visit the White House. He met Kennedy, LBJ and Nixon. I'm watching this movie again and it never gets old. I highly recommend this movie to someone who has not seen this movie.	5.0	The number 1 film of all time!	2009-12-04	4	2	2

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1DCS4ZXYTBYX6	Robert Hawkes	"Even Roger Ebert (a smart critic even when you don't agree with him) is taken in by this ... visual and emotional trickery. But then he also describes Kevin Costner as ""an intelligent actor"".Luckily, this film reaches the apex of its tastelessness early on, when Forrest's disingenuous voice-over narration accompanies actual footage of George Wallace getting gunned down. At least the producers avoid (though only just) treating us to the same for the Kennedy brothers. Presumably George Wallace, as a redneck, doesn't deserve the privacy accorded to Boston bluebloods.The film constantly pokes fun at people and institutions - Black Panthers, hippies, drug addicts, the mentally retarded, the Army, war, the Presidency, and so on - without staying anywhere long enough to develop any redeeming satirical bite; staying just long enough to get the ... laugh and move on. Hanks is a great technician, as are his helpers, who cannot resist, for example, yet another chance to do the blue-screen trick with Gary Sinise's legs. And so far from ""rubbing my eyes at the realism"" of the anti-war rally scene (as Ebert says), by this time all I could say was ""another damn trick"". But that's what American movie-making is mostly about these days: one-liners and digital tricks.Add to this dish a ... layer of bare-facedly ... sentimentality, and you have ""Forrest Gump""  - a cinematic and emotional Bill of Goods."	1.0	Dishonest is as dishonest does.	2003-01-28	50	13	37

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"What's there not to like about this film? It seems to have everything: crisp direction, outstanding acting, a compelling narrative, life lessons worthy of affirmation, highly innovative special effects, and a soundtrack whose CD continues to be a bestseller. It received and deserved five Academy Awards and could have received others as well. Of special interest to me is director Robert Zemeckis and his crew's brilliant integration of material from Winston Groom's novel with historical material in the 1960s and 1970s. I am not referring to Sonny Shroyer as Paul (""Bear"") Bryant or Peter Dobson as a young Elvis Presley; rather, to the inclusion of footage of John F. Kennedy and George W. Wallace in scenes in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) appears. What is fact? What is fiction? Who cares?Another question: ""Where's Forrest?"" At various points in his life, he is outrunning childhood tormentors on bicycles, scoring touchdowns for the University of Alabama, attending a White House reception, proving himself worthy of a Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in Viet Nam, attending a major peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial, launching what becomes a highly profitable shrimp company named in honor of a Viet Nam comrade, defeating international ping pong champions, creating a ""smiley face"" which makes another person wealthy, jogging thousands of miles throughout the United States, re-settling in his family home, reuniting with a young son he did not know he had, marrying his beloved Jenny....Some people have told me they think this film is ""corny"" and that Forrest is ""dumb."" If ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" what he accomplishes suggests otherwise.  However, who he is as a person is far more important to me. I admire Forrest because he is a thoroughly decent man whose wisdom cannot be measured by I.Q. tests or net worth. I would be proud to have him as a son or son-in-law, as the father of my grandchildren, and as a next-door neighbor. Who wouldn't?FYI: The special features which supplement the DVD version of this film are among the most informative I have examined thus far. Why is that not also true of so many other great films?

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	Forrest Gump is a tale of America's culture from the 50s through almost the present day, and it is brilliantly done.  Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is quite simply flawless as an idiot savant who comes into contact with most of the significant events and people of his day. I have always liked Hanks as an actor, and here he puts in an unusual and yes, a brilliant performance.But the real star of the movie is America of the 50s through the early 80s.  The portion of the film that dealt with the Vietnam conflict was unforgettable, as we see large numbers of ordinary American boys swept into a conflict that they little understood.  Gary Sinise puts in a very creditable performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's platoon leader in Vietnam for whom the war is a personal tragedy.The film hilariously shows Forrest Gump navigate through many of the key events in history during the periods.  He meets Elvis and influences his style.  He meets President Kennedy. He has a ringside seat in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He is caught up in the Vietnam War.  He meets President Nixon and inadvertantly triggers the Watergate scandal (this part is really a hoot).  The film's portrayal of the hippies and radicals of the 60s is particularly funny and in fact rings true.This is a film that almost everyone will like, and which will touch even the most hard-boiled viewer.  The DVD is a terrific value, and most viewers will enjoy watching this one many times.	5.0	Impossible not to like!  Hanks is brilliant.	2005-05-05	25	21	4

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ADOUJ7L6CSU07	Roy Ho	Forrest Gump is one of the best film of all time. Definitely the best Zemeckis's work so far and he has put so much soul and depth to this 1994 Academy Award winning Best Picture. This movie portrays the life of a slow-witted character who gets embroiled in various ridiculous situations. He was a Vietnam war hero, received a congressional medal of honour, shook hands with many US Presidents and was a successful owner of a shrimp company. We get to see many world events through the eyes of a supposedly &quot;dumb&quot; character. The flow and pace of the movie was perfect as we ride through various historical events like the Vietnam War, assasination of JFK and the Watergate Scandal.  Tom Hanks gave an undeniably wonderful performance as Forrest and truly deserves the Oscar that he earned. Gary Sinise gave a superb performance as Lieutenant Dan in the movie. Even though he was only nominated and did not win anything, I felt he really deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The scene where he pulled Forrest down from the bed and cursed him for saving his life, just simply blew me away. Sally Field is also wonderful as Forrest's mother and deserves the Oscar as well. The line &quot;Forrest, you have to do your best what God has given you. Be brave Forrest, be brave in everything you do. Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get.&quot; really moved me and brought me tears. No movie had bring such emotion in me. Robin Wright did her role well as Forrest's love interest and complements well to Forrest's life. The actors truly brings the characters to life and I must salute Zemeckis for choosing the perfect cast.  The technical aspect of the film is just excellent. The visual effects is unlike anything we have seen before. Many movies have not fully utilised the CGI effects to complement it. Nowadays, filmmakers just want to show what special effects they can do rather than what the special effects can do for the film. In Forrest Gump, visual effects are utilised to their best to create unbelievable scenes. Scenes like the flying feather, Lieutenant Dans' missing legs, Vietnam War, meeting of the president is just incredible. This is what visual effects is all about. To create impossible scenes to the big screen.  Alan Silvestri's film score is one of the best scores I have ever heard. From the touching piano piece at the beginning feather scene to the uplifting tune of Forrest hugging Jenny at the Washington square scene, Alan's award-winning score truly brings the perfect mood and emotion to the film.  Every aspect of this movie is simply excellent from the eye-popping special effects, film editing, wonderful score, sound, to the theme of the movie. This movie makes us realised that we all have a purpose in life and that we all have the ability to do the impossible. Forrest Gump tells us that we all should have strong principles and beliefs to succeed in life. Forrest only believes in 3 person. He believes in God, his momma and Jenny. Nothing can go past them.  Just look at what Forrest has achieved. He is the President of a shrimp company, a war hero, a Ping-Pong champion, and a happy father. Forrest Gump simply tells us that we can achieve anything in life as long as we put our best effort and believe in everything that we do.  Forrest Gump is no doubt one the best films I have ever seen. It changes my perception of life and makes me realised that we all have a purpose in this world. We probably won't be seeing anything like this forever. A true masterpiece.	5.0	A movie you don't get to see nowdays.	2001-06-05	82	73	9

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3081Z4P774YR4	"""rsmon77"""	A movie like &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; can easily be misinpereted or over-examined to death, despite the fact it has an obviously simple story behind it: a man (with a 75 I.Q., played by Tom Hanks) drifts through rather turbulent times (from the 1950's to early 1980's), and tries to find a purpose in the world. There is the story of &quot;Gump&quot; in a nutshell. There's no great hidden politicial or sociological agenda in the story, outside of the obvious fact that life needs to be experienced, not mourned over (not a good thing to hear for a mild cynic like me). This is one of those films that was a surprise to see in my teenage years (like &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, both equally good films) and despite the criticism of &quot;Gump&quot; (and believe me when I say I've heard just about all of them and then some), I have only this piece of advice: lighten up, will you?  The DVD itself has some interesting stuff, such as several mini-documentaries of the making of the film (including two sequences that were never completed), commentary with the filmmakers, and more.  It's a movie that a somewhat cynical man like myself isn't afraid to admit he has in his film library.	4.0	&quot;For no particular reason...&quot;	2001-09-02	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AMJPFNUKED92B	"R. T. Meisenholder ""Romanticist Philosopher"""	This is my favorite movie of any that I have seen in my twenty years. This movie is a hilarious, emotional, dramatic, and capturing tale of a man with a simple Anti-Socratic philosophy of life. He does nothing more than what  he is told to do. Soon enough he runs his way into a great deal of  excitement as well as danger. This is a movie I thought would be an  incredibly frivolous waste of time when I saw advertisements on television.  A dullard that accomplishes so much and is strategically placed at many  major events of the last thirty years seemed like a lousy idea. I was  pleasantly surprised when I placed my buttocks upon my seat in the theatre.  The score made me feel part of this movie from the start. The young actor  and actress playing Forest and Jenny started the film off great. The  narration by Tom Hanks worked great from the start as well. Gary Senise and  Robin Wright Penn were very moving as Lt. Dan and the adult Jenny and Bubba  was a great character too. The comedic use of the old cut scenes with the  presidents and such were fabulously done technically and worked well as  comic relief. They were designed to merely poke fun at those times. In a  realistic sense they don't affect the real story that much at all. The real  tale of Forest Gump is the romance between Forest Gump and his childhood  sweetheart Jenny. Robert Zemekis pushes all the right buttons when it comes  to this aspect of the movie. I ended up feeling sad for both Forest and  Jenny. The theme is truly a moving one. Forest's shortsightedness is his  greatest strength as well as his greatest weakness. Jenny could have been  saved if Forest had a greater understanding of the situations she was  putting herself in and how she was hurting herself. His inability to do  anymore than what he is told prevents him from getting the one thing he  wanted, Jenny. He becomes rich, a war hero, a famous athlete, and a good  citizen capable of providing in his community. In the end he winds up with  nothing but a child played by Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense.  Perhaps this child is Forest's chance to help his son avoid the mistakes he  made. Little Forest has the intellect that the older Forest is lacking.  Just as in the beginning the feather flaps in the wind. Forest learns that  destiny is both predetermined and changeable. I couldn't ask for more.	5.0	An Iceberg With A Deep Emotional Message Underneath	2000-05-03	3	2	1

Forrest, through time and predicament, chances across many famous people, but what remains the most endearing are the regular people whose lives Forrest has touched: his mother, Jenny, Bubba, and of course, Lieutenant Dan. People are shown in the most miserable of circumstances, overcoming the greatest of obstacles.Not much more can be added to what has already been written about FORREST GUMP. It's a love story, it's a history lesson. It's about war, it's about tranquility. Everything combines in a congruent two-hour moment worth many repeated viewings.	5.0	My Favorite Movie--Ever	2013-10-11	2	2	0

Tom Hanks is outstanding as Forest Gump, and every sapporting actor was perfect for the role.  This movie has so many memorable lines in it, its almost insane.  This movie is almost a modern day Rocky, in which it shows what one man could do with his life, and what we should do with our lives.  Easily deserved every reward it got.	5.0	THE BEST FILM EVER MADE	2004-07-11	4	1	3
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AEGR40GALMDJ4	Ryne Williams	Forrest Gump, to me, is one of the greatest movies of all time.  You get involved with a simple minded man, and see everything through him.  After seeing this movie, you almost feel like you know Forrest Gump.  You don't even expect the film to move you that much, but it does, and it takes you by complete surprise.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest American actors, and personally I do not think that any one else could've even come close to playing that role.  All the suporting cast was vibrant and interesting.  The movie all around is a classic that will never be forgotten.	5.0	A Touching and Inspiring Motion Picture	2004-04-28	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2FA18B50XGXJX	Sam Damon Jr.	One of the greatest movies of all time. In the top 3. JFK, Its a Wonderful Life, Forrest Gump. We need to ask ourselves what can a film do? The most a  film can do is change our lives forever, and Forrest Gump does  that.AHHHHHH! People reading your reviews is painful. Please realize  what you are seeing!Forrest Gump is a METAPHOR, a parable of America.Why do you think he journey's through the late 20th century? Its not an  accident. Gump is a message to us, that if we stick to our MORAL COMPASS,  we could even be retarded and things will work out. We don't know this.  Jenny represents us--America who does not stay true to her moral compass  and she flounders, yet time and time again Gump, the living embodiment of a  moral compass comes to rescue her. The point of Gump's dim-wittedness is to  contrast more clearly that the thing that brings him success is his  goodness. This is something we evidently have forgotten all about in  America and we need to be reminded.We begin with Forrest as a boy who  falls in love with a girl who stands by him against some bullies. When we  find that she is being abused by her father and she asks that she wished  she were a bird to fly away and Forrest prays for her, with God arranging  for her to be rescued by a relative taking custody, most human beings would  be moved to tears at this point. The prayers of the simple and pure of  heart are answered. This theme of Jenny wishing she could fly away  continues throughout the film. She can't fly but she does teach Forrest to  run, and run he does. With his pure heart, he goes far, to the crimson Tide  football campus, to Vietnam, to Red China, to a shrimp boat...As the  years go by, anchored by Forrest being involved with every event, Jenny  goes astray and Forrest tries to rescue her. The scene where he decks the  militant boyfriend who slapped her shows that he is not some weakling, but  a U.S. Army Soldier who loves his woman as much as he loves his country!The relationship of Forrest with Lt. Dan is beautiful as despite all the  bitterness and rage the latter feels towards life, Forrest reminds him,  &quot;You are still Lt. Dan&quot;. And this is the central thing, its the  fact that we are each unique and ourselves that makes us worthwhile, not  any act or achievement. Forrest achieves mightily but he knows that his  value is that he is himself and he only wishes to be with his Jenny. True  love gives and doesn't expect to be returned. If we had more people with  half their intellects and replaced that with half of Forrest's heart we  would be in great shape today.That is the message of Forrest Gump---the  feather is having the right attitude to always be able to fly no matter  where the wind takes you, to keep your humanity and do what is right no  matter what.The sad ending reminds us that we have to intervene and  protect people early, and to cherish the ones we love today before its too  late. O, I wished the Jenny at the end of the film was that way earlier on,  sensible, beautiful, competent, why did she have to go through so many hard  knocks in life to get there. Maybe some of the women watching the film will  see her journey and arrive at that point a womanhood sooner with happier  endings. To men, I say be selfless like Forrest is and devote your lives to  others as a protector and have a moral compass.A great film, my review  above does not do it justice.	5.0	Realize the film's true message: have a moral compass	2000-08-20	22	17	5

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2ME1PP7HBNBCM	Sam Rose	From the naive childhood to the hippie years following the Vietnam war, Forrest Gump displays life from the late 40`s to the early 80`s,from Elvis to Nixon passing by John Lennon and JFK.One of the weird points is that his  mother runs a B&amp;B, and Elvis sleeps there, and Forrest  teaches him to  dance.In the Vietnam War, he saves all his friends.His friend told him that  after the war, he would go in the shrimping business, but he dies in the  war, so Forrest goes into it himself.I`d write more, but I won`t give all  the story.Great movie!	5.0	Striking!	1999-11-27	5	2	3

Great moments in history are caught when Forrest just happens to be there and he's a part of it by accident. Like seeing lights that are bothering him while staying at the Watergate Hotel, lol.

He just follows his nose, and things happen. Maybe if more people did this, they might enjoy what they have in life, and get more out of the precious moments we have in life.Without a doubt, this film is superbly entertaining. If you have a good script, and a Great cast, then all you need is a Zemeckis to create visually good material, and masterful special  effects  to back it all up.The end result is that a very moving, dramatic, funny, and ultimately emotional film will result.if you find something deep and meaningful in this film, then good for you, and if you find something else in this film, I would question why you would watch a film; at its heart, this film is superbly crafted. It cannot but be with the people who created this work.The imposed meanings that some reviewers assert tell more about the reviewers than they do about the film.Highly recommended as great entertainment."	5.0	99% of Life Is just  Showing up ...	2005-03-04	6	5	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2B49RM8CGAILU	"""schnits75"""	The great quality about Drama is that it tends to incorporate all other genres of film (i.e. comedy, romance, action/adventure, etc).  Forrest Gump does this seemlessly, drawing upon simple humor, heroic heart, romance, as well as being able to tie in many different phases of life in which we all must pass through.  Phases like a first love, a first day at school, and death.  Forrest Gump maintains itself as a timepiece, or marker, showing all the turbulence of he 60s and 70s through his eyes, which remain innocent even as he ages and lives through war and heart ache.  That innocence is what helps draw the audience in and captures each and everyone's heart. I have yet to meet anyone with a negetive word to say about this film.  If everyone carried a piece of Forrest in them, the world would bea much better place.	5.0	Forrest Gumpt, The Epitome of Drama	2001-06-16	3	1	2

It is a magical mystery tour through the formative times of the baby boom generation, with a simple and guileless man as our guide. Forrest Gump is like the literary character created by Richard Powell, whose ""strength is as the strength of ten because his heart is pure"". The world around him spins like a top, slowly wobbling until it falls, and through it all Forrest's simple character acts like a rudder in the water. He steers us through exciting and troubled times, from the rise of Elvis to the fall of Vietnam, the cynicism of Watergate and the nasty hangovers from free love that wasn't so free and one too many trips on the Marrakesh Express. The movie deftly captures this space in time with the perfect blend of music (that just slaps you in the head with its freshness and lack of premeditation) and images that are culled from the back pages of your mind. It skips like a stone across the hopes and dreams of a once idealistic generation that were launched like a rocket into space, only to suffer a fiery reentry as it all came crashing back to earth. What a ride. We lost our innocence, but Forrest did not lose his. We lost our heroes, but Forrest shows us true heroism with his own simple example. We lost our way, but we can find it again. This movie is not to be missed."	5.0	Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you	2001-05-25	6	6	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3CCK3ET7DWI6L	Scott Kennedy	"Critical praise or damnation aside, Forrest Gump, simply, should be seen by all people who really love ""Hollywood"" films.  What do I mean?  Well, Hollywood has a knack for making empty films that say nothing and mean nothing.  However, every so often, they get it right AND the films wins Best Picture.I can think of only two other Best Picture examples that compare to Forrest Gump in their appeal, their scope, their grandeur, their humor, their characters, and their place in Hollywood...Gone With The Wind and All About Eve.  Why?Because each focused on a central character whose existence both set and altered the course of all those they encountered.  I am no true fan of the very one-note Tom Hanks, but, his face is one of the sweetest images ever captured on film as Forrest Gump.  It is remarkable, truly.The supporting cast is no less than perfect, however, the best supporting act in this film has been largely overlooked.  Alan Silvestri's score.  Listen to his suite as it appears on the double cd soundtrack.  Magnificent.  I defy anyone to listen to that on loud, and not be moved or inspired.  In fact, the Academy, finally understanding the importance of music and that comedy films and dramatic films cannot possibly compete against each other, divided the Original Score category the following year.  However, it was one year too late, as Forrest Gump's score lost to the bland and generic Lion King score.If you have seen Forrest Gump and loved it, you already know what I mean.  If you haven't seen Forrest Gump, you must only see it on DVD or Letterboxed VHS.  YOU CANNOT SEE A CROPPED VERSION!

While this dvd will not be gracing my shelves, I am forced to admit that this was a remarkably put-together piece of entertainment. It kept my interest from beginning to end, with plenty of laughs, surprises, and excitement. Note, however, that this is the ClearPlay review. The cleaned up version takes out the nudity, the violence, and the profanity which would otherwise have seen this film in the garbage, if I had seen it. Happily, I did not, and as usual, the film is much better without this stuff. Even still, there are quite a lot of themes inappropriate for children (or adults for that matter). This film does not paint a pretty picture of the past few decades, which is perhaps why many people don't like it. Personally, I think it was just brutally honest. Being told from the perspective of a ""slow"" person gives the filmmakers that liberty of telling the story with a child's simplicity and honesty. The truth is, life wasn't good then, and it isn't any better now, 17 years after the making. But this is not a film meant to depress. The comedy succeeds thanks to Tom Hanks believable acting. Does he act accurately as someone who is ""slow""? Probably not, but that wasn't the point. This isn't a treatise on a medical condition. The film bravely tackles almost every key issue of the times, leaving the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions, and thus is not ""mindless"" as some have accused it of being. This is an engaging, entertaining, enlightening film, and if you have ClearPlay, I highly recommend it. If you don't . . . well, that's why I only give it four stars instead of five.

He has taken a serious and debilitating human condition and turned it into a cheap and tawdry satire.  He has created the  impression that people with this disability can achieve a level of  functioning that is, through no fault of their own, impossible, and further  eroded tolerance for these people by creating the impression that they do  not achieve these impossible goals simply because they have no ambition or  willingness to do so.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ALC4MDU8TH31X	"""showbiz911"""	"I know that some people may say that a movie based on the life of an ""idiot"" is of little interest to people and does not deserve someone's time.  Well, Forrest Gump has done nothing but shut those people up.  Tom Hanks stars as a slow-witted Southerner named Forrest Gump.  The film shows about 30 years of his life and our nation's life.  Forrest always manages to be around when something big is going on in America whether it be Vietnam or the Watergate Scandal.Forrest starts out as child living with his single mother(Sally Field) in the South.  Forrest's only friend besides his mother is a young girl named Jenny who turns out to be the love of Forrest's life.  Early in life Forrest needs leg braces for his crooked legs which starts up the comedy in the film.  He then grows up to play football and turns out to be an All-American.  He then joins the army and meets his best friend and shrimp fanatic Bubba.  They go to Vietnam together where Forrest is struck with his first of many hard blows.  He also meets his future friend Lt. Dan(Gary Sinsie) in Vietnam.  While in the war Forrest is shot in the ""buttox"" and is hospitalized.  It is in the hospital that Forrest realizes he is exceptionally skilled in the sport if ping-pong.  After the war Forrest joins the national Ping-Pong team.  Forrest then buys a shrimping boat and begins working alone.  He is later joined by war vet/friend Lt. Dan.  The two end up getting rich off of the business.  Forrest then returns home where his mother is sick and decides to mow lawns.  Jenny later revisits Forrest  and the two live together for a while.  She later leaves him and this is when Forrest begins his 3-year long jogging spree back and fourth across the country.  After his run Forrest gets a letter from Jenny and decides to visit her.  He then learns that Jenny has had his son.  I won't tell you the rest, you'll just have to buy it and watch it for yourself.Forrest Gump is a heart-moving, and humourous movie that the whole family can watch.  I would highly recommend buying the DVD version instead of the VHS version since with the DVD version you get two disks, one containing the movie and the other containing a handful of great extras.  Which ever you decide, you will still be buying one of the best films of the 19th century!"	5.0	Forrest is Brilliant	2002-07-05	11	7	4
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H	SideshowBob	I could never understand why this film was and still is so popular.The story is not even that great.Some slow inbred southerner lives through different eras...while playing college football,going to vietnam,saving his ungrateful lieutentant's life,showing Lyndon Johnson his bullet wounded ass,falling in love with his whorish drug headed hippie girlfriend...blah blah blah. Its just stupid. There are other Tom Hanks films out there,that are so much better,compared to this overhyped big waste of time.PHILADELPHIA,THE GREEN MILE and CASTAWAY...just to name a few.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3FNM6LQ7VEKWH	Sir Bowen	In this movie, the life of a slow-witted Forrest Gump intersects most of the important events of the previous 40 years, even to the point of influencing the course of history.But this is not what the movie is about. It's mainly a story about how having a solid character and a pure heart can carry someone farther than having intelligence. In fact, Forrest gains a certain advantage from his lack of intellect, in that he's more free to react from his heart.Another notable aspect of the movie is the use of visual effects that seem to show Forrest interacting with famous historical figures. Pretty realistic.	5.0	A story about character	2001-08-10	2	1	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AJ9W09EUQPAKE	Sirin	This is the sort of movie that people rush to embrace with unconditional acclaim as it covers big, simple themes - small town underdog comes good, pursues lifelong childhood sweetheart, has an engagingly simple view of complex affairs, wraps up several huge incidents of late 20th Century history in nice bite sized chunks etc...And it is a tearjerker. That is what clinches it for most people. It does all of the above, and is heartwarming as well. So they get this DVD and sit down with loved ones on a Saturday evening with a large bucket of ice cream and let it all wash over.All of this is fine, but I merely wish to use this forum to express my reservations with the central plot. This is a movie that traces the life of one man. We are asked to feel sorry for this man, sympathise with him, love him and root for him all the way to come good in the end. Personally, I never felt this with Forrest. Basically, he accomplishes too much too easily. He is born half crippled but instantaneously shakes off his crutches to run away from bullies, he is an unwitting Vietnam War hero, he inspires John Lennon to write 'Imagine', he meets and charms three US Presidents, he becomes a shrimp millionaire after a storm wipes out the rest of the industry and, yes, he gets the girl in the end. All of this is accomplished with relative ease. Where is the adversity? Why should we care, deep down for this man? It is touched on. There are several sensitive moments during the movie, such as when Forrest crumbles into tears on discovering that he has an illegitimate son. But these need to be developed far more fully to turn him into a developed hero. As the movie stands, he is more annoying than heroic. Imagine a kid at school who has no apparent ability but sails through life achieving almost anything. Is that a great story? No, it's a tremendously baffling annoyance.There are heroes in the story, but they are the supporting characters to Forrest rather than Forrest himself. Gary Sinise as the legless Vietnam veteran is pretty funny as he goes through various stages of denial and alcoholism before coming to terms with his condition. And Jenny, his sweetheart suffers the tribulations of the last decades of the 20th Century far more realistically than Forrest. She does not sail through every problem but suffers emotionally and physically from the batterings that life throws at her.I am all for huge sentimental, zeitgeist type movies that tell a heartwarming story of a young man who comes good in the end. But I want to care for the character and root for him to the ends of the earth. I just couldn't do this with Forrest.	2.0	Forrest - a hero? Please	2004-11-17	27	14	13
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ACSC760OU29DQ	Sis	When my stepfather first urged me to watch Forrest Gump, I was critical. Over three hours of a stupid guy's ramblings on the world? Please.But then I actually did watch it, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Forrest Gump tells the story of an Alabama man born with a low IQ. The story begins with him sitting on a bench, trying to strike up a conversation with the woman next to him. At first she isn't interested, but as Forrest's story goes on, you can't help but be drawn in and before long there are more people on the bench, missing their buses so that they can keep listening.Forrest has been everywhere, from war to to Ping Pong tournaments, and met a cast of people along the way, the most important being his long-time love, Jenny. Forrest is dense and clumsy, with braces on his legs and a mother that would do anything for him and won't hear a word against him. Jenny is beautiful and smart, with a father that abuses her. They're best friends.When they grow up they go seperate ways, but Forrest never forgets her, and they run into each other at differnet points of their lives. Forrest's story is told in a great way- Forrest himself is dull, but you have to be sharp to catch all the references in it, from Nike campaigns to the impeachment of Nixxon.When the flashbacks end and Forrest is back on the bench, he finishes the rest of his story from there. It's sweet and sad and truly moving. Even though Forrest is not especially bright, there is plenty of wisdom in all that he does. As he says, he's not a smart man, but he knows what love is.	5.0	Life Is Like A Box of Chocolates....	2006-07-18	6	6	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1P2XB9U35BJQX	"""sixtymilesmile"""	As with many of my other favourite films (Truman Show, Trainspotting etc) this one is great due to the meaning and depth involved. At the start Forrest is a boy who is 'simple' yet by the end of the film he has led an extraordinary life, including inspiring Elvis' dances, seeing the first wave of coloured student at his college, won the College Bowl single-handedly, fought in Vietman, ran a shrimping company in honour of his best friend, and produced a bright and happy son. Throughout these events, most of which go over his head, we see the way different people interact in America, and how if you stay true to your beliefs and your dreams, but don't let adversity take you down, you can achieve anything. It is certainly funny in places as well, especially little comments in the narrative like Forrest's childlike innocent reference to Jenny being abused, completely not understanding it. The way he chases after Jenny like a lovesick schoolboy is touching. This is a legendary piece of cinema.	5.0	Moving and thought-provoking	2001-02-11	1	0	1

It is a movie entrenched with multiple human emotions and themes:  compassion, empathy, happiness, sadness and hilarion wrapped in a blanket of human dignity.  As a slightly over twenty-year-old movie, the plot of human conditions the movie portrays never age, which speaks to the movie's endeavor to send a powerful message of tolerance and acceptance.  As viewers watch Forrest grow from an awkward &#34;mama's boy&#34; to a confident, somewhat simple, but courageous man, viewers understand regardless of where one begins in life, it is where one ends that matters.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2U6BT86L5GFIV	"Sokste ""KtS"""	I just intellectually could not suspend all that would be required in order to enjoy this. The basic motif of inserting Gump into all these actual events annoyed me. And then seeing it take place over and over just exacerbated my annoyance greatly. Few movies as nice as this one bothered me as much as this one.So, to go from the subjective to the objective, I'd like to suggest that this doesn't have *universal* appeal. It is a very distinctive movie, with a unique structure and content. And if it *is* your cup of tea, great. But if as you're reading about it, a little voice inside is getting annoyed, listen to that voice. For some of us, it just doesn't get us there.	3.0	Being a baby-boomer, this film riled me like no other	2003-06-10	14	5	9

I have tried to figure out why I love it so much - and really it's the whole package. I love it's humor, the acting, the dialogue, the unique attractiveness of the main characters. I really believe Tom Hanks can do just about anything. He was amazing in this role. The thing I love the most about this movie was his sincere love for his childhood friend. In fact, I think sincerity describes this movie totally. It's about truth, honesty and love. A sort of surreal/drama/comedy - it always uplifts me and makes me feel good.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3W3W36JJEL14L	"Spider ""Boy"""	I would have given it 5 STARS, but because Hanks is out of character several times, especially when he cries at the end. Gump would not cry or have those emotions towards his son. The whole film he played Gump as a naive unaware oblivious person, but then all of a sudden they went for the melodramatic moment at the end, which was simply not needed. He also overplays the part sometimes and lacks believability. Watch it a few times and you will see what I'm talking about.I give it only 4 STARS and most of those go to Zemeckis for his direction of a film that really takes you in some many directions, and work each time.YES, you have to be an idiot not to know its PURE HOLLYWOOD, but so what? It works!  People that criticize Hollywood films like this most simply do it to be rebellious. You can admit you like these types of films, but still love cult, underground, independent, foreign films etc. Nobody cares if you like Forrest Gump. It's a movie of life, death, victory, failure, love, hare, anger etc. and it manages to encompass all of those emotions well. For those who criticize it, go make your movie and see how yours turn out.	4.0	Gumps Rocks But Hanks almost Sucks	2005-09-07	5	2	3

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	Forrest Gump is a mesmerizing and epical movie directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back To The Future), and starring Tom Hanks (Big) as Forrest, Sally Field (Mrs. Doubtfire) as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright Penn (State Of Grace) as Jenny, Gary Sinise (Ransom) as Lt. Dan Taylor, and Mykelti Williamson (Heat) as Bubba.Tom Hanks shines as the dim-witted southern simpleton named Forrest Gump who loves his country, his mother, and his only childhood friend Jenny, and that's about it.The film follows Forrest through an inspiring journey from his childhood in the 50's through his college years and Vietnam in the 60's, to his admirably successful shrimping business venture and settling down with a family which concludes in the early 80's. And throughout this incredible journey, Forrest has no clue how great a person he is and becomes.We get to share history as it unfolds with Forrest through the simple mind of Forrest himself. We get to meet different people who mark a significance in Forrest's life: his Vietnam buddy, an African American simpleton named Bubba, who constantly talks about shrimps and an interest in starting a shrimping business after the war, Forrest's superior officer in the war, Lt. Dan Taylor, who's saved by Forrest against his will and in the process loses both of his legs. On top of all that, we're amazed at how Forrest gets to meet three US presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; and musical icons Elvis Presley and John Lennon, and make history as he becomes a state football champion, a national war hero, and America's ambassador to China as a ping pong player.Forrest Gump will take you along on his thrilling, funny, and sometimes sad trip through his very simple but stunning life, and you will be unable to pull away from it, not even for a minute.Another important feature in the film is the soundtrack which covers each period with the songs that defined the era.RecommendedA	5.0	...a mesmerizing and epical movie	2005-12-31	7	4	3

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A10C5CJK1YKGV0	Steffan Piper	"""I don't remember being born, I don't remember what I got for my first birthday and I don't remember going on my first outdoor picnic ... but I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in whole wide world."" -- Forrest GumpI have to be honest with you and just say that I'm a fool for sentimental movies like this. This is actually one of my all-time favorites. I usually find myself disappearing into this movie during flu season and when I'm confined to the couch for a week suffering in pain. Watching Forrest Gump seems to make things better, sooner.While that might sound corny, and you might be rolling your eyes, I usually feel better every time just watching it. The truth about the success of this movie is that most people identify with it, because unless you're a sycophantic sociopath, there are many times when the majority of us feel inferior, or less than or unable to meet the demands of our life - rendering us a little blue, sad, debilitated ... take your pick. Knowing that there is someone in the world like Forrest, probably gives us the hope that you're going to be alright if you hang on and don't obsess on your flaws. Forrest Gump is a lot of different things to different people. Mostly, it just takes you out of whatever you're in and does a pretty consistent job at making you feel that much better. Even if it's just for a little while.I'll spare you the repetitious information regarding any technical information about the DVD or the cast, as to date there are 543 reviews on this, 397 ""5 star"" and 42 ""1 star"", and 10 pages of posts on IMDb.Another reviewer stated that this was an introspective look into the Baby Boomers generation, and while I've never been a fan of the Baby Boomers per se, as most of the would-be flower children that briefly took up residences in communes, would later switch-off and drift into the largest group of corporate raiders in the history of this nation. Not much of a legacy there. But the character of Forrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey. Forrest Gump is an amalgam of several people, this according to Winston Groom and the reason why so many people identify with it.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	Still do not understand Amazon's policy of not separating reviews of Standard DVDs from downloaded streaming movies from Blu Ray DVDs.  They should all be separated even if it demands more effort and work of the Amazon employees.There is much discussion elsewhere on this film in terms of plot summary, meaning, and value so I won't get into that. My reviews are strictly regarding the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray. I did not have the Standard Def version so this is not a comparison between the two.The video transfer was completely free of any artifacting, stair stepping or aliasing.  The overall image was a touch soft without that hard edged video look typical of many current films.  While there was no noticeable grain, the soft appearance did not interfere with the warm color grading and imaging throughout the film.  While not deserving of video 'DEMO status', the video transfer was quite good.The audio transfer is DTS HD 5.1 and was nicely spread across the front stage.  There is some nice panning to the discreets but not very much through most of the film.  The only time your audio system will come to life, especially your sub channel, is during the wartime explosion scenes.  Even then there is very little use of the discreet rear channels being  used for anything other than general ambience rather than discreet foley fx.  Never the less, the  lossless audio is nicely balanced and dialogue clear.  It should be noted that in  the beginning of the film I had to turn the volume up past where I normally set it for most films.  This tells me that the audio levels during editing were set lower than most and once I  boosted my own audio level, all was fine and dandy.Since I do not have the Standard Def version I can't make a recommendation that this is better than the Standard Def.  However, the Sapphire Series of BluRay DVDs generally boast of greatly improved mastering of a film to Blu Ray so my guess is that making the move from your SD version to this Blu Ray would be a major upgrade, especially so for the video transfer.  This is because soft focus films like this generally produce more noticeable grain in SD than BR.I didn't have time to watch all the extras, and there are a great many, but I did watch the 6 or 7 screen tests which were very enjoyable and charming.  I would rather have more screen tests on discs than those wasteful previews of other movies that we see far too often and cause us to pay for a company's advertisements rather than improved BR imaging.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	4.0	Forrest Gump on Blu Ray-Sapphire Series 2 disc collection	2012-12-19	6	5	1

On the other hand, it's entertaining, funny, and even wise. Somehow looking at the sophisticated world through the eyes of the unsophisticated Forrest Gump makes this story work and offers a refreshing look at things. The funny thing is, it's hard to like Forrest and it's hard to dislike him. That's because ""normal"" people are always caught between wanting more and wanting less. Forrest offers the perspective of someone not trapped in that struggle, in contrast to the struggles of Lt. Dan and Jenny, and shows us how simple love and acceptance can create a life of profound meaning, purpose, and happiness."	5.0	You never know what you're going to get in this movie	2005-10-21	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"Robert Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump"" is a spirited venture that gets off to a dazzling start but is torpedoed by a second half that is mundane and sappy.  Tom Hanks turns in a wonderful performance but neither he nor the impressive technology on display can save the day in the end.Forrest Gump (Hanks) and his mother (Sally Field) lead a modest existence in Greenbow, Alabama.  Forrest is not blessed with a great degree of intelligence but as he gets older, his good-nature and his honesty along with a series of strange twists lead him to fame and glory as a sports star, a war hero, a successful businessman, and a celebrity.  Yet, even with so much going on around him, it is always the wisdom of his mother and his love for Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) that is foremost on his mind.""Forrest Gump"" is best when it follows Forrest in his journey through history.  Watching him partake in some of the most important events of the 20th century and seeing him interact with such real-life figures as George Wallace, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and John Lennon reminds one of just how magical the film medium can be.  However, when ""Forrest Gump"" starts to focus on the Forrest and Jenny love story, it crosses over into routine soap-opera territory.  All of the innovation present in the first half is tossed aside in favor of a clich&eacute;d and routine tale of love and loss.  Hanks, Wright, Field, Gary Sinise, and Mykelti Williamson are great but ""Forrest Gump"" the film proves to be somewhat less than satisfying."	2.0	"""Her dream had come true.

I find it impossible to believe that a person with an IQ of 75 could achieve the things Forrest Gump did and have the wisdom that he was shown to have in this movie.  A much more credible performance about a mentally challenged person is given in the excellent movie: ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""  Leo DiCaprio's portrayal of how a mentally retarded teenager's limitations and antics cause major problems and upheaval for his family should have earned the young actor an Academy Award in my opinion.  Forrest Gump is just a mildly entertaining fantasy.  I can't understand why Forrest Gump would win for best picture.  I was incredulous as I watched this movie, knowing how impossible it would be for someone of his intelligence to achieve the things he supposedly does in this movie, i.e. graduate from H.S., go to college, join the military, etc., etc., etc.  If you want to see a believeable movie about a mentally challenged person and his family, see the movie ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" with Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio."	2.0	Disappointing fantasy	2007-10-20	19	8	11

Not only did it win an Academy Award for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), but also Best Picture, plus three other Academy Awards.  This film starts off in a small southern town, where Forrest grows up.  Next it takes us through three decades of Forrest's life, from the 1950's through the 1980's.  It show's Forrest, who happens to be a really fast runner, as a college football player, a vietnam soldier, a ping pong champ, a shrimp boat captain, and a man in love with his childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright).  Oh and did I forget to mention that it also portrays him as a hippy!  I give this movie five stars because it has managed to include action, love, comedy, a little bit of history, and a whole lot of heart and soul.

But I will do my best to tell you how this movie has affected me. Every one of you has seen this film. The whole world has seen this film. There is nothing I can say to those millions of you who have seen this All I can do, is give you my review.I will not go into detail. You already know every scene, every line. I just really wanted to have my say posted by Amazon.The obligatory `cliff note' is Tom Hanks plays the part of a mentally challenged man whose life interacts unwittingly with persons of fame and politics.  He has no ides of the impact he has in people's lives. and simply sees the world `as it is', and yearns for the love of his life, his Jenny. In fact, everything he does, is driven by his love for Jenny.You will never EVER see a better performance by Gary Sinese, as the physically and severely soul wounded Lt. Dan. EVERYTHING he has done since this movie, is compared to this role. Robin Wright Penn will never have a role as perfect as she had as Jenny, the woman he has loved since childhood, but shuns him repeatedly, in search of her own life. And as to Tom Hanks? Well, he is one of the premier actors of the modern era, and his performance in Forest Gump eclipses even his role in `The Green Mile' (my other favorite film). Hanks so `under-plays' his simple-minded Gump character, to the point of diamond brilliance. In the end, he finally get's his life's desire, and hears the words he waited for his whole life, from Jenny...""I love you"". And then, she is sadly gone. But we get a glimpse of a whole new beginning in his life, with his son (played by Haley Joel Osment).Yeah, I know there is nothing new in this review that really describes the film. My point was, is, watch this movie on DVD as often as you can. Not only will it enthrall you, it may just make you a better person.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1SDPA1J98UP4L	"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf"""	Forrest Gump is a very hard movie to watch since I am an autistic physically disabled black dude who grew up in the racially charged 1960's.  I had always heard so much about Forrest Gump that made me not think it was the kind of movie I'd like watching so I usually avoided it with a passion.  Suddenly this Christmas friends of mine roped in into sitting through Forrest Gump and I was shocked by how much I absolutely loved this movie.The movie is vivid fictionalized but oddly realistic life seen through (disabled kid) Forrest Gump's eyes.  Forrest Gump's perspective on life was weird but strange as he was the movie felt real in the oddest ways I could imagine.  It is true watching life unfold through Forrest Gump's eyes offers a perspective that leaves you altered for the better if you have any heart and soul at all.  I owe this movie a huge appology because for years I just knew in my heart I'd hate Forrest Gump yet I ended up loving that it was so much like my own life experience growing up disabled in the 1960's when you got very little encouragement and help as a special needs kid.I suspect I disliked Forrest Gump because it came way too uncomfortably close to being exactly like my own life growing up disabled labelled the dummy or my neighborhood retard by grown ups and peers alike.  Like Forrest I had family members (grandparents mainly) who loved me and fought hard, long and tirelessly to be sure I had the same opportunities for advancement other kids had.  I saw the park bench scene in the movie trailer and felt it was acted way too simplistically almost as if the movie was poking fun at or making light of the disabled so I never wanted to watch it.  Forrest Gump threatened to reopen many painful memories from my own past growing up disabled and those sores were still sensitive in my heart so why watch it.I am much stronger as a disabled person now than I have ever been before so I let myself be roped into watching Forrest Gump.  I liked and understood myself now so I risked veiwing Forrest Gump this Christmas Eve surrounded by friends.  Anyways this Christmas Eve friends wanted me to see the Forrest Gump DVD after hearing I had still never seen it so I saw the movie from beginning to end.  Watching Forrest Gump was still very painful because, I experienced personally so much of the torment Forrest did going to regular school as a disabled kid in the mid 60's myself.  More than a few times I wanted to leave the movie and just go sit in a corner, retreat into my own autistic world to cry tears of solidarity for Forrest Gump in a place where my heart was my only witness but I did not.  I stayed the course and watched the whole Forrest Gump movie despite my own pains being vigorously stirred. I gave my word to friends I'd watch to all of Forrest Gump and a Wolf without honor is no Wolf at all.Yes Forrest Gump stirred up some real painful experiences in my past but that said the movie answered some real unresolved questions I had leaving me much stronger, secure and prouder as a disabled man for my Forrest Gump experience.  In my eyes a truly good movie uses fiction to teach truth in ways that leaves an audience stronger better and more enlightened and in all these measures Forrest Gump excels so completely as to have no equals in its job of putting 1960's life with disability in honest perspective.  My grandparents used to insist I never see myself as disabled I was expected to do everything the normal folk did and for years I thought my grandparents were cruel almost to the point of being sadistic.  I had started to know my grandparents loved me.  Watching Forrest Gump showed me that expecting your disabled child to make his own way in normal society coping using tools he developed alone was the most difficult way to love a special needs child in the 1960's but it was the only way to encourage success back in those days when ignorant hostile cruelty about disabilities was rampant.I am successful today exactly because my grandparents pushed me forcing me to cope in the world of normal people until I got it right.  In my case it took me 41 years to get it right and it is still a daily struggle to live among normal folk but I do it.  I had hated and avoided watching Forrest Gump for the same reasons I love and highly reccomend buying it from AMAZON.COM now.  The Forrest Gump experience as wacky and off beat as it appears was really how it was to be cognitively and physically disabled in the 1960's.  For a long time Forrest Gump was too real.  Forrest Gump's message hit me way too close to home reminding me of things I'd rather forget and for those very same reasons I most highly recommend that you please buy Forrest Gump on DVD from Amazon.com because the story might be fiction but the 1960's disabled experince it shares is so REAL it can not honestly be deniedtake it from one who lived it!

When I first began buying DVD's, I found, to my horror, that Forrest was not available. Why????, I asked. Now I know. The wait has paid off in a splendid DVD presentation, with extensive extras, all captivating. You want to know how they 'did' Lieutenant Dan's legs (or rather, lack thereof)? Buy Gump DVD and find out! You want to watch the beginning of Haley Joel Osmont's career? Grab Gump DVD, and check out his screen test!Forrest Gump is a movie that transcends both comedy and tragedy.

His simple-minded, but big-hearted approach to life is inspiring like nothing else.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3P7ERFJUWNXVN	The Birdman	This movie is like a spoiled child: everyone involved gave it everything it could ever possibly need or want, and yet still it ends up annoying you enough for you to want to put a pillow over it's face and blame it on cot death.seriously, there is stuff to like in this film. Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise both give good performances(Sinise especially for acting like a Nam weathered loon), the effects are cool, though oddly out of place in a sentimental comedy drama like this, and it does have that hollywood blockbuster polish that is so attractive to us cinematic crows.but something dark lies beneath, and this is the way they have purposely placed a right wing cowardly subtext throughout the entire movie, which delivers a message to all viewers which is just WRONG WRONG WRONG. Witness: Forrest solves his problems, and those of a thousand other people, by RUNNING AWAY VERY QUICKLY.he becomes a good soldier by TELLING THE SARGEANT WHAT HE WANTS TO HEAR.in the entire movie, ONLY THE HIPPIE GETS AIDS and finallyBY BEING INCESSANTLY HAPPY ABOUT EVERY DETAIL OF HIS EXISTENCE,EVERYTHING TURNS OUT ALRIGHT. this is all so unbelievably terrible and bad it serves only to make me hate the Oscars for giving not giving it to Pulp Fiction, which is an infinitely better movie.PS my friend and fellow Horseman El Satanico is right, a man who spends all day at a bus stop telling people unbelievable stories has to be pretty sauced.	2.0	strange bus stop man accosts civilians, wins Oscar.	2004-03-10	18	8	10

On the one hand, he's perfectly likeable in, say, Road To Perdition, oozes charm in, say, Big, but then there are times you could happily run him over with a car. Castaway is a good example, but surely the best example has to be this - 2 and a bit hours of Idiot Does Good. And 2 and a bit hours of the most sentimental, mawkish U-S-A! U-S-A! drivel you'll ever see.Reasons to hate this movie.1. Forrest Gump himself. Tom Hanks thinks playing someone who is mentally slow equals having big wide eyes and, er, well, that's pretty much it. And saying really stupid, but supposed to be cute, things (""my name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump)"".  Ha ha ha, oh how witty. Doesn't he just warm your hearts, ladies and gentlemen? Eh, no.2. The humourous coincidences throughout the movie. One would have been fine, a nice little knowing, ""ahhhh"", but Forrest unknowningly invents so many things (phrases, logo's) you half expect him to get zapped back in time to invent the wheel. It's stupid and corny.3. Pulp Fiction.. that's PULP. FICTION was beaten to the Oscars by THIS syrup-laden, twee ""all is well.. all is well.."" crud-fest.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	"During the 1995 Academy Awards, the critically acclaimed ""Pulp Fiction"" lost to a movie called ""Forrest Gump"" starring the then red-hot Tom Hanks.  I never saw ""Gump"" in the theatres and assumed that it had to be a VERY good movie to rob the envelope-pushing ""Pulp Fiction"" of the Best Picture Oscar.  Because I am such a fair person, I bought the DVD and decided to give the movie a shot before passing judgement.  After the first half-hour I was checking my watch every fifteen minutes.  Aside from the handsome production and Hanks's performance, this was an overall safe, fairly predictable little movie that pushed no boundaries and played by Hollywood's rules of filmmaking.  It was fun to see Hanks evolve in his character, but there was little dramatic thrust and it was even a little sappy.  Don't think I'm totally bashig this film; I just think that it's a tad overrated and didn't deserve Best Picture.  Although parts of ""Pulp Fiction"" were hard to digest, I give it props because it at least dodged the conventions of filmmaking ""Gump"" so readily embraces.  If you're looking for a little crowd-pleaser, then by all means, ""Gump"" will be your cup of tea.  For me, I don't think I'll see this film again or recommend it to anyone else."	3.0	"""Pulp Fiction"" lost to THIS?"	2002-06-25	12	2	10

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2I5O8AEFU1SOK	the_smoking_quill	About once a year, I watch this unique and heartwarming film to experience the sorrow and joy and beauty of life.  And each year, Forrest Gump proves itself abundantly deserving of both its Academy Award for Best Picture and its status as an amazon.com Essential Video.The film chronicles, from boyhood on, the life and times of a mentally slow but good-hearted and physically gifted Southerner.  In doing so, it recreates vibrantly and poignantly the most turbulent decades of change (the 60s and 70s) in twentieth century America.  It is thus the story of a man who remains innocent in the midst of a nation rapidly losing its innocence and, because of his difference, makes a difference.  Ultimately, it is a love story that, both throughout and in its sublime conclusion, dares to address the issue of free will versus predestination.  (And does so more successfully than any film--and perhaps any popular work of art.)Tom Hanks enters an amazing, tour de force performance, actually becoming the slow-witted but faithful Gump.  The tenderly stunning Robin Wright Penn and the perfectly-cast Gary Sinise shine in memorable supporting roles.  The soundtrack--a remarkable combination of original music, period-evoking songs, and haunting silence--is one of the best in recent memory.  And the screenplay--which goes far above and beyond the earthier, lesser book on which the film is 'based'--is simply inspired, a work of magic.I've seen this film several times now, and each time I can only cry at its evocation of life's essence, even as I smile thereafter.  Highly recommended and very much worth owning and sharing.  Five shining stars.	5.0	Simply wonderful	2003-10-09	3	3	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3M7RECGYLXOPA	The Wickerman	I have seen a lot of movies, and among those a lot of great ones (&quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;Face/Off&quot;, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;) but I am very confident in saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  There are just not words to describe its brilliance.  I first saw it at the theater, when it came out.  I was about 11, and it was almost too intense for me.  This movie is very much like a window into real life.  You get a look at pain, torment, racism, war violence, and the very essence of the human spirit.  And, it's all presented in a fairly simple manner, so as not to go over anyone's head.  The characters are all presented in fine form, and the acting is off the charts.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of all time, up there with Robin Williams and Nicolas Cage.  Gary Sinise is up there, too.  I have seen this movie countless times, and it never gets old.  Each viewing is like a thrilling journey, and even though you know where it's going, you can't wait to get there.  You've got comedy, action, drama, this movie transcends genres.  I could probably sit here and praise this movie all day, but that would still not do it justice.  You have to experience it for yourself.  I can't imagine that any other movie will ever come within miles of this.  It is truly a masterpiece of film.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel like going for a run...	5.0	There will never be anything like it...	2001-05-31	6	4	2

Most of the movie is him setting on a bench and telling his life story. About 10 or 20 min. before the end it is going on then and he is not telling a story. This movie really should not be rated PG-13, the only thing is then lauguage and some war violence. This movie is touching, funny, exciting, and sad.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A29G2SMTX9UCZ8	Tim Ford	Winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor, Forrest Gump speaks for itself as one of the best movies. Played by Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is about a man who grows up in the south. He is not the smartest man, but the movie is a view of his life. Robert Zemeckis, the films director, starts the movie off in present day and then shifts the movie to the past. Growing up in the South, Gump faces issues of growing up and witnessing history in many aspects. He feels many things that goes on with growing up including overcoming a disability, going to college, the Vietnam War, meeting many famous people, loosing friends and family, and the issue of drugs and aids. This movie then shifts to present day where he is at a bus stop. From there it turns into a love story with a new meaning. The movie ends with a good feeling and a brief history lesson from the 1950's to then present day 1994, when the movie was released. If we were to compare it to any other movie, it would be placed next to a documentary. This is a documentary with a new spice and flavor to it that I highly recommend. After watching this movie, you have a good feeling and some new sayings from Forrest Gump, who is a family orientated film. This movie is for a person over the age of 16 who can understand the full concept of the movie and the history behind. I give it an A+.	5.0	A man named Forrest	2001-09-22	1	1	0

And then he finally got Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and had a little Forrest. You could tell by a person's shoes what kind of a life they had.

My number one favourite, it follows a mentally challenged man from Alabama in the most crucial decades of the century. What will leave you watching this is Forrest's good heart. He hasn't a clue of the evil in the real world, and lives his life on a gentle breeze. The ending is remarkable! When he is talking at the end under ""He and Jenny's tree"", I can't help but cry. What is also entertaining is how he tells the people he sits with on the bus-stop's bench his life story. A line my mom and I laugh over is when he almost sounds annoyed as he says,"" And I met the President of the United States, again"" and he rolls his eyes. All in all, Forrest Gump is a must see for *almost* all ages-I don't know, I saw it for the first time when I was seven!

Not only did I feel the storyline was ridiculous and extremely far-fetched, I didn't like nor sympathize for the main character, Forrest Gump.  I know that Tom Hanks is very talented and Robert Zemeckis is an accomplished directer, but what were these two thinking.  The only person I can half stand in this movie is Sally Field, who I like and respect as an actress, but even her character wears thin.

Its a story of a simpleton who goes through his life with a sense of determination that seems to blow the minds of most of the people he meets.  His decisions are always pretty clear.  He spends his life doing the right thing and holding true to the first friend and one true love of his life Jenny, who due to a child rearing of molestation and child abuse cracks down and falls to heroin and promiscuous sex.  This movie is a must for any american history buff. Forrest is a part of every major piece of history he experiences in his life.  He is a vietnam war hero, he walks dead on into a landmark of what would become the tear down of segregation, he witnesses the watergate scandal and the aids epidemic.  A simple man who experiences an unbelievably full life.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3VZ4LAHI144EC	"tomato cow ""JSC"""	"The sweetest of love stories, philosophically profound, deep as the ocean and light as a feather... and very funny. Forrest Gump is the ultimate movie in so many ways, there are so many sides to it. It's predominantly a `serious' film about a dim headed, yet good hearted southern boy and how the absence of a dysfunctional ego and a simple sense of honor and integrity enables him to flow through life effortlessly, like the metaphor of the white feather we see at the beginning and the end of the film.Forrest Gump is a masterfully written and directed tale that punctuates deep philosophical substance with a good deal of humor -the scene of Forrest and Bubba scrubbing the floor with toothbrushes while Bubba enlightens Forrest on the details of `shrimping' is just too funny for words. There's never been a film like it before or since. It ingeniously weaves the history of a generation into the script, taking scenes from the Vietnam war, JFK, the 60's protest movement and flower power, and onward into the age of AIDS.  Actual film clippings from various historical events are cleverly edited to enable Forrest to step into them and interact. Wonderful Stuff... it's kind of a nod to the `Wonder Years'.As richly entertaining as Forrest's life is, and as very funny as many of the scenes are, it's still the character of Forrest that carries the move. He's impossible not to like. You become significantly invested in his life. You share his heartbreak as Jenny repeated shuns the open heart he offers her. And you admire his quiet acceptance of 'what is'. His lack of self consciousness - devoid of the myriad games and manipulations that most people of `greater intelligence' display -his simple open heartedness and sense of personal integrity which he carries through life are inspirational. This clearly is a story that shows the ultimate triumph of virtue over the complex dysfunctions of the mind. Jenny plays out a sad character... always looking somewhere else for love, although she finds it on her death bed And Lt. Dan is just an awesome character. His 360 degree turn through what life deals him is as inspirational as Forrest's.The closing scene is the most memorable for me... the feather floats in the random breeze, as Forrest muses about predestination vs random existence: "" I think it's both... both happening at the same time."" - which leads me to believe our beloved Forrest isn't as dumb as he's portrayed."	5.0	Heartwarming, deep and very, very funny.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	In 1994, FORREST GUMP raised a ruckuss for winning 6 Academy Awards, including &quot;Best Picture&quot; - and it deserved each and every one of those awards.  Adapted from Winston Groom's novel, the film tells the tale of mentally retarded Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), who is present at many historic events while chasing after his lifelong love, Jenny (Robin Wright).  The special effects are so absolutely flawless it's as if Gump truly was at those events; it's amazing!  The soundtrack is also awesome, and adds to the atmosphere of the events at which Gump is present.  Hanks is at his best, and gives a truly moving performance; Wright is very good; and Sinise is really excellent.  This is one of the few films where even adults will cry.  The end scene, with Gump and Lt. Dan meeting before Gump's meeting, is a real moving moment.  There is also some lighthearted comedy at moments when you need it most; it's really a terrific film.  Of course, there's also excellent directing by Zemeckis; he has really given us an extraodinarily lifelike film.  You just can't afford to miss out on FORREST GUMP.	5.0	4.5 out of 5	2003-09-15	2	1	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3T1NXU3SEY31B	Tony Banik	Finally on DVD! This has to be one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Great special effects and greater acting, Tom Hanks is the best. When it was originally released, I went to see it 3 times in the theaters! There's a reason why this is going to be released as a 2 disc set, that's what the people want, it's a fantastic film that needs to be split onto 2 discs, 1 disc for the movie, another for the special features. You won't be dissapointed purchasing this DVD. I don't know what else to say about this wonderful film. That's why I was a little disturbed to read the review below mine, from someone unfortunately named: &quot;Rivkah Maccaby.&quot; We all love the fact that we can review movies on Amazon, it's really cool to be able to give our own &quot;2 cents&quot; on our favorite movies. In the same respect, it's also fun to trash movies that we don't like, it doesn't matter if the movie deserves it or not, it's just fun. But, if you're going to repeatedly call a movie &quot;stupid&quot; in your review, at least have the brains to explain why you thought it was stupid. Give us some details, some parts of the movie you thought were bad.  Rivkah Maccaby, are you also a filmmaker? Are there any movies that you have made recently? Have you ever heard of the term &quot;I'd like to see you do better&quot;? Can you make a better movie than &quot;Gump&quot;? Probably not, but if you ever make any movies, I would love to review your work so that I can make the same brainless comments as you did on the Gump DVD. The fact is that &quot;Gump&quot; is a brilliant movie that you should buy right now for your home movie collection. But that's just my opinion, one of over 150 reviews so far.	5.0	Reviewer: Rivkah Maccaby	2001-06-25	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2GXKHLB4F48CW	"trastevere ""trastevere"""	"Remember that intergalactic cruise ship in ""Wall-E,""  with all those obese passengers hypnotized by their video screens?  I bet the video they were watching was ""Forrest Gump.""""Forrest Gump?""  An Orwellian trick?  Not sweet Forrest, who seems (on the surface at least) to personify all that is good and humble and admirable in the world.Don't get me wrong:  Forrest is a good man.  But that doesn't mean that the film in which he stars is actually expressing ""good"" values.In fact, ""Forrest Gump,"" fantastically realized as it is, is a cynical, calculating film.Before you get upset, let's step back and define terms.  Can we agree that  in an ideal world, a film (like any work of art) will express a view of life which is truthful?  That viewers who experience that work will come away not only entertained, but also invigorated, strengthened, and enriched?I raise this point because Hollywood producers have long understood the formula for manipulating mass audiences with over the top sentimentality.  Before Hollywood figured out the formula, the Greeks were already doing it.  Plato himself attacked the theatre because of its power to excite the senses and numb the mind.At its best, a Hollywood film can be riveting and inspirational:  look at To Kill a Mockingbird,  Singing in the Rain,  or Mary Poppins, for example.  Why do I love those films and why do I exclude Forrest Gump from their ranks?Because in all three cases (and innumerable other example could be cited) these films provoke in their audiences not not only wonder, but also the desire to interact with the world.  The children in ""Mockinbird"" experience injustice, but they also learn to accept ""Boo Radley,"" and, we presume, they will emulate their father as people who make a difference.  In ""Singing in the Rain,"" the plucky and talented prevail-- and will, we can expect-- spend a lifetime bringing joy to millions.  ""Mary Poppins"" goes away-- but not before Jane and Michael-- and the entire family-- are transformed-- and take their places in society, joining other Londoners in the park.The ""Forrest"" effect, on the other hand, is the opposite.  We are encouraged (no: frightened into the decision) to stay at home.  Only a fool would follow the other characters into harm's way.  The big world is depicted as chaotic, dangerous, and generally not worth it.  And anyway, if Forrest is any example,  staying at home is a surer road to riches.Don't get me wrong:  the idea of a wise fool is wonderful.  He appears in every culture.  But generally speaking, the story about the wise fool imparts wisdom.  If you look carefully at ""Forrest Gump"" you have 90% artificial flavoring. Because the outcomes in ""Forrest Gump"" are all rigged to reinforce the same idea:  city folk bad, Forrest, good.  Asking questions bad,  sitting on the porch swing good.Now I love sitting on porch swings.  I've sat on them (or on hammocks, or meadows, or snowfields) in over 50 countries of this world.  And everywhere I've gone I've met good people.  And the more I know the world, the less it looks like the world of ""Forrest Gump.""  Even in the worst zip codes of Los Angeles I've met people seeking to enrich their lives,  to interact with --and help-- others.  To change the world.The Forrest Gump world is different.  The world is bad.  And hard to understand anyway.  So, again, going out there-- into ""the arena"" in Teddy Roosevelt's words-- just isn't worth it.This is a dangerous idea, one that goes against the very fabric of what it means to be an American.  We are a nation of pioneers-- our future depends on our willingness to continue to be so.And so Forrest represents a myth of failure, of decline.  And it reinforces the correctness of the decision to escape from our destiny by telling viewers they made the right decision not to get involved.  Not to know to much.  Maybe even...not to know anything at all.In Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" books are banned because they make people unhappy.  Why?  Because they tell uncomfortable truths.  Forrest Gump wouldn't fit that category, because it feels designed to tell certain people only what they want to hear.Of course, this isn't the only film to do so.In the market driven America of today,  a product is good if it reinforces the idea that the consumer is good.  Therefore, a movie is good if it makes the viewer feel good.Fair enough.  Hollywood has always been mostly about straightforward entertainment, right?Well, yes and no.In the days of classic Hollywood cinema, audiences could feel good by identifying with John Wayne's eternal outsider, Humphrey Bogart's code of honor,  Scarlett O'Hara's astonishing persistence, and Fred Astaire's grace-- a wide variety of human characteristics-- all of which-- in their complexity-- somehow made audiences of the time feel better they were.  Maybe because they enlarged the scope of what was felt to be human.In other words,  American consumers had the humility to identify with characters bigger, braver, and more foolish than they were themselves.  Characters who suffered and learned. This was, after all, the reason people exposed themselves to drama from the time of the Greeks.In today's consumerist America, however, audiences don't want to get their hair messed up.  Characters like Scarlett and Sam Spade seem too far from home for most of us.  We want to identify with characters like Forrest Gump, who gets it all without even trying.  Or Good Will Hunting, the world's greatest street fighter, legal eagle,  nuclear physicist, sleuth,  lover, and who knows what else.  And all he needed to get the girl was Robin Williams weeping over him and uttering the magic words: ""You're really good!""Unlike Sam Spade, Scarlett O'Hara, Shane, or Terry Malloy,  Forrest and Will-- the heroes for the Wal-Mart American--  don't really learn through suffering.  They don't have to:  they're perfect just the way they are.  The only thing wrong in their worlds is that everybody else didn't know how perfect they were before they made the movie.  And by buying a ticket, the audience gets to take part in the canonization...of their own egos.In other words, the FORREST GUMP consumer is a weak, selfish,  shallow, lazy narcissist, unable to bend his/her imagination to identify with characters who are flawed- and thus actually human.  In other words, this post-modern self-centered character would reject anything remotely human-- if somehow it got past the guards at the entrance to the shopping mall.Naturally the Consumer Creature will call a movie ""good"" if it allows him/her to remain in the bubble of their shallowness.  Otherwise, it's ""weird.""I guess that's why Wal-Mart doesn't have a big selection of real books, or jazz, or classical music.  Or why Shakespeare, and Mark Twain,  and Thomas Jefferson are excluded from the minds of the worst generation in the history of the country.  Hunter Thompson called them a ""generation of swine.""Viewed in this way, Forrest Gump is the Moby Dick of this generation.  It is the white whale of shallowness, and, I'm afraid,  it will take us all to the bottom of the ocean.Someday-- and maybe soon-- historians (perhaps in China, India, and Brazil-- countries where young people actually go to school to learn)  will view movies like this as a symptom of a culture in intellectual--and moral-- freefall.  They will say, that was when American stopped being a leader-- and started its descent.  (Of course, even if the U.S.A. morphs into a state of slave-workers for a future Chinese Empire, the workers drones will undoubtedly be told they are still number one, and they will go through life believing it.)Meanwhile, the future historians will look at Forrest in the pantheon of great characters in literature (Lear, Hamlet, Ahab...Finn,  Gump) and marvel at the capacity of the human being to rise--- and to fall.Forrest isn't, in fact, a character at all-- he's a ball of tricks designed to lure the audience's most infantile self inside.This is fascism as consumer culture.  It doesn't matter how technically impressive the movie is, or that the scene where Forrest runs can make anybody cry.  This is the American version of ""Triumph of the Will,""  the moment when it became practically illegal to have a mind.By the way,  Robert Zemeckis' former writing partner, Bob Gale, co-creator of the BACK TO THE FUTURE series (the only films Bob Zemeckis should truly be proud of, except for USED CARS) accused Zemeckis of cynicism when he made FORREST GUMP.  Zemeckis claims he doesn't understand the accusation, and I believe him.  I don't think he understands what cynicism is, or how this film so perfectly embodies it.  And that puts him into the 95% of America that hasn't the slightest idea what it means actually to think.  And how criminal it is not to.  Especially when you have the power.Again, to those of you who are offended by this comment,  why not stop to consider that maybe living a shallow life is even worse than being offended. In any case, history will judge you far more harshly than one writer possibly could.  Why not try to rouse yourselves from your slumber and join the world.  It's a lovely place.  Besides, do you really want to spend your life like those butterballs on the cruise space ship in WALL-E?As someone who lived through the sixties, I can tell you that the film itself is an insult to all the men and women who struggled and shed their blood in that time of striving.  And their blood was not wasted!  Voting rights, civil rights, environmental protection-- these are the fruits of that struggle.The proper heroes of a film about that time are the men and women who fought in Vietnam-- and against the war.  Who fought for civil rights, and against the haters.  Who reached for the moon-- and landed there.  Who experimented with new ways of creating society--and made discoveries which have enriched our lived.  Scientists and scholars and firefighters and farm workers and computer geeks and musicians.  Not a man-- sweet as he is-- who looked at it all and said none of it made sense."	1.0	brilliantly executed feel good device; a false view of history and of life	2009-11-16	71	12	59

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	ACS6CGLM156NY	Truman	Forrest Gump is just one of those films where everything falls perfectly into place, making it an instant classic.  No matter what your preference in movies; humor, action, romance...Forrest Gump covers them all, splendidly.  Released by Paramount Pictures in 1994 and running 142 minutes, Forrest Gump was directed by Robert Zemeckis.  Zemeckis' starting line up consists of Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn and Sally Field.  Not too shabby.  The film won numerous awards, too many to mention here, but topping the list were Oscars won for Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Effects.  The film follows Tom Hanks as a young boy named Forrest, with just a bit of a learning disibility, and his life growing up.  Along the way, he runs into many characters, some well known, and in one form or another, slightly or greatly impacts the lives of each one.  Where Forrest lacks in mental capabilities, he more than makes up for in his thoughts and actions, which are ruled by his heart.  Forrest Gump combines all things nessacary to make this an all-inclusive film.  From the music of the 50's, 60's and 70's to the special effects and storyline itself, there will be something for everyone.  This film deserves 5 stars across the board for its power to make you laugh, cry, learn and hope!	5.0	This film holds something for everyone!	2004-08-10	2	2	0

I love it, don't get me wrong, but it can only be bearable for so long. You end up wanting to strangle Jenny, until she gets AIDS, that is. Forrest is  the only really likable character, because of his innocence. The director  did a really great job of touching base on a lot of really impacting events  of the 20th century. A good movie to watch if you're feeling patriotic. I  really liked how they weaved Forrest into the history of the shaping of  modern America. Vietnam, the &quot;*beep* happens&quot; bumper sticker, the  smiley face logo, John Lennon, John F. Kennedy, Elvis, the hippy  generation, etc. As I said, this is a really well done movie with great  acting, but it seems very long.	4.0	Great Movie, but gets old	2000-01-17	3	1	2
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3POUK5BO810DD	T. Wu	"This film might be taken to be many things--an autobiography, history, comedy, war film, but at its heart lies an allegorical sort of epitaph for a wild era in American history (1960s-70s); a psychological catharsis. (Warning: this review has spoilers)We seem to be told that everything about our protagonist derives from the singular trait that he is a little bit dumb. Yet there is more to Forrest Gump than being a little bit dumb. He is also a 'little bit' innocent, a 'little bit' hardworking, a 'little bit' selfless (and a 'little bit' lucky, at least in regards to his personal affairs). Ultimately, our narrator Forrest seems to fill the role of an angelic ideal, like Dante wandering through the depths of Hell in the Divine Comedy; like a man who has never eaten from the Tree of Knowledge stumbling through the depicted darkness of postwar America.T.S. Eliot once remarked, ""We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time""-- and this seems to apply aptly here. Each time we return to the bus bench with Forrest, at the end when we return to the feather, we see the same things, yet know their meaning for the first time. And has Jenny, the female charge of our angelic Dante, our bird which has flown far, far away, to college, to a singing career, through the antiwar movement, waitressing, and finally an AIDS victim, arrived back where she started in that wheat field behind her father's home: alone with Forrest by her side, only to know him, his simple kind of love, for the first time? (It's an interesting plug for all the 'Nice Guys' who can never get a break, isn't it?)Yet unlike what perhaps this film suggests, Jenny was not wrong to want to fly (even if the directions of that flight were not as fortuitous), and we should not refrain from exploring in life for ourselves. Forrest certainly never did, even though for him it was an inadvertent journey. His saintly character seems at one level to be a stunning example of some writer's indictment by contrast of American culture-- presumably his own generation. Yet the morality play only works because our stories of Gump's earthly charges-- Bubba, ""Lt. Dan"", Jenny, are tragic ones-- while Forrest's is not. As if God's hand in his infinite justice were reaching down and placing the virtuous Gump in the most opportune positions, even as the world seems lost around him. Unfortunately, us mortals in the real world cannot truly live up to the model this movie holds forth. Imperfect and living in a world where guile and self-interest pay off, descended from the fallen Adam and Eve, we are more like Lt. Dan and Jenny than Forrest.Yet the tragic characters herein aside, it is important to remember that the risks inherent in life, and the moral sacrifices to self-interest sometimes required, are never a justification for turning one's back on it, even if none of us will be as effortlessly successful as Forrest. Let us not take from this a message of despair. It is not necessary to be an angelic idiot in order to do substantial good in this world. And if our explorations in life bring us back to that place where we started, if complexity's chaos and confusion become brittle and melt into love, it is also true that love compels us to live life nonetheless, to pursue our dreams and fly as far as we can. (Even if only so that perhaps one day, we may look back again at what we had at the beginning with understanding eyes, and know it for the first time).The final scene in this film shows young Forrest Jr. boarding a school bus, the smartest kid in his class (thus presumably an imperfect mortal, like his mother), ready to face life's new adventures. Where will it lead him? None of us would deny him the chance to find out. So, if this film inspired in you a thoughtful catharsis, I would think of it not as an indictment of a postwar generation that reached out ambitiously and optimistically, or of a culture uniquely American, but as a place of wisdom from which to begin again."	3.0	It is not necessary to be an angelic idiot to do substantial good in this world	2006-03-04	12	4	8

Disk #1 has the film in Dolby Digital 5.1.  The sound is just right, and very aggressive where it needs to be, like in helicopter or ship at sea scenes. The image is very sharp in a widescreen version, and the colors are highly realistic. Two different selectable commentaries are among the best I've listened to. Disk #2 has all the &quot;extras&quot;, and lots of interesting ones at that. Most of the features are in Pro Logic, but the feature on &quot;sound design&quot;, appropriately, is in Digital Dolby 5.1. They really go into all the &quot;secrets&quot; of making the film.

He was the best guy they could choose for the role. The special effects in the movie are just breathtaking, beautifully executed!The DVD is nicely produced and one of the vital points of the DVD set is the additonal features DVD.

The sympathy, nostalgia, tragedies, and most of all, moving lines such as &#34;you have to do your best with what God has given you&#34;, &#34;you have to leave the past to move on&#34; are still more relevant than ever and apply to everyone at a different level. I cry every time I watch this movie, and realize something new and charge myself with motivation when I need it. The oft quoted golden line &#34;Life is full of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get&#34; is just truer than ever, and on this particular viewing - Happiness is when you appreciate and accept, and be strong in all circumstances even when it is tough - are what I left with the most.	5.0	Insipirational	2013-12-23	1	1	0

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2CDMCG1Z84A51	Wanda B. Red	"Critics of this movie who think that the Forrest character is a sentimental fiction just don't understand the grand irony of the film. Like many a ""fair unknown"" of early novelists -- from the the romancers of the Middle Ages to Henry Fielding in the 18th century -- Forrest, the archetypal innocent brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, teaches us to see the world anew.And what we learn is both enchanting and disenchanting. The film romps through three decades of the late 20th century, revealing the foibles of those times but also some of their finest potential. Forrest's run back and forth across the country is hilarious. My favorite line: ""I'm pretty tired now. I think I'll go home.""The music is almost an independent character, which threads its way throughout the film, helping not only to capture the spirit of the times but also to remind us as only music can of the rhythmic synchronicity of human life. This is also a rhythm that the circular plot and the repeating image of the feather brings forward.Forrest's modesty makes space for my favorite character in the film: the magnificent Captain Dan (Gary Sinise), who Ahab-like dares God to bring on his worst -- and in the process proves both the resilience of the human spirit (and invites us to laugh at its pretensions). Sally Field (as Forrest's mama) and Robin Wright Penn (as Jenny) are also not bad.The naysayers who think their highbrow taste puts them above this film just do not understand what it's all about. Occasionally the movie itself forgets its own best intentions (""Life is just a box of chocolates"" -- yuck), but given its overall achievement, it can be forgiven."	5.0	A Great Big 18th-Century Novel of a Movie	2006-03-05	9	7	2

Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors ever, and the rest of the cast as well.  This is, without a doubt, Robin Wright's finest role, and the magnificent Gary Sinese absolutely earned his Academy award.  Sally Field of course was wonderful as well, and let's give a little kudos to the actor who played Bubba!There were a few 'bad' reviews on this site about this movie.  Hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, BUT, I can't help but wonder what kind of borderline personality disorders these folks have for coming up with ANY KIND of negative perception/assesment of this film.

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2REUCAKSHMNAZ	"William T. Prince ""William T. Prince"""	"First let me say that I'm not going to get worked-up over Tom Hanks' portrayal of a mentally retarded character.  Forrest was not retarded.  While he was not the sharpest tool in the shed, his IQ was not more than two standards deviations below the mean.  Besides, Mr. Hanks is an actor, and he was merely acting according to the way the author wrote the character, the way the director directed the character, and his own interpretation of both.This is an exceptional movie--still my all-time favorite.  I haven't actually watched it in a while, but when I do, I'm moved every time.  How can one not be moved by a character so ingenuous, so resilient, and so good?  How can one not be moved by such an incredible story, so skillfully directed?  Bad things sometimes happen to good people.  ""It happens,"" as Forrest said.  Someone once said that ""life is ten percent what happens and 90 percent how I react to it.""  Never has this truth been so accurately portrayed as in this wonderful movie, ""Forrest Gump.""""Is he smart, or is he. . . .?""  That scene clinched the Oscar for Tom Hanks, and I still can't watch it without getting a big lump in my throat and tears in my eyes.  Tom Hanks is the best, most versatile actor of our time, and never has he been more brilliant than he was in this movie.  No one with a pulse can watch this movie and not be moved by it--perhaps even changed.  I could not recommend any movie more highly."	5.0	STILL MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIE!	2003-03-05	3	2	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1GVGKQ453NJ5F	Winnie Tso	"Warning! This review may contain spoilers!Forrest Gump: An Inspiring movie during the time of the Vietnam WarSet in the time of the Vietnam War, Robert Zemeckis directs a heartwarming movie, Forrest Gump. Like no other, this movie has become a cultural phenomenon in our society today. Quotes from the movie such as: ""Stupid is as stupid does"" and ""life is like a box of chocolates"" has changed how we speak. This movie has been awarded six Oscars, 38 other awards, and 44 nominations. Forrest Gump, a simple man who lacks the brains, has good intentions, and we see his character develop through the movie.SummaryThis movie begins with a white feather falling to Forrest Gump's (Tom Hanks) feet, He is sitting on a bus stop bench in Savannah, Georgia. Forrest then proceeds to pick up the feather, and puts it in his book. He then beings to tell his life story to a woman sitting next him. The people next to him change from time to time, each with a different aspect and attitude towards his narration.His story begins with him at the doctor's office needing leg braces. On his first day of school, he is already considered `the weird kid' and doesn't find a seat on the bus, until one girl, Jenny (Robin Wright), who later becomes his best and only friend, asks him if he wants a seat. During their time in school, they spend most of their time together. One day when they are walking on a road, a group of bullies come throwing stones at Forrest. Jenny tells him to run, and Forrest ends up having to break out of his leg braces and he discovers his ability to run at lightning speed. His fast running skills get him into college through a football scholarship.  After his graduation, Forrest is enlisted in the army and is sent off to Vietnam. In the army he befriends a black man named Bubba (Mykelti Williamson). Bubba talks about his future shrimping business and persuades Forrest to go with him after the war. During the war, his platoon gets attacked, and even though Forrest uses his speed to save many of the men, Bubba is killed because of an exposed wound. He is later sent to the hospital because he took a shot to his butt. In the hospital, he is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour, and later finds his super ability to play ping-pong. He later plays competitive ping-pong against Chinese teams, and rises to fame. When he returns to his mother, he finds his home filled with cutouts of himself and endorses in a company, which earns him $25,000 dollars. Wanting to fulfill his promise to Bubba, he uses the money to buy a shrimping boat. Forrest's ex-Lieutenant, Dan (Gary Sinise), joins him on the boat as First Mate. Though in the beginning they have a hard time catching shrimp, their boat manages to survive a Hurricane (unlike the other locals), which in turn brings huge amounts of shrimp. He uses that money to invest in an entire fleet of shrimp boats, and Lieutenant Dan invests the money in Apple electronics. Because of this, Forrest is financially secure for the rest of his life. One day he gets a call, to find that his mother is dying and he returns home to say his final goodbye.One day, Jenny is seen coming back to visit Forrest. Forrest spends time with her and proposes to her. She declines, but still loves him, so they sleep together. Jenny then leaves early in the morning. Forrest decides to go for a run, and runs across the country several times. He becomes famous in three and a half years. Today, Forrest is shown waiting for the bus at the bus stop as he had received a letter from Jenny, who asks Forrest to visit her. When he meets Jenny, he realizes that Jenny is with a son, and that he is the father to the baby. Forrest then finds out that Jenny is suffering from a disease (most likely AIDS). The three move together, and Forrest and Jenny eventually marry. Jenny passes away soon after.The movie concludes when little Forrest is waiting at the bus stop for his first day of school. As Forrest opens little Forrest's book, the same white feather from the beginning of the movie is slowly falling into the pages. The bus leaves, and the feather is seen again to drift upwards to the sky.Characters and Actors:Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, portrays the main character as an innocent and lovable person. It can be seen that Forrest is a bad-luck character as whenever he is around a famous person, they pass away. Such as President Kennedy, Nixon, and Elvis Presley.Tom Hanks is without a doubt the best choice for this role. Hanks not only act the part, but also become the character and made it more believable with the Southern accent than ever. As Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times said: ""Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role."" Hanks delivers the role with such brilliance that it sets a new standard for everyone.Having only acted in a few movies prior to Forrest Gump, Robin Wright, who plays Jenny Curran, portrays the actor in a surprisingly outstanding performance. Jenny is a woman that is very important in Forrest's life. She gives Forrest the strength and happiness we see in Forrest every time he sees her. Though Wright's performance all took us by surprise, Hank still outshines as the greatest role.Lt. Dan, who is played by Gary Sinise, portrays the lieutenant as a harsh, tough, yet a kindhearted man. When we first meet this character, we see him as a demanding brute. After the war, we realize that he is actually a compassionate and altruistic. Without Sinise's ability to act Lt. Dan out as what he is now, Forrest would be different, and the story wouldn't be as good as it is now.Historical AccuracyThis movie is set in the 20th Century. Forrest Gump gives the audience a view of what it is like before, with great accuracy.An example of a small but accurate fact was the fact that students of different races are being assimilated into America. The movie shows the military helping African Americans enter the school.Many scenes from this movie were shot with the background of Vietnam War. Although this fact is correct, it is seen that the intensity of the war wasn't like how it was. After all, the Vietnam War is the greatest and longest war in all of the United States history. Damages from the war should've been much greater, there should've been more men fighting, and the consequences should've been greater.Another accurate accuracy was the rise of popularity of Nixon. In the scene where Forrest arrives Washington D.C, he is caught with the hippies and other people in which they are against the war. The film accurately portrays this scene of history.Thoughts on the movie:Watching it as a family movie, I would rate this movie a 4.5/5, as it was a very heart-warming, well acted, and Oscar winning movie. This movie not only contains historical accuracy, but it also teaches us a life moral. Comments from other viewers, websites, magazines, friends, and other critics have shown the worthiness and importance of this movie. There can be only little improvements to this movie, but otherwise, it was a great movie, that is suitable for any ages."	5.0	Forrest Gump Review By Estelle Ip (140285)	2013-03-27	7	3	4

Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994. Out of all of the movies that were released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20. Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on. The only reason that I would give it props is for(at the time) was the special effects, which now are dated. After Gump Zemekis directed a episode of Tales From The Crypt where he used the same Technology and was easiest the worst episode of that year. I used to be a HUGE Zemekis fan. Used Cars, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Furture movies and Death Becomes Her were I thought were strong movies. But arounf Back to the Future 2  I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film. To the objective viewer re-watch this film and think about every scene and try to remember where you have seen that scene before. I guarantee you after you do that you will see this movie in a totally different light.	1.0	Deja Vu All Over Again	2006-09-30	52	15	37

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"Year of release: 1994Writers: Winston Groom (who wrote the novel) and Eric RothDirector: Robert ZemeckisRuntime: 2 hours 22 minutesI haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any creedance to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exagerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talant.-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""-- Mastering your talants will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).-- Keep your word.-- Pray and have FAITH.-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness.

The first one is the movie and the second one are the special features.There's nothing much to say about the film that already have been said, so I'll just put that Forrest Gump is one of my Top 5 all time favorite movies.The special Features disc is completely amazing.  I'm head over heels about how movies are made and the actual story of how it all came to be.I was pretty surprised how different the novel and the movie are.  The special effects, acting, anecdotes, etc.For me this is a winning format.  I'm happy because I got it and the price I paid is more than good.Get this.	5.0	Forrest Gump Blue-Ray review	2011-04-02	9	9	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A1TWRSW3DZF7L8	"""xpio"""	Forrest Gump is definitely one of &quot;those&quot; movies. You know the ones, where you're left speechless at the sheer greatness of it. Tom Hanks, undoubtedly one of the top actors worldwide, puts on a brilliant  performance, with a perfectly retarded drawl (or at least I thought so). A  top-class movie except for the fact that it is against my beliefs entirely!  That's the reason for only four stars.	4.0	Inspirational!	2000-01-18	2	1	1
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A31Z0PODU47G2B	xxrsduchessxx	"What can I say? It's FORREST GUMP and TOM HANKS.Brief OverviewTom Hanks is amazing as a lovable dim witted guy who didn't have a chance to amount to anything (his back was as crooked as a question mark, five measely points below normal). But his good heart and simple understanding of things helps him live a life we all envy.Why We like the StoryWe root for him because of his good heart and the way he treats people and love that he unwittingly becomes a college football star, medal of honor soilder in the Army, shrimping boat millionaire, Macintosh stock holder etc. Gump is present at so many historical events that it keeps our interest and the fact that Gump witnesses all these events and has no clue about the significance of these events makes it amusing and endearing.QuotesThere are so many great quotes from this movie ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" ""Stupid is as stupid does"" ""But Leitentent Dan, you ain't got no legs"" ""Sorry I ruined your Black Panther Party"" ""I gotta pee"" ..... etc. etc. they are endless.O yea and the classic ""RUN FORREST, RUN"".Tom Hanks's ActingThe amazing scene where Gump finds  out that he has a child, lil Forrest and he gasps  ""Is he...."" and can't say the word smart because he knows what life the kid will have if he is slow like his dad, how people will treat him and how lonely and inadequte the child would feel. Its an amazing scene and you feel the humanity of Forrest Gump.He is an amazing actor. His performance here makes slow forrest a human to us. We don't spend the movie seeing him as a sad retarded guy. We see him as a person, who has something to overcome. He is lovable but a real character. Forrest is not reduced to a typical ""retarded guy with not personality"". Many ""retarded"" people are depicted in movies as simple, who laugh at simple things and have no depth. But Forrest is a real character with depth that Tom Hanks masters. Oscar is greatly deserved with this movie!THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR DVD COLLECTIONS OR PEOPLE YOU JUST BUY A FEW MOVIES. ITS THE MOVIES YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE!!!"	5.0	Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump	2006-04-24	5	4	1

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A2WO8K4A8CVUPV	Ybarra	"If you haven't seen ""Forrest Gump"" yet, I am shocked.  An odd movie about a simple man who grows up being genuinely nice to everyone no matter who they may be or what they may have done.  Tom Hanks is spectacular in his portrayal of Forrest. The movie sends a clear message to the viewers, ""No matter what happens, take it in stride. And take it in stride Forrest does, always looking at the bright side of things during the darkest of times.  If you're a fan of smart films like ""The Green Mile"" and ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"", then you will definitely love ""Forrest Gump"""	5.0	A must see	2011-12-21	1	1	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3NOSDDSTZZLDO	Y. Reagan	I've always loved this movie, from the first time I saw it. And at the age I first watched it, I was very picky. But Tom was great in it, as well as Gary Sinise. I think Gary's part in this movie, is one of his best performances, and that's sayin a lot.I love how Forrest never just gives up, like a lot of us would love to do in hard times. He always keeps going, the best he can, and always does his best to find the best in people. He's such a sweet guy who had a pretty hard life.A really great movie :)!	5.0	Amazing movie!	2009-03-14	3	3	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A13OMXUND1T5XC	"""yymao"""	I have watched this movies many times. No need to mention the humorous plots and lines, the beautiful pictures, the excellent acting, and the span of various historical backgrounds in this movie, which make it indeed the top in the film-making history. What I like the most about the movie is its philosophical taste of life. It makes you think.Forrest Gum is really just a common person, not too bright, not too aggressive, but nice to every one. There seems nothing that  he persists, and there seems no goal in his life. He goes to where life takes him. But he is not a loser, he ends up with success and luck beyond what he expects. His all-time love, on the other hand, forming a great contrast with him, always pursues her dreams, tries hard, and experiences all sorts of frustration, without a happy ending. It really makes you think how one should live his life.I like the scenes of the feather in the wind. That carries infinite taste of life. The more you watch the movie, the more you will feel the taste, and the more you will like the movie.	5.0	Philosophical Taste of Life	2002-06-16	2	2	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; has to be near the top of that list.  Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor.  There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with &#34;Gump&#34;.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the life story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the &#34;scale of normal&#34;, falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department.  However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart-turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple man, has touched so many others.There are two primary reasons why &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; will resonate through the ages:First, is the Gump character himself.  Not only did it rocket Tom Hanks to super stardom, but it is one of the greatest representations of life ever put on the big screen.  Even though Forrest is obviously &#34;slow&#34;, he has qualities about him that we all wish we could mimic.  He doesn't get caught up in the &#34;b.s.&#34; of life, instead just taking things at face value and living life in the moment.  As a result, he has a knack for showing up at the right place at the right time.  Sometimes, we get so caught up in the minutiae of our everyday lives that we forget to just &#34;live&#34;...something Forrest does like no other.Secondly, this movie is a reflection of its times.  I think there are so many baby boomers who, like Jenny, thought that counter-culture (drugs, hippies, etc.) was the best route into adulthood.  What many of them realized, however, was that such behavior could not last forever, and eventually you have to come back to reality.  In this case, Jenny has a Forrest to come back to, which provides the primary drama of the film.Overall, &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is a landmark effort in cinema, as it is one of the only movies that can still hold up perfectly despite being only about &#34;the journey&#34;, so to speak.  It can be watched by viewers of pretty much all ages and enjoyed on some level.  The film is on television so much these days that sometimes it gets a little over-exposed, but it still remains a special piece of filmmaking.	5.0	One Man's Journey	2014-01-26	1	1	0
0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	Forrest Gump...what is there to say? Excellent movie. It's seeing history and telling it from a point of view. Many people, who were not in the era, do not realize how everything was, until they see this movie. With history is the whole 'true love' plot, which goes well for the movie. This movie is definitely one of my favorites, my friends and I can remember it word for word and we use many quotes till this day. I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc. I look at it as a drama and to me, drama has a little bit of everything in it.	5.0	Forrest Gump (1994)	2004-10-19	9	6	3

0792140923	Forrest Gump [VHS]	A3RMXOM5RYIA4I	Z. Mann	&quot;FORREST GUMP&quot;(One of my favorite movies) is an uplifting, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, experience, where you see the whole wide world through the eyes of a man who's never seen it before, and hardly understands it.Through my opinion, &quot;FORREST GUMP&quot; deserved every Oscar it won(Except for one). Tom Hanks(With his back-to-back Oscars) had been amazingly convincing(What, with his accent and all), but I found it nearly absurd that he was chosen over the even more amazingly convincing, Morgan Freeman, in &quot;THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION&quot;(Also one of my favorite movies). While watching this epic for the first time I laughed and cried, nearly at the same time. This movie is awe-inspiring, and though it is PG-13, I wouldn't reccomend this to a kid 10 or under.The special features on the DVD look interesting and I might buy it someday on DVD, but for now, I'm sticking with what I originally had, the VHS.	5.0	All That, and a Box of Chocolates.	2002-06-08	4	2	2
