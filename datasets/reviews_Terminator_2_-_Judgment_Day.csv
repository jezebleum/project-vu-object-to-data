0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2QB4F1510HPL8	13 Ways And Counting	"This is Ahhhhhnuuuulllld in his prime! I picked this up locally not too long ago. Being that this was an older movie I didn't expect much from the blu-ray transfer - at all. I was quite suprised.When you watch this on blu-ray take into account how old this movie actually is and you will come away with a new appreciation of how well it was filmed originally. The picture is crisp, the colors are really sharp, the contrast is perfect. The sound has obviously been tweaked, not in a ""WTF that doesn't sound right!"" fashion but cleaner - what you would expect from blu-ray.The scene where Sarah is breaking out of the asylum and she breaks a guard's arm - you'll cringe :)For the price you cannot go wrong with this one! Revisit an absolute classic. With more recent releases being expensive and really not worth the price (it should be cheaper to snag a blu ray than to see it in the theater - my opinion )this is an easy purchase. Even if you have never seen this one and think Ahnuld is cheesey pick this up - you'll understand why we all love a good Ahhhhnuuuuld flick. Really you've got to love this one.If this isn't in you collection but ANY High School Musical is you don't deserve blu-ray, a tv, eyes, or the $$$ you wasted on it :)"	5.0	T2 Blu Ray - It still holds up!	2009-02-22	9	6	3

You cannot go back and re-shoot an entire movie in a HD format. So thus, you cannot make it an HD movie just like that.  Now the features on the other hand, is something that can be surpassed from the DVD releases and is multiple times not done.  I just get sick of hearing the same old tearing down and poor ratings of a movie all because of the retarded expectations of people thinking a movie should be magically re-done in HD when that is not going to happen.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3CGVO10F7NPMJ	A Customer	In the most explosive and anticipated sequal in years, three great actors light up the screen with their tremendous performances on top of eye-popping special effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the invincible machine, sent back in time to the present day by his creator...to help him change the future as a child (Edward Furlong). His mother Sara Conner, played excellently again by Linda Hamilton, is committed for preaching words of the terrible war and death that await the Earth. With the Terminator's help, Furlong helps his mother escape...only for the three to battle a more complex time-traveling machine. A machine that frighteningly aquires the uniform of a policeman. The advanced T1000 played by Robert Patrick, is a vitually- indestructable killer sent back in time to keep the future as it is. I feel ridiculous reviewing a movie like this, because it was so perfectly done and thrilling in every sense, everybody has to see it for themselves. Forget terrible movies with good special effects, this flick was so ahead of it's time at the box office and is still today THE most talked about action-packed thriller. I think every person should see and own this movie, in my opinion it's the best film Hamilton or Schwarzenegger have ever done.	4.0	Muilti-Millions Not Wasted On This One...	2001-05-25	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1OHU9K80KXTTN	A Customer	What is there to say about T2?  It, in my opinion, is a candidate for the greatest film of all time and overall best film in the sci-fi genre that even has been and ever will be created.  Everything that made the first film a masterpiece has been expanded upon and doubled at that.  We actually have a Terminator as both a good guy and bad guy this time (Arnold is the good guy - yay!)  As with my last review, I don't want to go into plot detail.  Chances are you have probably already seen this film and you are buying it for the reason of high definition, but if you haven't seen it, I feel sorry for you.I did a tad of complaining about how the first Terminator movie didn't have many extras and it was kind of blurry.  Again, during the night, there is still the fuzzy specs, but everything else looks great (again, the reason I don't detract from the score is the age of the movie and the limits of technology).  Man, did the ramp up the content though.  If you are fortunate to have your player hooked to the net, (I use my Playstation 3 'Skynet' will install certain features and before you start the movie, it detects your general location and if the connection itself is ok.  If everything passes, you are taken to the main screen.  Here you have an interesting top-down menu system with several options (scene selection, subs, etc) as well as a quiz game you can play along with the movie.  There is even some exclusive content via BD-Live like download interviews and extra stuff, as well as a chess game you play against 'Skynet'.That about covers it for this great collector's item.  Will Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be even better, or will it fail and disgrace the franchise title it bears.  I'll be back - again!	5.0	T2: Sknet Edition	2009-08-14	3	1	2
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	This is the first DVD I ever bought, and it was a great purchase. Even if you have it on VHS or on an earlier DVD edition, I would highly recommend buying this version because of its new features. I'm sure everyone knows the plot: Humans vs. Machines after WWIII, the first terminator was sent back in 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, but the human resistance sent back Kyle Reese, both of them died in the first movie. In this movie, a terminator superior to Arnold is sent back to kill John Connor, but this time Arnold is protecting him. Arnold's nemesis, the T-1000, is a stunning visual achievement, with the liquid metal and morphing, and Arnold does a great job as the T-800. The acting in this movie is good all around, I can't think of a single bad performance. The writing is great, not a single scene suffers because of it. The special edition is even better, with new scenes and lots of materials on how the movie was made, plus lots of bios. Check it out if you are a fan of sci-fi or action.	5.0	Great Movie, Awesome DVD	2001-05-19	0	0	0

Terminator 2 set the standard for all action movies that followed it. Terminator 2 once again has Arnold, but this time he is to protect instead of destroy.

Though the story was a bit lame...the usual &quot;human kind is gonna die, someone needs to save it&quot;, the action was fast paced and very fullfilling. The main character, the terminator, needed no special acting skills other than one expresion (good thing for Arnold). Just one thing...its one of those paradox things...If they prevented the future from happening the way they did, then  how did the terminator come back in time if they never exsisting?  The DVD format did the movie justice. It brought out the color and effects the VHS version could not. The sounds and explotions were mush more well defined also.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AZSN1TO0JI87B	A. Estes	"In the rare pantheon of sequels that are just as good as -- if not, better than -- the original, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is in limited but good company. Nearly a decade after leaving his stamp with the first film, James Cameron returned to the property that put him on the map (perhaps with tail between legs following the disappointing release of ""The Abyss"" a few years prior). With original players Linda Hamilton and, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action, Cameron co-wrote a script that expanded upon the simple premise of the original film while adding more social commentary and even more action than before.While our heroin from the first film, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) rots away in a maximum security mental institution, her young son and future savior of mankind, John (a fresh-faced Edward Furlong), is roaming the streets of Los Angeles, blasting some GNR whilst robbing ATMs. Meanwhile, the war against the machines rages on in the future, and as such, a newer and deadlier Terminator with shape-shifting abilities -- the T-1000, as played by a stone-cold serious Robert Patrick -- is sent back in time to crush that little squirt John Connor before he leads all of humankind to victory. It's hard not to imagine the resistance chanting ""Yes, we can!"" while the machines retort with ""We built it!"" Anyway, as before, a protector for Connor is sent, only this time it's a re-programmed version of the same would-be Terminator that originally tried to kill his mother. And thus, Arnold is back.""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is notable for a lot of things, but what really makes it stand out is its stunning visuals effects. As one of the first films to utilize CGI in a big way, it simultaneously closed the door on the dominance of practical effects in the '80s while opening the door for the likes of ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Matrix"" and, of course, ""Avatar."" Using the T-1000 as the film's guinea pig, Cameron makes us believe liquid metal can come to life and stalk us. Even as technology has advanced, the CGI in the film is remarkable and somehow manages to look better than the CGI-heavy fodder of today.But special effects aside, the film is truly a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions. While admittedly not as tightly paced as its predecessor, the follow-up is chock full of dizzying action, dazzling set-pieces and big and bold ideas about the future. Amidst all of this lies a disarming sense of fun and humor, vis &agrave; vis the interplay between Schwarzenegger and young Furlong. To counter this, Hamilton steps it up as Rambo with sweater-meat. Her turn as the hardened and focused soldier is a natural progression from where we last saw her, and thankfully, Hamilton is up for the task.As far as big-budget blockbusters go, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" sits at the top of the heap. Very few films have come along in its time that are as truly epic and entertaining as this. With Schwarzenegger in his prime and Cameron at the top of his game, this is a no-brainer. One of the few ""must-see"" sequels in history. This one truly gives its predecessor a run for its money. While the franchise laid dormant for a good decade, Hollywood couldn't resist, and two sequels as well as a TV series followed. To be sure, though, ""Terminator 2"" is the end all, be all follow-up and a perfect companion piece to the original. Like chocolate and peanut butter, or plastique and burly beef, if you prefer.**Review edited on 11/04/2012"	5.0	More Human Than Human	2000-10-28	3	2	1

Gift For You ""Antubis72"""	"Pass this up and just buy the regular blu-ray Skynet Edition disc.In a nutshell:#1 The HUGE 14"" tall endoskeleton head bust is CHINSY at best. Details are not horrible but they're not good either.  It's constructed of high impact styrene plastic (vacuum metalized chrome is probably the only plus on this thing).  It looks VERY ""toyish"" with some very poor black paint wash applications.  Light up eyes feature is a tad bit cool...sound effects are annoying and too loud at best.#2 All the extra bonus special feature discs and extra ""director's cut"" discs (aside from the actual blu-ray film disc) are just DVDs...that's right...JUST DVDs.  The studio just decided this is a strategic way of getting rid of their overstock of what they've previously released in the past.  They couldn't even transfer all of this to blu-ray?

Tha sound is so amazing that yu can hear tha sweat rubbing against each otha in Ahnuld's naked scene. I saw this film in my huge home theata, and I had neva had such a puwerful experience since watching Cunan tha Barbarian on dvd.  Jimmy Cameron pruves why he's tha best directur in Hullywood. Yu knew Titanic would be a great Oscar-winning film, when yu see Arnuld shuuting thousands of rounds of ammunition senselessly. In addition, Edward Furlong's role as a rebel without a cause is a can't miss. Linda Hamilton's great acting and muscular physique makes yu wonda if she is a Terminata herself. This is the best dvd out in tha market. Forgat Stallone, Willis, Seagal, Van Damme, and Edward James Olmos. When Arnie is in tuwn to kick to major liquid metal buttcheeks, you knuw that the real deal is on.Don't furgat he's a cybernatic machine frum tha year 2029.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1AUOVXPT5MYX4	"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx"""	"I can watch this movie several times a week and never get tired of it. ""TERMINATOR 2"", without a doubt, outclasses its prequel in more ways than one because of T-1000 and its effects to say the least. This movie not only shows great special effects, it plays off the characters established in the first film in an interesting way. The killer cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is now a protective body guard to a young John Conner. Sara Conner is no longer the quivering victim waiting to be saved, but a tough, hard-driving heroine who takes motherhood light years from the June Cleaver model.Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as the Terminator here because to me, he's rather weak as bad-guys and Robert Patrick is outstanding as the new Terminator. Everyone seems to think he isn't threatening enough, but I think that someone who doesn't look like a psychopath killing machine (unlike Arnold) is creepier to me. My only dislike about the movie was the Terminator's (Robert Patrick) run, which although interesting to watch, seems rather like Forrest Gump's!

For a 2 DVD set the extras are poor. There are a couple of things like this software to make you look like a battered T-800 but those are for PC's. So the extras are poor.If you don't have any edition of the T2 series, this one will do, but I think the UE is far better, if you like the extras and stuff. The only thing this DVD has is the commentary from Cameron. That's the main thing to get this one instead of the UE.If you already have any of the other version stay away from this one."	4.0	Good DVD but the extras are poor	2003-07-09	3	2	1

The manufacturing process is still behind. Blu-ray would have made a much better impression had double-layer disks been ready for the launch, but blu-ray is going to leap-frog over HD-DVD in terms of quality once this happens.HD-DVD is already using double-layer disks so they are maxed out now. What we are seeing now is the best HD-DVD can offer compared with 1/2 of what blu-ray can offer. Hurry up with those new disks please!	4.0	Better than DVD. Could be better.	2006-07-10	15	6	9

I loved T-1000, he was a wonderful villain, I loved Arnold's good guy terminator, just as wonderful a hero, and all in all this is one of the best movies I've ever watched on my TV or computer!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1BB5NSYVV2EWM	Alex Krychek	Why should you buy this DVD? If you've seen Terminator 2 you haven't seen it until you've see it this way, and if you haven't seen it then I recommend this to you even more. There is so much material stuffed into this DVD that I couldn't even begin to list it (it would take too long). It takes a two sided disc just to hold it all. All I can say is that Cameron and/or whoever else thought this thing up outdid themselves. This is quite possibly the best DVD I have found so far. With all due respect it should be selling for alot more than it is. The extensive menu system is setup as if you were in Skynet. On side one,where the movie(s) are, you start out in an Endoskeleton factory. On side two, which holds the extra goodies, you can descend into the very core of Skynet itself. For film buffs, there is a &quot;mini-class&quot; set up in the data core portion. It takes you through the many phases of the feature filmmaking process for T2. It starts with Camerons account of frantically writing the script and ends with marketing and publicity. VERY informative. Make sure to check out all three documentaries and the japanese trailers while exploring the extras. For those interested in more substantial goodies there is a secret code that you can enter one the first side to access a THIRD version of the movie. (look for roman numerals) The extra scenes in both alternate versions were a pleasant suprise. My jaw dropped when I saw the scene with Reese. To me this movie not only set the milestone for current action/scfi movies, it pounded it in with brutal unhuman force. It was well made, well written, well cast, and very replayable, which is more than I can say for most hollywood films.	5.0	This DVD is worth buying	2000-12-23	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AH4SL0YL5AQVU	Alric the Red	"At that time of the theatrical release, a tiny voice told me even then that this was less than the sum of its parts.  That voice was a mere pipsqueak of a thing, looking up at this spectacle of a film, which was so aggressively big, it was like looking up at a tidal wave, breaking over you, with so much of everything crashing down.  Oh, sure, it's got its interesting time-travel premise and the neato liquid-metal terminator.  But foremost, it was an ARNOLD vehicle, with every scene written so Arnold can perform his cooler-than-thou shtick, consisting mostly of catchphrases and lots of destruction while carrying a really loud gun.  All of  those complaints aside, I'm enthusiastic enough about the Blu-ray experience andTerminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray] was cheap enough that I thought I'd take another look.Well, I've decided it: Blu-ray or not, it was indeed plum boring.  People were reduced to cartoon characters Arnold can perform his routines on.  For example, without breaking his stride, he shoots a guard in the knee, then without looking back, cites to John that this stunt remained in strict compliance with John's earlier enjoinder against killing people.  I didn't think it was cute, the deliberate injury to an innocent person presented as a cool joke.  This is not a good movie.  It's not good science fiction; it's not good drama; it's not good comedy.  Remove the flamboyant pyrotechnics and the contrived coolness, and what's left?  ARNOLD, and his terrible acting.  I seriously doubt this movie will be regarded highly by film buffs twenty years from now.As for this Blu-ray edition, the high definition didn't add anything to the experience.  How can it?  It's so full of action, there's no room for anything else that could benefit from a hi-def display.  Any artistry brought to this venture was expended on the pyrotechnics.  The cinematography was efficient and cold, with the simplest aim: to assault the audience with bullets and bombs.  So while it was a noisy movie, there wasn't much to SAVOR visually; not like, say,Blade Runner [Blu-ray] orGattaca [Blu-ray], sumptuous visual feasts you'll indulge again and again.  If you've already seen it, and you own the SD DVD, there's nothing more for you here on Blu-ray.Nor are there any extras to sweeten the deal.  This Blu-ray edition is indeed a stripped-down affair.  The studio probably threw this together to meet the sudden demand for Blu-ray titles, but you can bet there's a big fat Blu-ray SE coming down the pike.  So to those to whom this matters, you despair is unwarranted.Undoubtedly my strong criticism for this film will garner a lot of angry ""no"" votes, with the readers clicking the button as if they were slashing my tires.  Be that as it may.  So that my Blu-ray library doesn't become as cluttered as my SD DVD library has become, I gave my copy away to my son._________________________________________"	2.0	Less than the Sum of Its Parts	2009-01-06	20	3	17

However, this time he's the protector of John Connor (as well as Sarah Conner)The T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is after John Connor and it's up to Arnold to stop the T-1000 from killing John.  This isn't as easy as it sounds, since the T-1000 is an advanced prototype, even more advance than the old terminator.  However, this doesn't stop the terminator from fighting the T-1000.  The old terminator is torn to pieces, while the T-1000 shows little damage.The Special Edition has new scenes added, including the first nuclear nightmare.  On the other side of the DVD are other features, like the &quot;making of&quot; special for T2.  All in all, one of the best DVDs!	5.0	&quot;I'll Be Back&quot;	2002-10-28	2	1	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A13WEAPFRQWMHL	Amazon Customer	"The image and sound quality on this new Blu-Ray edition are fine according to my eyes and ears, so I'm rating it two stars despite the temptation to drop to one because of the irritation I experience whenever I put the disc into my player.Basically, this T2 release is a perfect example of how a Blu-Ray disc's UI can be badly designed and authored. I'm not even talking about the menus themselves (though they are sluggish and some of the interactivity options are confusingly presented); I'm talking about the amount of time one has to wait before even getting to the menus.On my player (Panasonic DMP-BD50K with the v1.9 firmware from 10 June 2009 - the most recent version at time of writing), here's how the schedule goes when this disc is inserted, with times given in minutes and seconds:0:00 - Press ""Play"".0:44 - Player's front panel shows its first timestamp (0:00).1:21 - Player starts a network connection.1:45 - First appearance of any graphic on screen (a progress meter for the network connection).4:16 - The ""Skynet"" UI comes up and shows me my zip code and the fricking *weather* in my area (because I apparently need to be informed of these things in order to watch the film) and then waits for me to press ""Continue"" before it'll do anything else.5:16 - The first of several studio logos plays.5:59 - ""Skynet mainframe accessing"" message appears on screen, telling me that because my player is BD-Live 2.0 compliant, the disc is downloading data for the menus (the full-motion clips, maybe?).7:00 - The main menu finally appears and is accessible.Seven minutes of startup time. And this was a good run, too; I'd started timing a previous run in the week of the disc's release, but gave up after *twenty-five* minutes of staring at the ""Skynet"" graphic and waiting for the network download to complete.Now, my network connection isn't bad - I get firmware updates for my player without any difficulties. But even if it were that, this stinker of a UI violates two principles which I think are important for Blu-Ray authors:(1) It wastes time and bandwidth downloading useless and peripheral information, with no chance for the user to opt out short of disabling the network connection on the player ahead of time. When I put a disc in my player, it's because I want to watch the film on that disc, as hard as that may be for the T2 disc author to believe. If I want to find my zip code, I'll remember it (or look it up on my mail or the USPS web site); if I want to know what the current weather is like in my region, I'll poke my head outside. This is unforgivable.(2) It won't finish loading on its own: unless I press ""Continue"" after the ""Skynet"" zip-code/weather screen, it'll just stay there. (And disabling the network on the player in advance, while it does save some start-up time, leaves me with the same problem: in this case, the UI notes that no connection is available and then waits for me to confirm.) It's bad enough that the disc takes so long to load, but making me spend that time waiting at the player to click a confirmation button - as opposed to letting me go and use the time elsewhere - strikes me as very poor design. Discs should load all the way to the main menu before requiring user interaction.This is the first time I've been tempted to write to a studio (Lionsgate) and ask them to re-author a disc with features omitted. As noted above, I'm very happy with the presentation of the film: I just wish I could extract it from this awful, irritating disc UI and save myself some time and frustration."	2.0	How not to author a Blu-Ray disc, example #1	2009-06-14	43	37	6
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A26GKRY72ROT25	"Amazon Customer ""HomeTheaterGuy"""	The fact that you can play this movie in DTS is worth the price of the DVD! The sound is truly awesome! The special addition movie is the same one that was on the Pioneer special edition Laserdisc...the same exact movie, almost the same exact supplemental material. The one thing that's nice is, the scene splices (especially the dream sequence with Michael Biehn) seem to be &quot;seamless&quot; whereas the laserdisc version had traces of a splice. There is a third hidden movie that has all of the cuts spliced back in and really explores the new terminator allot more. You really get to see how much more advanced the new terminator is than the older model. They seemed to give a lot of thought to the menus, and the custom THX segment is the coolest yet! For my fellow home theater buffs, this is one to own! The sound is almost reference quality. All said and done, this is a great DVD and it has a second disc with all supplemental material. One warning, the menus on the supplemental disc can be a little confusing when trying to work your way around them. I gave it 4 out of the 5 possible stars because they could of enhanced the audio track a bit to really make this one of the best sounding flicks to experience.	4.0	Great DVD!	2000-09-05	0	0	0

It's funny, because I still feel the same way.  It's a film that just doesn't hold up well as the years have come and gone.  Cameron's 1991 sequel, a film that I nearly didn't see because of my feelings on the '84 film, is drastically different.  Thanks to recommendations from friends I finally took the time to check this one out, and I have to say that it totally blows the first film out of the water in ALL AREAS.  You see, I attacked `The Terminator', not only for its graphics (yes, they were great for the time and paved the way, but the don't impress now, at all) but also for the density of the story and the acting (I over praised Hamilton; definitely reaching for something to praise).I don't know if I have enough praise for this film though.The acting (even from the Schwarzenegger) is leaps and bounds better than the '84 film (even if young Furlong has his moments of cringe inducing overacting) and the graphics are nearly as good as things we see today (I prefer these graphics to Cameron's overrated mess of an `Avatar'), but it is the depth of story that really impresses me the most here.  This film doesn't feel like your average action junkie film.  It has a beating heart, and while the whole idea of man being mans worst enemy has been explored many times (two years before this film Cameron expressed similar feelings in `The Abyss'), it is a subject that lends itself to many variations and thus has a long shelf life.The film picks up YEARS after the first left off.  Sarah has gone crazy (or so the government would have you believe) and has been locked up.  Her son, John, is living with neglectful (or maybe they are just tired) foster parents.  The Terminator returns, except this time he is not the savage killer he was initially.  In the future, John has rewired him to be his protector, and he ventures to rescue John from an advanced killing machine sent to destroy him.Madness ensues.The underlying morale of violence and it's claws in humanity are embellished in many ways, from the overlaying plot regarding the future and the machines, to John's own views of The Terminator's knack for killing to his simple yet powerful observation at a gas station (""we're not going to make it, are we?"").  The film really understands how to rise above its own genre, creating something truly powerful within all the explosions and bloodshed.I kind of attacked Arnold for his lack of acting skills, and while some protested that that was the way he was supposed to play it, I still kind his performance in the first film to be rather ridiculous (but a lot of that was the script).  It's amazing what a little brain power can pull off.  With the advanced script work, this particular performance reaches all new heights.  Arnold, while still awkward and unintentionally comical, carries a human heart here, slowly learning how to adjust to the human world.  Robert Patrick makes a better villain than Arnold (and thus Arnold makes a much better `protector' than `terminator').  He has the suave viciousness needed to make him less robotic (he is an advanced model).  I mentioned already that Furlong has his moments of `ouch', but he also has many moments that work.  He is surely the films weakest link, but I won't fault him too much.  He works (and his work in 1998's `American History X' is sheer genius and proves that he had the talent).Linda Hamilton is a goddess here.  She grapples EVERYTHING to perfection.  I don't truly understand why so many consider her a supporting actress here though.  Some may argue that the machines (the terminators) are the leading characters, but that's like saying Shia LaBeouf is supporting in `Transformers' because the main characters are the transformers.  Anyways, no matter where you put her, she deserves to be somewhere.  I didn't think that anyone could knock the `Thelma and Louise' ladies from the top of my ballot, but Hamilton has done it.  The way she balances the macho with the insane with the tenderness is just astonishing.  She never flinches in her delivery, proving to transcend the genre and just deliver brilliance.This may be taking a lot of you by surprise (it has me) but I tend to believe this may be the perfect action film and surely one of the best ever made.  With heart, soul and a TON of fantastic action sequences (the initial chase scene, through the mall, on the street, OMG), this film is a must see, not just for the action junkie, but for the film lover in us all!"	5.0	A dysfunctional family road trip, that works...	2010-02-15	4	2	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1FTX1GEU6O8KZ	Andrew	We are all too familiar with the story of this movie, so I will spare you the details. &quot;The Terminator&quot; was a sleeper sci-fi hit that was a rarity in its genre. Movie-goers were beginning to see sci-fi films that rose above others in the genre and even other genres. &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and, the film that started the revolution, &quot;2001: A Space Odyessy&quot;. What made &quot;Terminator&quot; so different was not just another bleak view of the future, but a tense, edgy thriller with some damn fine writing. But while it took an effort to make films like those, it took a greater one to make a sequel. &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and very few others accomplished this task successfully. As for &quot;T2&quot;, unless you've been living under a rock, we all know how well it did. This is definitely the best of the series (in my opinion at least) and definitely one of the best action movies to grace the face of our planet. This is the movie that also started the trend of making action movies with ridiculously huge budgets and paying action stars ridiculously huge salaries. But T2 delivers, with a great story, stunning visuals, and Schwarzenegger in his prime. Plus who can forget Brad Fiedel's synthetic score which has been parodied numerous times?Why another DVD though? This film has been put on DVD almost as many times as &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Special features are somewhat reserved here, so what justifies another release? DVD producer Van Ling answers the question in a quaint little insert about how new technology has developed since the last T2 transfer. They can now present T2 the way it should be, digitally mastered from a 1080p, 24sf digital telecline transfer for &quot;superior video and audio quality&quot;. This release of T2 is aimed toward the home theater crowd. All that confusing talk means that the picture is presented with more clarity.And the sound is just awesome. The DTS track has been dropped from the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; in exchange for a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX track and a Dolby headphone track. If you have the technology, try to watch a DVD with a DTS track whenever possible. In the case of this DVD, there's only the Dolby 5.1 EX track. But the track on this &quot;Extreme DVD&quot; defies both the Dolby and DTS tracks from the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. It takes full advantage of a dimensional sound field.The goodies here are minimal; a SFX documentary, a behind the scenes montage, and a few DVD-ROM goodies that I didn't bother to try. But there is the original version of the film available to Windows Media Player 9 users on the second disc. You can watch it on the first disc as well, it's disguised as an easter egg. On the main menu of Disc 1, hit the right button five times while highlighting &quot;Play Extended Version&quot;. There's also an enhanced mode with behind the scnes and there's a spankin new commentary by James Cameron himself.But the question remains; is this DVD worth buying? It really boils down to what your reasons are for buying this new DVD. If you don't own the film, yes. If you're troubled by the mediocre video quality of either of the first two releases, then yes. If you want Cameron's commentary and other new supplements, yes. And if you want to playback T2 in HD on your PC (and even if you find that your computer equipment is currently insufficient for HD playback), yes. But if you want extensive behind the scenes, you might want to stick with your &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. This &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; delivers though, despite falling short in the behind the scenes section.	5.0	The Epitome of Action Films	2004-07-13	2	2	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A21DZUYTN019N3	Andrew J LaPlante	Sure, Terminator 2 might be more technologically advanced than the first one as well as longer and has more action but for some reason the first one catches my eye more and seduces me more. The 2nd one starts 10 years after the first terminator came back to kill Sarah Conner but failed, the 2nd terminator was sent to kill John when he was only ten years old, however this was a T-1000, an advanced Terminator that can copy and imitate anything it touches. As in the first a protector is sent, the T-800, the same model as the first terminator who is kinder and gentler in this movie.  The reason the first terminator is better is because the humans don't stand a chance against the Terminator, it's a cyborg and they can't kill it, two Terminators fighting each other gives away the ending of the 2nd movie.  the sound mix is alright but the way the widescreen picture is set up isn't as amazing as the first terminator movie.  I was kinda left disappointed but I did enjoy the movie a great deal, but today it's not as amazing, it's just too serious and tries to be better than the first movie, most sequels don't try to surpass the original but extend the story.  But anyways, the picture quality is good and the sound mix isn't too shabby, the DVD menu is kind of hard to navigate through and the documentaries are more about interviews but not actually shooting scenes and how they came about or what they used to make them. Why I give this DVD 4 stars is the fact that it's the terminator and was also one of the first rated r movies I ever watched and to this day still makes me guilty because I know I should have not watched it because I wasn't supposed to, oh well, can't change the past can you?	4.0	Great DVD, but I don't see how this can surpass the original	2002-01-24	2	1	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	I recently saw this movie for the first time.  I had no idea what to expect, and I thought that I was in for a stupid plot with lots of things blowing up.  I was so wrong.  This movie is great!  The visual effects are mind blowing and the story is definetly there.  In the first film, Arnold is a killer robot who is sent back through time to eliminate Sarah Connor, the woman who will give birth to a boy that will lead the human resistance in a future war against these machines.  In the future, John sends back his best friend to protect his mom, and he becomes John's father.  Now, another Arnold bot is sent back, along with Robert Patrick.  But now Arnold is reprogrammed to save John, who is now 10.  Patrick is a new prototype called the T-1000, made of liquid metal.  If Arnold was hard to kill in the first movie, this guy should prove interesting.  Go see this movie if you want thrills and action.  I guarantee you will be satisfied.	5.0	He's Back	2002-03-10	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A33M07VZBYRMPY	Andy H.	Terminator 2 goes deeper into the story about Sarah Conner and the machine world, which reflects the overall quality of production to the movie. The blu-ray version is by far more realistic and clear than the DVD version. This version contains much special effects that look just unreal, considering it was shot back in the early 1990s.	5.0	the best terminator movie	2012-04-29	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3BFJFJRXMWXAX	Andy Williamson	TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY is the DVD to judge all others by.  This dvd earns my highest rating.  The film itself is good as well.  Specifically, this set is laid out better than any I have ever seen.  The menu boards are consistently interesting to look at-you don't necessarily want to just race thru them.  The depth of material buried deep within these discs is amazing.  This is the way all DVD's should be done: extras up the wazoo, deleted scenes that are actually interesting (Cameron should have left a few of them in), storyboards, alternate endings (thank God it wasn't used-although Sarah Connor's final soliloquy is horribly cheesy in the theater version as well), featurettes and the like.  Not to mention the INCREDIBLE picture and sound quality.  Wow.  NO pixelation, NO artifacts, NO pauses, jumps or anything else.  The only other DVD I've seen with comparable picture quality is &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, and that is a reference disc.So for all of you out there who waited for this film to come out, here it is-the ULTIMATE version of not only this film, but EVERY film yet released on DVD.  It is hard to imagine anything that could make this DVD better, cleaner, crisper, more definitive etc.  This is as good as it gets folks.Essential.	5.0	THE reference DVD.	2002-10-23	1	1	0

I wont review the movie because chances are if you are buying this version its not for the movie.This item is a 1:1 scale plastic replica so its about the size of my head! Its huge, the biggest DVD case Ive ever bought. The base has a tray that slides out to store the 5 DVDs and 1 Blu Ray disk. If you don't like that idea you can keep the DVDs in an included keepsake case. The Replica skull plays sound bites of guns and action scenes from the movie while the eyes light up. For a DVD CASE there is a great deal of detail that went into this. But keep in mind its just that a DVD case. Its not a side show replica that will cost you hundreds of dollars. It's simply a unique limited edition plastic replica DVD case painted chrome.I bought mine at best buy and canceled my order on amazon. Yeah it cost me more money but the outer box is mostly clear plastic. This stands a good chance of being damaged in shipping. If you are a collector I suggest shelling out a few extra bucks and pick it up locally in person vs having it shipped if that option is available to you.Assuming you buy yours at Best Buy, and you are NOT a collector and actually plans on opening it- You may find ""BEST BUY EXCLUSIVE"" sticker on the front advertising a $50 Sideshow collectible gift card inside. I assume from reading the sticker this is only available at BEST BUY. So if there is no sticker assume there is no Gift Card inside.Now on to the Disks and features. You get the New SkyNet Edition Blu ray  disk, a digital copy, and all 4 special feature DVDs from both previous editions (Extreme and Ultimate editions) making this a 1 stop shop ultimate collection for any T2 fan who doesn't own any of the other versions. Or an expensive double dip if you do own any of the previous versions.Over 8 hrs of interactive extras and 6.1 DTS-HD audio and the D Box option.If you are unaware of what DBOX is, its an add on device that you connect to your audio system and the other end under your seat. This device then turns sound into vibration so you feel like you are in the movie.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	The metal box cover aside, this DVD is an incredible find, packed full of additional features and tons of material.  Down to the basics, first.The DVD iself comes in a very poignant (no joke) and well-themed metal case, no more than a slip cover for the DVD, really, but very well made and pretty cool to display.  Word of caution, though, you might find that the metal inside could rip the plastic covering on the DVD box itself, the real case inside.  Just something to keep in mind, but nothing really important.The content has both the original movie shown in theatres, with all the cuts and scenes left out and still keeping just about all of the continuity.  Disc 1, though, features the director's cut, beautifully remastered and adrenline-packed, with 16 minutes of additional footage!  Some of the scenes were cut mostly for time reasons.  A few of the scenes were a bit out of place, somewhat important in their own right, but not adding a whole lot to the story, and were cut for continuity's sake.  I'm not sure if I totally agree with every scene cut, and I usually watch only the special edition, finding that those scenes, at least a few, are more important to characterization and background than they are time-consuming.The second disc, along with the original theatre screened movie, is loaded with specials and making-of bits.  It's quite informative and very thorough.  Any fan of this movie will enjoy the secrets (as if they didn't know already) and the behind-the-scenes look at the film.  Fans of sci-fi, action, and serious drama will enjoy the movie as well.  It is a deep movie, hence why I believe it to be Cameron's best.  He really lays it out for us, the direction in which humanity might possibly be heading.  Still, the presence throughout the movie of hope, of a brighter future, is in the prevelant message: &quot;The future is not set.  There is no fate except what we make for ourselves.&quot;  It is deep in some aspects, pure action in others, but a great blend and a truly riveting movie, one that I watch time and time again and still remember that we need to be better to each other as human beings.  May we all learn something from our mistakes.Enjoyable, poignant, riveting, exciting, and ground-breaking special effects.  If you are even remotely a fan of one of these facets, then T2 Extreme DVD is a must-add to your collection.	5.0	Probably Cameron's finest movie, incredible DVD!	2004-03-22	0	0	0

Actors played their parts well the only flaw is; the original is based in 1984, they had sex in '84 which meant the kid was probably born in '85.  they have the kid as a thirteen year old in T2  making it the year 1998 yet they say the earth blows up in the year 1997.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1N8NRZ0FJ16ZJ	"""atydbwl"""	Imagine now small explosion which emits a ball of light and a beam of light scanning across the screen from left to right, sound following adjacent to the beam, then a small sheet of metal with the logo &quot;T2&quot; gradually getting closer.  As it grows larger, you hear footsteps behind you getting closer.  The logo pauses, likewise for the footsteps.  In a reflection off the logo, the terminator aim a shotgun towards the logo.  With the exploding thunder of a shotgun and shattering sound of metal bursting to pieces, you realize the &quot;T2&quot; logo is no more.  Whilst the metal slowly melts, you notice the liquid metal joining back together.  When pieces become a whole, the puddle forms and slowly rises.  The engulfing tone heard, so recognizably noted is the THX symbol.  You embrace your seat as you witness the letters of the THX symbol being born.That is my favorite part of this DVD.  Which, I'd have to say, was hard to decipher.  This DVD in general just knocks any of the competition out of the water.  This should be the mark of what DVDs should be modeled after.  The reflective aluminum case alone will tell you that this ain't no ordinary DVD.  The menu system is unbelievable.  It is truly remarkable how interactive and flowing the menu is.  Working around the fact that it is complicated to navigate, enjoy watching all the actions taking place when changing menu screens.  There are hidden features (easter eggs) a-plenty in this DVD.The movie itself is flawless.  With three different types to choose from, theatrical, special edition, and ultimate special edition, you might be sitting at your couch for a while now.  The special effects was so elite for it's time you would think it was a movie made recently.  However you have to stop to think that this movie was made a little over 10 years ago now.  You don't even have to have wanted watched the first one or even HAVE to have watched the first one to sit through this one.  This is a story and movie of it's own.  Beautiful transfer unlike the VHS or Laser Disk version of this movie.The sound is phenominal.  Whenever I feel the need to show off my system, I use this movie as a reference.  Dolby Digital EX and DTS ES sound.  I am one to attest that sound MAKES the movie.  Without having the sounds bursting through each discrete channel, I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much.  Thankfully this DVD looks and sounds wonderful.  As a demo, I've described the newly developed THX symbol specially made for this DVD alone.  not only that but the Dolby Digital and DTS intro's are remarkable nonethess.  After you rewind those three things a few times, get past the intro and go onto the prologue.  This is where the fun begins.  Explosions a-plenty, firing and beams from all around you.  Airbornes circling around you.  Not to mention Lazers being shot directly at you.  Rockets shot from behind you, coasting over you, and then exploding in front of you.  Crackling of bones and metal being overrun.  Mid-Air Explosions and then a final crash down to the ground, literally sweeping you off of your feet.  And this is just the prologue.In otherwords, BUY THIS DVD.  IF you don't even like this movie, it's a worthy DVD.	5.0	THX - Best Picture, Best Sound....That says it all	2001-05-23	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	Viewed: 6/07Rate: 76/07: Considering the year that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was made, I've got to be surprised it had been a while to the point where there is a recent influx of pictures with high dependency of special effects in less than a decade. Yet Terminator 2: Judgment Day is neither the film that The Terminator is nor an exhilarating movie experience. Rather it was a chore for me. The first hour was crippled with excessive show-off of special effects and horrendous acting, not to forget to mention the annoying presence Edward Furlong emitted. Surprisingly, Terminator 2: Judgment Day made serious improvements in the second hour with less reliance on special effects as well as everybody's acting had greatly improved. The final thirty minutes of the picture was a reminiscent of Cobra's ending. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only thing watchable in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and that's why I got interested in this second part. The original was way ahead of its time, a classic in its own right, but Terminator 2: Judgment Day was half of that. A quite overrated picture that offers nothing but flash-in-the-pan stuff. Special effects alone do not constitute movies, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day was quick to correct itself in the second hour. As to the story, it is not too bad at all, but it certainly almost feels like as if I've went through this already before. This is probably a stupid question. Say, if Kyle Reese wasn't born until maybe around 2000, following the logic of time, John Connor would be born around 1984 or so. Then, the question is...who comes first? John. So, my point is: if John was first, how could Kyle be his father, considering that Kyle would need to be alive in 2029 or something and get to 1984? To elaborate further, if Kyle wasn't there, then how John can be born? If a different father, does that alter the make-up of the leader? If you think about it, you know that you have a stupid dilemma on hand that would defeat logic. Considering how good the original, I rather not pursue it because I know the logic is self-defeating. As for Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it was too overlong chore for me. Today, the picture has since become vastly overrated. Stick with the original.	4.0	Overrated.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AI46E73DWKD2B	BackToGood	"I just recently re-watched TERMINATOR 2:JUDGMENT DAY (1991) to try to get some understanding as to why SO MANY movie fans think that it is the best of the Terminator films and having seen it, it is worse than I thought! I was sure that I would at least think T2 was good enough to rate closely to it's predecessor T1 and boy was I mistaken! I first saw T2 back in the early 90s and it really didn't blow me away even back then. But that was more due to the fact that I had suffered sequel overload during that time (DIE HARD 2 and LETHAL WEAPON 2 being the main culprits, both of which I loved at the time and can't stand now!), but also that I was more into Arnold Schwarzenegger movies (three Arnie action classics PREDATOR-1987, RUNNING MAN-1988, and TOTAL RECALL-1990 had just come out) than I was into Terminator movies. I just wanted to see an Arnie action film! I know the Terminator is supposedly different from the typical Arnie flick, but I wasn't fully aware of this at the time. In retrospect, I understand better what the Terminator films encompass.With T2, I kind of got an Arnie action film, but not really; it's more of a James Cameron film, which for me, is not really a good thing. I think Cameron is perhaps the most overrated director in modern film history! In T2, Arnie's T800 is really only a nominal (although above the title credits) character; and plays 2nd fiddle to Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton, who overemotes mightily in this) and 10-year old John Connor (an annoying Edward Furlong) and acts as their protector from the T1000. Robert Patrick plays the T1000, whose liquid metal configuration is a cool (if unbelievable) creation. Patrick is actually pretty good in his limited screen time and definitely exudes menace, but the fear of his character is derived more from his seemingly invincible design (backed up by some incredible, groundbreaking CGI) than the actor himself. In T1, we saw Schwarzenegger's T800 bit by bit lose his ""humanity"" to reveal the creature underneath (with the aid of puppetry and stop-motion animation) and that was a lot scarier.The T2 supporting cast ranges from very weak (John's foster parents, who weren't even REMOTELY curious as to why a huge German-accented leather-clad biker was looking for John!) to inconsequential (Sarah's Mexican friend that helped hide them out), but not all their fault as they aren't operating with much of a script. Also, I found myself cringing at certain scenes, and for the wrong reasons! A major example would be the poorly executed (no pun intended) ""key"" scene when the heroic trio go after the T800 creator Dyson: When Arnie's T800 strips off the human skin on his robotic arm to prove their story to Dyson, the bug-eyed reactions of Dyson and his wife were way over-the-top. But the worst part of that scene was Sarah's overly melodramatic crisis of conscience about killing Dyson; Hamilton's acting during that scene was really bad. Contrast an ineffectual manipulative ""Hollywood"" scene like this one to the more ""naturalistic"" character reactions in T1, which wasn't made with some studio bigwigs getting in the way of the director's vision. Also, I thought the whole Dyson subplot to be kind of tacked on.Arnie's one-liners (which shouldn't even really exist in a movie like this) come off as mostly stale due to a painfully weak, by-the-numbers script. I couldn't believe how poor the dialogue was when I saw this again recently! Not really even an attempt at realism or humor. The dialogue serves as filler material to either try to be cute with silly catchphrases (and dated ones at that) or to pontificate unnecessarily about nuclear war and the fate of humanity. T1 didn't have such waste in it, cutting to the chase (literally) and even the expository dialogue and scenes were PART OF the action, rather than being separate from it like in T2.James Cameron is not really one of my favorite directors (although I think T1 is perhaps the best sci-fi action film of all time), but he did a tremendous job of helping to usher in a new era of special effects with T2 (major reason why I'm at least giving it 3 stars!). The 20-year old effects are still very eye-catching indeed and top even a lot of the current CGI in movies now. But the main problem with the effects is, as previously alluded to, with the logic behind the makeup Patrick's T1000 character. Are we supposed to accept at face value that such an unlikely creation from the not-so-distant future is even possible? Yeah, it's cool, but it's there as simply an excuse for action and to wow us with advanced effects, whereas in T1, Arnie's T800 was an actual CHARACTER! When it comes to CGI vs. character, give me character anyday!"	3.0	Doesn't measure up to it's predecessor	2010-05-01	13	2	11

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	"This movie was the overwhelmingly successful sequel to the original ""Terminator"" film that had established the series as well as the plausible context for this return to the science fiction genre and the notion of a world at risk at the hand of a murderous seemingly unstoppable cyborg. This time Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg sent back from the future and reprogrammed by Sarah Connor's son to save her and him (as a boy) from another, much more dangerous and technologically advanced cybernetic organism  (a T-1000 series) sent back to eliminate them all.  And so the incredible chase established in the first film resumes!Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, this time much more savvy, cunning, and street-smart. Newcomer Edward Furlong plays her son, and Robert Patrick plays Schwarzenegger's indefatigable adversary, the quicksilver T-1000 cyborg.  A number of others from the original movie are also in this sequel, and the movie propels all of them on through another series of sequences and situations at a speed that is both breathtaking and awe-inspiring. There is also a lot of humor here, as Furlong's character comes to trust and even love the Schwarzenegger cyborg as it protects and helps him to free his mother and evade the T-1000. Some of the language is a bit blue, for Arnold learns from Furlong how to free-associate among a string of four-letter invectives in establishing a running commentary regarding the actions of his foes.This is a superior thriller, and stands well against the test of time. Some of the special effects are absolutely spellbinding, and the film will easily hold your rapt attention throughout its more than two hour length. Rumor has it that Schwarzenegger and company have agreed to begin production on a new sequel, T-3, sometime in the near-term future. You will love this movie, and I can highly recommend it.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A351XMJF8DCD8Z	"bart ""wwfrockfan"""	"Just so you know, this review is for the Ultimate Edition, not the badly reviewed Extreme dvd.  I'm gonna start this review with a little history.  Terminator 2 has been my favorite movie of all time.  It was a yr ago when I had first got a dvd player and my brother and I decided that one day in the future, we will own the ultimate edition of T2.  We would have bought it right if we had not already owned it the movie on video.  It was not that long after that I heard that Artisan was releasing a new edition of T2 called ""The Extreme DVD"".  We thought about getting that after seeing that it might be good.  But after hearing all the negative reviews, we decided to stick with the Ultimate.  But there was a problem; The Ultimate Edition was going out of stock.  Soon on every market shelf, there was The Extreme Dvd in place of where the Ultimate edition used to be.  I guess we can say that the Extreme had taken over.One day over the summer, I was at a store and for fun, I decided to check if there Ultimate edition in stock.  As predicted, the shelf was full of Extreme dvd's, but under the huge pile of dvd's there was ONE Ultimate edition of T2.  It may have been the last one available in the whole state so I bought right away.  At first, I was a bit disappointed with the dvd.  One reason was because I had first owned the movie on video so I asked myself ""Did I really have to buy this movie"".  I know the video was old and the picture was a little blurry but it was still in decent condition.  I felt like I wasted my money.  Also it's a widescreen.  I know 99 percent of people prefer widescreen but I like full screen (but I am willing to look past that). But after a while, I decided to explore the dvd and realize that it's a great dvd.  Hell, it may be the best dvd in the world.  It has got so much stuff on just one disc!  It has many documentaries on it, cast and crew info, audio commentary, 2 versions of the film, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround ex, DTS 5.1 ex, trailors, dolby surround 2.0, over 700 story boards, entire screenplay, lots of features that include the making of t2 from make-p to visual effects, and the animated dvd menus are really cool and much more.  Enough about that, here is the plot.Its been about ten years since the events of the first film.  The Skynet and machines of the future want to once again to attempt to eliminate the leader of the human resistance, John Conner.  They now send a more advanced terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick).  This thing is made up of liquid metal and can imitate anything it touches by physical contact as long as its something of equal size and it something that doesn't have moving parts; like a machine, ex-. a gun.  It can form solid metal shapes, ex- a knife.  The humans too have sent a terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and programmed it to protect John (Edward Furlong).  He first must find John, and then help get his mom Sarah (Linda Hamilton) out of a mental hospital.  It is said that somewhere between the time after the first movie and before the second movie, Sarah tried to stop the existence of Skynet by destroying the company who will build it.  She was stopped and sent to the psychiatric clinic for he stories of the ""machine from the future"".  After getting her out, the 3 then go on a quest to once again try to prevent the existence of by stopping the computer genius Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), who will eventually build it.  At the same time, they must also keep John alive and away from the deadly T-1000.Anyway, T2 has to be the greatest movie of all time and I am happy have it on the ultimate dvd.  For those of you who are reading this, if your not happy with you Extreme dvd, then I think you should tell Artisan to re-release the Ultimate Edition b/c I am sure that will everybody happy."	5.0	My favorite movie of all time on one great dvd	2004-04-03	2	1	1

And the second.Such great juxtaposition of having what was formerly the evil Terminator Arnold come back in time as a good guy to defend the very same man he was targeting to kill in the previous movie. Such amazing effects with the liquid metal terminator, and so TELLING of how reality functions I might add. And such fantastic action scenes as ALL the actors all play off eachother so... fantastically.it is a sensual delight. And the funny thing is, it made me want a liquid terminator girlfriend.. oh the things we would do togethe!Butt I digress. The Director's cut has some pretty telling scenes that demonstrate the nature of the Terminators, one scene in particular shows the liquid terminator fumbling around in John's room, demonstrating the director's vision that the Terminator could not actually 'see' and that it's understanding of areas and buildings was all preloaded like software.little things like this, all throughout the movie, which added depth to the characters and a perspective for the viewer without adding lines.Definitely worth the view, and easily the best of the series.	5.0	Watch the EXTRAS!	2014-06-04	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AZ3KW35E2BSVV	B	I found out nearly a year ago (when I bought my new blu-ray player) that brand new release blu-ray DVDs use the latest technology, which means you have to update your blu-ray player's software (firmware) every month or two.  Aggravating - but a fact you get used to.  If you can't play this DVD, find out how to update your player's firmware.(By the way, my 4 stars is my rating of the movie itself... not my personal blu-ray problem.)	4.0	Blu-Ray Players Constantly need Software Upgrade	2009-05-21	5	1	4
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A11ERLOY4HCPA4	Big Ron	"This movie has been one of my favorites. I owned it on laser disc in the early 90's.  It looked superb and sharp on my 32"" TV. Turns out maybe the reason it looked so crisp back then was because 450 lines of resolution was about the limit of what could be seen.When I rented it on Blu-ray and played it, I couldn't believe my eyes.  It appears that it was not filmed on the highest quality film stock.  It looks slightly soft at times and just plain undefined.  Not razor sharp and prestine.  The opening nighttime battle scene is one example. The T-1000's arrival under the bridge is another, and Arnold's arrival next to the big rig trucks is yet another example. Yet the daytime scenes in sunlight some look a bit better.  That includes the scene with the two kids going to the bank's ATM.INTERESTING DVD COMPARISON - I have the same movie on DVD.  I played it in the Blu-ray player which upconverted it.  It looks ALMOST the same as the HD version. This movie is only slightly better in HD at best. I've seen older movies than this one that look  much more detailed.The best part about this disc is the redesigned main menu graphics and the updated 2003 commentary featuring the director. THAT'S IT.BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see what Blu-ray can do, this movie is NOT the one to get.UPDATE 2/2011: I newer version of the movie called the ""Skynet Edition"" was released on Blu-ray in 2009.  It's much better than the original 2006 Blu-ray and higher quality than a upscaled DVD.  Not razor-edge sharp but very clean and crisp."	1.0	"ONE OF THE WORST SO-CALLED ""HI-DEFINITION"" TITLES"	2008-01-07	46	40	6
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A394IRECLUKU0R	Big Tony Marooner	"""I'll be back""These words have never sounded so foul to human ears than when pronounced by Arnold Schwarzenegger (i deserve to get this posted for spelling it right) This is a bad remake of a bad film.There are so many mistakes in the film:1)The T-1000 punches his body through the window of a helicopter to get inside. An instant later, the hole in the windshield is gone2)The computer that the T-1000 reads in the police car (at the beginning) reads that John is 10 years old and was born on February of 1985. Which means that the movie would have to take place in 1995 ( 2 years before Judgement Day). Yet, Arnold claims in the car, (while driving towards Mexico) that Judgement Day would happen in 3 years, just after the Skynet funding bill is passed by congress3)After The Terminator exists the bar in the beginning, and takes the gun from the 'bar owner' he takes his arm down from the barrel. Next scene his arm it is back in the original position on the barrel4)In the bar fight scene Arnold gets stabbed by one of the bikers - if you put it in slow motion you see the rubber knife bend in a few frames.And hasn't it become a cliche that all Mexicans have a US army supply store in the garden with a mustach  while drinking whiskeyThank you please"	1.0	T2 this is your Judgement!!!	2003-01-09	32	6	26
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AH4XETKRJS413	Bill Foskett	This is a fantastic movie if you have a big screen TV and a DTS set up. I am lucky to have a 22 year old son to set these things up for me and they sound really great with very clear shot gun shells hitting the ground and bullets bouncing off police cars, and my favorite was the helicopter chasing a truck under a freeway. The sound there was extremely real! Being able to look at how the movie was made, and the tricks used to make it all happen, will keep me busy for a long time.

The only thing that would have made it sweeter is if they'd included the Guns 'n' Roses music video for ""You Could Be Mine"" which was on the three-disc Pioneer laserdisc box set - here all we get are still photos from the video. (There are also a couple of audio Easter eggs on the three-disc laserdisc set: one in which if you play through all the chapter menus, you'll hear Arnold say, ""I have detailed files"", and the other in which if you press Play on the LD player instead of step through the script, you'll see the animation and T2 music play through from the main title credits.)

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	APMHG04VBS07E	Bobby	First, my rating is for this disc, not the movie. I give the movie 5 stars. I also give the disc 5 stars... IF you have a compatible bluray player. I got this for a christmas present from my mom. We tried to watch it while at her house and could not because of all the extra 2.0 menu crap. There was no way to skip it for us. Others said they could just hit cancel on the first message that said it couldn't connect tot he internet. They said they could wait a while and the movie would finally play... My mom has a brand new visio bluray player (with net apps if that tells you how new). it is a 2.0 player. It took about 5 minutes to get the first message about the internet... I canceled out of that, then waited... then waited... then waited some more. We walked down to the beach for a bit and came back... and it was still sitting on a black screen... it never played! For that, this ITEM gets 1 star.I brought the movie home and it played without a problem on my panasonic. When you get the full effect, the skynet edition is pretty cool but honestly, who cares to see the stuff that makes it the skynet edition more than once?	1.0	Rating the disc, not the movie!	2010-12-28	9	5	4
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1RPKCLVRLU062	Bob Carpenter	I was about to buy this disk when I did some more research on high-definition DVDs and learned from a report from Sander Sassen of the Netherlands at the Hardware Analysis site that the high definition version of this disk requires (a) the installation of a separate piece of digital rights software, called Interactual Player, (b) an internet connection to the Interactual license server, and (c) an IP address that the license server believes is in the United States or Canada.  And then the license you get is good only for four days.  It is possible to get around issue (c) by using an anonymous proxy server in the United States, such as the proxy for free site.In addition to the licensing requirements, the HD version requires Windows Media Player Version 9, which is included with Windows XP.The movie, T2, is an absolute must see for any sci-fi fan, but you probably already knew that.	3.0	Digital Rights Management (DRM) Issues	2004-12-14	6	4	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1XMNCX6ST5443	"Brainiac ""DMC"""	"This ""Skynet Edition"" of T2 is the best looking release of T2 to date. The picture is sharp and detailed. It's not overly grainy, nor does it look like the grain has been reduced too much.I can't judge the audio from a home-theater buff's perspective, as my only audio source is the TV's built-in speakers, but it sounds great on my TV. The main uncompressed audio track has a very wide dynamic range...sometimes too wide, actually. I have to turn the sound up quite a bit to hear dialogue clearly, then I'm blown away by the action scenes which are way too loud. This might not be as much of an issue for those with better audio systems though.The only gripe I have about this disc is the insanely slow loading times. I have a pretty new Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-Ray player and the disc takes 2-3 minutes to load initially. Once the main menu has loaded, you can watch the film and special features easily, but if you want to watch with any of the informational overlays (script, production notes, storyboards, etc.) in the ""interactive mode"" then you have to wait again as the interactive mode loads. Just plan on taking a bathroom break or something after you pop the disc in while you wait for it to load.The BD-Live feature is, I think, a big plus on this disc. Several ""making-of"" type features that were on previous releases of T2 can be downloaded via the BD-Live interface. So even though you don't own every previous DVD release of the film, you can still watch the special features that came with them. There are some other BD-Live features which I haven't tried, such as an interactive chess game of some sort.If you haven't picked up T2 on Blu-Ray, this is definitely the one to get. Great picture, great sound, and good special features make this worth the price you pay for it, as long as you don't mind the slow loading times."	4.0	Great looking disc, but very slow-loading	2009-06-29	2	2	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AYT4FJYVCHYLE	Brett Benner	This is the must have disc for anyone wondering what the hype is over DVD.  Artisan has done a bang up job on this ultimate edition, which contains  both the original theatrical version and the special edition which has  multiple deleted scenes. The menu screen alone is exhaustive and  imaginative, replicating the interior of the Cyberdine.  Every aspect of  the film is covered extensively from preproduction through marketing of the  film with interviews with the cast and crew. There's also a &quot;making  of&quot; the T2-3D attraction that's housed at both Universal Studios in  Hollywood and Florida.-No video here, simply pictures and text.  The DVD  also comes with a booklet (much needed to break everything down) that has  chapter listings for both the original and special edition, and a  collectors metal slip case that wraps around the case. The movie, after  almost ten years, holds up really well, with the special effects still  something to marvel at. Even the THX opening has been  &quot;Terminatorfied&quot;.  If you're on the fence about it, trust me,  it's worth every penny. It's too bad all DVD's weren't approached with such  care. Although if they were,there'd be no reason to leave the house.	5.0	Overwhelmingly thorough	2000-09-19	2	2	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3BN8S0FFHK3XC	Brett Michael  Roberts	This new &quot;Ultimate Edition DVD&quot; of Terminator 2 Judgement Day, one of the biggest box office smashes of all time, is truly The Ultimate Edition. Unless you get this outside of the US (which I did) you have two disks. One disk is the movie (THREE versions of the movie, in fact), and the next disk is all the special features. And it takes DAYS getting through every feature. I mean, three documentary, 8 trailers and TV spots, an entire script, interviews that you can access separately, and 52 chapters of behind the scenes footage, from makeup to visual effects, from editing to restoring deleted scenes. There are so many special features, this is what DVD was made for! You can also look at the original drawings of certain scenes, awesome!!!!However, I find the real highlight of this disk (or disks) to be the movie itself, I mean WOW!!! You get three, I repeat, three, versions of the movie. One is the original theatrical version, featuring no cut out scenes (the worst), the special edition, featuring 16 minutes of additional footage (second best) and the Extended Special Edition that you need a code for (the best) which features 18 minutes of additional footage, as well as an alternate ending. Here, now, I will give you a step-by-step description of how to get this extended special edition. I'm sure most of you people reading this know how to already, but this is for those who didn't know this version existed, or don't know how to get it. What you do is, you go to the features menu. It'll say &quot;Theatrical Version&quot; and &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Click on &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Then, you highlight &quot;Play Special Edition&quot; and type in (you may have to type ENTER in-between each number) EIGHT TWO NINE NINE SEVEN (8 2 9 9 7) and then, the &quot;Go To Theatrical Version&quot; option changes to &quot;Play Extended Special Edition&quot;. This is the definitive version of the movie. I believe that every single little, tiny scene that they cut out is in this version. Well, thats the code, now back to my review.The picture and audio on this disk are SO awesome, you won't believe it. Crystal clear picture, and sound so loud that it's like you're in a movie theatre. The additional, restored scenes are remastered as well, and slip perfectly into the movie. If you haven't even seen the film, you won't even notice these scenes put into it. Usually, on additional scenes, the picture is dirty and shakes. Not in these added scenes. And, to make it even better, the scenes are presented in 2:35:1 widescreen anamorphic format. Yes!! Just the first disk makes this DVD the ultimate edition!! Also, there's an audio commentary by 26 members of the cast and crew, however, this commentary is just interviews put together to sound like a commentary. However, there's a noticable glitch in the theatrical version, due to the commentary. Well, if you watch this commentary on one of the special editions, you'll notice it's the same commentary as the theatrical version, but they talk about deleted scenes as well. You may, also, notice that they continue talking about the deleted &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; at the hospital, when it goes into the next scene. So, now, when you watch the theatrical version, you'll notice that the beggining scene with Sarrah Connor watching the tape from six months ago, the beggining of the scene is cut off!!! Oops! Well, that's forgivible. Now, the second disk (or the second side of the disk) has lots of special features. The three documentarys include &quot;The Making Of Terminator 2 Judgement Day&quot;, &quot;T2 More Than Meets The Eye&quot;, where they talk about deleted sequences and the reason they were cut. The last is &quot;The Making Of Terminator 2 3-D Breaking The Screen Barrier&quot;, about the making of that 3-D terminator ride. I loved that ride (yes, I went on it) and this documentary is really interesting. The rest of the features, well, I'm not sure I kinow all of them. Maybe YOU should discover all the features on this disk. If you own the previous DVD release of T2 (which had no extras), then trash it and get this &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. You WON'T be dissipointed.If you found my review helpful, please be sure and vote for me! Thank You Very Much!	5.0	The Most Awesome DVD Ever Created. Trash The Old Disk!	2001-10-17	1231	1144	87
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AEHNPK5XULPNB	Brett N	Terminator 2 is a great follow up from the original Terminator, and even  better. This time Arnold plays a protector for John Connor(Ed Furlong). The  T-1000 played by Robert Patrick is an excellent role, as he looks freaky,  and is a great T-1000.Linda Hamilton plays Sara Connor, another great  performance by her. The sound on the dvd is almost flawless, due to the low  activity in the surrounds, it would get a perfect 5. But the video transfer  IS flawless, almost as good as Fight Club. The music score in T2 is  different as we hear a bunch of noise, that sounds like STOMP, but it fits.  Great Story, And an excellent action movie .

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A15LTLCGCHP6Y8	Brian Uyeda	The audio transfer is great.  The video transfer is good.  The Blu-Ray authoring is terrible.I have a Sony BDP-S590 player which is current enough to have 3-D and Wi-Fi, but this Blu-ray ran super slow.  It doesn't help when extra menus (aka barriers) are inserted before I can play the movie.  Like a number of other Blu-rays, the player can't recall where I left off after the machine has been restarted.  Okay, I don't like that but, it's a common annoyance.  Also, many of the bonus features requires downloading to view which is again time consuming when the files are 500Mb.  If I wanted to download, I would have bought this on iTunes, not on on a high-capacity Blu-ray.  But there are outright bugs in the authoring like deleting an existing bonus feature while another is downloading causes the exiting download to stop.  And I was able to hear the correct audio for behind the scenes access the first time, but not for subsequent playbacks.Basically, if the person or team that created the Blu-ray menus created Skynet, mankind would have no worries because we'd be able to defeat anything that functioned this poorly.	2.0	Bad Blu-Ray Design	2013-05-13	0	0	0

Watching the Blu-ray, it was like a gray screen had been removed from between me and the TV. Audio is also substantially better than the DVD release.If just a better looking and sounding movie isn't enough for you, then just about every bonus feature ever created for T2 has been ported over to this Blu-ray release.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgement Day was the mega-hit blockbuster of 1991. Starring Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the infamous T-800, the film has become one of the  most beloved ScFi/Action films of all time. The sequel to Cameron's cult  classic The Terminator (1986), the film picks up the story ten years after  the failed 1985 assaination of Sarah Connor. Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is now  locked away in a federal assylum, and John (Edward Furlong) is living with  a unloving foster family. As mentioned in the film's mythic introduction,  another terminator has been sent through this time to kill John as a boy.  However, another terminator, ironically played by Arnold Schwarzenegger,  has been sent to protect him. The concept of machine fighting machine for  the existance of the human race was a artisitc mastersroke. The menace and  invinciabily of Robert Patrick's ominous T-1000 adds the hyperkinetic spark  that make this film so thrillingly fun. This innovation gives the film the  creative edge and orginality to equal the first Terminator in both  intensity and emotional impact. One of the most important ScFi films of the  1990's, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is an intellectually intensive action  epic with much more philosophical impact than your average popcorn movie.

Arnold has an excellent role as the Terminator assigned to protect John. His enemy, another Terminator which is more  advanced than him, who has been assigned to destroy John, the leader of the  humans. The movie has great sound and radical special effects. The whole  movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.The fighting scenes were very good  and the ending was a bit abrupt, but rather sad. I strongly recommend this  one to those of you who enjoy great action and great fight scenes. Watch  it, then if ya like it, buy it here!	5.0	Terminator 2	2000-03-18	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2EHYCA29NSQLU	Bud	I am a Blu-ray noob, but I could not get past the BD-Live features of this disc and watch the movie.  It did play on another player, but it was slow, and the Skynet menus, etc., did not add anything worthwhile.  I would avoid this version since Amazon does not allow returns if it doesn't work in your equipment.  Get the non-Skynet version instead.I do give it 2 stars because it is still a great movie, but the picture quality, while better than DVD, is not up to newer HD releases if you have a screen capable of 1920 resolution.	2.0	Doesn't play on non-Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player	2009-09-25	4	2	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2PL1SCQ38US2A	"Cainz ""cainz"""	This review is for the Ultimate DVD edition of T2, which is far superior than any other version on any format.  First off, the movie itself is a great.  It is destined to be a classic.  Great story, good action, special effects that were well ahead of it's time, and even great emotional drama as well.  This was one great movie.Next, I must give praise about the excellent picture quality and awesome sound.  The picture transfer on this DVD is great.  Crystal clear.  Nice and sharp.  And then...there's the sound.  Boy I tell, you, the sound on this DVD rocks!  If you have a great setup, you'll really appreciate the 5.1 and DTS sound on this one.  Turn it up and you'll let the great soundscape of this DVD immerse you into it's world.  This is another one of those discs that can be utilized to show off your high end system with.  Going even further, this DVD edition has the most extras packed into a DVD that I've seen in a while.  Extra footage, commentary, you name it.  A whole disc devoted to that stuff.  An extra branching feature seamlessly lets you watch the movie with the extra footage, which I thought was great.In all honesty, I recommend this particular version VERY HIGHLY.  I seriously think that anyone who has a high end setup and appreciates great DTS, DD 5.1 sound, and superb picture transfer should get this version.  It's a must have.  I would also recomend this to those who have a DVD player without the high end system setup, becuase the just the movie and exras that come with it are worth the price alone.  If you don't own it and are considering getting it, what are you waiting for?  It's worth every penny.  You won't be disappointed	5.0	Among the best all-around DVD's ever made.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	The original Terminator was something very special and was the film that kick started the career of one of the biggest action movie stars in history. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the original Terminator was the definitive bad guy; violent, emotionless and unstoppable. That same character returned for the sequel, but this time he joined the defending team and was sent back by future John Connor to protect the past John Connor. Arnold is still a T-101 but was reprogrammed by future Connor to fight on the human's side, and rather than having a human enemy, the story is very much Terminator vs. More advanced Terminator.Judgement Day focuses around a 10 year old John Connor whose mother, Sarah has been put in a mental institute for telling the stories of the original Terminator assassination attempt and John is a rebel living in a foster home. Another Terminator has been sent back to kill the future leader of the human resistance, now a much more powerful enemy, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) which is a machine that is made almost entirely of liquid metal. It can morph itself to look exactly like anything it touches and mould parts of its body to sharp objects to assassinate those who get in its way. As the protector, a reprogrammed T-101 (Arnold) is sent back to protect the young rebel.Taking the guise of a police officer, the T-1000 goes on a rapid search for John and comes very close to catching him, but at the right moment is found by the T-101 and has the best man (or machine) for the job as his protector. Once John becomes aware of his possible future, he and the T-101 embark on a journey to not only break Sarah Connor out of the mental institute, but to destroy Skynet and prevent Judgement Day and the rise of the machines. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now a tough woman who appears tougher than the T-101 and becomes the leader of the attack on Skynet.The original Terminator movie at the time was considered really hard to top as at the time of the sequels release, the original had gained a massive cult status. Nobody really considered just how good this film would be and it came along at a time when Arnold was developing his career as a diverse actor, whilst still remaining loyal to the action movie genre. Also, hot off the cusp of the massive film, The Predator, there was no doubting there would be more interest in this solely because of Schwarzenegger's involvement. Of course, a massive budget of $102 million and the involvement of Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't necessarily make a good film. What made this great was its pace, atmosphere, acting, action, script and special effects all masterfully combined to create what was undoubtedly the film of that year.The clarity of the special effects of the time was revolutionary, much like the special effects exhibited in the first Terminator. They managed to make the T-1000 machine utterly believable in its presence and ability to mould itself and transform at will as we were treated to particular moments in which it did just that. Most impressive was its rising from the mental hospital floor behind one of the guards, only to kill him and take his form. The makeup of the damage taken by the T-101 was also very well done and really did make it believable that Arnold was possibly really a machine underneath that masculine exterior.Linda Hamilton is triumphant in this role and a complete re-imagining of the character we know from the first film. The Sarah Connor from this movie is vociferously brutish in her demeanour and is clearly a woman who has experienced something very traumatic that has meant she needed to lose the core emotions that weakened her in order to survive. Edward Furlong as the main protagonist for the entire Terminator story arch displayed a perfect character and the rebellious kid attitude was performed really well by him. It almost makes me wonder what the hell those involved in the third Terminator movie were thinking by not casting him in the lead role once more.I honestly adore this film as it manages to become unconsciously deep and expressing of the idea to remain emotionally close whilst at the same time remaining strong in your convictions. It was well deserving of the awards it won at the time and it's quite sad to know that any future Terminator movies will not pale in comparison to the brilliance of Terminator 2. Buy it or rent it, either way, you will love it.	5.0	Amazing	2009-06-23	2	1	1

Terminator 2 is awesome.You can't beat Arnie as a hero. You also have both classic catchphrases with a new one. The enemy is more threatening/powerful. We already have the cold hero Arnie. We have the soldier Sarah Conner. We have the silver nemesis T-1000. Add to the mix young &#34;this is my town&#34; John Conner, and we have a perfect blended cast of characters. The action isn't bad either.In terms of the blu-ray disc, the quality is great and same for the special features.Totally reccomended!Goodbye, everyone!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A143WM0JPY8DRZ	Carol Coston Postle	I am an avid DVD collector, and this Disc is absolutely the best I own.  I am a big &quot;deleted scenes&quot; buff, and this disc realy came thru in that department.  The Supplemental Material is practically a film school on T2.  There are 3, yes 3, versions of the movie on the first disc.  The third is the &quot;Extended Special Edition&quot; which contains two scenes the &quot;Special EDition&quot; left out: A scene where the T-1000 searches John's room and an alternate &quot;Future Coda&quot; ending.  To access this verion of the film, select &quot;speical edition&quot; after putting in the first disc.  O the menu where you can play the sp. edition, skip to a scene, or go to the theatrical version, enter 82997, the date of judgment day on your DVD remote.  &quot;Play Extended Cut&quot; should pop up as an option.  NOTE: I don't think this works if you enter it on your computer keyboard.Anyway, If you liked the film even a little bit, BUY THIS DISC.  The picture and Sound Quality are superb.This film is rated &quot;R&quot; for strong violence and language, and some mild nudity.	5.0	The best DVD I own	2001-07-11	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AK5448HOQZAOE	C. Cobb	"I have seen this movie exactly 2 times: In the theaters when it came out and this evening, January, 19, 2013.  In many ways the effects hold up even after 21 or so years.  I remember being blown away when the T-1000 came out of the wreckage of the semi truck for the first time and thought ""wow!""  These days it's pretty tame.  The acting by both the terminators was mediocre at best, but the best acting was by Linda Hamilton.  She transformed herself into one kick butt lady!  Especially when one juxtaposes the first with the second.  I am loath to give it 5 stars, because it really is not that good.I give it 3 stars mostly because of what it did for its time.  It was one of the first blockbuster films to use computer graphics in the capacity that it did.  There were others before it, like Tron, but that was just cheesy eye candy, this had a lot more depth and gave the terminator a personality, albeit a minor one, that played off John's character well.  It is a shame that Edward Furlong (John) turned into a complete loser later in life as he had some potential, but like most kids in films, he got into drugs and alcohol and that ended that.I don't blame Linda Hamilton for not reprising her role in the third, as the reviews were bad and I couldn't bring myself to watch the movie after learning that Hamilton wouldn't do it.  That spoke volumes.T2 was a good action film for its day, but it will probably be another 21-22 years before I watch it again."	3.0	Better than the original, but definitely aged some	2013-01-19	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1WGY6MZDZ1H9J	C. E. Ivy	In almost every case I've encountered, the director's cut far surpasses what was shown in the theaters. In the case of James Cameron, it was true  of &quot;The Abyss&quot;, and it's true for T2. The theatrical cut can be  watched on this DVD, but so can the &quot;Special Edition&quot; (and if you  pay close attention to the DVD menues, you can unlock an Extended Special  Edition with a different ending...) The Special Edition just makes more  sense than the theatrical version -- there's a lot more dealing with the  CPU that makes the Terminator and SkyNet tick; more family time with Miles  Dyson; and more scenes showing the cruelty (and flaws) of the T-1000. All  in all, it makes the characters face more challenges than in the theatrical  cut, which gives them all more depth and makes for a better picture.	5.0	When will the studios learn?	2000-09-02	0	0	0

The acting, action, and special effects are top notch, but the movie is somewhat hampered by weak dialog between John and The Terminator, but honestly it isn't that distracting and dialog really is not why we watch these movies.This is a strong addition to The Terminator franchise.Recommended!CFH"	4.0	Enjoyable Sequel - Recommended!	2013-02-02	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1MS5ZM0GKM7Q1	"""chornuy"""	WOW!!!  This is for sure my favorite movie of all time and I doubt I'll ever change my mind.  I'm in love with this movie cause the actors are awesome(Arnold especially), action scenes 24/7, very good special effects for a 91 movie, and storyline is awesome.  I know people who think matrix is really cool since it's like about us being in a computer,etc.  But I'm not a big fan of that.  But the story of how machines become self-aware in T2 is a really good one.  Even thought that would never happen and the movie is kinda sci-fi with Arnold getting sent back in time and all...I don't pay attention to that...this movie is freakin awesome!!!Arnold was the perfect guy for this movie and It's all cause of him this flick is such a huge hit.  The whole cast did an awesome job.  I watched this movie countless times...I'm a huge fan. ...My favorite scene in T2 is when when that one lady working in that mental hospital punches Arnold's face and breaks his shades...then he just turns his face back and throws her by just shoving her face.  I crack up at that part every time and I'm doing that now that I'm remembering that scene....T1 was kinda dumb cause the special effects were really [weak], Arnold was the bad guy, there wasn't that much action like in T2, and all the music sounded like it was from a Nintendo game...lol.  When I heard T3 was coming out I waited forever for that movie to come out and when I saw it I really liked it, but I didn't like it better than T2 because it didn't have John Connor in it and the new vilan (terminatrix) was kinda shady, but still good.  I would give Kristana Loken a 9 and Robert Patrick a 10. ...	5.0	I wish there were words to describe this movie	2003-08-24	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AMLOFV2DTBJ3E	"Chris A. Politz ""Chris Politz"""	With VHS there was always a fairly visible vapor that affected the film.  With DVD we saw a new image.  With Blu-Ray the vapor is eliminated, and the image is heightened to the point that you can see every flaw.  This is the case with most older films that are given the High Def treatment.  Terminator 1 and 2 are no different.  Please watch Independence Day and tell me that ever effect is goofy looking in HD.  The fact is our films under HD are starting to look like those old black and white sci-fi movies we told our parents looked like crap, and we doubted out they could ever fear the Creature From the Black Lagoon.I, however, am a realist.  I get quite excite when I watch a Blu-Ray and can see the flaws.  From dirty windows in the Bourne Series, to the Jittery movement of the De-Swartzenegger'd Terminator.  T-1000s special effects were amazing originally, but now, almost 20 year later, it looks... well, matted.  Because let's face it... they are.Blu-Ray is going to age your films.  Allowing us to see every inch of the movie, all 1080 of it, and is going to also show blemishes, bumps, bruises, and might open the door to a more romanesque interpretation of the artform, instead of the Athenian idealism that preceeded this age.  The reason why this statement is fact is that the entertainment industry is shuffling as we speak to design make-up that is HD safe.My hope is that it is not.  All our favorite films are flawed.  I mean, after all, T1 and T2 do not star the great actor of all time.  Let's face it.  The name at the front of the credits is the first flaw.All the same, I love my copy.  I can't wait to see a true HD movie like Terminator Salvation.  The robots are majorly going to kick butt.	5.0	Blu-Ray is deceptive, and possible Roman	2008-07-23	9	2	7

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A17FW6FREPW9N3	ChrisF	"The actual movie transfer on this disc would rate five stars - a brilliant sharp image with great sound. Also, the writer-director commentary (from 2003) makes an excellent addition to the film.I have down-rated this disc due to the intrusive non-standard additions. Most irritating is the long delay when first loaded as the disc attempts to connect to the internet - since I didn't connect my player this results in an error message requiring a manual bypass. Then there are seemingly endless commercial snatches at the start of the disc, each taking up time before the arrival of the main menu. Extremely irritating is the DTS snatch whose volume level is far above the others resulting in a huge blast of noise.When the main menu is finally displayed you will see cute but non-standard menu headings resulting in more wasted time figuring out what these mean.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AHJ78GCBHHOGP	Christopher Chin	I watched this flick as a child in 1992. 19 years later I bought this HD version and it just bring back the nostalgic value + the best AV experience ever! The clarity of the 20 year old film is just phenomenon. The start up screen as you load the Blu Ray show skynet loading requesting for internet access. You can press cancel to proceed to the main menu.The main menu screen is very cool... showing the part structure of the T101 model. The T2 theme is playing in the background. Very cool menu indeed as there is beeping sound as you navigate through the menu. You can choose to play the theatrical release or the extended version.The clarity of the image is superb. The DTS Master 6.1 soundtrack blow me away throughout the movie. The shotgun sound pumps away with my subwoofer pounding shot after shot. Rear surround is active and always keeping me on the edge of the seat. DAMN... I never enjoyed T2 so much before this.Overall, it is a good buy for whoever that have not gotten any DVD or Blu Ray edition. I have read many reviews indicating too many re-release of this classic flick. I have not seen the rest but this really kick ass on my Onkyo surround system & Samsung LCD TV. This review does not include the extras as there are too many and yet to go through them yet, but they look good and hoping to go through every one of them during weekend!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	APEE242AK8G8G	Christopher Stenner	Although my DVD collection isn't extensive, it holds enough that there's quite a gap between those which are exceptional, and those that fall short.  T2 'The Ultimate' certainly fits with the few exceptional DVD's that I've come across.It's been many years in the coming, but it's certainly been worth the wait.  When T2 first came out, I was full of anticipation as I went to the movie theater as a young kid and saw it.  When I heard there was a new DVD coming out, I was just as excited.. and it didn't let me down.  The movie itself, on DVD, is amazing.. without a doubt.  The beauty of the picture and sound of DVD really helps keep this movie as it should be.  The added materials are outstanding.There are quite a few full length (30 min, give or take) documentaries, 3 in total I believe.  The one I continue to go back onto is the making/thought process of the deleted scenes (which, wonderfully enough, can be seen as part of the movie, if you choose to do so, or you can watch the original) which add to the movie in countless ways.  It gives the movie much more depth, which I found enlightening.. it also adds more feeling to the final scene, and it adds some humor..  the smiling scene is absolutely priceless.Without a doubt, one of the best DVD's that I've come across, and a must have for anyone who enjoyed the movie at it's onset, and certainly worth a look for anyone else.. especially those who enjoy action movies.	5.0	Certainly fits with the best of them	2001-03-08	1	1	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3RHC348D367EL	Christopher Vakili	In similar fashion to the Godfather series, the second movie is better than the original.  Arnold gives a brilliant performance and shows why he  is the best action star in hollywood.  There is a good supporting cast, but  Arnold is what makes the movie.  Arnold travels back in time and has now  been &quot;reprogrammed&quot; to be a good terminator.  He is the protector  of John Connors against a more advanced terminator.  Sarah Connors (Linda  Hamilton) plays a much tougher role than in the first movie, but she gives  a good performance.  The special effects are great and so are the action  sequences.  I recommend that you go to Universal Studios and check out the  Terminator 3d show.  It is the bomb.  It got me very pumped up about T3.  Lets hope Linda Hamilton will come back to T3, but if she doesn't, its okay  because Ah-nuld is back!	5.0	T2 deserves 7 stars	2000-08-30	2	0	2
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1UMNXF74JG9DO	"chrobs ""chrob11"""	Of course I was interested hearing that they were going to be releasing a 1080p version of the movie.  And I wondered if it was going to be worth purchasing this version, considering the add'l 16 minutes of footage were included on the previous Ultimate Edition (albeit by way of an Easter Egg, as it were).  So of course, I purchased it.  I have not actually watched the whole thing yet, and I will explain why.  But first let me say that the picture and sound were phenomenal.  I do not have Dolby ES, but DTS, but it still sounded great.  The picture was not to be believed at how clear.  I do have progressive, albeit only 480p (not the 1080p touted by the DVD - are there really any 1080p TVs out there?  Mine does 1080i - did it make a difference?  Not sure, but it looked pretty awesome to me!)Anyway, the one 'flaw' with this edtition, and the reason I am even writing this, is this ... they chopped off the sides of the film!  I can't believe out of all of these reviews, that no one had mentioned this little shortcoming of this version. They clearly explain in the enclosed booklet that they took a 2.35:1 (wider) format and chopped it down to 1.85:1 to fit the standard widescreen TVs.  It sounds like they only did this so that the presentation would be clearly 1080(p) (not to make liars out of them? dunno).  Otherwise, as they explain, there would be black bars at the top/bottom that would take away precious viewing from the full 1080 lines of resolution.Well, (Hello?!) I don't know about you, but the major reason that I even purchase Widescreen versions of DVDs at all is to GET THE WHOLE PICTURE!  I WANT to see what's going on at the extreme periphery of the scenes.  I admit I did start watching this edition, and, after having read how they masacred the panarama, I wanted to see if I noticed anything.  Well, the first scene they show through the Terminator's eyes - y'know all the data stuff happening on the sides of the screen - he was sizing up the Biker Dude to see if he could fit into his clothing -  well, it was very clearly and obviously Chopped Off.  I shut the thing off and have been contemplating bringing it back to Media Play for a refund for the reason of False Advertising.  Although, now, reading in these pages, someone is saying there might be an additional Extended (by 2 mins) version of the film - although not sure since it appears this person was referring to a foreign version.  So I might give his Easter Egg a try - and he claims something about he 2.35:1 A/R.  We'll see.So I gave this a '2' rating, because as much as what you could see was pretty awesome in comparision with previous (or any) versions, resolution-wise, I was not happy with the 'widescreen pan &amp; scan' thing they pulled.	2.0	Extreme &quot;Chopped Off&quot; DVD	2003-06-09	5	4	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Known for having sets and ideas that tend to push the bounds of filmmaking, James Cameron likes to be ambitious and have films that would otherwise be quite a bold risk. Before this film he made the Abyss, a complicated underwater shoot that wasn't a huge hit Fox wanted it to be and before that Aliens, a really tight schedule with big sets, miniatures and a 10 feet tall queen alien. Now the advancements are more digital but still no less groundbreaking and in turn, still exciting.John Connor, mankind's savior after machines declare war on their creators, is actually a deviant, robbing ATM's of cash with a special laptop and disobeying his foster parents and getting in trouble with the law. His mother Sarah is in an insane asylum has her declarations of nuclear war, machines, terminators and time travel make her apparently nuts. In the first film, the machines tried to kill Sarah before she gave birth to John. Now, they're going after John himself.As a protector, John in the future reprograms a terminator to save his skin in the past instead of the last time which was a human soldier.  Only he looks like the terminator from the last one so it obviously freaks Sarah out since he tried so hard to kill her.The film is definately more ambitious with a thrilling bike/semi chase to the rescue and escape from the insane asylum and to the incredibly real and powerful nuclear dream, it really pushes the series into a better direction rather than just being a nice action movie, this is a ride.Also after ILM's digital breakthrough with the pseudopod from the Abyss(that water tentacle), ILM was responsible for creating the T-1000, the villain of the film who's entirely liquid metal and is capable of imitating what he touches and using his body to creating blades to stab people with.The movie quite frankly oozes cool. It's got action scenes, drama and character development, some comedy and some classic scenes(I still smile during the ""Bad to the Bone"" intro). The DVD set is practically exhausting where it details so much about the film, you probably know enough to create your own Terminator 2 but let's face it, you can't duplicate a classic, there's one already here."	5.0	A cinematic classic	2005-03-06	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A28FPY7E22K1J6	Colin Neal	Terminator 2 is a more mainstream, thoughtful sequel to 1984's &quot;The Terminator.&quot; Whereas Terminator 2, was a dark, horrific, brutal film, T2 is more about the theme of the future of humanity in a nuclear era.  Blessed with a huge budget and a superb script Cameron successfully turns  the tables on Arnie's character and Sarah Connor's developing relationship  with the Terminator. Also effective is John Connor's development into the  leader he becomes in the future during the film.Previously only  available on special edition laserdisc, the DVD ultimate edition adds much  more background and detail to the story. As with Aliens, the 15 or so extra  minutes of footage add mainly depth to the characters, for example, the  Terminator learning to smile, Miles Dyson's family, and the T-1000 taking  pleasure in killing a dog. This is unlike &quot;The Abyss&quot; with the  half an hour which adds a whole new storyline at the end!As with all  Cameron films the sound is amazing, really sharp, clear thumping sound  although the Brad Fiedel soundtrack is a bit wimpy in comparison to a James  Horner or Jerry Goldsmith score. It does work well - the dark synth score  fits with the metallic machinations. Expect the picture quality to be  amazing!What would have made this release perfect is if was presented in  full screen as well as 16:9. As Cameron filmed it in Super 35 you miss some  of the film in widescreen and some of it in full screen (unlike pan and  scan). So, it looks like I'll still be using my full screen laserdisc for  sometime to come! All we need now is for them to go back to the original  Terminator film and remix the sound from Mono into Dolby 5.1!Brilliant!  Buy it!	5.0	The finest sci fi film ever made	2000-07-14	125	103	22

I'm planning on making a life size statue of the T-800 myself  but lacked the materials needed to sculpt my own skull. the rest I can make but this will help allot. I did end up modifying it after i received it. I took the extra black paint off of the temporal gears. The details are there they just went overboard with the black paint. I also didn't like the look of the red eyes they seemed to simple so I went and snagged some red lamps from Radio Shack and put them in because they are more screen accurate. Next I plan on repainting the teeth. I got it knowing I would be changing some things but even without my changes its an awesome bust. The movies also make a great add on to my collection.

I also own the 'Ultimate' edtion which came out a awhile back.  If I had know that this edition was going to come out, I would have waited.  As great as this edition is, and this is the one to own, I still feel like I got suckered.  Oh well.  Everyone has probably seen this movie, so I seen no need to do a review, but know this is the best possible print of the movie on DVD.  There's actually like three versions of the movie here, the theatrical release, the additional footage version, and a version to watch on your computer which should provide a much higher definition picture.  And the sound is the best I've ever heard.  To really experience it, it must be witnessed on a proper sound system, with surround sound and all that stuff.  The extras are plentiful to the point of being almost too much.  The two complaints I have seemed to be shared by others.  The plastic DVD case comes ensconced in a metal slipcase, which looks really nice....until you try to slide the plastic case out of the metal slipcase.  It's such a tight fit that the plastic case gets damaged.  Why couldn't they have done like a metal tin or something than this slipcase I don't know.  The other complaint is why didn't they just release this version from the get go?  To make more money, I suppose, but I find it really annoying that this seems to be becoming a more common practice, releasing different versions of a movie, starting with the barebones version, and then throwing extras in for the later versions, just to squeeze a few more dollars out of our pockets.  BTW, this version does also have the directors' commentary of the movie, something which I don't think was available in the previous version.	5.0	Best version ever....until the next one?	2003-06-11	3	3	0

From the standpoint of depth psychology, science fiction can be thought of as an unconscious but meaningful imaginal extrapolation of where we'll end up if  we don't change our collective course right now.  As Dr. Glen Slater would  point out, the cyborg is a good image for the loss of our humanity in a  culture increasingly dominated by mechanistic thought (&quot;Things are in  the saddle and ride mankind,&quot; as Emerson noted long ago).  On another  level, the film is a good story with lots of action and special effects;  Arnold is convincing as a human-shaped tank of a Terminator reprogrammed to  be dumb and helpful, and Linda Hamilton does well as the strong and cynical  Sarah Connor, mother and protector of the future.

Now I see this ""Extreme"" DVD edtiion is on sale here at Amazon for a mere $4.99.  Wow, now that's a deal.I enjoyed all three of the ""Terminator"" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects.When this movie came out, the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping, so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later, they are still cool.Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible, literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time, he looks like the most indestructible ""person"" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.Arnold Schwarzenegger, an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg, plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged, too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first ""Terminator."" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid, a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong, and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star.Still, despite all these annoyances, as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn, I can't help but wonder now how this looks on Blu-Ray!

But when Artisan release Extreme DVD, I was anxious and waited and waited... and until it had release, I do have a few qualms.Firstly, the metal case scratch the cover of the DVD casing. One pull, and its a goner. Worst yet, I can't out it back in. Secondly, I can enjoy both versions of the movie itself. But the 2nd disc was a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT to me. A few minutes of documentary and no trailers?!? Why even bother call it EXTREME DVD? I mean, the metal casing with the T-800 face on it was cool, but the content was nothing.I like the movie a lot... but the extras were way too little and how I wish I can get the Ultimate Edition instead.As a fan, this was a dissapointment to me for this edition. What saves it is only just the movies, the special features pulls the package down. Be warn about the metal case... your DVD plastic casing will be scratch.	3.0	I'll be back...

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2UEYNUWKVOYPU	"Daniel D. Vander Haar ""movie history survivor"""	Last night I watched the hidden version included in the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, and its always interesting watching the deleted scenes, and seeing what versions of the movie have what extra features. Now let me get this straight. According to the ultimate alternative ending, Judgement Day did not happen, as the future is not set, and John Connors went on to become a Congressman, instead of a leader of the resistance. So Sarah Connors spends half of her adult life smuggling guns, blowing things up, assasinating people, and being locked away in a psycho ward for telling people that machines from the future were sent to kill her and her son John. We won't even touch the millions of dollars worth of damage she caused to property. Yet, here she is 30 years later, walking around free as a bird. And even though these things she said would happen did not happen, she is still seen as a hero, and not a nutcase, and she runs around like a nutcase telling everyone that each day is a gift. A gift from whom? Since the future is not set, and assuming here that God has nothing to say about this, the gift must largely come from Sarah. Its just a moviem, and perhaps we don't really want to go in this direction. Maybe it was a good idea that this alternate ending was never used.This Ultimate Edition of the second Terminator movie is one of the three best movies I have for sound. I have a Pioneer Elite sound system with 5.1, B & W speakers, and a Panasonic HD TV. My system rocks. Therefore, when a new edition was offered with better sound and picture, I was interested. I can say that my setup can tell the difference between very good and very, very good. And as very good as the Ultimate Edition is, the Extreme Edition is even better. If someone wants to buy my Ultimate Edition dvd, I will be happy to sell it to them, and I will be more than happy to keep my Extreme edition.	4.0	The Ultimate Edition vs The Extreme Edition	2003-06-04	0	0	0

I was surprised when i found that my copy of  the film was delivered on 2 discs as aposed to the 1 disc that it was meant  to be on. Apart from this small fault the rest makes a really good package  and a brillant buy for anyone who likes this film or just action films.  There are tons of additional features included which can take up hours of  your time sitting through. Of all the films that i own this is definatley  rated very close to the top. I really recommend it to anyone who is  expanding their collection of films or someone who just wants to watch one  of the most fun and exciting movies made again and again.	5.0	What A Classy DVD	2000-09-01	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3UQ3PNURYB0N3	Daniel Sutton	Dear Amazonians,When I first viewed Terminator 2: Judgement Day in the theater, I was blown away.  Since I got the Ultimate Edition of this DVD about three years ago, every time I watched it, I got the same thrill as I got the first time I witnessed not only one of the best action thrillers of all time, but on of the best dramas of all time.Many viewers have referred to this movie as an action movie, but I consider it to be something much more, a drama.  This story of a young boy (John Connor), who befriends a machine from the future sent back to protect him from a ruthless ultra-advanced Terminator as he grows older, is very personal.  The movie is violent, but goes beyond pure violence and noise for &quot;shock value,&quot; and presents something truly special.  I continue to watch Terminator 2 with the same passion and interest as I expressed when I saw the original release.  And, the Ultimate Edition goes even further, putting footage that was never seen ino the feature.  Now, the story makes even more sense as you see how Sarah Connor struggles with the will to destroy John's protector, while John displays some of the traits that he will need as the future leader of the human resistance.I very strongly recommend the purchase of this DVD.  You will not be disappointed by its appeal.Take care, as Always,--Daniel	5.0	One of the Greatest Movies of All Time	2003-02-28	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3K3DEVYIOWX0Y	Daniel Zuccarelli	Quite possibily yes. It gives &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;The Abyss&quot; a run for it's money. This DVD has 3 (yes 3) versions of the movie. The regular version, the special edition with all kinds of extra footage, and a 3rd hidden extended special edition with another 3 minutes of footage and a different ending. DTS sound, 5.1, 2.0 all dolby sound, all the time. It's all here.THe extras, oh my god the extras. There are tons and tons of featurettes, about really every aspect of the movie. They are all laid out in these cool cyberdyne systems menus that are really fun to navigate. The extended special footage is here to view seperately, since on side one you have to &quot;unlock&quot; it (type the judgement day date in with your keypad after you select special edition but before you start the movie, a quote saying the future is not set will come on the screen).There is a commentary, but it's not that great. It's quotes from all the featurettes pulled together so it really sounds like a production instead of a few guys sitting around watching and talking about the movie. This is the one soft spot on the DVD.This is Cameron's best flick, and it gets the royal treatment here.	5.0	3 versions of the film... 6 hours of content! Best DVD ever?	2000-08-30	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"In reviewer Ronald Thomson's DVDTown critique of the previous release of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" he called it ""a landmark film in special effects development."" True, and Artisan's ""Ultimate Edition DVD"" establishes yet another benchmark, the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc. It's what director James Cameron was said to have wanted with ""Titanic."" Now, he gets his way. The disc contains two versions of the movie, the primary theatrical release and a special, extended version, plus over forty special features. I'm not entirely sure I agree with Ronald's assessment of the film's having an entertainment value of 10, but I'm willing to concede the point in its ""Ultimate Edition"" trappings. I certainly concur with everything else Ronald said, especially that ""Terminator 2"" belongs in any sci-fi collection. Now, before I comment on the special bonus items, here's more of what Ronald said about the movie itself...the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc.""The first terminator failed to change history. It's up to a second terminator to terminate John Conner in his youth years after the attempt to kill his mother. Granted, just another cyborg won't do. The terminator sent back to change history has the ability to emulate any non-mechanical object it comes in contact with, but Arnold Schwarzenegger is up to the task of saving the world, even against an indestructible, morphing adversary in this terminator-on-terminator battle.Thanks to the marvels of time travel, John Conner was raised believing that the world would be devastated and he would lead the rebellion against the machines. His mother, however, was committed for being delusional. After all, how could machines take over the world? Now, two terminators show up, and he realizes that his mother was right.""Video & Audio:The audio and video for the movie are fine. Definitely high quality. The sound and anamorphic picture are THX certified, but more important, the detail in sound staging is excellent. For instance, in one of the opening scenes, a motorcycle drives by on the road, and the audio definitely tracks with the location of the bike, even though it's a simple background noise. Amazing battles, fights, explosions, gun shots, and chase scenes leave the viewer enjoying the movie, not just admiring its technical perfection. The picture is slightly light, overall, and perhaps a tad soft. I would have liked a greater color depth.More from Thomson: ""'T2' is not perfect, the acting leaving much to be desired. But then, so is the acting in ""Star Wars"" imperfect. In both cases, however, the acting does not detract from the movies' overall effectiveness, presentation, or entertainment value.""Extras:Thanks, Ronald, now let's hit those new bonus features, starting with side one, which is labeled ""Side A"" in print so small you have to hold it to the light and squint to read it. This is the main side, and the first thing you'll notice when it starts up is the snazzy new interface. The animated menu design looks like the inside of a robotics factory for terminator cyborgs. However, while it's beautiful to look at, it presents some problems getting around. A warning comes with the package (which is housed, by the way, in a handsome brushed-aluminum casing) stating that ""due to the advanced features utilized in the creation of this DVD, some players may experience minor navigational difficulties."" My Sony 7700 player had no technical difficulty navigating the menus, but I had trouble finding everything I needed to. Some of the directional arrows are so dark and so tiny, they can be hard to spot, and they are often not located with the rest of the items on a screen. It also took me a moment to locate the THX tests advertised on the box. They're in the audio section and indicated by a little ""THX"" sign on the skeletal metal head to the left of the main audio choices. Once you find these tests, though, which are about the same as those found on the ""Fight Club"" DVD and basically duplicate the tests on most standard DVD setup discs like ""Video Essentials,"" you'll find them handy to use. They include checks for color calibration, brightness, convergence, channel balance, channel-phase polarity, subwoofer integration, and other such criteria for optimizing a home theater.Now, you're almost ready to choose which version of the movie you want to watch. The first is the regular theatrical release at 136 minutes; the other is the special edition with sixteen minutes of additional material. Some of this extra stuff is in bits and pieces scattered about; and some of it is contained in completely new scenes, raising the chapter index to an astounding eighty selections, maybe a record of its kind, an index point for about every two minutes of screen time! If you have already seen the film, and who hasn't, I advise watching the special edition; it's one of the few instances where the added material makes sense and isn't just included as a gimmick. But the chapter selections menu is no longer animated as it was in the previous disc. I suppose some things had to go, and it's a miracle the engineers were able to cram as much as they did on both sides of one disc. Anyway, the side also contains four different audio tracks: one in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, another in DTS 5.1 ES, a third in Dolby Surround 2.0, and a final one featuring commentary by members of the cast and crew. English is the only spoken language option, but subtitles are provided in English for the hearing impaired. There are also extensive cast and crew biographies and filmographies, plus some DVD-ROM items. The keep case claims that the film was newly remastered in THX, but as far as I could tell in comparing it to its prior DVD incarnation, the picture and sound quality appear the same, with the anamorphic screen ratio an identical 2.17:1. Perhaps Artisan meant that the film was newly remastered for DVD previously. In any case, the picture and sound are still as good as could be hoped for and deserving of the highest rating that could be assigned them.Side two (B) is where you'll find most of the bonus materials. Again, navigation may be an initial problem, but once you think you get the hang of it, it becomes no easier. Here, in various categories, you will discover more than you could ever want to know about the film, its history, and its production. One of the subdivisions is called ""Information Programs,"" and it includes the disc's three main documentaries. The first is a thirty-minute promo titled ""The Making of T2,"" produced at the time of the film's shooting in 1991. You'll see interviews with the stars and crew and various behind-the-scenes looks at the techniques used in the filmmaking. The second, twenty-two-minute, featurette, made in 1993 for the Showtime cable channel and titled ""T2: More Than Meets the Eye,"" is even more interesting. It deals with the longer version of the movie and explains why certain scenes had to be cut for the original theatrical release and why they were filmed in the first place. The third documentary, the twenty-three-minute ""Making of Terminator 2 3D: Breaking the Screen Barrier,"" is all about the creation of the MCA/Universal Studios theme park attraction and hints that the attraction may be a stepping stone to a possible third theatrical feature. We'll see.Another subdivision on side two is called ""Visual Campaigns."" It includes four trailers, three in partial widescreen and one in pan-and-scan, and five Japanese teasers. Then there's a third subdivision, called ""Data Hub,"" which has even more information. To begin with, it contains the complete shooting script of the film in 574 text frames. Placing the written text over a flaming red-and-orange backdrop, though, was a questionable decision. I didn't read the entire script, only the first few pages, but had I tried, I probably would have needed new glasses by now. (The DVD-ROM portion of the disc allows one to read the script while looking at many of the storyboards.) Next, there are what appear to be hundreds of regular storyboard sequences and archives. Tons and tons of archival stuff. In fact, there are sixty separate video selections, each individually indexed, probing the filmmaking process with cast and crew. Of these, I was particularly taken with the segments using multi-angle shots, the Terminator saying ""I'll be back"" in a variety of languages, and the sequence demonstrating the video transfer of ""T2"" for separate letterbox and pan-and-scan versions taken from the same Super-35 negative. And in yet another section, ""Data Core,"" you'll find fifty more chapters worth of supplemental items. Somewhere buried in all of these hours of bonus goods, there is supposed to be an article titled ""Battle Across Three Dimensions"" by Estelle Shay, but try as I might, I honestly couldn't find it. Next, if you have the patience, wait twenty seconds or so for a static menu screen to come to life and then click on it; you will be rewarded by a link to a not-so-hidden Web site. Finally, a thirty-two-page informational booklet insert may also set a record of sorts. You'll be exploring for weeks.Parting Thoughts:Without question, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" the Ultimate Edition DVD, is well named. It is a milestone in the evolution of the DVD medium for its ability to carry huge quantities of information into the home. The movie itself looks and sounds as good as ever, and in its extended version it may even be a better story.

Had bought this as an archival movie (along with T1 & T3 and several other Schwartzenegger action flicks) due to the low price, played it a few times and kept it in a cabinet along with all my other BD movies.  However when I tried watching it again with some friends a month ago, it refused to load in 3 different BD players.  Disc is in excellent shape - no scratches, dirt etc - so I'm guessing it got 'disc rot' although I cannot see any difference between it and the other Terminator BD discs.  What a rip!	1.0	Disc went bad in 5 years	2013-06-06	4	1	3
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1Q1KYZ8P5R97X	"David Skapura ""avwiz"""	"First, let me say that I'm a big fan of the Terminator series.  I'm also a very technical person (a real, live, computer engineer) with a lot of A/V experience.  For those of you that are into this sort of thing, I also happen to have some experience in neural network technology, but that's another story.That said, I was really looking forward to watching the HD version of the Director's cut of T2 before going to the theater this weekend to see the new Terminator Salvation movie.  My son, now 14, had never seen any of the Terminator movies, and had only occasionally watched bits and pieces of the Terminator: Sarah Conner chronicles, so we started out by watching the original Terminator BD earlier this week.  Given that the original was made in 1982, the BD version, played in full HD and 5.1 THX surround, was a great (re-)introduction to the series.My wife had ordered the T2 SkyNet Edition BD in April, and we were happily surprised to have it arrive in the mail from Amazon on the very day that the new Terminator movie was released in the US.  I removed it from the box, inserted it into my Sony BDP-S300 player, and then waited for it to boot...As others have already noted here, we waited... and waited... and waited.  It took fully 3 minutes to complete the preliminary loading (a bit long, but not outrageous for a BD HD movie on our player), then the screen went dark for another 2 minutes.  At that point, we got the secondary loading message from ""SkyNet"", indicating that it had found a Blu-Ray Profile 1.x player, and that menu's would run in full animation mode [to access all content, a Blu-Ray Profile 2.0 player with internet access was recommended].  This secondary load screen remained visible for another 4 minutes, then the screen went dark again.No audio, no video.  Nothing.  We waited another 5 minutes, then started pushing buttons on the remote.  The Menu command activated the drop-down, top-level menu for the BD, which allowed us to select options and settings for the play-back.  We selected the Directors Cut, and as soon as we did, the menu disappeared and we went back to the black screen for another 30-40 seconds.Then, out of nowhere, the LionsGate splash screen appeared, and played in full THX surround-sound for a grand total of 23 seconds.  Then nothing.  Back to black, no audio, no video, and the BD player indicating that the track counter, and playback, had stopped.  Pressing the Play button on the remote momentarily caused the BD Player to switch back into play mode, but still nothing.We went through this same exercise three more times, each time selecting different options from the top-level menu, trying to get it to play something.  Anything!  Unfortunately, every attempt ended the same way.Based on the feedback others have provided here, I strongly believe that this is an error in the design of the T2/SNE BD-ROM.  I've (both before, and since) successfully played other BD movies on the same player, including the original Terminator and - just to test the player - my Ironman BD movie.  Everything works but T2/SNE.Again, my player is a two-year old Sony BDP-S300 profile 1.0 BD player, with no ethernet port available.  So, I have no option of updating firmware on the player, nor do I have any option of utilizing the BD-Live features supposedly offered on the T2/SNE disc.As I won't be spending another $300 to buy a new player to watch this movie in HD, I will be returning the BD-ROM to Amazon for a refund, and my family and I will happily enjoy the Director's cut of the film on up-converted DVD tonight.My advice to the average consumer of this BD would be: if you don't have the absolute latest in BD player technology, avoid this BD at all costs.  Stick with the Extreme version of the T2 DVD.  It upconverts to full HD with only moderate graininess and plays full THX 5.1 surround sound without any issues whatsoever."	1.0	Warning to owners of older Blu-Ray players...	2009-05-22	30	16	14
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A38EQCXYMH63QX	David Slicer	When first I saw Terminator 2 in a movie theater,I was totally blown away  by the entire film.There has never been a film that had really knocked me  into deep oblivion.Terminator 2 was a big box office smash that made a  whole lot of money at the box office.The last time a film had a great  amount of impact on me before this film was Star Wars back in 1977.14 years  later,I'm sitting in a movie theater watching Terminator 2.This time I was  in hyperdrive.This film keeps you going and going and going.But there wrere  some answers that needed to be explained.Why does The Terminator act a  little human in the film? Where there some scenes in this movie that were  eliminated that provided the answers to this film.That's why it's a good  thing this film was finally rereleased on VHS in a special edition  director's cut.Of course that's nothing compared to the DVD.In my  opinion,the best DVD since The Matrix,Terminator 2:Judgment Day has enough  extra goodies to knock anyone,or some people out of orbit.I rented the DVD  not too long ago,and I really enjoyed it. It provides plenty of  entertainment for even the person who has seen this a thousand times  before.	5.0	This version is even better than the theatrical.	2000-09-16	1	1	0

(pun intended, yes I spelled his name wrong on purpose!) Unlike other action movies, T2 includes charracter development, character depth, intricate plot and (suprisingly) a moral statement.The acting is by far the best thing in the film, every role is played to the point that you have to surrender to the movie's will that these are not just characters, these people are 'REALITY' *. The visual effects are another great for this film, the effects are astounding, well not nowadays, but for back then, these were beyond just a 'breakthrough'.though this movie is not without it's flaws.......(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)At the climax, the movie succumbs to ""stupid bad guy, and plot devices"", here, let me explain: The entire movie, the bad guy has been running himself to death to kill John Connor, he can transform his arms and fingers into huge blades, which can apparently expand a decent length. He can also run at superhuman speeds, he can also imitate peoples body and voice to trick people into traps. Now, at the end of the film, he has connor within 30 feet of him, and all he does is walk 'SLOWLY' toward him (I'm guessing this was for suspense, but the effect was stupid). And of course, due to the Terminator's sluggishness, he easily runs away, while his mom stays behind for reasons I can't fathom (she had ages to get away herself).Once the Terminator reaches Johns mom, he turns his finger into a long blade and impales her through the shoulder, he tells her to call for John, she resists, this sequence goes on for a minute, this entire time, I'm saying to myself, ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL HER, TRANSFORM INTO HER AND CALL FOR JOHN!!!!"", of course he does this later, but of course, then somebody comes to save John and bla bla bla.(SPOILERS END)Another thing that might turn off some veiwers is that you can't really relate to anybdy in this movie. One person's bad boy middle-school kid with rotten foster parents who he's stuck with(some may be able to relate to this, but most probably won't be watching this movie), one's a woman who's trapped in a mental hospital, one's a scientist on the verge of a world-changing discovery and one is a.. uh, robot.Well, there you have it, a rough and tough action film with a kind of weak climax, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the story.8.5/10  (probably would have been 9/10 if it weren't for that ending).* The exception of this would have been the role of Edward Furlong, though this is somewhat excusable due to him being a child actor, his character is a bit less than beleiveable."	4.0	Now THAT'S an action movie!	2008-01-06	1	0	1

For starters, the menus are absolutely amazing! They are almost mini-scenes that are completely new, but are so sharp, they could have been used in the movie.  All the documentaries are great and let you appreciate the amount of work, time, and energy that went into the film.  Its always fun to hear about the film from Cameron and Arnold themselves.

I wrote a review for this DVD a couple of months ago about how it was a waste of money, and I was WRONG. I broke down and bought this DVD and fell in love with it.The menus are loaded with FX, and the main part of the special features is set up as scene selections. You choose from over 30 chapters of text/video features, which include everything from production notes to video clips of the ride at universal studios theme park. The film has 3 versions, including the original version and the special editon(this version does not include the Future Sara ending like the VHS release, instead this scene is part of the special features section)The special edition version does contain several added scenes, including the dream sequence with Kyle. And the disc also includes an audio/video test to calibrate your television and your sound system for optimal performance. My only gripe is that the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped. It of course sounds better than Pro Logic, but does not have the same quality on the DTS track as you might find on Gladiator. But the picture quality is darned good, and I take back everything I have said in the last review about this movie being a waste of money. The price could be a few dollars cheaper, but overall it is a good buy. For another good Arnold movie, I recommend the 6th Day, which will be released in spring of 2001 on DVD.	4.0	An Excellent action DVD with 6 HOURS of extras!	2001-02-08	2	2	0

It was a box office hit, and many consider it better than the first.BASIC PLOT: In the future, humans and evil machines are fighting each other. The leader of the human army is the powerful John Connor. A cyborg called the Terminator was sent back in 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother. The Terminator was defeated by Sarah.Many years later, John has been born. Sarah was sent to a loony bin because everyone thought she was crazy when she told about the Terminator. John lives with foster parents, and is quite a rowdy teenager.The machines send a new Terminator, the T-1000, back in time to kill John. This one can change into people and is made of liquid metal, so he's quite tough to defeat. John from the future sends his own Terminator to protect John. Can the T-1000 be defeated?OPINION: This film is fantastic. A great story, lots of action, and excellent special effects for the time. A must have for Sci-Fi fans.	5.0	Governator 2: Reelection Day (just kidding!)	2005-09-21	0	0	0

BDLive is reserved for stuff like current trailer downloads, and community screening nonsense.  The stuff already on the disc, like commentaries and featurettes should play regardless of any internet connection.  This is merely Liongate's way of mining marketing information by tracking what features are viewed so they can sell me more crap.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"The first ""Terminator"" movie from 1984 became, from my point of view, one of the most unlikely sci-fi/ action hybrid classics of all-time. With such a low budget that was allotted into making that movie, the result was a surprisingly incredible experience thanks to James Cameron putting that limited amount of money into excellent use. Parts of that movie though, especially the futuristic scenes have dated rather badly over the years but it still remains a highly innovative movie. 1991's follow-up ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" takes what was great about the first one and builds upon it to create an even better sequel. This is no sequel slump by any stretch of the imagination. James Cameron with the benefits of a much higher budget and with the task of creating one of the most highly anticipated sequels ever in the history of movie-making, he pushes the envelopes of sci-fi action thriller making and revolutionized special effects by creating some of the most awesome special effects ever made in action movies even by todays standards. ""Judgement Day"" surpasses the first one by a good amount in many ways, even though the first one was awesome in it's own right. It showed a much improved technological breakthrough in movie-making with far more special effects and innovation that results in a movie that still looks fresh and as up to date and even ahead of it's time, much more so than many sci-fi movies that have come ever since then.It all begins many years after the terrifying events of the year 1984 where Sarah Connor survived her ordeal with the emotionless human cyborg. She is now in a mental hospital after being arrested for attempting to blow up a computer factory. John Connor is a very rebellious teenager who's in the care of foster parents. However, John Connor, even if he 'survived' the ordeals of the original Terminator machine, his life is about to take a drastic change when two Terminator machines arrive out of the unknown realm, in the year 1992 in Los Angeles for opposite purposes. One is to kill John Connor, the other to protect him from the vicious machine.  Skynet from the year 2029 send an extremely dangerous human cyborg called the T-1000 who can take the shape of any human being by means of liquid mercury metal, to kill John Connor to prevent him from being able to lead the human resistance against the machines. Just as the machines sent back a T-1000 back in time, the humans also send back another cyborg ironically called ""The Terminator"", with almost exactly the same design as the original version that was sent back to kill Sarah Connor many years back.While it may have improved upon the greatness of the 1984 original Terminator movie, ""Judgement Day"" carries all of the depth and darkness of that one and takes the storyline to even darker realms. For a relatively long movie of over 2 and a half hours, the darkness and the incredible suspense will keep you holding tight to your seats for the entire time. Few movies in my opinion have such ability to do this but Terminator 2 does just that. In some ways, I would also view this second outing as the opposite or counterpart to the original Terminator movie. The first one had Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the bad guy while this one has him playing the good guy. I kind have to say that Arnold did a better job at playing the evil Terminator machine from the first one but he still does such an excellent job playing the 'good' guy while Robert Patrick delivers a truly chilling role as the menacing liquid metal machine T-1000.  While Arnold Scwarzenegger did some good movies since then, his roles went downhill in my opinion, and fell to rock bottom with the awful ""Batman & Robin"" movie and hit speed bump after speed bump before getting back on top with the awesome ""Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines"". To me, it's the Terminator movies that have forever made me a fan of many of his movies. Edward Furlong does such an excellent job playing the rebellious John Connor, must I saw even better than Nick Stahl did in the Terminator 3 movie, no offense to Stahl, he did good but Furlong did better. Linda Hamilton improves her character Sarah Connor, by turning her in a mean woman fighter, with massive attitude. In some ways, Sarah Connor rivals Ripley from ""Aliens"" as the best woman fighter character in any movie I've ever seen. With the help of the extraordinary directing of James Cameron, dark and powerful script, and from the excellent cast, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" was one of the few movies that got all of the justice that it deserves. This is one of the best movies of 1991 and even now, it still has all of the punch it had when it was released. No other action movie, except for ""T3"" has toyed with darkness, fun, action, and depth the way that ""Judgement Day"" did.I don't know how they did it but they created what I would consider one of the best movie sequels ever in the history of movies. A good number of sequels fall flat on their faces against their original counterparts but not ""T2: Judgement Day"". This one surpasses the first one. Go and get this movie. I don't really feel like commenting on the presumably numerous editions released these past couple of years. I just would like to say that you should get this movie. I just wanted to comment on the movie itself. I went through the sad event of having to toss out the VHS edition because it got damaged from being worn out. This is definitely one of the best movies ever made and I must even go the distance to say that this movie trilogy is up there with Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, and Indiana Jones as my favorite movie trilogy. I cannot explain enough of how much I love these three Terminator movies with this review. Just go and buy the dam movie."	5.0	"""Judgement Day"" has come at last!"	2003-10-16	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A39IKVHD9A4IBV	DJ	Upon the first release of the DVD, just having it is good enough for most people.  However, there is that tiny population, with me being one of them,  who have the luxury of owning a LaserDisc player.  People who do have the  money may have owned Terminator 2: Special Edition.  This edition is  definitely special.  Not only is this edition with the movie.  It is the  movie in its entirety.  It is the movie with various edited footage and  scenes that were not shown in the original movie release of T2.  I remember  watching this movie over at my uncle's house and seeing how it all fits so  nicely together.The problem with the first release of the DVD is that I  was too spoiled.  Everyone who has seen the movie already knows what to  expect.  But for those like myself who has seen the added footage, it is  definitely not whole.And now, August 29, 2000... the same date (month  and day wise) used in T2 that tells the tale of the destruction of humanity  and the war against the machine starting... we are now graced with the  ultimate form of T2, likewise the name of this release.  I fully recommend  this for any T2 fans.  I recommend this even to those who has not seen the  movie in its true entirety.  Not only will this release make much more  sense, it will bring some closure to the questions that often plague our  minds.People who are seeing this movie for the first time, I cannot help  but recommend seeing the first and original Terminator.  I know the effects  and everything about it will look old and outdated to you who has seen  glimpse of this movie.  But it will make seeing T2 a lot more enjoyable  because you will have the background story to fill in.And what is my  personal opinion about this?  Is it worth buying?  For 40 dollars retail,  that is a lot to ask for.  However, considering this to be the ultimate  edition, I say it's worth 40 dollars spent to receive a copy.  And if you  find any other places with a better price than the MSRP of 40, it is safe  to say that you got your money's worth.  Definitely both a collector's and  a viewer's item.	5.0	At long last...	2000-08-05	2	2	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A39PME88IIGPX0	"""djordman"""	Seven years after the original Terminator took the world by storm we are presented with the sequel.Los Angeles, 1994. Sarah Connor has given birth to her son John, but due to the traumatic past, she's incarcerated in a mental hospital.From the distant future, a highly advanced Terminator is sent to assassinate John. At the same time the human resistance also transports an older reprogrammed Terminator to protect John.Unsuspecting, the young John and his guardian Terminator find themselves in a relentless struggle for survival.What makes Terminator 2 such a landmark is it's special effects, which are simply out of this world. The seemingly indestructable killer cyborg, the T-1000, consists of liquid metal and mere words can't do it's beauty justice.Spectacular, all the way through! The reason I don't rate this movie 5 stars is simply because I was still more impressed with the original. There are a few glaring contradictions in the time-traveling storyline, more apparent than in the original movie.  Also, this sequel lacks the sinister dark feeling that made it's predecessor so special.Terminator 2 lacks the sophistication of the original, but even ten years after it's release there's absolutely no denying it's beauty.	4.0	Science Fiction has never looked this good!	2002-09-08	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1PIPSCW42JR6U	"D. Meeker ""Huge Collector Of Horror and Sci-F..."	First thoughts...Amazing! Better than the first. You've got James Cameron back behind the camera and he is very talented, which he proves from this movie. Anyways, here's the breakdown.1.  Directing--Of course this is going to be good! It's James Cameron (Avatar, Aliens, Titanic) again. Amazing job from one of the all time best directors.2.  Script--Excellent story and writing from James Cameron and William Wisher. Better writing than the first one in my opinion. Nice job!3.  Acting--Amazing again because you've got Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the title character. You also have Linda Hamilton back, Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong. Very nicely done.Now for the content review.Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language1.  Sex/Nudity=1/10. Both terminators are fully nude at one point in the movie but there is nothing bad.2.  Violence/Gore=9/10. More violent than the original. Many people are killed by both teminators throughout. There is not a lot of blood though.3.  Language=7/10. Just a tad worse than the first one. 18 F-words and other profanities.Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. It is hands-down better than the first one and always will be the best in the Terminator series. Excellent job from James Cameron. Highly recommended to everyone who enjoyed the first one.	5.0	Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)	2010-12-21	4	1	3
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	Boy, is this a great movie.  It was when it hit the theaters more than a decade ago, and it still is.  Armed with a multi-million dollar budget and an arsenal of state-of-the-art special effects, director James Cameron puts together a sci-fi thriller that thoroughly entertains from beginning to end.But the true beauty of TERMINATOR 2 is its undying loyalty and respect for its predecessor, made some eight years before.  Even though there was such a gap in time, Cameron remained faithful to his original production, which translates into a seamless and believable sequel.  The T-800 machine, the nemesis in the original &quot;Terminator,&quot; returns, only this time the cyborg has been programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), now a pre-adolescent.  And once again, Schwarzenegger was made for the role of the T-800:  a stoic, hulking, violent killing machine, yet this time, Arnold brings a discreet sense of humor and compassion to the part.Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, young mother of John, but now she's buffed and tough and ready to fight back.  And Robert Patrick is exceptional as the advanced T-1000 Model, the machine programmed to kill John--a machine so advanced it makes the T-800 look like an old Commodore PC.  The action, the effects, the story, are spellbinding, but again, the subtle and not-so-subtle parallels to the original &quot;Terminator&quot; are what impressed me the most.  The title of this review is but one example, as it was said by the protectors in both movies--and prophetically so.  There are many, many more, which make TERMINATOR 2 so faithful to its predecessor, and so darned fun to watch.--D. Mikels	5.0	&quot;Come with me if you want to live.&quot;	2004-06-09	4	3	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3VJEEE8QXKR99	D. Nicolai	I was looking for something to show off the capabilities of my new plasma screen and thought this might fit the bill. I've been testing lots of the WMVHD clips from the microsoft site and was impressed but I wanted to try a full-lenth feature film.Let me summarize the reasons I am not satisfied with this product.1) The HD windows media files require the installation of the Interactual player which is known and well documented spyware. We shouldn't be forced to install or use spyware to play HD content.2) After I finally got the Interactual player to find and install a license for the video (the WMV uses DRM protection) I inspected the license and noticed it was only valid for 5 days. 5 days to play a movie I own??? I set the date on my machine forward by one week and, sure enough, the video was no longer playable. I set the date back and the video still wouldn't play (as expected). The quality of the video was nice, but I refuse to pay for a movie that expires in 5 days.Thank you Amazon for at least having a simple and straightforward return policy.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2FWKDI6BVP1W3	"Doran L. Odonnell ""Technology Bound"""	I love this movie, but the High Def version installs a program so it can play on your computer. Unlike ALL of the OTHER windows media version movies I have, this one MUST have THEIR program installed and you MUST have an internet connection available to check if it is a valid copy. Well, when I installed it, the movie worked fine. The picture quality was first rate and the sound as good as any movie. However, the problems came about when I stopped the movie about 30 minutes into it to do something else that I had to do. It first froze up my computer and then it would boot up and none of my desktop icons would show. I rebooted it and it would work sometimes for a few minutes and then quit working again, hiding all of my icons. It wasn't a virus either. I check for viruses a lot. Anyway, it eventually wouldn't allow me to do anything at all and I had to reformat my hard drive to get rid of the problem,. Quite a bit of hassle for a 2 hour video.I would suggest that you NOT buy this product unless you are willing to just watch the DVD version. I think the company who made it should have followed suit with everyone else and made it so it could be played through windows media, but they were probably just so darned worried that their precious video would be stolen that they made it screw your computer up.	1.0	The Windows Media Version Screwed My Computer up!	2005-09-30	13	12	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2BRZDMSGCYIKN	Dr. D	You're better off with the HD DVD version of this movie instead.The movie itself is worthy of 5 or more stars, but the transition to Blu-ray is awful.  There's absolutely no difference between the HD DVD version and the blu-ray.  Film grains are STILL seen in the Skynet Edition.  The picture looks very clean and high-def in brightly lit scenes, but in darker environments, the graininess is ridiculously noticeable.  You would think that they'd clean that up!Also, if you notice, nowhere on the blu-ray case itself does it say the magic code, 1080p.  Usually, the 1080p designation indicates a crystal-clear image without any major film grains.  Since that's nowhere to be seen on the case, expect the picture to be on the crappy side.Lastly, please note that your Blu-ray player has to be connected to the Internet in order to play this film, and you need to have sufficient hard disk space in order to download the extra features.  Unless you have a PS3, make sure your blu-ray player has enough space or attach a USB drive or external hard drive to it.  Without those peripherals, the movie will not load at all.So in summary, this is a 5-star film, but it's a one-star Blu-ray.  I gave it an extra star because I got it super cheap (less than six bucks).  I bet you it's that cheap because of exactly what I said above.	2.0	Ditch the Skynet Edition Blu-ray	2012-03-15	7	4	3
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AGTW325WH7JMG	Drew	This DVD is awesome!  The sound and picture is phenomenal and it's worth every penny.  My one drawback (and I'm hoping someone can contact me at jusjams@home.com for a little help) is that the audio comes in 3 versions: Dolby Digital EX 5.1, Dolby Stereo 2 channel and finally DTS-ES which requires the decoder for the 3rd surround channel making it 6.1 channels.  I am unable to get my DVD player to play this version even though I don't have the latest set-up of 6.1 channels.  I'm told that this new format is backwards compatible with the 5.1 set-ups but it doesn't seem so with mine. Just the intro with the THX logo is enough to sell this DVD delight where you see Arnie blowing the T2 title apart and the metal starts to melt like the t-1000 and forms together as the THX logo!, but I wish I could run the DTS-ES version where the DTS logo and the CD explodes into a zillion pieces (like in the theatre runs)Mine only shows with no volume.  I still would recommend this DVD very much for all the extras and the mere fact that it's still one of the very best friggin' movies out there to date. (same level as Matrix) No regrets!

Acting skill is not required to star or be featured, just the ability to seem to be doing all these stunts and to give voice to the occasional few words or sentences without falling on your  face. This these performers do. The rest is action and more action. I found the whole enjoyable though not materially better than many films of the same genre. Coming in at just under 150 minutes, it is a lot to bear with all at once. The time goes fast, however.Much too late to make a serious recommendation: but, here goes, any action fan who wants no conceptual or emotional problems with a movie, will find this one entertaining.	4.0	GOOD ACTION THRILLER	2013-07-18	1	0	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	I hadn't watched this in years and, to be honest, I was somewhat trepidatious about how it would hold up. As it turns out I should have known better; it's every bit the smart, emotive powerhouse I remembered, and miles better than most modern efforts in the same niche. One of the things I find most impressive about it is the respect it maintains for the original, where most sequels of this type (including T3 and Terminator Salvation) can't wait to distance and differentiate themselves from their lineage. Even though the first Terminator had aged quite a bit in the seven years between films, T2's sharp, daring script constantly cites events, characters and situations from its timeline like a religious zealot thumping the bible. It also builds directly upon the dark, challenging themes and premonitions of its predecessor, resulting in a towering, substantial world that seems so real I could almost touch it. Of course, I'd be silly not to mention the still-spectacular action scenes, which flawlessly build in size and scale until they reach a timely crescendo at the end of the third act. CGI was still in its infancy in the early '90s, but James Cameron's knack for its timely, appropriate application is already at veteran levels in T2. As a direct result, those infamous scenes with a transmorphing T-1000 remain striking and impressive, where other effects of the period now seem clunky and unrealistic. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, it's among the very best of the batch in multiple genres, and Arnold has never been more at-home in a character. This is an old ride that's aged like wine.	5.0	Bold, Intelligent Writing and Spectacular Action Help This Sci-Fi Classic to Age Gracefully	2012-07-06	3	2	1

I do not put in movies just so it can waste my time searching for firmware updates.  My whole reason for why I became a movie buff is because I no longer have the patience for slow moving updates or bad internet connectivity.  I found out (get this) that this blu-ray disc was incompatible with the cheap blu-ray player I bought from Walmart.  I had to order a not so commonly known electronics brand from Canada called Seiki which I discovered can load up blu-rays, and dvds faster than you can fast forward a vhs to the opening scene of a film.  It was expensive, but I love it.  I can also watch uber rare foreign films that have different region coding.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1THTI30FHNU9	Dustin Ramsey	As for the film itself, of course it's phenomenal,  just about everything you want in an action movie. I wanna talk about the disk itself; first off, for Blu-Ray, I was never really blown away by the picture quality, it seemed like a really high quality DVD than Blu-Ray. Minor note; this might be a stupid thing to complain about, but for me, the menus seemed a bit cumbersome to navigate. Lastly, the most striking thing about this disk is the absolute lack of any special features, aside from 2 different commentary tracks. Is there really not any material to include? With this film, you could have a 2 hour special just on the effects, not to mention actor interviews and deleted scenes. That's the worst, cause I know there are tons of deleted scenes.	3.0	Fantastic film, slightly above average disk.	2013-08-14	1	0	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A5QCKO0LL1D5E	dv_forever	The T2: Ultimate Edition DVD came out 6 years ago when the DVD format was still gaining in popularity and yet it still remains one of the finest single movie DVD editions of them all. Skip the later Extreme Edition which was only released to capitalize on the much anticipated arrival of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in theaters. Buy the Extreme Edition only if you want to hear the James Cameron/William Wisher commentary track.Back to T2: Ultimate Edition, this baby is loaded top to bottom with features, commentaries, clips, an alternate ending, an entire screenplay and a total breakdown of every facet of the film's production, from pre-production to marketing and release strategy. Yes, like a total film school in one shiny case. You better believe the case is shiny, Artisan actually relased this DVD in a metal slip cover initially, that's right, real metal! Talk about doing things the right way.Now for the movie, you get both the theatrical cut and the special edition. Although you may want to view the special edition once in a while, if you're a true movie buff, you'll realize the utter superiority of the theatrical film. It is James Cameron's real vision, after all. He has stated this on many occasions. The theatrical version is better paced, tighter and just flows wonderfully, it's perfection. The special edition version is more bloated in it's running time obviously and these scenes don't add much value to the film but they do take away from it. For instance Arnold grinning like some ugly horse? Yeesh!T2, the theatrical cut, is a sci-fi masterpiece of epic proportions and all the talk about it's advancement of digital technology, it's state of the art special-effects will never transcend the fact that it's a truly well told story with rounded, developed characters personified by actors giving very good performances. This film is an example to lazy, idea lacking filmmakers everywhere. Even if you are going to do a 'genre' film, have the audacity to take the genre and your ideas seriously so you can elevate your work beyond the limitations of the inherent genre. James Cameron accomplished this task on more than one occasion. Here's a toast to you, Jim!	5.0	Review For T2: Ultimate Edition DVD, One Of The Finest DVDs Ever Created	2006-08-30	13	13	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AT2BYFEVLVITT	D. Wetzel	First off I must admit I was very disappointed that this DVD was delayed in Canada, and I had to drive down to the States to purchase it, I just  couldn't wait. But after getting a great price and finally finish watching  the six hours of footage on the DVD I think it was all worth it. I have  seen the movie numerous times before, and even now I still love it. The  special extended version of the movie is just great, and I was kind of  surprised that they actually cut some of that stuff out of the original  release. None the less, I'm glad we get to see it now. Even though  Canadians will have a tough time finding this, seek it out, cause you won't  be sorry!	5.0	Throw out your old T2 DVD and buy this!	2000-09-01	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A34527CGD8W6Z8	"Edward Swan ""dub273"""	Terminator 2: Judgment Day has aged fairly well in the decades since its release.  The CGI may not be as mind-blowing as it was back then, but it still served to tell an exciting, if inelegant, tale about taking your future into your own hands.  As with The Abyss, the director's cut of this movie restores crucial nuggets of information. Knowing, for example, that the Connors decided to reprogram the T-800 to allow it to learn and process information with a more human understanding make one less likely to say &#34;Groan!&#34; when the Terminator gets all gushy and sentimental toward the end.So, the movie is good.  Let's talk about streaming on Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video.About a year ago I subscribed to Amazon Prime, in part for access to its large library of movies in both HD and SD.  When I saw that T2 was being offered in HD, I was excited for the opportunity to watch it that way.  but I noticed with this movie, and most others, that streaming in HD is a near impossibility. They say HD is available, but even with a speedy connection, it never is. I am able to stream content over Netflix and Hulu in high definition on a regular basis.  I purchased Cabin in the Woods on Amazon Instant, hoping to watch it in HD, and have been disappointed that I am only able to watch it in SD ever since.  Unless Amazon gets its act together, I won't be purchasing any more content from their Instant Video marketplace.	3.0	Fabulous movie.  Poor quality streaming.	2013-04-07	1	0	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AFTZ0GYJBOJWN	"""eggman183"""	Terminator 2: Judgment Day is arguably the best movie in the Terminator series. In the first movie, Arnold Swarchenegger (sp?) played the T-101 Terminator, who was assigned to kill Sarah Connor, who was to be the mother of the man who would lead the battle against an army of rogue machines called the Terminators. Now, Arnold reprises his role as the Terminator (now a T-850 model), who's become the hero sent back in time to protect the hero himself from a new, liquid-metal Terminator: the T-1000, a robot that is all but invincible. The movie has a great plot and action scenes. My only gripe about the film is that the special effects are exceptionally outdated. Still, T2 is a movie that deserves to be in anyone's film collection.	4.0	Not perfect, but darn close!	2003-07-17	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A163TRB4VW62TS	ehh	While it is true that T2 boasts some excellent special effects and elaborate action scenes, it's just not as well-made as the original. For one, it's frequently way too dramatic and serious.  It's practically humorless, while T1 was chock-full of dark humor.  Why Cameron didn't add the same wit into this sequel baffles me.  The drama and talk between the good characters is prententious and overlong. Secondly, the pacing is not as good.  T2 is too long, and by the time we get to the great climax, we no longer care what happens to the characters.  We just want more action.  While T2 is long and has ups and downs, T1 is thrilling throughout. Third, the characters are extremely unlikable.  Sarah is portrayed as a tough woman who has no problem holding a child at gunpoint and beating up anyone who gets in her way.  John, for the first half hour or so, is just plain annoying. Finally, the film is just bland and uninspired.  There are plenty of shoot-outs and explosions, but it's very tiresome and hardly exciting.  T1, however, was full of suspense.  So, while definitely not a bad film (it's entertaining at least), it does prove that bigger doesn't mean better.	3.0	Not as good as Terminator 1	2001-08-09	6	5	1

The new DVD version makes this movie  even better by showing tons of behind-the-scenes material including the  entire screenplay. The original version of this film released on DVD was a  disapointment, the video and audio were exceptional but it really fell  short in the extras department. This DVD version gives you an overwhelming  amount of extras, 3 different versions of the film, 3 &quot;making of  &quot; featuretts, cast and crew commentaries, interviews and much more.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1TKYAYESYHIA2	"Elijah Chingosho ""Dr Elijah Chingosho"""	"""Terminator II"" is an excellent movie with a lot of action. The film was well made with excellent sound and picture quality. I loved the action, comedy and excellent acting by the main stars, Arnold, Sarah, John and Patrick.The storyline is that ten years ago, the machines that rule the future sent a Terminator to destroy the unborn John Connor. However, they had failed. Now a cyborg that can change its shape is sent back from the future to kill John Connor before he can grow up and lead the fight against the machines. This newer Terminator is more deadly. Its efforts are thwarted by a protector (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) whose duty is to save John and his mother Sarah.This movie is one of the best box offices smashes of all time and with good reason. The action is non-stop and the special effects are out of this world. The ending could have been different.

While the commentary is good, it only works on DVD-Rom drives, something which I don't have but a friend did.

Also we see more of Miles Dyson's house and that he has a daughter.The director's commentary is insightful, as it was recorded in 2003, 10 years after the movie so he looks at it from perspective. He feels the movie still stands on its own merits and I agree.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1PLE1RNXP5FTG	"""emeraldavatar"""	Everyone under the sun has already seen some version of T2 and has their own opinion, so I'll concentrate on the differences between the versions, and the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; extras.  Let me just say that, IMHO, this is one of the best action movies ever.  Just action, mind you.  Now then:  There are three versions of the film on this DVD.  First you have the original theatrical release, which everybody knows.  Second, the Special Edition - in my opinion, the best version out there.  There are a lot of character development scenes in here, a dream sequence featuring Michael Biehn, a bit where they reset Arnie's CPU to &quot;learning mode&quot; and Sarah tries to kill Arnie, and some extra T-1000 effects (little glitches when he starts to lose control of his shape).  These are little things, and it's true that they slow the middle of the movie down, but they make the impact that much stronger when the third act, the blow-everything-up bit, begins.  Truly.  Then, if you can find the &quot;cheat codes&quot; specific to your DVD player, there is the &quot;Ultimate Version&quot; of the movie, which contains the same extra scenes plus one sequence with T-1000 in John's bedroom and one of the lamest epilogues ever cut at the last minute.  This final sequence is proof that sometimes you need to rein the director in, even when that director is as talented as Cameron.  It makes the whole movie seem insipid and feel-good and it conclusively ends the Terminator saga.  Blech. Now, then, about those DVD extras:  truly amazing.  Just about everything you could imagine is on this disc, viewable as one long program or half-minute segments. There are interviews with everyone who worked on T2, storyboards galore, a full shooting script, behind the scenes shots and montages of all the FX work, trailers in English and Japanese, teasers with views of the Terminator production process, and 3 different &quot;making of&quot; videos.  And if you want to watch the &quot;ultimate version&quot; scenes on their own (just to see how unneccesary they were), they are in there as well.  All connected by excellent animated menus which are actually the DVD's greatest drawback.  This is cutting edge stuff, so a lot of older players will not be able to handle the menus properly.  You can still get around, but sometimes the buttons don't do what you expect them to.  Also, I think some older DVD players will have problems with the disc's format - to get it all onto one disc, they used dual layering on both sides (I think this is properly called DVD-8, but not quite sure).  If you bought your player three to five years ago, you may want to rent this one first to make sure it will run properly.  All in all, even though I've seen this movie so many times I probably won't watch it too often now, I'm glad I got this.  Watch for the original Terminator to get the Ultimate treatment sometime in Spring 2001.  That one won't have so many extras, though, simply because there isn't as much material available.	5.0	Great DVD, but don't bother looking for the third version...	2000-12-26	7	6	1

I'm sure there will be a subsequent re-release of this in a Director's Cut Edition in an attempt to get people to re-buy the Blu-ray another time; on top of the countless times we've all purchased this on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, Blu-ray, and whatever is coming next. For that reason, and that reason alone I have marked down my score on this. I don't approve of the blatant money grab, and as a fan, it offends me.The movie itself looks and sounds great though, especially for its age. In my opinion it has aged pretty well, considering the advancements in technology since its original theatrical release. Again, my average score is in response to the disregard for consumers, trying to take us to the woodshed one more time to milk this old (but fantastic) classic.Please vote for me if my review helped, thanks!	3.0	This is for the Blu-ray, why are all these reviews for the DVD??	2009-02-05	16	16	0

This is one of your best  options,ain't no doubt. Myself,I've seen it maybe a dozen times,and still  I'm excited every time all the way.I rememeber the time the film was  released ,back in 1991.

The sheer number of options and special features, the menu interface, the soundtrack... everything is better, especially coming straight from watching the first Terminator film on Blu-Ray... check out my review of that travesty at your leisure.The film transfer strikes me more than any previous viewings on several differing mediums: the stark colour contrast of blue environments and red Heads Up Display places the perceptions of the Terminators outside the realm of the living and breathing. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, there is only one detractor - the morphing of the newest class of Terminator, the liquid-metal T-1000. And that is a muted detractor, the transfer to Blu-Ray is that good. It seems the further into the movie, the better the T-1000 images get.There is but one minor complaint with this Skynet Edition - the special features run during a viewing of the film; there is no option to watch them on their own. But like I said, it's a minor inconvenience compared to the surplus of material.	5.0	Pulled out all the stops!!!	2011-07-30	4	4	0

You know that this has three versions of it (the third is accessed with the code of the original Judgment Day (82997)).  What you might not know is how it looks:  Very textureless and plasticy (plasticky?).And that's the biggest problem here.  In an attempt to remove the ""noise"" in the picture, this edition of Terminator 2 also ends up removing the natural film grain from the picture.  What does this do?  It makes the picture TOO sharp, TOO clear, and ends up giving the feeling that everything has been sprayed with a shiny kind of plastic, removing the textures from just about everything.  (Obviously one can see that road is road and that cloth is cloth, but skin in particular looks TOO smooth, at least to me.)I only own this release and the old Ultimate Edition on DVD, and I'll tell you right now that this picture is superior to the DVD.  However, on my 42-inch plasma, running at 1080i, I can clearly see that this movie has had its grain-reduction WAY overdone.  The sound is good, the movie is as good as ever, and the video is better than DVD.  However, it's not as good as it SHOULD be, and that is disappointing.Caveat emptor in this case, especially since this probably means some kind of triple-dip sometime in the next two or three years.UPDATE 5/20/2009:  There's more and more discussion about how much grain-reduction was actually done on this film, especially at thedigitalbits.com.  I'm not terribly interested in getting into discussions of ""did-they or didn't-they"", so let me just say this:  When I watch this on my display (which is not state-of-the-art but is respectable on a PS3-HDMI-42""-plasma-1080i setup), I think that the image looks too smooth.  I expected a grainier look from the Super35 photochemical film process Cameron used.  I still think this is the best release of T2 available in terms of video + multiple versions.  I just wouldn't be surprised if a ""better"" edition comes out two years from now with an ""improved"" transfer/remaster.In the end, I'm glad I bought this and I'll be keeping it for years to come, I'm sure."	3.0	Ah, the dubious joys of (possible) GRAIN REDUCTION...	2009-05-19	16	10	6
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1L0HZI35HF8OF	Eric V. Moye	This the only sequel I can think of which outdid the original.  T-2 is fabulous!The story is very compelling, with Arnold as the good guy after being his malevolent best in the predecessor.  The first conflict between him on the Harley Davidson vs. Robert Patrick in the White Freightliner gets the heart pumping and the action keeps going.Unlike T-1, this has some surprisingly humorous moments, from the &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; music when Arnold first appears as a biker, the T-1000 comparing himself to a silver mannequinn, and the best of all - trying to understand why he just cannot go around killing people by responding &quot;Of course, I am a Terminator.&quot;Others commented on the additions this disc contains.  I also disliked the inability to move past promotional items.  But this is sure a worthwhile addition to any video collection.	5.0	And back he came!	2001-02-17	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1O626RCX1G3J0	E. Saltbush	The soundtrack of Terminator broke ground for the genre, with its creepy, haunting and ominous techno kind of feel. In all the Terminator movies, the sound track is pretty much the star. T2 adds deeper character to the series. Even the bad Terminator has interesting depth and responses to the role.Was the original Terminator a lot scarier? Oh yeah. But the liquid metal Terminator felt like he fit right into the L.A. Police Department. Not sure if that was intended to be a comment on the department but in retrospect that's a lot of what the police can be. Scary and everywhere. No point in shooting back, just try to stay away.Meanwhile the T1000 played by Schwarzenegger enjoys the chance to embrace some of the nicer bits of California, the desert, John as a child, nice bikes. Stunts were great and the comedy was better. Whoever played the waitress in the biker bar, she nailed the look. Worth watching again.	4.0	Classic and the best adult John of any version	2013-03-03	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1GN8GZ2V9USXF	fieldpj@yahoo.com	This is one of those DVD's that you wait for with bated breath. I was very fortunate to get a copy for 15 in an on-line auction. This was to be my first DTS soundtrack DVD and it gave me the excuse to buy the Videologic DTS sound system. It was with eargerness that I placed the DVD into my player and cranked up the sound system. Right from the menus it's apparent that this is something never seen before even surpassing the excellent DVD of 'The Abyss'. The DTS sound test and specially-created THX logo's are beyond what can be described. The quality of the film is excellent. The terminator's metal bofy gleams and the laser shots are crisp and well defined. The sound is beatifully separated and  is the best of all the DVD's that I have played. The three versions of the film all have their plusses and minusses but the seamless branching between them is excellent. Then of course, there is a second disc full of the 'extras' that DVD buyers have come to expect. However, these are more. Trailers, documentaries, video segments. All are good quality and give the viewer full immersion in the Terminator world. When the DVD is used in a PC there is a novelty factor in being able to watch the movie and have the script side-by-side to compare. This is undoubtedly the best DVD around as an all-round package. It's just a shame that other DVD producer's don't take the time to try and give the same treatment to other great films.	5.0	Unsurpassed Excellence !	2000-11-13	5	4	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3VO053P7D6VEN	Filip Maslowski	Ok, let's get started. In my opinion this DVD has far more negatives for me than the positives. The movie entertained me(still has after a million times) but let's face it, when i bought this i thought this was going to be better than the Ultimate Edition DVD. Hence the name Extreme Ed. Boy was I wrong. This was one of my least favourite DVD purchases. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great and its iconic but the DVD, just isn't up to par with me. I will love the audio commentary though. I love commentary btw. That's one of the reason's I buy DVD's. I didn't even know the Extreme Ed. had commentary...	2.0	cheated	2003-06-08	1	0	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3SO0F8B7BSPGZ	"Fireball ""Fireball_SP2"""	Although with it's good intentions in the beginning, and special effects/ technoligical aspects, it could have been a milestone.But, sadly, I don't agree it is.He's back, here to protect young John Connor from the T-1000 (the truly best thing of ANYTHING of this film).Robert Patrick can pull this act off so well, that nobody, not even our best oscar winners out there could do as well, besides he looks the part, physically, and with his ice cold stares that are stealth, he was the best choice. A great actor too-not just here, but every movie I've seen him in.Arnold-uh...Ah-nold is really a pretty good actor....but what is a terminator/robot doing with an Austrian/Belgian accent? Please. Regular speech from your typical robot: 'Attack' or 'This does not help our mission'Arnold's Belgian T-101 : 'Uh-tack' or 'This doz not help our meeshion'See? Regardless, yes, his acting and character is great.Edward Furlong has most of his character down pat, yet he slips now and then, like the 'cool dude' jokes, which , well, the way he put them, weren't funny, and was annoying with the 'rad, dude' stuff. His dialouge that was given to him wasn't the best either. Like, 'We've got Skynet by the (you know)'WHY SO 90's cool? Even though that's the kind of dialouge going around then, it's not the kind of humour that this movie needed. They are trying too hard ! Just be funny or natural. If needed. IT'S LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE a sarcastic 90's style coooool remark. Stupid.Linda Hamilton is trying too hard with her part. Yes, she's suppose to be angry, scared, and numb to a lot of things. Still, she did allright.The acting with everybody, except for Robert Patrick, is a bit too tidy or pleasent for a movie that's suppose to be a thriller-sci-fi, so it comes too tight as a movie. The 'nuke ' message is not really preached, more just given as a fact, which is better. Good for Cameron on that part.Maybe the violence, language, and even the attitude was kept that way so it was easier to understand for teens, who flockled to this movie, since it was 14-AA and not rated 'R' in a lot of places. Not fair to us. And still too violent for teens anyways.Overall, the movie was not natural enough. Good, not great. And any other things great about the film cannot save it from this factual look at the weak parts.The worst part is , no offense Arnold, the physique and acting skills are very good on his part.....the accent, if he couldn't skip it, then they should have kept him a mute, which wouldn't work, or get somebody else, for all three of the Terminator flicks.P.S. - the scene where Arnold smiles while Edward Furlong agrees silently that the weapon he found looked cool on him wasn't very practical....he smiles?A) he's a robot, and making him smile makes him less of a convincing Terminator.B) he didn't even know WHAT a smile was or what it is to a human to smile...so why did he? They tried toooo quickly to make him toooo human. He's JUST beginning to learn. The words or lines he says that aren't the norm to him (&quot;Hasta la vista, baby&quot; or &quot;He'll live&quot;) are funny, but better that he says it in a robotic way....he's a robot, so keep his disposition that way!	3.0	A robot with a Belgian accent ? ? ?	2003-08-26	2	1	1

AMAZON is cheating with these reviews that not belong to the EXTREME DVD.This EXTREME DVD has ONLY 1 version of the movie. While the ULTIMATE has 3 versions (more versions than this one).All extras (except 2 things) are DVD-Rom O N L Y! Not only this your stuck with one version, and its SHORTER then the ultimate. The ultimate also has a 3rd version that can be unlocked this one does not have it.The only good things are, the medal case art (but don't plan on puting the disc case back in the medal case it will destroy your dvd case), the disc art, and menu design.Everything else is worthless unless you have that DVD Rom, and there is no 6 hours extra like the ULTIMATE which is great to look thru.The transfer rate isn't that good so the image quality isn't clear.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A20DFSLBRNAC8Y	freee	Beautifully directed, beautifully written and very well acted, this Sci Fi masterpiece is a must watch for anyone who would call him/herself a &#34;movie fan&#34;. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T 800, but this time he's fighting someone his own size, or to be more accurate, someone more advanced than him, the T 1000, a much more advanced Terminator sent from the future to kill John Connor, leader of the human rebellion in a future war against the machine .One thing I love about this movie is how it played with people's expectations. In the first Terminator movie, Arnold was the bad guy and boy was he scary. The first Terminator is not only a good sci-fi film, but also a good horror movie, and a big part of that was how absolutely terrifying the Terminator was.  This time around they switched things on us. Instead of giving us the same thing one more time with better effects, they changed the dynamics just enough to provide a product that is fresh, packed with action and filled with classic moments that are still being referenced in media to this day. Here, the T 800 is given much more depth as he becomes more human as the movie goes on. By the end of the movie, you'd have to have a heart of stone if you don't get at least a little teary. It is amazing how they managed to humanize a character which, after watching the first movie, would much  likely haunt your dreams rather than tug at your heart strings.There's very little moments where this movie drags. Most of the time, it's just one great sequence after another great sequence. I can name at least 5 great moments in this film I savor every time I re-watch it. I don't want to spoil anything, just know that you're more than likely to have your own list when you're done.The movie actually has held up unbelievably well after all these years. Most of the effects still look pretty decent, and the action sequences are top-notch. Granted, there are a few scenes where the effects don't look as good as they once did, but I don't care. The movie involves you so much in its world, I'm willing the forgive that some effects haven't aged very well. However, for the most part, it has aged beautifully.In conclusion, this one's a certified classic; escapism entertainment at its absolute best. If you were born in the 2000's, or for some miracle have yet to experience this movie, grab a bucket of popcorn, sit back on your couch and enjoy. You won't be disappointed. It is a movie that involves you, shocks you, entertains you, excites you, and by the end...just have an explanation ready to tell whoever you are watching it with as to why all of a sudden your eyes are all watery. If you watch it alone, just let it out, nobody will know.	5.0	The Best Sequel Ever Made	2014-05-22	0	0	0

But the picture is perfect, and the 5.1 surround just RIPS and puts you right in the middle of the action. Many DVD's make rather dissappointing use of surround sound.They need to give this a listen to see how it should be done. My only gripe is the lack of separate French and Spanish language tracks,so I still have the rugular version of the T2 DVD. Languge students take note,DVD's are a great (someimes VERY frustrating) tool for the intemediate student on up,though I'm sure many have discoverd that by now.(And those dreadful Pok&eacute;mon cartoons are much more tolerable with an alternat language track). But as for T2..Listen to me now and hear me later and understand a coupl of weeks ago in the not too distant future..if you don't have the T2 Ultimate Edition DVD, you are quickly relenquishing your right to claim yourself as a fan of the film!

You can go years without watching this, but remember almost every scene when you finally see it again. This is real close to being a masterpiece, and it probably is. The special effects for the movie are still amazing even by today's standards. To me, the most memorable scene is when Sarah has the vision of the city being blown away, only leave skeletons in a fiery inferno. It is a really scary and somewhat realistic scene of what could happen to us if we aren't careful in the future. Not that machines will cause our demise, but we ourselves will. That is the message of the movie, that violence is ""in our nature"".The story is incredible. The Terminator becomes the dad that John never had and you really feel it while watching. The acting is also great and the end of the movie is a real tear jerker. This is a have-to-see movie if you haven't seen it already. This movie is so big, it's weird if you haven't seen it yet. You've been missing out. For those who have seen it, this is the movie to get and you will love it as much as you always have.The Ultimate Edition DVD is the choice to get and watching the Special Edition of the movie is a must because it has new scenes that only add to the already great story.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ATJLR5VAS2QE5	Garrett Aja	The Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2 was (and still is) an epic achievement among DVDs releases, with great picture, multiple versions of the film, and an almost dizzying number of special achievements.So why mess with a good thing?Besides the blatant attempt to create a tie-in to Terminator 3, the new &quot;Extreme DVD&quot; has some different special features (which is similar to squeezing an already crushed orange for juice), improved picture (most noticeable on regular TVs in that the &quot;shadow bars&quot; surrounding the actual widescreen picture inherent to many Artisan releases is missing), and a commentary by James Cameron.Granted, the improved picture and commentary are nice (particularly for the discussion of the scenes omitted from the Theatrical Version), but it's not particularly worth it if you have the Ultimate Edition (unless you have a DVD-ROM drive). Throw in a somewhat difficult package (I personally managed to nearly destroy the inner case's label when first pulling it out of the metal outer casing), and you've got a release that requires some thought before purchasing if you have the Ultimate Edition already, or can easily find it.	4.0	Good release, but.....	2003-06-12	7	7	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2HU94KJ4SUFR0	"Garrett Stiger ""Gar"""	This is one of the best action/science fiction films I have ever seen. One  of James Cameron's best collaborators is Arnold Schwarzenegger and that is  well proven here. This film is, in my opinion, light years better then the  original Terminator in every aspect. Cameron is great at creating action  films with elements of human drama. The ending is a bit cheesy and over the  top but not enough to make this a bad film. The acting is pretty good. I'ld  say the best performance is given by Linda Hamilton as the hardened and  determined Sarah Connor. The music is okay. The special effects are  terrific. The DVD is great and loaded to the gills with extras. I  particularly like the &quot;making of&quot; documentary which includes  interviews with Arnold, Cameron, and other cast and crew members. The  documentary also shows the process behind the computer and make-up effects.  The picture quality is fantastic.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3ACZ7UFFFCDHA	GDAWG	Terimnator 2 exceeded the expectations after the acclaimed Terminator.  James Cameron is a great filmmaker and should make more movies than he has.  Arnold gives his usual performance but Linda Hamilton really stood out along with a young Edward Furlong.the plot:  John Connor is now a young boy and is in grave danger of a new terminator sent to destroy him before he becomes the leader in the future.  John Connor (in the future) sends another model of the 1st terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect john from the new terminator (Robert Patrick).  This is all happening while Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in a mental institution after the Skynet Software company covered up the 1st battle of the terminator.  She was sent there as insane because she believed what Reese (The Terminator) told her about John and the future and the terminators.While escaping the mental asylum John is being chased (in a remarkable chase scene..almost as good as The Matrix Reloaded) after by Robert Patrick.  Arnold comes to save the day and they make it out safely.  the terminator and john go to group up with Sarah.  After they're together The Terminator explains why he came to protect John and also explains what judgement day is...(Andrew Dison recieved the terminator hand from the cover up of the mess in their hydrogen plant...therefore he is destined to make the terminators that will destroy the human race...with a chip and the hand.) Sarah tells them what to do.  Obviously she planned ahead for Judgement day and stored guns underground where her spanish buddy Enrique lived and were.  Sarah has a dream of Judgement Day and acts quickly.  She decides that she'll change the future of the terminators by killing Dison but she has a change of heart before she kills him.  The Terminator and John show up and lay down the whole thing in front of Dison.  That he would be responsible for 3 billion deaths in the future.  So they decide to destroy everything that would make a terminator.  The chip, the hand, his house, and most importantly the Skynet Company.  From there the action takes off.James Cameron has made a fantastic movie.  Overall I think it's better than the 1st one.  The version i saw was on Tv but i plan on buying the T2 Extreme DVD.  Excellent Sci-Fi movie.  Arnold's best.	5.0	Great	2003-07-07	1	0	1

The story concept is interesting, but what stood out was the constant stream of pointless, foul language combined with unlikeable characters.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1X47U1QYK50OE	George Mallone	Terminator 2 stands as the best action/science-fiction ever put to film; and the DVD lives up to that high standard.Terminator 2, the sequel (obviously) to James Cameron's landmark Terminator movie, takes that films atmosphere of terror, of hopeless and heroic struggle against murderous and unfeeling machines, and kicks it up several dozen notches. This time, our mechanized friend from the future(Arnold Schwarezenegger) is fighting for the good guys; fighting to protect humanity's one hope in the future in the War Against the Machines, John Connor (played by Edward Furlong) from quite possibly the coolest sci-fi villain ever created; the shape-shifting and seemingly unstoppable T1000 (Robert Patrick, now of X-Files fame.)Since we last saw our merry band of apocalypse fighters, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been locked up in the looney bin for professing her belief that a man from the future saved her life from a killer robot and impregnated her with her son. But when her now-estranged son realizes that her tale was more then an insane rant, and gets his hulking robotic friend to help break her out, the spectacular action gets going (and going, and going.)The action sequences alone are worth owning the movie. Using revolutionary (especially for the time) special effects, Cameron creates an adrenaline-pumping thrillride that has yet to be matched in the intensity of its atmosphere (and holds its own special effects wise, even against new-comers such as The excellent-if-slightly over-rated Matrix).But there's more to this then great action; Linda Hamilton's performance as a fanatically militant mother with a clear vision of the dark future awaiting humanity is superb, and again, helped along by Cameron's strong visual style (the visuals from that &quot;Judgement Day&quot; dream never quite leave your head after you've seen it, even once!) And Edward Furlong's attempts to bond with his emotionally-incapacitated protector range from comical to touching, and provide another emotional base upon which the film works to its dramatic, explosive conclusion. To top it all off, this DVD, to put it simply, rocks. The visual quality, audio quality, the features (6 HOURS of content!), my goodness. All I can say is that this is a DVD experience simply unmatched by anything else (especially since I had the fortunate benefit of watching it on a 43&quot; Sony Projection TV with 5.1 Surround Sound!)Whatever Cameron-less machinations (pun-intended) might be undertaken with the future of this franchise, this flick stands as a towering achievement of high-octane, action-packed, smart sci-fi.	5.0	Best Action Sci-Fi Ever; Even Better DVD	2001-07-02	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1T2E1SY35D6ML	Gerard T. McGuire	This is why they invented DVD. You take a great movie and you jam it so  full of extras that it takes you days to watch it all. You tweek the sound  so it blasts through your surround speakers as if you were watching it all  over again in the multiplex. You add additional footage in a special  edition that extends the movie by  twenty minutes. You gather ALL the stars  of the film and interview them about the process of making the movie and  everything that surrounded it. You would then have a DVD like TERMINATOR 2  THE ULTIMATE DVD.In my previous reveiws, I was often dissapointed when  good films werent given the tweaking that I love with the DVD medium. This  is everything I hoped it would be and more. You know the story, now get the  extras. BUY THIS DVD!!!!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3KEH903M7EG2F	Gordon Riley	This is the sequel to Terminator, James Cameron's first majr blockbster.  The basic story of T2 is two cyborgs(Arnold Schwartzenegger and Robert  Patrick) are sent back in time. One to kill the future leader of the human  resistance in the war with super intelligent machines(John Connor AKA  Edward Furlong), the other to protect him. Unlike the first Terminator,  Schwartzenegger plays the role of the hero and is more humane in his  actions. Like most of James Cameron's movies, special effects are  outstanding, as is the action. However, there has always been one thing  that has always bugged me about Cameron's movies. The theatrical releases  are often cut to shorten the experience and take away from the actual story  being presented. Examples of this are &quot;The Abyss&quot; and  &quot;Aliens&quot;. There is more action, with a better symbolisation of  motherhood in Aliens with lost footage intact. In the Abyss, characters are  given more depth with the alien encounter becoming all the more profound in  the special edition. And just like those two movies, Terminator 2 is a far  more superior film when presented in it's complete form compared to its  theatrical doppleganger. Charcaters are given more life, especially Arnie  in his interactions with Furlong which go a long way to explaining Arnies  more cuddly side, as well Sarah Connor's(Linda Hamilton) concerns over the  machine which is watching over her son. Highlights of the new footage are  the scene where Furlong opens up Arnies's head to reprogramme him, and the  Sarah's dream where Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn, the hero from the first  movie) forewarns her about the impending danger that their son is about to  face. This is by far a superior edition. Forget the theatrical edition.  This is the way the movie should have been. (I've heard rumors that Titanic  is missing twenty minutes of footage. Could Cameron's record with special  editions continue? We'll have to wait and see. ^_^)	5.0	The way T2 should have been the first time	2000-06-06	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1V37BTVO0K0XY	gothamknight	First off there is the theatrical version on here. All you have to do is the following: Disc 1. On the Main Menu, highlight the words 'Sensory Control.' then press the 'Right' arrow key on your remote five times then the words 'The Future Is Not Set' will appear in Red on the right hand side. Now press 'Enter' and the Main Menu will switch to the Theatrical Version Menu. Now you can watch the Theatrical Version of the film. Thats all you have to do. Now for this film this has to be Schwarzenegger best film. It was like he was born to play this role. And the effects are great. The movie broke ground with some amazzing graphics and effects. The basic plot is SkyNet sends another terminator(the T-1000)back in time to destroy a young John Conner(the future leader to destroy the machines and skynet.)But in order to protect the young John, the John from the future reprograms another terminator and sends him back in time to protect him. Sarah Conner is locked up in a mental institution but breaks out with a little help of her son and the Terminator. But the T-1000 won't give up untill he destroys John. Great film and an excellent DVD. I wished there was more special features though.	5.0	Theatrical version is on here.	2006-02-23	2	2	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3S738GO35SH0W	Greg Hughes	There is action galore in this film. This sequel takes place ten years after the first. John Connor, the future saviour of the human race, lives with his foster parents, while his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is  imprisoned in a mental institution, where the doctors are convinced her  warnings about the future are the ravings of a lunatic.Since the  machines in the future failed to kill the mother of John Connor, a new  liquid metal prototype (the T-1000), has been sent to kill John as a child.  The resistance fighters have sent back a reprogrammed T-800 (Arnie) to  protect John.The action is almost non-stop but there are some flaws  that I noticed. When the T-800 is looking after John we see a bit of the  T-800's non-human, emotionless personality, the way he uses words like  &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;affirmative&quot;. Since the original  purpose of the Terminators was to infiltrate the human resistance groups,  was Kyle Reese (John's father) right to say that they're &quot;very hard to  spot&quot;? Arnie is well-built and muscular, but wouldn't most people born  after a nuclear war be skinny and under-nourished? Sorry if this sounds  like knit-picking, I just thought it was worth mentioning.The reason I  think this film needs another sequel is because of the ending. Sarah, John  and the T-800 try to destroy Skynet, and thus prevent the war from ever  happening. It is obvious they didn't succeed. If they had the time machine  would never have been built, Kyle would never have been born, and John  Connor would never have been conceived. Plus all those extras would never  have met violent deaths at the hands of the first Terminator. In which  case, the future must be set!I give this film four stars because of the  great action and special effects. The plot also includes the neat irony of  mankind's dependence on computers, the things that end up trying to destroy  us.	4.0	This film is crying out for a sequel	1999-12-12	8	4	4
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A71JM03XAQ4GJ	Greg Mallon	Love the movie... just a quick note about the version that comes in the METAL CASE.  It looks COOL, but once I slid it out of the METAL CASE (which was tough), sliding it back in causes the stiff plastic covering on the &quot;normal case&quot; to tear and rip (the sharp metal edges on the metal cover do this.  Maybe I got a badly manufactured version.  Not a comment on the movie, but just beware of the cool case (i had to get rid of it since it was &quot;eating up&quot; the normal case every time I slid it in and out).

This is a good sequeland I still have the ultimate edition dvd, but decided toupgrade to this. I was concerned before buying it afterreading reviews about the grain issues. There is some,but I have to say most of the film is clear as can be,colors look nice, sound is great and there's interactiveextras. It's definitely a step up from the dvd and probablythe best it's going to look & sound for now considering thefilm is over 20 years old.

It will probably drop in price, but for a fan and collector, I wouldn't take the chance of missing out.  I own all these editions, so this doesn't really give much that's new other than a new transfer or remaster of the Blu-Ray.  It would have been nice to put some type of new feature on the BD disc.Considering that a Sideshow Collectibles bust is like $500, if you want the display this is nice piece.  The teeth are white, which is more accurate than the ones that show metal teeth.

The packaging of the DVD is  sleek and unique, the menus are funky and consistent with the film, and the  image and sound quality of the transfer is second-to-none.  What turned me  off is the supplemental material describing the making of the movie. This  stuff usually fascinates me, but after reading about it on this disc, I  feel qualified to go out and film ""T3: War and Peace"" myself. The  information is presented on hundreds of screens of text which take hours to  plow through, sparsely highlighted with live interviews and examples of  what they are describing. Occasionally there is the truly interesting  nugget of trivia or clever Hollywood trick explained, but mostly it is just  descriptions of camera apertures, lighting angles, etc.  Exceptions to this  are the chapters explaining the T-1000 and T-800 special effects.  But on  the good side, it certainly gives you a firsthand idea of all the work that  goes into making a movie.  The name of this DVD should be ""Everything  (and we mean EVERYTHING) You've Ever Wanted to Know About T2 (but were  afraid to ask!)""

PACKED with the ULTIMATE IN SOUND (Digitally Mastered by THX, Dolby Surround EX 5.1 and Dolby Surround DTS 5.1) and picture quality (the widescreen format enhanced for 16X9 TV's) is the ULTIMATE in entertainment.

""The Terminator"" introduced us to Arnold Schwarzenegger as the indestructible killing machine...and made him and Cameron superstars. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" continues the story of Sarah and John Connor's fight against the machines. ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" is a worthy sequel to this movie, taking the story to its inevitable conclusion, promising another sequel, which I hope Arnold returns for. ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" and ""I'll Be Back"" (featured in the first film) are classic lines from the movies which have permeated our everyday jargon. Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.""THE TERMINATOR""In the first installment of the series which would skyrocket Schwarzenegger and Cameron to fame, Arnold plays The Terminator, an unstoppable killing machine sent back through time. Michael Biehn (""Meggido,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss"") plays Kyle Reese, a man sent back through time to 1984 L.A. to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton, who would return for the 2nd movie, reviewed here) with a mission and message for her. Arnold, who was almost an unknown at the time, delivers a strong performance as the title character, the unstoppable killing cyborg sent to destroy both Sarah and-I'm not going to spoil it. A killer-perfect performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger (who would rise to fame, along with James Cameron) along with the rest of the cast, the score by Brad Fiedel (who would return to score the next film in the series), the widescreen format (enhanced for 16X9 TV's) and the AWESOME sound mix make this film definitely worth having.Rated PG-13 for violence, language and brief sexuality/nudity.TERMINATOR 3:RISE OF THE MACHINESArnold Schwarzenegger returns to the role that rocketed him to stardom-and eventually, ""Governator"" of California-to defend John Connor (this time played by Nick Stahl) and an old flame (Claire Danes) against a new Terminator-a woman (played with sexy murderous flare by Kristanna Loken (you're HOT, BABY). Rated PG-13 for violence and language."	5.0	One Of The Best Terminator Films Ever Made!! LOVED IT!!	2004-11-18	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A4TOB6RCLDEJW	HANA SIEGELSTEIN	Okay, I wanted to get the original edition on Amazon, and then I saw this  Ultimate Edition. I didn't know there was a difference, so I checked it out  and what I saw made me wish it came out sooner! I got the DVD the day it  came out and then I played it all night long! I played the Theatrical  Version, then I played the Special Edition, and then I checked out all the  biographies of Arnold, Linda, Eddie, Robert, and James Cameron. I then  thought I was cheated but I first flipped the other side and I got all the  other great features. So many great features you need both sides. I checked  out the Trialers and Teasers, the Documentries, the supplementary features,  the story boards, and I read some fo the script, which is a great addition.  I then read the booklet over and over. And after seeing the Special  Eddition, this is now my favorite movie!!!!	5.0	THIS VERSION MAKES IT MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!!!!	2000-09-09	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A20SPXGDNGLZ8G	"Hani ""Hani"""	Terminator 2 - Judgment Day, this second Terminator movie by hard-working and imaginative director James Cameron has all five stars. This movie was a true hit in the early 90's but is still a great classic in the 21st century, with many movies that cant live up to those special EFX and action scenes this is an unforgettable action/SCI fiction movie. Arnold's character the &quot;Cyberdynes System model 101&quot; loses the ever so cool spotlight in T2 when a much more advanced shape-changing LIQUID METAL Terminator the &quot;T1000&quot; (Played brilliantly by Robert Patrick) is sent back to destroy or what should I say TERMINATE John Connor the future resistance against the machines.Great special EFX and Action scenes with a spectacuar finish no-doubt thought up by the mastermind of the terminator James Cameron.The Ultimate Edition DVD provides loads of special features and a directors cut version with never before seen deleted scenes.Not to mention the DVD enhances the entire viewing of the movie with more spectacular looking Special EFX.A truly captivating movie an ABSOLUTLY MUST OWN ON DVD FILM!	5.0	Terminator 2 - Judgment Day	2003-09-15	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A20FK68BUB1IVA	Happy Reader	"I ordered this 2-disc DVD, forTerminator 2: Judgment Day, because I was replacing our old VHS. According to this amazon page, this 2-disc set has the Theatrical release and the Special Edition Version of T2, both in widescreen.  The 2-DVD set I received had only the Special Edition Version on DVD. The 2nd disc has the Theatrical Release, but it is NOT a DVD. It is to watch on your computer using some fancy application that I don't have. So it didn't work on my computer. I returned the DVD because I thought they sent me the wrong one.[Please note the version of Terminator 2 that I linked above. Amazon has a bad habit of putting a review for one edition/version of a movie on every page of every version/edition. It can be difficult to figure out which version someone is reviewing!]After I sent back the wrong version of the movie, I ordered it a second time, again from this page (as linked above). The second time I received the SAME thing. So WARNING! You cannot watch the Theatrical release on DVD. And the EXTRAS shown on this amazon page are different from the extras actually contained on the 2-disc set they'll send you.That said, I decided to keep the second set, even though I tried to contact the seller, through amazon's contact seller feature, twice to ask what's going on, and they never bothered to reply. Beware of Mighty Silver! There is no customer service there, and they don't care if you got the wrong item. Incidentally, amazon doesn't care, either. They'll give you your money back, but they're not changing the page.Now that my rant is over, I'll review the 2-disc set I received - twice.The first DVD disc has the Special Edition Version of the movie. Your viewing choices are to watch in Dolby 5.1 SurroundSound, Dolby Headphones. You can also watch it with a fantastic Commentary Track, and with either English or Spanish Subtitles.The differences between the Special Edition and the Theatrical Release are that several deleted scenes are added back in. To tell the truth, I like the Theatrical Version better, but maybe that's just because it's a beloved movie in our house.Added scenes that I noticed:1. The T-1000 leaves the scene of the wreckage of the giant tow-truck he used to chase after T (Arnold's Terminator) and John on the motorcycle. New: Firemen are cleaning up the wreckage.2.  In the psychiatric hospital, Sarah is sitting on her bed in her cell. New: Sarah has a dream sequence with Reece seemingly visiting her. (According to the Commentary Track, the idea was to tell some past story from the 1st movie. I think it's open to interpretation whether she had a vision or a dream.)3. In the psychiatric hospital, the doctor has just stopped at Sarah's cell, where she's doing pullups, and he's talking about her with his guests. New: Two guards enter Sarah's room and use truncheons and tazers on her to get her to take her pills. It's a brutal scene.4. T and John have called the foster parents' house, and realize they must be dead. Cut to the T-1000, changing back to a policeman from the shape of the foster-mother (skewering the foster father). New: T-1000 goes into the back yard and kills the dog. He takes it's collar, and sees the name ""Max"". He realizes T and John tricked him.5. They have pulled the police car into a closed service station, where T and Sarah sew each other up. New: John asks T if he can learn. T says that he can if they pull a switch in his microprocessor. Sarah opens his head and takes out the chip and is going to destroy it. John stops her. (According to the Commentary, this was deleted for timing reasons, but both Cameron and Wisher really miss it. They love how it shows Sarah's mistrust and confliction with T.)6. T busts the window of an old station wagon to steal it, then they are on the side of a road and Sarah is eating a sandwich in the station wagon. New: In between these two scenes, John takes T to get food at a food trailer and tries to teach him how to smile.7. Traveling South in the station wagon, Sarah asks T about Dyson, and T replies that he has extensive files on him. New: Scene changes to Dyson working at his computers at his gorgeous seaside home. His wife wants him to stop for some family time, but he is too excited, working on a revolutionary microprocessor.8. They stop at Enrique's in the desert to weapon up. New: Sarah tells Enrique they should leave tonight, too, and he responds angrily. In the underground weapons locker that John and T opened, there's a longer conversation between the two.9. In the final scene at the iron works, the T-1000 has just reconstituted himself after the liquid nitrogen freezing. New: As he passes a striped steel barrier to enter the building, he puts his hand on the barrier and his hand and arm turn striped and stick to the bar. (Per the Commentary, this had been the first thing to show that he had been ""injured"" and wasn't working quite right.)COMMENTARY TRACK:  I thought this was one of the best commentary tracks I've ever listened to, and I've listened to a lot! It was recorded on 2/10/2003 with commenters James Cameron, director and co-writer, and William Wisher, co-writer. This was the first time Cameron had recorded a commentary track for one of his films. They cover everything, from special effects to acting to subtext. Two of my favorite comments:At the very beginning, when the T-1000 comes through from the future and is kneeling naked, Cameron comments: ""We did digital winky removal here. Apparently it was not complete ... I remember seeing a bill for digital willy removal. I want that money back!""When someone asks, who is your favorite kick-a$^% female character, my answer is always Linda Hamilton in T2. She is not comic-book and special effects, she is the real thing. In the commentary, Cameron says that Linda didn't just work out, she did weapons training. And, ""Linda could really run. Like a panther.""Also, at the beginning, Cameron mentions how when he first approached Arnold Schwarzenegger about T2, Arnold wasn't enthusiatic. He ""wasn't at all sure"" that it was going to work for him to play the good guy.DISC 2:1. ""No Feat But What We Make"". This is a 24 minute short on Terminator 2's ""role in the rise of digital special effects"". Comments by James Cameron (T2 writer-director and director of ""The Abyss""), Dennis Muren (ILM visual effects supervisor), John Knoll (ILM CG supervisor for ""The Abyss"" and Co-Creator of Adobe Photoshop), Steve Spaz Williams (ILM animation), Mark A.Z. Dippe' (ILM CG Supervisor), Stan Winston (Special Makeup and Terminator effects), Peter Jackson (director ""The Lord of the Rings""). Cameron and Knoll talk about how the water alien psuedopod, in ""Abyss"", was a leap of trust in CGI, because nothing like that had ever been done in film. Then, in T2, what Cameron had was a $100 million dollar film dependent on CG, when it had been done only once before in a film and then for only one 9-minute sequence.2. ""T2: On the Set"", an 8 minute production shot montage. Interesting stuff, like the model shots of the tank truck, carrying liquid nitrogen, sliding down the street.3. ""High Definition - Theatrical Version ROM"". ""This disc contains the complete theatrical version of the film in Microsoft Windows Media 9 series, payable in high definition and 5.1 sound exclusively on your PC. The resolution is higher than standard DVD format.""  Didn't work on my computer.4. DVD ROM.

Didn't work on my computer.ZERO stars for an amazon page that gives false information.ZERO stars for Mighty Silver, incapable of fulfilling your order from the amazon page.FIVE stars for the theatrical release, now if I could just get a DVD of it.FOUR POINT FOUR stars, rounded down to FOUR, for the Special Edition Version of T2 - it's not as tightly constructed as the theatrical release.ADDED LATER:I did get a single-disc DVD of the theatrical release. I don't think I can give you a link to the amazon page, because it is not fulfilled by amazon. Rather you order from individual sellers and pay shipping. However, I got it for $2.99 plus shipping!Unfortunately, I can't review that DVD and it's extras, because amazon put my review of the 2-disc extended version on the page of the single disc theatrical release. I wish they would stop doing that."	5.0	WARNING! Theatrical Version is NOT on DVD and EXTRAS different from amazon page!	2012-09-23	2	2	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A12IRF62KW0H3R	Harold J. Sharon	This extreme version will make you extremely upset you wasted your money.  It has DRM embedded!  Good luck getting the DVD ROM to play.  You have to jump thru hoop after hoop after hoop.  It says WM 9 but it's an outright lie.  You have to install Interactual player, THEN go their website and hunt for a license and then MAYBE it'll work. And if it does, you get only 5 days and then have to renew again!Other than that, it really is a 5 star dvd of course.  But most would want this for the hd version and that deserves 1 star.

You have two discs, 1 is the movie and the 2nd is all of the special features, and it takes days to even name all of them, i mean there are three documentaries, 8 teasers and trailers, seperate interviews with the cast and crew, the entire screenplay, 52 chapters of behind the scenes footage, and original storyboard drawings.  This is what DVD was made for!The first disc can just make this the ultimate edition.

Now you can't just get this version, you need a code for it. Go to the special edition menu and highlight ""play special edition"" then type in 82997, you might have to press enter in between each number, then the ""go to theatrical version"" option changes to ""play extended special edition"".  Along with the three versions, the DVD has crystal clear picture and 6.1 DTS Surround Sound!!!!!. On the extended versions of the movie, you won't even notice any cut scenes because they are slipped perfectly in the movie.  There are also cast & crew biographies that you can access as well as an audio commentary.  Now to the 2nd disc.  The three documentaries include: The Making of Terminator 2 Judgement Day where they talk about the making of the film, T2 More than Meets the Eye where they talk about deleted scenes and why they cut them, and the last is The Making of Terminator 2 3-D: Breaking the Screen Berrior where they talk about the making of the 3-D terminator ride. Next is the teasers and trailers, there are 2 theatrical trailers, 1 teaser, the T2 special edition trailer, and 4 japenese trailers.The next is the storyboards, to access these, click on ""data hub"". There are many,many original drawings, from the arrivals to the end of the movie. Now for the script, you also have to go to ""data hub"" for this. You get the entire original screenplay of the movieit is awesome to read what Jim Cameron original had in his mind for T2. Next is the 52 chapters, once again you need to go to ""data hub"". There are seperate chapters for differnt things, i will name you some. pre-production,screenplay,ommited scenes,special effects,makeup,visual effects,marketing campaign,logo customization,post production,casting,props,and post production. There are many,many more but i can't give it all away. The next is the interviews, you need to go to ""data hub"" for these. After you choose the interviews, you can see them interview people like James Cameron, Arnol Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, William Wisher,and Robert Patrick. If you own the extreme or normal edition, trash those f***ing pieces of sh** and get the Ultimate Edition, you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"	5.0	The Best DVD Ever Created	2008-06-13	1	1	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1G1CA1WXD2AE2	Harry Thomas	I'm irked. I bought the T2 Special Edition laserdisc box set (used, but I still paid $75 for it) and now they come out with this. I almost didn't buy it because I had the box set, but I'm damned sure glad I did. This is quite simply the best DVD package that I've seen yet. I knew it was going to be different when I had to remove the stainless steel slipcover. I wasn't disappointed.The interface is top notch - very slick, but doesn't hum at you (like some DVDs do) while you're making a selection. Lots of cool sounds when you change levels, though, and very good CGI imagery. The movie side of the double-sided disc has both the original version and the special edition director's cut. Instead of a long solo commentary from one person, disc supervisor Van Ling narrates and intersperses audio clips from 25 other people who worked on the film from Cameron to Schwarzenegger and the other primary actors, effects people, etc.The other side contains three documentaries; the first on the making of the original version; the second on the deleted scenes; and the third on the making of the Universal Studios T2:3D stunt show. (Spoiler warning: if you haven't been to see T2:3D, then I suggest that you wait to watch this one.)The other stuff on this side is what you can get on the laserdisc box set; fifty chapters of step-by-step pages, interviews, and background video clips on what it took to make the film. Added is a chapter on the T2:3D show and an insight into the making of a DVD.I guess I'll keep the T2 laserdisc box, because after seeing this, no one is going to want to buy it when they can get this. Extremely well done on the part of all involved.	5.0	Oh, boy. This is the best special edition DVD yet	2000-08-29	5	5	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1845AS6BXN69	HDmaniac	The Extreme edition is clearly a marketing ploy targeted to bring in extra $$$ with the upcoming T3 release.  The so-called improved picture in the Extreme edition is not noticeable compared to the Ultimate edition.  The Ultimate edition contains more versions of the movie and also has the DTS soundtrack that the Extreme edition lacks.

In this movie Arnold is back but this time is a good robot sent from the future to protect John Connor. He learns catch phrases from John which he uses in awesome and funny moments. But, there is also antoher robot sent back who can adopt different people's appearances and can make realllllllllllyyyyyyyy sharp objects with his hands and fingers. This movie has the governator beating people up, blowing up cop cars with a minigun, and fighting a stronger robot. The action scenes are classic and shall always be remembered and the scenes of the future may seem cheesy now but were absolutely amazing for the time. This is a must see movie. From the opening sequence with Arnold arriving all naked and going into a bar to find a proper outfit to to the vilain telling the pilot of a helicopter ot ""get out"" (which he does and so would I as my life means more than my bones!!!!!!!) to the awesome conclusion!!!!!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This sequel is by far, much more complex, fascinating and terrific than the first one. The engrossing and inevitable between the man and the machine is cynically remarked through apparently simple narrative devices (for instance, the use of Atari -a machine to fake another machine - and get some money; the simulated War games in the Gallery moments before T 1000 makes his appearance; the pleasant moments in which our future hero young boy tries to advise his mentor machine, that not all human being must be exterminated, the hard explanation about what feelings mean, the funny twists of words in search perhaps of his missed future father).The future against the fate!The impressive opening sequence, in which we watch the mechanic foot flattening the brain's skull, (suggesting a clear statement about who is the master) of the bloody Battle between men and machines is visually stunning.The undeniable and superb employment of EFX , makes of this last device another invisible actor. There are many breathtaking chases, and the double final battle keeps for you a clever message; the machine against the human race, exterminating any possible trace about developing the future technology that will produce the abominable cyber generation. The perspective of the viewer is cleverly twisted , but imagine you change of vision angle and  ignoring all the futuristic dramatis personae to come. They would be a terrorist sect trying to avoid the ineffable progress. On the other hand we have the final confrontation between both machine generations, but the game has ended and the final resolution is a true hair raising battle in the middle (once more the underground irony) of an industrial stage. The elevated temperature of these furnaces permit through the melting process the transformation of solid metal into liquid metal, and that 's another winner premise.  The only way to face and win is reversing the process and make the liquid metal - the support structure of the new generation returns to its origin. Fire extinguishing the fire and both machines will find themselves in that melting cemetery. One of them obviously will die violently while the other will decide as a juggernaut: the mission is done: welcome the future with its virtues and faults.A superb triumph and one of the most original films of he Decade.	5.0	Sometimes second parts are better!	2005-09-03	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A12DR29EPNIGGG	"Honky Dreadlocks ""55318008"""	T2: Extreme DVD hits on all cylinders. The presentation of the movie is razor sharp--the picture and sound are crystal clear. The movie itself is so awesome that lackluster features probably wouldn't be too much of a drawback (unless this weren't the first version of the movie you were buying on DVD), but the features are outstanding. Cameron and Wisher's commentary is actually entertaining, and the text commentary is so exhaustive that it's almost hard to keep up with (and I didn't really notice any overlap between the two commentaries). And the best feature is the option allowing you to watch the movie in its theatrical form, leaving out the new footage. There's nothing really wrong with the new stuff--watch for a hilarious new scene at the truck stop--but it's nice to have the option to watch the original cut.Movie: 5/5DVD: 5/5	5.0	Immaculate	2004-01-24	1	1	0

Non stop action, dazzling visual effects and acceptable performances make this a classic and  the role of the terminator is probably what Arnold Schwarznegger will be best remembered for.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	I.B.	This movie is one of the best Sci-fi/ Drama action movies to drop since the day it came out. This and the matrix. I saw the first terminator and was hooked but I never expected to see a sequel. This almost makes the  first one look like nothing. They even made a 3-d ride out of it in florida  which is just as good as the movie. Anyone who hasen't had the cahnce to  check it out needs to go see what i'm talking about because it is  action-packed from beginning to end. Getting back to the movie I have to  say if u have a home system don't hesitate cranking up the volume and  watching this. It will make it like your seeing this for the first time if  you haven't seen it already. The plot, action, and ending was all on point  and it's nothing I can really say I didn't like. It really made you think  about the future and what would happen when it came out. Even wathcing it  now makes you wonder. Overall, the creators out-did themselves with this.  The only question I have is will there be a part 3?  I guess we just have  to wait and see.	5.0	Terminator 2 took it to the next level	2000-07-19	7	1	6

This movie sets a landmark in filmmaking, especially for hollywood and james cameron.  The fact that this was actually written by a director was great because not a bunch of great scripts and stories come out of hollywood these days.  This one is much better than the first one, although the first one is amazing also, but there is no way in beating out the second one.  There's actual character development and emotion in this movie tied in with action and suspense.  I can't wait for the third one to come out!	5.0	Unbelievable!	2002-08-08	2	0	2
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AT4ONNJ7NMBRW	Ichikoh	What can I say about this DVD and movie in particular.  First off this is the best action film that I could think of.  This is truly an action classic.  Then they added the digital and audio quality to the DVD version, and it kicks up the experience another notch.  I put this DVD in and let the action come out of my home theater and it pounds my heart, just like it came out back in the early 90's on the movie screen.There are tons of features on the DVD from commentaries to trailers and interviews.  I really enjoy the extended and deleted scenes that were cut from the theatrical version.  It makes the movie more complete.  Overall, buy this movie and put it in your DVD collection.	5.0	Awesome DVD......	2005-07-12	2	2	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2H39QFZSUI1BE	IClavdivs	You may need to have grown up in the 90s to truly appreciate this film, but in my opinion, it's one of the greatest films of it's time. You're not going to find much to appreciate about this film on an intellectual level. Sure the running theme of &#34;No fate but what we make&#34; raises it slightly above the average action film, at it's core, this movie is just big dumb science fiction action, of an ilk they don't really make anymore.The T-1000, a brawny emotionless cyborg from the future, is the role that Arnold was born to play, and he reprises it perfectly while adding some subtle additions to the character. Sadly this was the peak of his career before entering his role as the governor of California and is now probably too old to be a major player in the action genre. Linda Hamilton is also amazing here. No longer the meek victim of the first movie, her character Sarah Connor has clearly been driven nearly insane by the revelations of the last movie and a desperate need to prepare her son for his future role as humanity's savior.	4.0	Ahhhnold's High Water Mark	2013-03-05	0	0	0

I'll hold onto it just in case sometime in the future I get another brand of Blu-Ray player that can play this disc.So I would say rent this first to see if your player can handle it or not.

Emotion, special effects, great acting, etc. Let's talk about why this blu ray is the best ever made.1.) For a movie made in 1991, the transfer is flawless. It looks a lot better than the previous blu ray version.2.) The sound is amazing! (Dolby 6.1) The fact that they included a headphones sound option is fantastic! I watched it once with my Bose Quite Comfort 2 headphones, and it blew me away how awesome it was!!!!3.) They have most of the features (all of the good ones at least) from the last two versions of the movie on DVD.4.) We have all three versions of the movie and I love the extended special edition version the best. A must watch.The sound alone is worth the price.Get it. A must for any action fan, and a must for any blu ray owner.	5.0	Greatest Blu-Ray ever created. T2 continues to change the industry.	2009-06-26	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1TVAI295F200M	"""impurities"""	The previous release of T2 on DVD left a bland taste in my mouth.  No extras to speak of, no commentaries, no deleted scenes.Not so with the  newest release of T2, appropriately named The Ultimate Edition.  This DVD  is the paramount of why DVDs are worth the switch from VHS.  Not only does  the sound and video look pristine (you can actually hear the leather of  Schwarzenegger's jacket creak when he gets off the bike at the beginning of  the movie), but the special edition really adds a lot of flavor to the  existing movie.In the theatrical release, the T-800's sudden change from  a cold, unfeeling cyborg to a smiling, caring soul was a bit odd, but the  special edition a lot of questions are answered.  There is quite a bit more  character development, more of Sarah's insecurities, more of John's  leadership qualities, more of the T-1000's sadistic tendencies.The only  reason I didn't give this DVD five out of five was because Artisan made me  spend another 30 bucks to get the great stuff that I should've gotten with  the first release of the movie.If you've previously bought it, or  you've seen it and been waiting for the right time, or if you've never even  seen it before, I would highly suggest this movie.  It's a great addition  to any DVD collection.	4.0	T2: The Ultimate Edition Scores	2000-08-29	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2WHV0YLBOK0I0	Inspiring Insomnia	Terminator 2 was an improvement over the first film, even though, in my opinion, I preferred Ah-nuld as the evil Terminator.  Nevertheless, this film has an exciting, tension-filled story, with special effects that still look great all these years later.  James Cameron was one of the first filmmakers to place women in the traditionally male action role, and Linda Hamilton makes the most of her opportunity here.The blu-ray extras have just about everything you could ask for, and at the current $5 price, this is a steal.	5.0	Awesome film, with great blu-ray extras	2013-01-01	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2H1WNB30JNAWU	Jack D. Lowry	I've have been watching the Terminator movies for a very long time now.  This DVD lives up to what we expect from directors and producers when it comes to a great action movie.  I have watched the movies mutiple times over the years as I have grown older, I do believe I started watching the series when I was just a teenager I am now 30.  Even now in 2012 I havent grown tired of the series or action scenes.  Not exculding the bonus material was a very nice add on to the fans of the Terminator Series.  It has for it's time and it came out in 1991 some of best action scenes ever and I am very selective of my action movies.  So if you have yet to see Terminator 2 Judgement Day then pick this DVD up and sit back make some pop corn grab a drink and savor some great action scenes, good plotline and amazing special effects that will blow you away.	5.0	Terminator 2 Judgement day Extreme DVD is amazing	2012-11-07	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	Completely different from the first film. James Cameron goes a lot beyond his first attempt. He plays a dramatic twist and trick on everyone by making the  terminator  (or rather its sibling) of the first film the protector of John who is now born and kicking. But another terminator has been sent, entirely made of a special metal that makes him able to take any form he wants. The first thing achieved by the good one is to save John from the bad one. Then He saves the mother who is in a carceral psychiatric hospital. Then he prepares the attack against the bad one. But here James Cameron goes beyond this surface. The good terminator becomes a good father substitute for John. He learns human emotions, even if he will never cry, and he also learns human feelings and motivations and he will help in changing the future completely by destroying the research that would produce the thinking machines and the terminators. Then he deals with the bad terminator and manages to get him molten in a tank of metal in fusion, then to destroy the chip and arm that had already been produced by a research worker and a computer firms that had been destroyed in the meantime, and finally to go beyond his mission and all human feelings and destroy the second existing chip that would produce the machine-dominated future by destroying or having himseld destroyed in the metal in fusion. There is thus some hope that the future could change. Here James Cameron is really optimistic : the human race can use machines to transcend the future and the past to change the past in order to have a better future. He just forgets that if one man has invented this chip, it is someting possible in the human society at a certain moment of its development, and hence at least one other man, if not two or three are on the same line of research and will get to the same results, but not in the US this time, or maybe in the US after all, why not. There is no escape from the future of humanity, no matter how dark it may look, and there is A FATE in this historical perspective, even if this fate might accept some variations. But the general line survives and will always come to life. This would have given a pessimistic twist to the story and this was avoided by James Cameron. That is just what people like Stephen King, or some other science fiction writers avoid : Doomsday is necessarily down the road, a man-made artificial doomsday that has little to do with the Apocalypse but that means the end of humanity anyway, and maybe some resistance that will maybe be successful, at least for a time. A great action film though. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.	4.0	Why not change the future with the help of it!	2001-05-13	0	0	0

This film is a rarity: A sequel that far surpasses the originial, though  the first &quot;Terminator&quot; is one of my favorite films I still think  that this movie is better. This is also the best film of the 1990's. The  reason this movie is so good has nothing to do with the jaw-dropping visual  effects.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2VPFW9LN4L23Y	"""jakeybaby"""	James Cameron has always been at the forefront of great film making. When he made the Abyss, nearly everyone was convinced he was something special. Well, Terminator 2:Judgement Day is his crowning glory.The plot is simple.  A young boy, John Connor (Edward Furlong) is destined to become the leader of a resistance against an army of machines bent on destroying humanity.  The machine's A.I. soon figured out that wiping out John before he becomes this inspirational leader will make their task of world domination much easier.  So, they send a cyborg assassin(Robert Patrick) back through time to kill him.  However, the resistance know of this plan, and send their own cyborg(Arnold Schwarzenegger) back through time to protect John.  The scene is then set for a gripping and explosive game of cat and mouse as one machine tries to kill, while the other tries to protect.What i loved about this movie was the contrast of characters. Arnie plays a heavy, superstrong solid metal bruiser, while Robert Patrick plays a sleek, superfast and very stylish killer.  The confrontations between these two warriors are inevitably explosive and great to watch, and what is even better is that the action sequences are not repetitive.  There are new ideas for every set piece, each one using great camera work and jaw dropping special effects.  It is the special effects in fact, that still make this film a CGI benchmark.The real genius in the area of computer graphics was the creation of the Liquid Metal T-1000, the assassin sent to kill John.  This cyborg can shape change to mimic any person, and also to turn it's various body parts into brutal stabbing weapons. This could have been utterly botched, but Cameron has created an awesome piece of movie work.  When you watch the liquid metal sequences, remember that there were no advanced computers involved-this was all done using about 10 apple mac computers linked up together. Stunning.The basic story is nothing new. Humans versus machines in a worldwide fight to the death has been seen in a lot of movies.  Well this movie is different.  Adding the time travel aspect to the Terminator movies was a master stroke, and the Terminator movies will remain as all time masterpieces of film making.  The first film was good-this film is amazing. An essential addition to any DVD collection.	5.0	Judgement-Perfection!	2003-04-29	6	4	2

It was directed by James Cameron (director of the Titanic) who's known to be a perfectionist and it shows.  The dialogue and action sequences are sharp, and the movie benefits from the Blu-ray upgrade.  The only downfall of the movie is that it suffers from the unkillable bad guy.  Every time you think he's dead he comes back to life.  That is forgivable, however, because it is a common thread to scary/action type movies.	5.0	The Best Arnold Movie	2009-01-07	1	0	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2LJ9MP9YTFB98	James Mahan	This is the rare type of movie that can be looked at two ways. If you saw the first movie, it's a good continuation of the story with eye popping special effects. If this your first expierence with the movie, you still  will catch on the gist of the story with the special effects. Either way  it's a good story of human nature and the fear of machines too smart for  humans own good. The special effects were trailblazers for movies such as  the matrix and even jurrasic park. Just about every action movie fan will  like this. Some may not though because it basically is a violent movie with  good intentions.

Those that survived this Judgement Day had to face another war, The War of the Machines.Sarah Connor did have a son, John Connor. In the future, John is a grown man and the leader during the War of the Machines.  The SkyNet Computer System sent out Terminators to go back to 1984 to try to omit John Connor as they were after Sarah Connor before her son was created and born.It is now in the future, the year 1995. A surge of electricity and a black hole appears at a diesel truck stop. A naked, muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is transported through. It is the Terminator again. He walks into The Corral truck stop diner and gets looked at for his nakedness. He asks a biker (Robert Winley) for his clothes, boots and a motorcycle. The Terminator gets a cigar burnt into his chest. This starts a fight.  The Terminator gets ""bad to the bone"".At the Santa Fe bridge, another naked man (Robert Patrick) is transported. He is a T-100.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AIO247KHD2O40	James N Simpson	There is so much on the second disc in the Ultimate Edition that I have spent hours watching and still haven't seen it all yet.  T2 More than Meets The Eye gives a lot of interesting background information as well as showing scenes which did not make the original film.  Granted you have probably seen most of these scenes on TV by now but the accompanying commentary explains what James Cameron was trying to get across and why he ultimately left them out. There are also interviews with the actors in this section.The Making of T2-3D Breaking the Screen Barrier is interesting but is obviously a made for TV piece put out before the Ride was launched at Universal Studios.  It still has the voiceover throwing to two commercial breaks which I wouldn't imagine would have been too hard to cut out.  Apart from that it is pretty interesting but if you haven't actually been to Universal Studios and seen the completed thing I do not think you will get as much out of it.The menu you locate everything on this DVD from is really good, a bit hard to get used to how to get back to the main menus in some sections but once you work it out it is a breeze.  Here you can see stuff like all the merchandise available at the time, the 3 different theatrical trailers which are excellent as well as the trailer for this DVD.  You can see all of James Cameron's 700 original sketches he drew as storyboards as well as stuff from special effects to every different job needed to create the thing.  If you are into making movies then you'll be entertained for days.Oh and yes, the movie is great too.  You'll be back to watch it over and over again. You will also find summaries of the four main actor's careers as well as James Cameron and Brad Fiedel (guy who did the music) on the first disc which are pretty interesting.  The only thing I think could have been improved would be to put the scene selection feature with one less step so you are not just looking at numbers ie 1-4 5-9 etc as this is annoying and time consuming when you haven no idea which one a scene is under.  Apart from that though it is pretty hard to see how this sensational 2 DVD set could be improved. Just buy It!	5.0	This is Great! Trust Me!	2003-12-07	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A14SE1GA8X31DC	Jamie X-Treme	The original Terminator was a good movie. But T2 blows that one away!!! Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy in this astounding sequel. He is sent to protect John Conner, a rebellious teenager who will be the leader and savior of earth in the future. The ultimate enemy in this blockbuster movie is none other than the almighty T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a killing machine made of liquid metal. The Terminator (Arnold) must protect John Conner from the T-1000. The word as not yet been invented to describe the special effects, especially the most nightmarish holocaust scene yet! Ofcourse, this movie is loaded with strong intense violence and action, as well as profanity. This is the best sci-fi action film ever!!! Watch it for yourself and try to make up your own mind. This movie will blow you away!!! It's very moving, gripping, and absolutely unforgettable.	5.0	AN  EASY  FIVE STARS.	2002-10-31	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A17FKPVHJIPNHS	Jason Conley	Picture quality: excellent.  Sound: Perfect.  Metal dvd case: not the best idea in the world.  As soon as you tear open the plastic you're confronted with a metal case that's as tough as the terminator on the cover!  This thing doesn't budge an inch.  They should have made it a tad bigger because it's not an easy task to get the real dvd case out of this thing.  It tore it to shreds people!!!  It ripped the plastic on the cover and scratched up the picture and the sides of the case..and this was the first time i opened it!!!  It really is that hard to get to so BE CAREFUL!!!  Now on to the dvd itself.  On disc one you have the extended version of the movie with over 16 minutes of additional footage added and also some behind the scenes stuff and commentary by James Cameron!  Disc two is a little shallow if you don't have a DVD rom for your pc. You get 2 documentaries, one that's like 20 minutes long and the other that's around 8.  They're both good behind the scenes stuff but nothing spectacular.  The rest of the contents like the Windows Media player version of T2 must be accesed from your computer.  No trailers, tv spots, or even pictures.  Overall, good buy but trust me, be careful opening it!!!	4.0	Watch out for that metal cover!!!  It's tough to open!	2003-09-04	0	0	0

It's the extended version on blu ray with a couple of links to a website that you probably never needed to see in life itself. If you bored and like surfing the net, then this is definitely you.Buy this product for the movie or your movie collection ... if you have it on dvd, save your money.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3DE1IYJGU5HPW	Jason N. Mical	Again, this is another movie I'm not going to try to sell you on.  If you  are considering buying this DVD version, you probably already know it and  love it.  Believe me, you will not be disappointed.  The video and sound  transfers are amazing - five stars to both - and the extra features will  keep you busy for days.  The only video flaws I saw were in the Special  Edition, when an out-take scene was added, lines are noticable across the  screen for a split second.  Also, I was a little disappointed that the SE  cut didn't include the scene where the T-1000 feels John's belongings in  the boy's room, but it is certainly not a necessity, and so much was  included anyway.  Since the disc contains both cuts of the film, purists  can watch their original, and interested parties can see how many of the  extra scenes fit into an extended version, a version that actually works  quite well, if it is a little over-long.  My only complaints with this disc  are the packaging.  Two versions of the Ultimate Edition exist - one that  has one disc, and one that has two.  The two-disc version comes in a  normal, thin case, just like the regular, but because there is an extra  plastic flap to hold the second disc, you cannot put the massive book  inside the case.  Instead, you have to kind of stuff it in the metal,  exterior case, which can be a bit of a pain.  Other than that, this DVD  will satisfy the fans and the extra-features junkies for a long time.	5.0	A Fine Example of the Possibilities of the DVD Format	2000-09-07	2	2	0

I updated the player's firmware (version 1.9), just in case, but don't have it connected via broadband and didn't get a chance to test any of the ""on-line"" content. And contrary to some reviews YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET TO PLAY THE MOVIE!Once I opened the packaging and popped the disc into the player it took less than a minute for the ""Skynet is unable to connect to the internet"" message to appear and you hit ""Cancel"" (if you aren't wired). Another minute and the ""Mainframe Accessing"" animation starts followed by the main menus about a minute and a half later. Once I selected the version 30 seconds passed followed by the obligatory series of splashes and logos, annoying but not much different than most other discs these days. The movie started a few minutes later. So the total time lapse from the moment the disc player tray disappeared to the movie actually beginning (credits and music) was about 6 minutes. A long wait by most Blu-ray standards but certainly not the horror that I've heard some complain about (20 minutes plus!?). The menus too are a bit sluggish but not overwhelmingly so.The video quality is outstanding if a bit soft (not too unusual for a movie of this age) but the sound is AMAZING! This you really must experience with a 5.1/7.1 surround system to get the full effect this film was made to convey. I've owned the T2 laserdisc for years and it remains superior to any DVD version I've seen but this Blu-ray finally trumps it. 4 Stars for the relatively long wait to get to the feature and the slightly sluggish menus but the 'Skynet Edition' is a winner for those with 2.0 compliant BD players."	4.0	'Skynet Edition' Blu-ray on my Panasonic DMP-BD35	2009-06-18	6	4	2

However, the disc menu is quite another story, starting with a very serious looking intial message to the effect that Skynet has determined that insufficient memory is available at this location and that you need to connect a memory stick with at least 10,000 KB of space available together with ""Retry"" and ""Cancel"" buttons.  Having heard that this sort of things does actually occur with certain BDs (""Starship Troopers"" for example) I first connected a USB memory stick and hit the ""Retry"" button several times but to no avail.  I was just about ready to return the disc as defective when, finally out of desperation, I hit the ""Cancel"" button which, lo and behold, started the menu sequence.  If this is the studio's idea of a practical joke, I think it is in very very poor taste.From then on the menu sequence keeps going on and on through one meaningless layer after another until finally you get to the ""Play"" button.

There are still way to many variables for the video to consistenly work.  This is mainly because of copy protection and all the funky stuff they try to do to ensure you only use their player etc.Also, another reviewer referred to a code you need to view the HD content.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	In the history of Sequels, very few seem to have the clout to match or surpass the original movie.  This is one of those movies that far surpasses its predecessor and breaks new ground once again.  The first one was stunning because of the smooth transitions between different mock ups of the Terminator robot, stop motion animation and close up shots.  Just as innovative were the make up effects on Arnold, showing a metal creature under the organic skin of the assassin.  Not to mention it's original story, great script, solid acting and genuine emotion.  In Terminator 2, James Cameron knew that if the villain in the first movie was a tank, then the new one had to be like a Porsche.  Streamlined, efficient and incredibly dangerous, with or without weapons.  It seems Cameron got to do what he had wanted to do in the first movie, create a Terminator who is an everyman.  Someone who could slip into crowds without standing out.  Robert Patrick gets the honor of being the bad guy in this movie, the T1000 Terminator.  His steely glare and psycho-tronic movements mimic what made Arnold so convincing in the first movie.  This is a hunter, a killing machine.  And we know that if he were to ever catch up to his target, he would destroy him immediately, no hesitation.  In this sequel (and who doesn't know the story) Arnold is sent back by John Conner to protect his younger self.  The unstoppable killing machine is now reprogrammed to keep a young boy alive, and at first, he's willing to kill anyone who may threaten him.  The young John Conner, played by newcomer Edward Furlong in this movie, stops him just in time.  Cameron ingeniously writes in a different angle on machines in this movie.  The first one seemed to focus on our reliance on machines and how it would eventually  turn against us.  Now, he is making a careful edict saying that we need to show our machines who is boss.  That they should do what we tell them to do.  But eventually, this machine can learn lessons as well.  Cameron obviously grew with this story, showing the possibilities of our ingenuity and what they can be capable of.  Ultimately, good or bad, it's going to be up to us.  Once again, Cameron breaks new ground with special effects.  The computer generated shape shifting of the T1000 Terminator was something never seen before on the big screen.  It made the character all that much more frightening, especially when you see that he can go toe-to-toe with Arnold.  One of the other impressive aspects of this movie is Linda Hamilton.  Her performance is top notch.  She worked out, studied weapons and martial arts and lost weight in order to become the single minded obsessed woman she is in this movie, 10 years after having her prophesized son.  She is not the same person she was in the first movie.  Sarah Conner has changed...severely.  My only complaint was that she changed so much, there didn't seem to be a trace of the innocence, or the personality of the girl in the first movie.  But that only seems to add to the character.  It makes her seem so distant, so lost, that we realize that she has a long way to go as a character as well.  Her obsession to get to her son and for him to stay alive simply for his purpose of becoming a great leader, over shadows her own motherly instincts to just care for her son in the present.  On the DVD, there is an added scene where Kyle Reece comes back in a dream sequence, it shows Sarah's yearning for him and how much she misses him.  It is one of the few scenes that show that she has not gone completely harsh.  Cameron always knows how to direct action sequences as well.  This movie is no different.  He balances the action with a story and makes sure the movie never loses sight of it's own humanity.  The 2 Disc DVD is packed with extra features and is well worth the money.  The added scenes are cool and tend to give a little more to what we really liked seeing.  There is so much stuff on this one that it will take a while to get through it all.Highly recommended, this movie deserves it's five stars.	5.0	As Ground Breaking as the Original	2001-10-21	4	3	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A259W5KIP41XFL	Jennifer A. Everhart	The Terminator series is one of the greatest science fiction franchises of all time. My favorite is Judgment Day, but the original is also great and I am not so sure about Rise of the Machines. The extended edition of this entry contained a lot of never-before-seen footage that helped it feel more complete. Arnold Schwarznegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their respective roles of the T-800 and Sarah Connor with a cameo of Michael Bhien as Kyle Reese in a deleted dream sequence, with newcomers like Robert Patrick as T-1000 and Edward Furlong as the adolescent John Connor. The action was exciting, the storyline was worthy of picking up where its predecessor left off, and the acting was well-rehearsed. The visual effects were so real. It didn't use CGI much, mostly miniatures, makeup, and anamatronics. The CGI was only used for the T-1000 shape shifting parts, the right way, sparingly and hardly noticeable. Abusing CGI for living characters makes it look fake. The plot is where Skynet tries again to kill John Connor in the past and sends the T-1000 to achieve this goal, and the future Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self. It shows John in foster care after his mother Sarah ended up in a mental institution when she tried to tell authorities about Judgment Day and thought she was a psycho. At the mall, John and his friend were attacked by the T-1000 and the T-800 comes to the rescue. John teaches him about human characteristics, such as speech, like Chill out, Hasta-la-vista, baby, no problemo, etc. John also explained why killing is wrong. It is because we have feelings. Together, they help Sarah escape from the hospital and the trio goes to stop Skynet. This was a great action flick that will keep you entertained for hours, now with all these extras, and an extended version that includes deleted scenes to help the film feel more complete. Too bad the the original version on this DVD can only be played on a P.C. If you want to play the original version on T.V., please get the original DVD revision as well.Edit: I just saw Rise of the Machines more clearly with a friend, and we both thought that was where the franchise hit mediocrity without James Cameron. I will give in-depth reviews of that entry and the original soon.	5.0	The best in the Terminator series gets a great exdended treatment	2009-05-31	0	0	0

It was a great movie. It's too bad that Edward furlong didn't really have an acting career after this movie. He played the part well. I have all the terminator movies except for salvation. I really didn't liked that movie. It was such a shame too being that all the others before were good movies. the shipping on this movie was fast, so that was a plus. overall  I give it four stars; very rarely do I give five star reviews.

This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I know, I know, 8 year olds probably shouldn't be watching this one. Luckily I was taught my right's and wrong's, so it didn't phase me and I didn't miss out on seeing this when it was newly released). This is hands down going to be my next Blu-ray purchase.

I was eight-years-old when this came out, and was extremely excited! Ofcourse the plot concerns two Terminators sent back to kill John Connor, son of Sarah. One is the T-800, played by Arnold, the other is the T-1000, played by Robert Patric, one of my favorite movie villains. The excitement and horrifying tale never let up. For big T-Buffs, get the Ultimate Edition DVD, and watch the Special Edition which features tons of awesome scenes, which include Kyle Reese and some T-1000 special effects that are incredible!The special effects are top-notch with Stan Winston returning aswell as ILM doing CGI work, that would later help make Jurassic Park the great film it is.

They just slap them on this 'new' format, maybe redesign the menu screen in HD, and put it out for sale. Not so with this Skynet Edition of T2. Yeah, the menu looks grrrrrrrreat, but the movie itself looks absolutely flawless (I hear Batman Begins has a great BD transfer as well.) The dark scenes (in tunnels, at night...) have great contrast and subtle variences in the differing shadings. I'm sure you've read the other reviews for the DVDs since they're all lumped together, but this edition gives the third 'extended special edition' when the code 82997 (the date of judgment day-aug 29, 1997) is entered.	5.0	Great BD transfer, same special code!	2011-08-09	8	8	0

I already have the older version of the movie, and I've seen it many times over the years. I have an HP laptop running Windows Vista, hooked up to my 50"" Panasonic HDTV (1280x720), with the VGA connection. I loaded the disk, and it prompted me to install the InterActual player. Vista warned me that the program has issues with the new operating system. I went ahead, and installed it anyway, then immediately downloaded the newest version from the Internet. It then told me that I needed a DVD decoder that I could buy on their web page. I ignored that message, and went on to play the HD version of the movie. It played OK, after some initial stuttering during the first few screens.The picture quality was very good, but the audio was not Dolby Digital 5.1, meaning that there is no surround sound. I followed up on the InterActual web page, and they confirmed this. Apparently, Microsoft used some other audio encoding. So, even though the picture quality is better, I chose to watch the lower definition, extended edition in order to get the DD5.1 sound. I find the sound quality is at least as important as the video quality.The standard definition image is still very good. The nVidia chip set in my laptop does a nice job of upscaling. The 5.1 sound is spectacular as ever. The added minutes in the extended edition don't really add much, but the novelty effect is nice anyway.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3P1EB052N9Y90	Jimmy R	"First off, the picture is the same as the Extreme DVD release from TEN years ago.. Same clarity.. The special features - OVER 8 HOURS (as the Blu Ray Case Describes) aren't there.. When you first insert the disc, unless you have an internet connection (which I do) and an SD card slot and card inserted for downloads (which I do not - not on this device), you get an error message from Skynet stating ""not enough memory"".. So, you've already wasted 30 seconds after inserting the disc.. You hit cancel and the Lionsgate intro plays (now a minute has wasted), now since there's no sd card inserted the menu said ""Not Available"" all over it. You select the minimal features they do have  - trailers mostly. 2 versions of the film: theatrical and extended..and 2 commentaries, all of which are on the Extreme and Ultimate DVD versions... I forwarded to the chapter where John is being asked by his foster mom to clean up his room (cause I wanted a daylight scene)... Checked it and it's the SAME AS THE ENHANCED DVD... Same quality..My problem here is in three parts: 1) Blu Ray was touted to have all this space to hold hours upon hours of special features, far beyond a single DVD.. From what I remember, they were saying between 3- 5 DVD's worth of content could be stored on a single Blu Ray Disc, however, the special features on a typical Blu Ray are minimal at best, and I've yet to find a Blu Ray where it contains all of the same features as the DVD, let alone, more.. It's always less.. But yet, the studios have no problem issuing these two disc Blu Ray sets, with nothing on them..I know that's just a smoke and mirrors trick to make you think it's a big deal... 2) The picture has been remastered in high definition on DVD, so, really, there's nothing new here... and 3) The fact that I need memory or an internet connection for a friggin' disc to work is INSANE.. I bought the disc, I put it in, it should start up. Blu Ray was supposed to have this fast start technology and feature, however every Blu disc that I have (116 so far) takes it's sweet time, and you can't forward past intros, warnings or menus.. And my Player is a new Sony unit..also, it's kinda creepy that it needs to contact a mainframe in the first five seconds.. otherwise you don't get what's advertised on the package.. Universal Blu Rays have done this too (Casino, the Thing, etc.)..Another note on Blu Ray's operation, the discs are supposed to be more durable than DVD, yet I had a smudge on a new disc and the player froze twice. With DVD, if you turn the power off, it'll remember your place..HA, not with Blu Ray, make a mistake by accidentally hitting the power or ""home"", and the whole disc needs to restart like as if you had just hit eject... Then there's the issue of DVD's that weren't produced and formatted for 16x9 screens, 1.85:1 looks criminal by reducing the picture to a widescreen within a 1.33 frame, yet I put in in my up convert Toshiba DVD, and it still fills out at 1.85:1... (T2 is 2.35:1, I know)and if not, I could usually adjust my HDTV's H/V Positions to resize it, this is not available when using the Sony Blu Ray & there's no zoom either... I dunno if this is just the Sony machine that I have, but overall, it's not worth the hassle. And with close to 3,000 DVD's, I'm not rebuying everything, I only intended to upgrade the necessities.So my main point is, if you have an older DVD version of T2, stick with it, trust me, they did a great job on these two particular DVD's; they were testaments to what DVD could do back in the day and were held in high regard.. The Extreme DVD even had a 1080p mastered version of the Theatrical version in that package..and that was 2003.. So for the Skynet Edition I'm only out $5. It was brand new, but I won't be keeping it because of all the unnecessary drama you have to go through before it allows you to select the movie - which I guess is why it was $5, no one else bought it either..... In my humble opinion, and 116 discs later & into this game, Blu is a BIG Bust..Long live DVD.. Oh, and a similar thing occurred on the Reservoir Dogs 15th Anniversary Edition Blu, but that's elsewhere in another review."	1.0	Review and Rating are for the SKYNET Blu Ray Edition	2013-05-29	3	1	2

I, as well as many other consumers, are getting irate and infuriated about purchasing a DVD which we think in the right frame of mind is the best that is out there, and the best that will ever be, and then the company turns around and releases a ""new and improved"" version. This is the fourth version of T2, I believe, which is stupid, ridiculous, and time-consuming. First there was the regular edition of T2, which was short lived (and also long out of print). Then, they go and release the THX version with improved surround sound and commentary (also out of print, I believe). After that comes the Ultimate Edition. I own this one, because I was summoned into thinking that this was the biggie. This was the bonus version that everybody just HAD to have. This came with a new set of commentary, deleted scenes, 2 different versions of the movie, easter eggs, and among MANY, MANY different options. I haven't even had the time to explore all of them yet. Here, about 6 to 8 months later, they release a NEW version of this DVD, called the EXTREME version...how pathetic. This has everything that the Ultimate version has, except the new liquid camera movements that most people don't have the equipment and technology in their own home to handle. I think this was probably a ...poor shot at a promotion for the new T3 movie. This makes me infuriated, because they have also done the exact same with the first installment in the Terminator series. Sure, it's a great bargain that you can pick it up in stores for $$ brand new, but the fact that I had to pay [more] for mine makes me mad.To the point of this review  :  If you already own T2 on DVD, then pass on this one, but if you're looking for a good installment to your series and are thinking about adding T2 to your collection, give this one a green light.-Jared"	2.0	when are they going to stop?	2003-07-03	2	1	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3OD7GOXPSO9Z	JLR	"""Hasta la vista, baby"".A worthy candidate for greatest sequel of all time (along with The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and Toy Story 2), James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day delivers everything that a movie should deliver. It's got dazzling action sequences, spectacular visual effects, an intelligent human story, great characters and a nice blend of action, comedy and pathos, all wrapped in this one $100-million juggernaut. A welcome relief from the bloated misfires of Michael Bay, Rob Cohen and Paul W.S. Anderson, T2 is a movie that uses it budget for ideas and emotions instead of hollow gimmicks and indulgences, a movie that dares to thrill you emotionally and provoke you intellectually.T2 is set nearly a decade after the original Terminator. In the first Terminator, cyborgs from the future sent a machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of human resistance leader John Connor. The plan failed when the human resistance sent Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah and together, they managed to destroy the machine. Flash forward a decade later: Sarah is committed in a hospital when she is falsely assumed to be insane; her son John (Edward Furlong) is raised by foster parents; and Guns N' Roses and Public Enemy are all the musical rage at the time. Once again, the machines send a Terminator (Robert Patrick) back to time, this time to kill John Connor while the humans send back a guardian to protect him. The twist, of course, is that the guardian is basically a replica of the first Terminator, except it is programmed to protect.There are visual effects that are used to show off and then you havevisual effects that are used to tell a story. T2 rests in the latter category as the centerpiece of the special effects is the T-1000, a cyborg made of liquid-metal that can dissolve into various environments and possess the ability to turn into copies of the human it interacts. The T-1000 is a wonderful creation as we see him emerge from floors, transform into human figures, dissolve down from ceilings and create knife-like weapons from his hands and fingertips to kill. The genius of this special effect is that it is used for storyline purposes as opposed to visual pyrotechnics. In a brilliant sequence, the T-1000 jumps off a motorcycle from the top of the building onto a helicopter. After he headbutts the glass, the villain slithers into the cockpit like a silver snake before turning into his human form. The T-1000 then decides to use the helicopter to track down our heroes and kill them off. It is a brilliantly edited sequence that not only presents the awe of special effects as we see it but also helps advance the story a bit.But to heavily praise the special effects is to overlook the human element, which separates James Cameron from his contemporaries that rely on showing off with computers. The relationship between T-800 and John Connor is simultaneously funny and moving; one funny bit involves John teaching the robot how to smile while in an amusing scene, John teaches T-800 how to not speak ""like a dork"" and say phrases like ""no problemo"", ""chill out dickwad"" and the now famous ""Hasta la vista, baby"". The genius of Schwarzenegger is that he can accept roles that are proper for him and make them transcendent and memorable. Unlike the stoic Sylvester Stallone, Schwarzenegger is an actor that is eager to open himself in ridicule, as shown in scenes mentioned above, thus creating a more believable character for anyone to like. He becomes a father figure to John and his impending demise at the end strikes an emotional chord given the relationship between the two.Besides Furlong and Schwarzenegger, there are equally good performances from other actors, including Linda Hamilton as John's nihilistic mother with a grim outlook on humanity and Joe Morton as the troubled Myles Dyson, who is working on a new microprocessor that will unwittingly set the events for Judgment Day, the destruction of humanity. Cameron's skills with actors are often taken for granted and once again, he shows his skills at getting solid performances from a cast like he did in Aliens (1986).As usual in a James Cameron movie, there are loads of exhilarating action scenes that will get audiences pumping. The opening car chase as the T-1000 chases after John Connor in a truck is a mind-blowing experience that is also visually playful: The T-1000's menacingly imposing truck chasing down John and his comparably tiny motorcycle is an amusing metaphor of how powerful this machine is compared to the puny, vastly vulnerable Connor. The third car chase, this time with the T-1000 flying a helicopter after the heroes in a S.W.A.T. van, is also an eye-opener as we see an amazing camera shot of an actual helicopter flying over and under the overpasses with ease. Sequences like this would have been via computer; here, it was all done in real life. And the final showdown between Arnold and the T-1000 is exciting as they fight in a steel mill, a symbol of two machines fighting it out in a domain or a setting that created them in the first place.T2 is the apotheosis of what you call a ""labor of love"". Here is an action epic that is intelligently crafted, tremendously exciting and very witty. James Cameron often takes flake for his treatment of cast and crew members in pursuing a vision but watching T2 and all his other movies that have box-office successes, it is clear that not only do the ends justify the groans but such principles should actually be considered a good thing for a director."	5.0	The 'Citizen Kane' of Science-Fiction Sequels	2010-09-30	3	3	0

NO, the High Definition version will not work in all PCs.If you plan on viewing the High Definition version... FORGET ABOUT IT!  Personally, I hate to watch movies on my PC.  I'd rather sit on my couch and fire up the good old fashioned TV.  But, just out of curiosity, I bought this edition and thought I'd see what all the fuss was about.  BAD MOVE!  Look at the package and you'll see, the High-Definition version only plays on very High-End PCs.&quot;Recommended System Requirements for T2: High-Definition&quot;- Windows XP PROFFESIONAL- 512 MB RAM- 3 GHz Processor!- 128 MB / 3D Video- 24 Bit 96 KHz Multichannel Sound Card- Internet Connection (for the license to play it to download)- 1600 x 1200 or 1920x1080 or HIGHER display!I don't know about you, but those are some hefty specifications to watch a movie... and even if you have that, in my opinion, you're still better off with a skipping the PC and playing the regular version in a regular DVD player.I tried to play it on a relatively new Sony Vaio laptop (the only PC I have that has XP (however it was not XP Professional as listed in the recommended requirements).  Anyhow, my Sony is a 1.6 GHz unit, and it couldn't keep up at all.  What I got was a crude slideshow with a still image every 5 or so seconds.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2DD3U3KKV91HD	Joe	Watching T2 in 2012, you have to remember that this movie was one of the first big blockbuster sci-fi action flicks.  Special effects have come a long way, but in its day, T2 had CGI years ahead of its time.  So far ahead that this movie leans into that fact and skimps a bit on story.  The evolution of Sarah Connor from bungling waitress to pit bull is the interesting core of the story, and the warning to not become what you hate is powerfully delivered.Unfortunately, Arnie's career goals (young John tells the Terminator not to kill anyone) water down the believability of his Terminator character, and the horrid performance by the child star who plays John Connor are painful to behold.  Still, there's enough there to make it interesting with the regular length version, with lots of explosions, gunfire and liquid metal morphing. The Director's Cut goes a bit too long, but all completists and sci-fi fans should at least watch this once.	3.0	Time Takes Its Toll	2012-10-23	2	1	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	James Cameron's follow-up to its lower-budgeted predecessor, &quot;Terminator 2:  Judgment Day&quot; features a pumped-up Linda Hamilton teamed up with a reprogrammed Arnold Schwarzenegger to protect Edward Furlong as an LA bad boy who will one day save the future.  Whoa... time travel movies make me dizzy.Yep, this time, Arnold's the good guy.  He's still a steel-skeletoned leather-jacketed mesomorph from the future, only now, he has a soft and cuddly side.  It's uber-mom Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, who muscles her way through the action.  She starts the film in the nut-hatch, where she's like a chick Hannibal Lecter with a benign agenda, but the same results.  And no wonder she's so violent:  this time, she's got to battle the freaky liquid metal T-1000 (Robert Patrick as the worst cop ever!).  T-1000 wants to cut Furlong's puberty short either to spare us endless reports of his future misdeeds on &quot;Entertainment Tonight,&quot; or to prevent him from destroying the crazed supercomputer that tried to wipe out the world.  Either way, it's up to the good guys to keep the kid alive.Cameron mixes characterizations as sharp as the glass that explodes all over this movie with some knock-out violence and stunt sequences, plus some shocking-for-its-time CGI work into a sci-fi action fest with a steel fist and a tender heart.  Say what you want about Arnold- he's got chemistry with Furlong.  Yeah, the big guy works well with kids.  And Hamilton is full of a mother's love; she just expresses it by stabbing people and shooting them.  As for &quot;T2&quot; itself, it's super-slick, gun metal blue, goes off like a rocket and never lets up.  Pure entertainment at its finest.If you enjoyed the movie, you'll definitely want the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD, because it's got more features than the T-1000 has transformations.  Commentary, deleted footage, the trailers, the screenplay.  Storyboards.  A collector's booklet.  And the movie itself in a sweet widescreen transfer.  I can't go on... I'm exhausted.Which is how you'll feel after watching &quot;T2.&quot;  But in a good way, like a day at an amusement park.  This is one flick that proves big, loud action movies don't have to skimp on the smarts or the love.	4.0	So... He Is Back, After All!	2002-04-01	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	Set 10 years after the events of the first movie, two terminators are sent back through time in the year 1991. One is a good guy ( Arnold Schwartzenger) whom has to protect young John Conner ( Edward Furlough)from the deadly shapeshifting T-1000 ( Robert Patrick) because one day John will be a future leader. With the help of the heroine Sarah Conner ( Linda Hamilton) from the original movie, she with John & The Terminator have to prevent an upcoming war that will lead to the future and must outdo the T-1000.A sequel that works higher than the original movie which was a classic by the way. James Cameron with Arnold have returned in this highly expensive sequel that was probably the costliest movie in Carolco's history, however when it opened on July 2 1991 it has became one of the highest grossing movies of time with critical acclaim and academy awards for best make-up, best special effects, and best editing. What truly made it a new action/sci-fi classic is that the film contained unbelivable special effects by ILM for it's time like no one has ever seen before, great acting, flawless direction & writing by James Cameron, non-stop action and heart to go with the movie.The Extreme Edition DVD has some very good extras like Commentary by James Cameron and co-writer William Wisher, Extreme Interactive mode with graphic commentary and behind the scenes footage, superior sound & picture quality by THX. Two featurettes and a few PC-DVD.Rom features as well, this is truly a must have DVD for those who loves movies either action, Science Fiction, the original Terminator or just plain movies.	5.0	A most perfect action/Sci-fi flick and a cool DVD!	2005-02-01	0	0	0

When I heard about the T2 Ultimate Edition, I was pumped. Well, let me assure you that this DVD collection is worth every penny. The DTS soundtrack is powerful and the scene where the two Terminators meet in the arcade is a perfect showcase for your system. Glass shattering, bullets whizzing, motorcycles humming, trucks exploding -- it doesn't get much better than this. The extra features and Easter Eggs (the alternate ending is nice to watch!!) are worth the price alone. T2 is one of the true science fiction masterpieces, and it continues to reign supreme on the DVD as well.	5.0	Perhaps the Best DVD Title Out There	2001-07-16	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	Who said sequels aren't any good? &quot;Terminator 2&quot; is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, gee Molly, is it wonderful.Yeah, he's &quot;back.&quot; Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and &quot;Xtreme&quot; edition DVDs, Sarah says, &quot;You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!&quot; It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), &quot;T2&quot; clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is &quot;T2: Judgment Day&quot; better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.If you're looking for an action film, &quot;T2&quot; is your safest bet. It's ten times better than the other junk out there, and it has a definite, not-stop, pulse-pounding sense of action, that leaves you trying to catch your breath. It has a strong narrative and a clear statement on our society. On the other hand, &quot;The Terminator&quot; is probably the film for horror fans, time travel film fans, or those who like to be thrilled while they're watching their films regarding the future.In some respects, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.	5.0	He Said He'd Be Back...and He Certainly is!	2003-11-10	3	3	0

For some reason the Special Edition is the main attraction with 16 minutes of added scenes I guess.  It really makes me mad though since there is only one way to see the theatrical version, and that is through a pesky computer that will become outdated along with the programs, and eventually there will be no way to watch the theatrical version of the film.  The whole point of this DVD is apparently to have the best visual representation of the film, yet it is only for the Special Edition.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1J1A2INO6BDL	John Tan	I read through the reviews here and came across with one that explained on how to key in a code to see the extended special edition, which is 2 minutes and 43 seconds longer. It has an additional scene of T1000 searching around John Conner's room and an alternative ending where you can see old Sarah Connor. Anyway, that particular review stated that to unlock the extended version, you need to key in 82297 at the special edition menu. I was not the same code as mine. Mine is 82997. So, I figure that those of you who got the DVD could also have different codes. Anyway, it's quite easy to figure it out. When you select the special edition, you will see another submenu. On the right side of the sub-menu, you can see some kind of a VCR button symbols. They are actually roman numeric codes. A square and a rectangle is actually a &quot;I&quot;, a triangle pointing down is actually a &quot;V&quot; and 2 small triangle pointing up and down and towards each other is actually an &quot;X&quot;, So, mine was &quot;VIII II IX IX VII&quot;. If you key in correctly, the codes will change to &quot;The Future Is Not Set&quot;. You will then see the the T-800's both eyes glow and the extended special edition movie would start immediately.	5.0	How to see the Extended Special Edition	2000-10-04	7	6	1

There's something about it that holds my attention viewing after viewing.DVD arrived just in time! My video tape of T2 had worn so thin, you could probably read through it, so when my wife and I purchased our DVD player, this film was a must-buy.The DVD version of course, offers a whole lot more than the video ever did. In addition to the &quot;bonus&quot; stuff, such as interviews and trailers, there are the scenes which were cut from the theatrical release.If T2 is among your favorites, by all means...

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A33ENZGK8BLP3P	Jon G.	As someone who had previously owned the first Blu-ray edition of this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this version, but the price was too good to pass up.  However, I can truthfully say that this is the absolute best rendition that I have ever seen, and I have personally watched this film in every incarnation (VHS, DVD, etc.).  The picture quality is amazing... it almost seems cliche to say- but this is the most pristine transfer of this movie, period.  If you are a fan, do yourself a favor and get this- it's definitely worth adding to the collection.	5.0	Best version to date.	2012-05-15	4	4	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A24Q40NN7O07GK	Jon Morris	"I've been a huge fan of Terminator 2: Judgement Day since its initial release on VHS back in 1991. It was the most revolutionary movie I had ever seen at the time, and it (coupled with ""Jurassic Park"" which would be released 2 years later) would go on to change film industry as we knew it. The movie itself is a classic of the Sci-Fi/Action genre, and I would argue is BETTER than it's predecessor, the original ""The Terminator"" (1984). It stands teh test of time and is just as relevant, mesmerizing, and engaging today as it was over 20 years ago.I have owned several releases of this film spanning many different formats of media, but I have to say that this newest release, the Skynet Edition, is by far and away one of the nicest looking Blu Ray transfers I have ever seen. The picture is sharp and the colors are rich. It looks like a movie that was released a year ago. Simnply put, the picture is immaculate, and really holds it own on 1080P HD."	5.0	Amazing Picture!!!	2013-08-12	1	1	0

If you haven't seen it, then you should, it's one of the best movies James Cameron directed, If you're upgrading from DVD to Blu ray, the picture quality is amazing, and the option of selecting 3 different movie versions is beyond. I haven't had a look at the extras, but you need a code for the 3rd version EIGHT TWO NINE NINE SEVEN (8 2 9 9 7)  is the code. Over all, for the price, you can't beat this.

The film is a great warning for futurist who believe that automation is the way of the future... for everything has a limit and reaction, for creating artificial intelligence technology that is militarized, there will be a point that it sees humans as a hindrance rather than the top species	4.0	simply amazing	2014-02-10	1	1	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1QKCTSWTOOFRK	Josh Leman	Of course you've all seen the movie (and if you haven't, what the hell are you thinking? ), so let's get straight to the DVD itself.  The second you pop it in, you know you're looking at the most insane, overblown DVD ever released just from the crazy menu intro.  A lot of the best movies ever made were cheaper than the menus on this disc.  And you get just about everything you could possibly want in a T2 DVD and then a whole lot more.  Or, rather, you learn everything you'd ever want to know about T2, but the disc doesn't have one of the most obvious features fans would have wanted-- a Cameron/Schwarzenneger commentary track.  Yeah, there's that crazy 26-people track with subtitles so you can tell who's talking, and both Cameron and Schwarzenneger appear on it, but it's obviously just pieced together from various interviews and documentaries (many of which appear elsewhere on the disc).  As nice as it is, the best commentaries are the ones that make you feel like you're watching the movie with the people who made it, like the one on Anchor Bay's Evil Dead II special edition.  And when you think T2, you think James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenneger, so their voices should have taken precedence.  Everything else is as good as you'd expect, with three versions of the film all presented in fantastic picture and sound (DD or DTS).  The Special Edition version adds some interesting moments (a scene focusing on Miles Dyson really adds to the significance of his character) but also some lame ones (the Kyle Reese dream sequence is melodramatic and drags on way too long).  The hidden third cut, however, just adds two needless scenes, including a totally ludicrous alternate ending.  But anyway, it's one of the best DVD purchases around, and everybody who owns a player should probably buy it just as a reference of how thorough the format can be.  It's a five-star disc, no doubt about it, but they really should have gotten more of Arnold and Jim.	5.0	Unquestionably the most loaded single DVD ever released	2000-09-30	1	0	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1CJUE2W7M8ZA7	"Joshua Drew ""noxzid"""	Although I grew up with the theatrical cut, this directors cut is phenomenal in its ability to shed more light on humanity and our own understanding of what that means. Granted, this is done in the midst of a sci-fi, action shoot'em up where there's rarely a moment when somebody's ass is being blown away. Another great thing about this movie (and others like in around the same era) is that nearly all the explosions and stunts are real! Unlike the other installments to the series, this one is the most humanistic of them all.As mentioned, this is the last one before some other director craps all over the franchise. This movie had just enough humor to not take away from its weighty subject, whereas &#34;Rise of the Machines&#34; is a nonsensical joke. Take it from me, the ending of this film is the real ending of the series - a future that's clear.	5.0	The last one in the series, really.	2014-03-06	0	0	0

In the Cyberdyne Systems scene is some of the best Special effects in cinematic history better CGI than today I think the chase scenes are good the finish at the steel mill is just awesome there's also an alternate eding that's on an older DVD The Ultimate edition. As far as I'm concerned not by very many points but Terminator 2 is better than Terminator 1 not by a whole lot.

This time it loaded but trying to get through the menu just to get to the movie was a long process, almost 5 minutes which is too long to have to navigate through a menu.  Badly designed if you ask me. Once i got to the movie i was not happy with the sound.  It was just plying in stereo and i have a pretty good surround sound system.  I went and checked the set up menu for audio and everything was correct for surround and i double checked my  receiver settings and they were correct  but still only sound through the front left and right channel.  I returned it the next day.  Maybe that is why it was only $5.  You really get what you pay for.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A18BV4O63DOWNH	"""juno2"""	The best thing that can be said for  *Terminator 2*  (I'll omit the subtitle, if you don't mind)  is that, ten years on, it doesn't look at all dated, which I guess is pretty impressive for a sci-fi/action flick.  The worst that can be said for it is much the same thing:  this film, in my mind, more than any other, really got the  &quot;action-films-that-look-like-animation&quot;  movement rolling.  Just in case we didn't get it in  *The Abyss*, director James Cameron pours on even more liquid mercury in this film, to the point where we're drowning in it.  This movie cost a staggering amount of dollars, and it shows:  it's all special effects, and very little else.  But there's something worse:  the real subtext behind all this sturm and drang seems to be the need to not only SPEND money, but EARN a hell of a lot of it.  Think of some other blockbusters that preceeded this one:  *Star Wars*, *Raiders of the Lost Ark*, to name just two.  Of course Lucas and Spielberg wanted to make money, but they also seemed to have enjoyed making their movies.  There's nothing in Cameron's film that suggests anyone involved had the slightest bit of fun.  (In fact, Linda Hamilton is encouraged to act like a linebacker with  'roid rage . . . but in a thoroughly humorless way.)  *Terminator 2*  is an incessant barrage of setpieces and effects that frantically try to astound the audience -- with only fitful success, in my opinion.  Bigger the splash, the bigger the cash.  This movie's most recent offspring includes films like  *Mission Impossible: II*, *The Phantom Menace*, *The Matrix*, even *Gladiator* . . . all huge moneymakers, all resembling computer animated cartoons rather than movies, all BAD.  Noisy messes, every one.  *Terminator 2*  may very well be to blame for the sad state of action pictures today.By the way -- before I sign off, I'd like to say that I much preferred the original  *Terminator*, not only because it was a better-written movie, but also because the Terminator himself was a killer villain.  I knew I was in trouble with  *T2*  when Ahnold appears, for no discernable reason, naked in the opening scene with that godawful  *Bad to the Bone*  thumping in the background.  Scenes like that have all the resonance of a  *Married With Children*  episode. . . .	2.0	The start of many bad trends in movies	2000-12-19	20	5	15
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"After the success of ""The Terminator"" in 1984, it strikes me as somewhat odd that there wasn't a sequel rushed directly into production as soon as the original was deemed a hit. Nowadays, it seems like once a movie surpasses what it cost to make the movie then a sequel is virtually inevitable. This also seemed to be the mindset around certain movies back in the 1980's, especially the slasher type of films; but for whatever reason seven long years passed between the release of ""The Terminator"" before director and writer James Cameron re-teamed with his stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton for ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"".""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" picks up approximately ten or so years after the events of the first film. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been locked away in a mental institution after her crazed warnings of an impending holocaust at the hands of machines, and her 10-year old son John (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents. After the initial failure of the first Terminator to complete its mission of eliminating Sarah, the evil Skynet has sent back an even more advanced model, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), to hunt down and kill her son John before he can grow up to become the leader of the human resistance. However, John's future self is not without his own resources as he has sent back a weapon of his own to protect his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) identical to the one that attempted to kill his mother ten years before.A general rule about movies is that nine times out of ten the sequel may be on par with the original film, but rarely will it ever surpass what had come before; however, I feel very confident in saying that ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is easily one prime example of an exception to that rule. ""The Terminator"" was an excellent sci-fi movie that mixed futuristic elements with those of the modern day, but some may have wondered what more story could there possibly be since Sarah defeated the first Terminator, which should have saved her son and the future as well. Based on what I saw in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", or ""T2"" for short, what happened in the original was merely the beginning of a much bigger problem for mankind.Writer/director James Cameron has once more crafted an extremely taut, perfectly paced, sci-fi thriller that is leaps and bounds above what was done in the first movie. The story for ""T2"" is much bigger, the drama is more intense, the action is pulse-pounding, and the visual effects are still incredible even to this day. James Cameron must have known that he was merely laying the initial groundwork in ""The Terminator"" for a vast mythology surrounding mankind's future against the evil machines, because that last scene in the original movie hinted that something bigger may be on the horizon. Even though so many of us had seen the first movie and caught on to the hint that there may be more to tell, who knew it would be this massive blockbuster of a film that remains just as popular all these years later. Where the first film briefly touched upon Skynet and gave us brief glimpses at the war that awaits us in the future, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" takes all of that and builds upon it greatly. ""T2"" explores how events in the original movie actually set into motion the events of the future, shows us a very emotionally raw heroine in Sarah Connor, a different side to the Terminator from the first film, and to top it off gave us even more glimpses into the future battles that will ravage mankind. The only thing I can say about the story for ""T2"" is that it is simply awesome, and is quite possibly one of the greatest follow-up story's I have ever seen come out of Hollywood.The cast of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is comprised of a few familiar faces and some new ones as well. Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor with a much more emotionally charged performance than what was required of her in the original movie. Sarah is a completely different person than she was when we last saw her, now she is this highly trained warrior that is emotionally scarred and torn by what she feels to be her duty to train her son to become the leader of man, and yet to still protect him and care for him as her child. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, just as he promised in the first movie, as a reprogrammed Terminator, and proves yet again that this was the one role that he was born to play. Even though the character is just a machine, there are very neat moments within the movie where without saying much of anything, Arnold allows the Terminator to convey that there is some kind of connection that exists, a bond if you will, between the Terminator and John. James Cameron's script really aided Arnold in what he was able to do with the Terminator this time around by exploring the fact that the machines can learn from and mimic humans, which allowed Arnold to show some, albeit limited, emotions while still remaining in character.Joining the returning cast members we have newcomer Edward Furlong (""American History X"") as John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance. Considering the fact that ""T2"" was his first acting gig, Edward did an amazing job of bringing John to life in a very realistic way as a troubled kid whose destiny is too big for him to possibly fathom. The way Edward handled John's interactions with the Terminator was very interesting, because early on John sees the machine as a means to an end, nothing more than an overgrown action figure of sorts; however, over the course of the movie he begins to form a bond with the Terminator that becomes almost like a father-son relationship, that was at times quite poignant. The other new addition to the series was actor Robert Patrick (""We Are Marshall"") as the new, deadlier, and much more sophisticated T-1000 Terminator model. Robert was given a very physically challenging role that required a lot of physical activity, but from an acting standpoint the role didn't really challenge him all that much. That being said, as unchallenging as it was onscreen in the acting realm, I'm sure the preparation for all of the visual effects associated with his character were most likely quite time consuming and at times daunting.In the first movie the visual effects were very good, especially given the time at which the film was made, although over time I admit that some of the effects have lost their luster. While that statement is true for 1984's ""The Terminator"", it couldn't be farther from the truth when referring to the stellar special effects work done for 1991's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". While technology has definitely improved significantly since 1991, the effects within this movie still hold up quite well, and while maybe not as perfect as today's effects, they are still very impressive in their own right. For example the morphing technology, used to create the numerous effects sequences for the liquid Terminator, was so mind-blowing back in 1991, and yet even today it still looks astonishing.As I stated earlier, while ""The Terminator"" was a great movie, what James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger were able to achieve with the sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is simply amazing. Everything about this movie is just bigger and better than what was done in the original film, and this is an example of the kind of sequel that all studios should strive for when making a franchise.""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is rated R for violence and language."	5.0	He's Back, and This Time He's On Our Side...	2008-10-04	2	1	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1QJEI2S15711P	justice4all72	Thanks to the new master, the detail is much greater on this DVD than previous releases. You're able to see small, fine, details in the backgrounds that you simply could not make out on the Ultimate Edition. That coupled with the adjusted color (supervised and approved by Lightstorm) and other improvements over previous releases; makes this the best looking Terminator 2 on DVD.The harsh contrast found on the previous DVD is lowered to a much more natural level, which gives the overall picture a more film-like appearance. Even better, the excessive edge enhancement is just about completely gone. If those were the only improvements, it'd be enough to recommend the disc over the old transfer, but they aren't.2000's Ultimate Edition featured a very good 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer that only had a couple minor problems. Most distracting was an excessive amount of edge enhancement, more grain than was normal for a Super 35 movie, and contrast that was just a bit hot.For this new Extreme Edition, THX retransferred using the highest technology possible right now. They created a new electronic film master of the movie at the stunning resolution of 1920x1080 24 FPS. Basically, this new master would allow them to create new transfers of T2 for HDTV, and digital theatrical showings. This DVD is created from that gorgeous master, and is easily the best Terminator 2 has ever looked on the DVD format.10 out of 10. BUY THIS DVD!	5.0	T2: Extreme DVD	2009-05-21	19	18	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AU8C496DUFA0V	Kari	If you're like me and have been a James Cameron or &quot;Terminator&quot; fan for, like, ever, then you gotta see this!  I originally saw this film in the theater when I was 11 years old, after only recently watching the original &quot;Terminator.&quot;  I was blown out of my mind by the ground-breaking special effects, the epic scope of the story, and the all-too human side of the film.  That's what always gets me about James Cameron films, I think.  Not only does he have action sequences to appeal to the larger audience, but his view of the human condition is always touching and unique.You've gotta watch the Ultimate Edition.  It contains one of my all-time favorite scenes--where Kyle comes to Sarah in a dream sequence, telling her she has to protect their son.  And they really get Michael Biehn in for the cameo!  It's just way too cool.  I'd heard about that scene for years, but I only just got to watch it when I bought the Ultimate Edition DVD.Complete with an interactive menu, a behind-the-scenes look at the cut scenes, et cetra, et cetera, this is one of the most awesome special edition DVDs I own, and it's one of my all-time favorite films.  Buy it.  It's worth it.Oh yeah--go watch Robert Patrick (the guy who plays the evil T-1,000 in this movie) on &quot;The X-Files&quot; as Agent Doggett this season.  He's doing an excellent job. ;-)	5.0	This is just too freakin' cool!	2001-01-26	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A6TXFLRZVGAFT	Karin Partsch-Teiml	Michael Fletcher already did a great job in reviewing the DVD's special features, the Easter Egg and the other hidden and unhidden features of this cool dvd release. There is no need for me to do the same, so please check out Flechter's review for details on the dvd's extra features and give him a helpful vote for his great review!A lot of people claim, that The Terminator is better than Judgement Day, but I like both of them - there are things that make me favor the 1st and parts because of which I adore the 2nd.The story: Arnold Schwarzenegger finally managed to become to good guy, although he's still a killer-machine. The cyborg has been re-programmed and sent back through time by John Connor, leader of the great rebellion, to protect his teenaged ego from the '90s. The young John Connor's got his own Terminator now: Holy [*]! But of course there is a bad one too, trying to kill Connor, while still young and vulnerable and not the strong John C. of the future.The special effects of this movie are fantastic, there are a lot of explosions, shootings, and Terminator-actions you just can not can enough from!Deleted Scenes:1. John and his mother operate the Terminator in order to turn the switch on which is responsible for the cpu's learing process - so Arnie can get more human-like. They open the T's head and enter the port, where the all-controlling chip is. For John's mother this is a turning point, a possibility to destroy the Terminator (although he is the good one!). Find out for yourself what exactly happens in this scene!2. John teaches the T how to smile. A very funny scene, providing a hilarious expression on Arnold Schwarzenegger's face!3. Alternate Ending: Interesting, but I like the original one better. Check out for yourself!4. There are some more, but the ones listed above are the ones I can remember. Sorry for my bad memory, but these are the best scenes!Other cool stuff:If you stay long enough on the menu from where you can access the trailers and other stuff but don't enter one of the sub-memories, the Terminator's face suddenly appears and tells you to get out. Some other optical &quot;snacks&quot; happen at complete random! Check it out!The trailer for the special edition is superb: Imagine lashing flames, the Terminator-theme (dum-dum-dum-dum-du-du-dum ... like that), then a rough, hard voice, while you see a bleeding T, exploding s*** and stuff like that: &quot;Remember the action, Remem the danger, Remem the emotion ... if you thought, you'd seen it all, LOOK AGAIN ...&quot; You then see quick cuts from the deleted footage -&gt; my favorite trailer!A featurette about the T-3D show you can experience in the Universal Studios. You do get some parts of the show, making you think about a short trip down to Florida ...AND A LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT MORE!The whole menu might be a little bit confusing at the beginning because there is so many of stuff to explore, but you'll get used to it. T2 is the mother of all special editions! Buy the movie along with its prequel!	5.0	really ultimate	2001-08-13	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1ZKWCG1S5HW6I	"Kathleen ""cps3814"""	This movie is definitely the best I've ever seen.  I remember watching it the first time on video and I loved it.  I bought the ultimate dvd and was amazed of how many extra scenes there were added in.  It was like a completely new movie.  A lot of scenes left out explained the story better.  For example:  In the original T2 you saw John choose between his mother and the liquid terminator disguised as his mother and he chooses right, but you never see in the regular movie that the liquid terminator is damaged and starts to change to the color of whatever he touches.  Don't worry that little scene won't ruin the movie for you it's just an example.  The movie without the ultimate DVD was already a masterpiece, and with the added scenes it was the best!  I never get tired of watching this movie over and over again.  It's just that good.  Definitely, Arnold Schwarsenagger's best movie.	5.0	The Greatest Movie Ever!	2002-08-11	2	0	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	This DVD contains almost the same content as the Pioneer laserdisc box set  released a few years ago.  The laserdisc was considered by many to be the  best LD ever made mainly because of the huge amount of supplementary  material.  This DVD version finally brings this excellent content to the  public in a much more affordable price (the laserdisc cost over  $100).The mammoth supplementary section contains thousands of  still-frames, (some text-only, some text-with-pictures, some linked with  video/audio segments), that chronologically details the making of the film  such as pre-production, casting, visual effects, marketing, promotion, etc.  Described as &quot;6 hours of supplements&quot; on the disc case, in truth  it will take you much longer to absorb all the content.The Guns &amp;  Roses promo music video that was included in the laserdisc's supplements is  not included on this DVD.  The DVD merely contains still shots of the  video.  (This amusing video shows Arnold carrying a gun that is hidden in a  box of roses while attending a concert by, well, Guns &amp; Roses.)The  DVD does include the wonderfully edited promo documentary &quot;The Making  of T2&quot;.  This little gem WAS NOT on the laserdisc.  (Hurray!)There  is a dazzling DVD-ROM feature that lets you view the movie, the script, and  storyboard diagrams all on the same screen. (The script can also be found  in the supplementary section, but it is very hard to navigate through it  due to inadequate chapter stops).There are some &quot;easter eggs&quot;  (hidden features) on this DVD as well, one of them is an &quot;extended  special edition&quot; of the movie that includes 2 scenes omitted in the  special edition -- a scene where the T1000 searches the boy's bedroom, and  an alternate ending set 30 years into the future, featuring an aged Sarah  Conner.  The laserdisc also had these deleted scenes, but this DVD lets you  view the deleted scenes as part of the movie.  Another easter egg is a  collection of Japanese trailers (look for a tiny Japanese flag on one of  the menu screens).The only troubling thing about this DVD is that the  packaging includes a note saying, &quot;Due to the advance features, some  DVD players may have navigational problems.  But it should not affect your  enjoyment in using this disc.&quot;  It's troubling because this sounds  like it's something that SHOULD affect my enjoyment.  It hasn't cause  problems to my DVD player yet, but others have reported problems like  lockups and wacky navigation.	5.0	The Greatest DVD ever made?	2000-09-19	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ALTYANUSN8TWU	Kristopher Vincent	While the movie doesn't quite have some of the grittiness of the original, this is among not only my top 3 Schwarzenegger films, but one of my favorite of all time.  Several years ago, I had heard rumors of a newer, longer version of T2, but didn't put much stock in it, as a lot of such rumors didn't pan out.  Supposedly, one of the scenes mention was to be a shot of John's foster mother lying dead in a bathtub--obviously the handiwork of the T-1000--but it never came to pass.  I was pleased to see some of the added effects, such as the T-1000s inability to maintain his shape near the end, and it put to rest for me how it was you could tell which was Linda Hamilton and which was her twin sister, before the T-1000 was shot.  Rarely have I seen director's cuts that surpass the original and make it seem a whole new experience.  Only Aliens Special Edition and Star Wars did that for me.  And until this movie, I'd never seen a music video that could employ graphics from the movie as well--example being Guns 'N Roses' Axl Rose being evaluated as a waste of ammunition by the Terminator.  The movie is well-rounded, and I especially liked Sarah's comment about if a machine could learn the value of life, that maybe we could too.	5.0	Excellent buy	2001-03-06	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"After the moderate success of The Terminator, James Cameron decided to outdo himself with the old ""bigger is better"" modus operandi, and together with the greatest special effects maestros in Hollywood, created one of the most amazing sci fi action thrillers ever! This time around, Schwarzenegger was to be the good guy and fans were less than happy with the idea. The Austrian oak who immortilised himself as the unstoppable killing machine who spoke the famous line: ""I'll be back!"" But movie geeks had little reason to worry, for Cameron had something better up his sleeve, with the T1000, an even more invincible killing machine who could take on Arnie's T100. The tantilising premise and top-notch talent behind the collosal project ensured boffo box office. And once again, Arnie (with shades for added coolness) proved that when it comes to blowing up things with really big guns, there is no substitute.The action set-pieces are some of the most incredible ever put together, and with Stan Winston's lethal creation and ILM's morphing liguid metal guy (a menacing Patrick Stewart) battling it out for the future of mankind, the stakes are high, and the action ante even higher. A seriously buffed-up Linda Hamilton is a much stronger character than in the first film, and her hard-edged persona is well-played and fits the film's ""come and get it!"" tone. While the original's tense structure and nerve-shredding pace makes it superior in terms of cracking action, but in terms of spectacle and jaw-dropping SFX, T2 wins hands down. Wether this of the seminal original is the best is debatable, but what is for sure is that it is truly one awesome thrill ride packed with out-of-this world effects that still amaze 11 years later. Will the upcoming Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be better? Only time will tell, but rest assured, T2 takes it deserved place in the collection of all-time greats and is a must-have on DVD."	5.0	ULTIMATE ACTION! ULTIMATE DVD!!	2003-06-26	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AC06F0LPHI1TW	K Scheffler	"I recently watched this movie after not having seen it for a long, long time, and I have to admit that it is a very good movie, much better than most of the action genre.  Excellent special effects coupled with some amazing action sequences make for an exciting and gripping watch.  I particularly thought that the chase scene near the beginning was quite well done.  And I found Robert Patrick to be the perfect part as the T-1000 robot; his steely determined expression really was convincing.  In terms of this movie being a ""classic"" as some reviewers would have it--I wouldn't go so far.  The movie does have some inconsistancies and weak parts.  But overall, it is a very good and entertaining action movie.  It's kind of odd watching this movie with its post-apocalyptic element; the movie came out just at the end of the Cold War era when the possibility of an apocalyptic end to civilization was very real; that likelihood has, thankfully, become much less likely, and I think that makes the movie less unsettling and dark as when I first saw it."	4.0	Terminator 2: Judgement Day	2005-03-13	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A16X61RLY1YJL7	"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	"It is absolutely amazing to think that ""The Terminator"" was made on a shoestring budget of ""only"" $6 million, where the filmmakers were literally sleeping on couches and living off of coupons from McDonald's to making the transition to ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day!  Taking that into consideration and then looking at the over $150 million dollar budget for T2, which was the first of its kind, one can only sit back in awe at the silver screen masterpiece that was created by that budget.With ""The Terminator"" being James Cameron's first feature film and the film that went far beyond ""Conan the Barbarian"" in launching Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the demand for this sequel was constant and finally overwhelming, leading them to begin it's filming in 1990.  The final outcome of that filming and budget being one of the highest grossing films to ever have been made, to date of which, the film has earned nearly a billion dollars, which is simply astonishing!From a personal standpoint, when this film made it to the silver screen, I believe I went and saw it at least two times and I even read the book that was released concurrently with the film.  The VHS tape release of it was rather worn out as well due to this being such a compelling and captivating story!The premise:Enhancing upon the basic story and theme of the first film which was the first of many paradox's within this plot, director James Cameron brings us forward approximately ten years.  We're brought to the Terminator's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) introduction as he does essentially the same thing he did in the first film, seek clothing and weaponry.  From the very beginning of this film you see that it still has the same dark undertones of humanities future struggle against the machines but at the same time its going to have a different style as there is some humorous scenes right up front.From there we're taken to the T-1000's (Robert Patrick) introduction in the film.  At this point in time, the viewer who hasn't seen this masterpiece before doesn't quite know which of the Terminators is going to be the bad guy.  From there we're taken to the introductions of John Connor, played rather well by Edward Furlong and then his mother Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton reprising her role from the first film.It doesn't take one long to figure out that this is a big film and that the action is going to blow you away whether you're seeing it for the first time or the tenth time.  Few films of this genre even come close to comparing to the scale and scope that is T2 Judgment Day!  Everything about this film from the script to the actors and their acting to the makeup and the soundtrack all screams box office smash hit!As you can surmise, I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of the genre and fans of superb scriptwriting played out to perfection on the silver screen.  {ssintrepid}T2 Judgment Day Ultimate Edition Special FeaturesDocumentaries:- ""The Making of T2"" Featurette- ""T2:  More Than Meets the Eye"" Featurette- ""The Making of T2: 3-D"" Breaking the Screen Barrier""Special Features:- Supplemental Materials - Several features which cover every aspect of the film.- Cast and Crew Information- Trailers and Teasers- Entire Screenplay- Over 700 StoryboardsDVD-ROM:- An excellent DVD-ROM feature that allows you to view the film and the script at the same time.Other Features:- An outstanding metal enclosure for the DVD case.- A thirty page booklet with even more information about this incredible film."	5.0	T2 - Judgment Day - A superb Sci-Fi action/thriller!	2003-07-06	1	0	1

This DVD exemplifies what DVD should be! Check  out the interactive menus and you'll be amazed. The THX trailer is  astonishing. The amount of footage they packed on the 2 DVDs (technically  called side 1 and 2)will shock you. And then the movie. I would watch the  uncut version last to really appreciate the value of the deleted scenes.  Keep the booklet handy to point out the added scenes. This is not some  crappy 2 minutes of footage, it's over 20 (I think). For the most part  these are significant scenes. ESPECIALLY the part where Sarah wants to  crush the Terminator's CPU. Previously, this extra stuff was only available  on the 2 tape VHS set, which was hard to wade through and change tapes  over.  Maybe it was on a LaserDisc, but again I don't know that.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	Sequels are a large and largely ironic part of director James Cameron's film career.  There are those of us who remember one of his earliest films, &quot;Piranha Part Two: The Spawning,&quot; which was a sequel of sorts (same type of fish, but not the same fish), and he made two of the most successful sequels of all time in &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day.&quot;  I was going to say that the irony extends to the fact Carmeron directed the most successful film of all time in &quot;Titanic,&quot; for which a sequel cannot be made, except &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot; is out there in Omni-Max Theaters across the land and tends to subtract from the point.Unlike Francis Ford Coppola who still had half of the origianl novel to work with, or George Lucas who was working on a trilogy (or Peter Jackson who is doing both), Cameron was faced with trying to build upon a pair of fairly success first features.  After transforming the &quot;haunted house&quot; movie &quot;Alien&quot; into a military movie with &quot;Aliens,&quot; Cameron starts with an equally significant change in the premise for &quot;Terminator 2,&quot; turning the T-101 from the villain into the hero.  When you are dealing with a machine it is just a question of reprogramming it accordingly.  Consequently, Cameron is basically able to repeat the entire opening of the original movie (two naked guys come from the future, one is good and one is bad) and then pivot the entire film on the basis of that one little change.Now, you do not want to think about time paradoxes too closely because they tend to fly apart once logic or the laws of physics are invoked, but since the original T-800 failed to kill Sarah Connor the machines of the future and their overlord Skynet, send back a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to kill John Connor (Edward Furlong).  Sending back a dozen Terminators of pretty much any model number would probably work better, but the idea here is qualitative improvements rather than quantitative (i.e., this is not &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; with its infinite versions of Mr. Smith).  John is saved by another T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and proceeds to rescue his mother (a buffed up Linda Hamilton) from the crazy house, with the T-1000 in close pursuit.The final significant difference between this film and the original is that Cameron and his co-writer William Wisher have Sarah Connor taking the offensive.  While the T-1000 is hunting mother and son, she is going to do her own manipulation of the time line by taking out Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton), the scientist whose creative fingerprints end up being all over Skynet's creation.  Dyson is helped by having a couple of significant bits and pieces from the T-800 of the original film (which is where we get right into a &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; time loop, so let's just not go there).  For me, Dyson is the most interesting character in the story, and a clear break from science fiction film stereotypes in a whole lot of ways.It is easy to get taken away with the special effects in &quot;Terminator 2&quot; because of the quantum leap that films took from the water tentacle in Cameron's &quot;The Abyss&quot; to the liquid metal of the T-1000, but the human dimension of the dysfunctional Connor family dealing with their particular fate in terms of future events.  The Terminator is now the father figure for John Connor, but the boy has a few lessons of his own to impart to his personal Terminator.  Of course, the &quot;Judgment Day&quot; sub-title is something of a misnomer give not only what happens in this film but in the 2003 finale to the trilogy, &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,&quot; but this 1991 film (and all its myriad variations available on DVD) is a textbook example of how you can intelligently go about putting together a sequel in this genre that will make a lot of money and not insult fans of the original.	5.0	A textbook example of how to do a successful action sequel	2003-11-15	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A189P9BUO7GHXT	Lee Jordan	Arnold is back! And this time he's a good guy! I think T-800 makes a better hero than a villain. This time the bad guy is a very hard-to-kill cyborg, T-1000. More advanced and much more skilled at defeating Arnold's techniques. This time the evil cyborg is sent back to kill John Connor when he's a kid. Before the evil version of T-800 was sent back to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, so John would not be born and living to command the army of the future to gain confidence in stopping the machines trying to wipe out humanity. T-1000 is more powerful than T-800 and a much better fighter. But the story goes as follows, good guys always win. Such a shame Arnold had to destruct himself in the end. But this is an exciting action movie. Not quite as good as the first. But great and much better special effects. The quality was much better due to the fact it was made at a time technology was more advanced. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor. But this time she's a lean, mean fighter who's not going to take anyone's nonsense. Unlike before where she was an ordinary girl who was an easy target and had to be guarded by the hero from the future. But in this stoy, she can take care of herself. It's her son who needs the bodyguard to protect him from evil. A human being could not have done it against this villain. It took a machine to stop another. I hope they make a Terminator 3 sometime to continue the story.	4.0	Terminator 2 (Hasta La Vista, Baby!) [I'll Be Back!]	2001-11-11	1	1	0

However, the film in `normal' THX, Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 (you get the point) is absolutely mesmerizing itself- just turn up the volume!The extra feature, `frame-by-frame' behind the scenes explanation subtitles is so thorough that you literarily have to pause the film every 2 seconds, due to the amount of text.  Perhaps it is because I'm not fast reader, but it does become rather tedious to have to pause and rewind so often.I reckon if the two features (behind-the-scenes subtitles and feature video clips) had been viewable as separate options one would only need concentrate on one feature and enjoy the other on another occasion. Yes, you would have to see the film again - but the film is so good it is worth seeing over and over again.Other than these minor issues, EXCELLENT!	5.0	Get it, or be Terminated for missing out!	2009-01-25	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2YWEG35UMPBJ3	"L. Harris ""skytag"""	"This is a classic, perhaps *the* classic in the action/sci-fi genre. It's great film, but one that's showing its age, and a release that has some issues.Since I assume you've seen the film at some point I won't spend much time on the story except to point out that I've always thought the liquid metal villain was just silly. Special effects should support the story, but in this case it was the other way around. The effects used on the T-1000 were cutting edge in their day and still hold up well almost two decades later, but the idea of a bucket full of liquid metal being able to function as an intelligent machine and make itself appear to be human tissue, hair, and clothing is just too far out there.Sadly, the opening scene is probably the worst in the film in that the big terminator machines look like cheesy models and sparks fly when humans get shot. Overall the opening scene reminds me of something from a cheap Japanese sci-fi movie, but thankfully it doesn't last long and we quickly move to what may be my favorite scene in the movie, where Arnold gets his clothes and motorcycle.Based on comments by others and reviewers, this Blu-ray release is the best video released of T2 so far, but it's still not what I would call ""reference"" quality. It's very good, but by and large it lacks the detail I see in the best Blu-rays out there and film grain has been removed. I doubt seriously the problem is in the source material as some even older films have been produced stellar Blu-ray transfers. Instead, given the low price on this title, a price that makes it a very good deal in my opinion, I think it's more likely they just didn't bother doing the best job they could.The audio, like the video, is good, but not among the best out there. It seems a bit flat compared to what I think it should be, lacking substance on the low end. I experimented by turning off every speaker in my system (each has its own amplifier) except for the subwoofer. Note that in my system every speaker is capable of reproducing a reasonable amount of bass, so the sub only handles the very lowest frequencies in my system. Listening to a few parts of the film with just the sub I found it's inaudible during most of the film. It kicks in occasionally, but it never rattles anything in the room, and it's silent at times when it shouldn't be. For example, when the semi starts up at the beginning or when Arnold starts the motorcycle when he leaves the bar, I hear nothing from the sub, and sure enough, when listening to the film normally those scenes lack the audio punch they should have.Compare this with the sound in Terminator Salvation and you'll hear a big difference in ""oomph"" in the bass department. Terminator Salvation uses a subwoofer a lot more than T2 by a wide margin, and the end result is a much better, fuller sounding soundtrack. They could do better than this if they were serious about. It's good, but not great.The user experience with this title is one of the worst I've seen. The first and most annoying thing is that if you don't have your player hooked up to the Internet, early in the loading process you get a message telling you it couldn't connect to the Internet and asking if you want to Retry or Cancel. Loading won't proceed until you choose Cancel. (I think this is the single dumbest thing I've seen on a Blu-ray disk.) It then takes longer to load than most titles.If you want to watch the longest version of the film you have to enter a code. It's one of those things some idiot thought would be cute, but it's just an extra step that wastes my time, and that's if I can remember the code, which I never can. (I know it's the date of Judgement Day, 82997, but I forget when that is if I haven't watched it for a while. Write it on a piece of paper and put it in the case if you don't have it well memorized.)Scene selection is poorly implemented as you have to scroll through the options one at a time (it doesn't display groups of them the way most movies do).I'm rather amazed at how many ways they dropped the ball on this one given that it's not even the first Blu-ray release. Balancing the criticisms is the fact that it's pretty darn cheap for a classic on Blu-ray, so I'm glad I bought it, but if they ever release a truly reference quality edition with better video, serious audio, and a better interface I'd replace this copy in a heartbeat."	3.0	Great, but with several issues	2010-12-22	10	7	3

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3NZVCL9N8CLHB	"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True"""	"First off let me point out that another reviewer is writing his review based on the ""Ultimate Edition"" of Terminator 2, not this edition. This is the ""EXTREME Edition"". The Ultimate Edition came out first, and as far as I can tell, is no longer available... though I wish it was. I will return to why in a moment.Secondly let me say that I love the movie Terminator 2. I believe it to be a truly great Sci-Fi Epic by the great James Cameron, who directed ""The Abyss"" (a Sci-Fi classic that was one of the first movies to have a major scene use extended pieces of Computer Generated Special Effects ), as well as the classic ""Aliens"", and some might be surprised to know he also directed ""Titanic"". Cameron is a truly great director in that he tried to create great films that are multidimensional, incorporating character, dialogue, plot and indeed the visuals to create memorable movies.T2: Judgment Day combined great effects (for the time), fantastic action (it set the standard for many years to come), human emotions and an analytical/philosophical commentary (on things ranging from human nature, to the relationship of technology and man, to fate). Thus T2 is not just a great Sci-fi movie, or a great action movie, but a great FILM. Arnold might not be the best actor, but at least he plays a machine, which ironically is the one thing he might be cut out to portray believably. Fortunately the rest of the cast, particularly the actress playing Sarah Connor, do a fairly good job in their expanded roles of putting a human side to this story.Yes, if I was just rating T2 as a movie I would give it 5 stars. However, I can't give this edition DVD of the movie 5 stars. Why? Where to start.Another reviewer gives detailed information promising you the world if you buy this DVD. This is simply not true. What the DVD does contain is a Special Edition Digitally Re-mastered version of the movie. The special edition also includes up to 16 minutes of additional footage from previously deleted scenes. That's great! What's not so great is that there is no option to play the original version of the movie (without these new scenes) and unfortunately, while they are cool to see, I don't think all of them are really worthy. Some of these feel out of place, or it is easy to see why they were removed from the movie before release. Others are nice to have, but really I'd like the option. Unlike the other reviewer's comments, you don't have such option, it's part of the movie, and that's that. If I'm wrong about this, please email me and show me and I'll gladly retract this statement.There's an audio commentary option, as well as a cool new ""interactive mode"" that gives constant information pertaining to the current scene. Sort of like that old show ""Pop Up Video"" for music videos. There's a huge amount of information here, and sometimes it will tell you to click enter to learn more and it will take you to some behind the scenes footage. Some of this is good. Some seems to not play right on my player (or it could just be how it was done). The entire movie is also in 16x9, which is nice if you have (or plan to some day have) a 16x9 widescreen TV or an HDTV. It's not so nice if you have a standard definition TV. Even typical widescreen is usually 2.35:1 aspect ratio. I usually prefer full screen myself (I like to use the whole screen for the picture) unless it's a movie I deem worthy of widescreen (such as movies with lots of big shots and beautiful cinematography, which T2 would likely apply). However I can tolerate, and even appreciate widescreen at 2.35, the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen are minimal. At 16X9 however, it's a bit obnoxious; the video is a thin ""strip"" across the screen and more of the screen is taken up by the bars than by the picture. boo. It would be nice if they could have given you the both wide and full screen versions, as other DVD releases such as the Rambo Series did where the full screen is on one side and widescreen on the other. Oh well.Onto disc 2. Here you get 2 documentaries. Just 2. The other reviewer is talking about the ultimate edition, which indeed is packed with extras. What special features will you find here? One 20 minute documentary, and another 8 minute short! That's IT!! Here's what you DON'T get: Trailers, TV Spots, Interviews with cast and crew, a comprehensive ""the making of"" documentary, footage of the premier, etc. In other words, none of the stuff that was on the Ultimate (no longer available) Edition DVD!! None of the stuff you would EXPECT to be on the ""extreme"" edition, especially since it is trying to be the DVD to end all DVDs.You do however get a lovely foil-coated cover for the case! (note the sarcasm) You also get some bells and whistles like special DVD Rom features. Put the disc in your computer and install the necessary software and you can create a picture of yourself as a terminator or a short video clip showing your picture morphing into a T1000 or into another photo. That's all cool and what not, but really it's just a gimmick. You'll toy with it once or let your kids play with it, and that's it.There's also a 16X9 High Definition version of the Theatrical Version (no extended scenes) on this disc, but only for Microsoft Media Player 9. In other words you can only play it on your computer (a very fast computer, don't bother trying if your machine is less than 3 GHz or has less than 512MB of RAM and a decent video and sound card). What good is this? I can watch the other version in my computer on my standard DVD player software, why bother having this nifty high def version unless you really have the hardware to take advantage of it? I don't even get a regular theatrical version to play on my TV and they are giving me one that plays in my computer??!Moreover it irks me to no end that this edition lacks TV spots, trailers, and a comprehensive documentary. Even the Princess Bride DVD has all this! The most basic releases now have this standard. Especially with a movie like this I want to know the origins, the director's thoughts, the preproduction debates and storyline development, the casting, the compromises, etc. All we get is 28 minutes of fluff, most of which is just a short piece about T2's impact on digital effects, but never goes into full detail about their techniques.Extreme? Extreme waste of money. If you have the Ultimate Edition, treasure it! And avoid this garbage unless you truly have a monster home entertainment center or a beast of a multimedia PC and want to put it to the test. If you just want to own the movie on DVD, try and find the Ultimate Edition if you can. You get more for less. Ultimate Edition has SO much this one lacks. Truly, this is a sad day for DVD consumers.Rather than buy this, you should email Artisan and complain."	2.0	Extreme RIP OFF!!!	2005-12-16	17	7	10

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AZRJH4JFB59VC	Lynwood E. Hines	Terminator 2 is arguably the best science fiction action thriller ever made.  The film features landmark special effects that have rarely if ever been equaled since its release in 1991.  In keeping with the film's over-the-top, WAY better than it has to be philosophy, the 2 DVD set breaks new ground, and stands alone as the most impressive DVD bundle ever released.The incredible computer generated effects of Terminator 2 often overshadow the other elements that help make this a great movie.  The more &quot;traditional&quot; effects (notably the chase, nuclear explosion, and furnace scenes) are also of high quality and complexity.  These sequences are painstakingly detailed, and contribute to the film's intensity and sense of realism.While the story itself is fairly simple, and the final outcome of the film is predictable, the plot is complex and engaging.  There are enough unexpected twists along the way, as well as significant character development, to make the predictability of the ending less of a detraction.  The Special Edition improves upon this further, by explaining how the T-101 is capable of &quot;character development&quot; at all, and by filling in gaps in the story that were removed in the theatrical release for &quot;pacing&quot; reasons.The quality of the DVD production is nothing short of amazing.  The film transfer is extremely clean, and there are numerous audio options.  Also, the shear quantity of extra material included in this package is staggering.  The extras are a mixture of video footage, commentaries, stills, and text.  The DVD medium itself has been maximally utilized.  Menu transitions feature complex animation sequences with seamlessly integrated sound effects.  Traversing the menus is a fully immersive experience.As if all of this weren't enough, the DVD case and collector's booklet come enveloped in an Aluminum case reminiscent of the silvery bad guy himself.  While not especially significant by itself, the unique protective metal sleeve is consistent with and symbolic of the extravagant materials contained within.The single black mark on this otherwise flawless DVD set is the &quot;Artisan&quot; commercial shown when disk 2 starts up.  This commercial can not be skipped, and fast forwarding is disabled while it is playing.  You are absolutely stuck with watching it, which is pretty tacky.Movie----------------Originality: BCreativity: A+Complexity/Depth: A-Relevance/Message: AArtistic Merit: A+Overall Entertainment Value: A+DVD------Transfer Quality: A+Extras: A+Use of Medium: A+	5.0	I know now why you cry, but it is something I can never do.	2001-02-05	8	6	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3QZXDBATXFNZX	Magnolia	James Cameron's Classic Masterpiece T2 is a brillent film achievment that could never be done over. This film has great depth more than what people think. This is not just an action picture but a great drama to. This movie came out on a incridable 2 disk DVD Which has three version's of the film. The best version of the film is a version with 20 minutes of extra footage put back into the movie. Instead of the movie being 139 minutes long its 159 minutes long. These extra minutes add more to the depth of the story and more to the charcter's devolpment. This is so much more than an action movie when you watch it think harder and enjoy the movie exsperince its a lot batter than just scraching the surface of the story. James Cameron's has made one of the best film's of all time. And the DVD makes the exsperince even better. The footage added to the movie gives so much more depth that you don't even need to see the first Terminator because it gives you so much it pretty much tells you what happend in the first one. I like the first one but there is no need for anybody too see the first one again because this super delux version of T2 exsplian's enough about the first Terminator so you don't half to watch the first one to refresh your memory. If you have never seen the first Terminator than you will half to watch the first one but for those of you who have seen it you don't need to go back and watch it unless you want to.	5.0	James Cameron's Classic Masterpiece	2002-06-14	1	0	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about mankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 played by Schwarzenegger who is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps breaks Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two.	4.0	The T2 you must see	2000-11-14	1	0	1

It contains a new ending and extra footage.The new footage cut from the theatrical version is described below:Chapter 10: Ain't no TroubleThis new scene shows two prison guards beating Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) up because she refuses to take her medicine. This scene was cut because it took a long time to shoot and she was getting very mad at one of the prison guards because he kept messing up and it took a total of 20 takes or something. She later got her revenge on him later in the movie.Chapter 13: There is not much time left in the WorldThis is another scene that was cut from the theatrical release because this was something that made the film too long. But what is interesting about this new scene is that it has a character from the first movie, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) of whom was never in the theatrical version of Terminator 2. The scene is a dream scene, and it shows the two characters hugging and kissing, then Kyle walks away. Sarah chases him down the hallway, yelling ""Kyle, don't go!"" Then she goes through some double doors and ends up at a playground. Then, at the end of the scene, it shows the nuclear blast and then, Sarah wakes up from her dream.Chapter 20This is a new scene showing the T-1000 stealing a policeman's car after the explosion of the tow truck chase.Chapter 24This is a new scene of the T-1000 killing John Connor's dog, and finding out that The Terminator and John are aware of his whereabouts.Chapter 37New dialogue is added to this scene.Chapter 38This new scene is where the Terminator, John and Sarah open up and take out the Terminator's chip, therefore shutting him down. Then, Sarah knows she can't destroy the actual Terminator, but, she can destroy this little, fragile chip that is like the on/off switch for the Terminator. John stops her from trying to destroy the chip with a hammer. He convices her not to do it, and she finally listens to him. SO, she doesn't destroy the chip, and they put it back in the Terminator's skull. This scene was cut because this took about three months to film this one scene.Chapter 39This new scene is a scene when John teaches the Terminator how to smile. This scene is hilarious, because when thew Terminator tries to smile, it looks like he is smiling like a horse. This scene also has a new character for the movie, and the person is the woman John Connor (Edward Furlong) says ""nice place you got here"" and the new character, being the cashier (played by Nancy Fish) says, ""gimme a break"".Chapter 41This new scene introduces Miles Dyson (Joe Morton)'s family. It is a scene where it introduces another character to the movie,  and that is Dyson's daughter, who was never seen in the thatrical version. This scene was cut because when Sarah tries to kill Dyson, and Dyson's son was available for shooting the film, but his daughter wasn't.Chapter 43This is an extended scene where additional dialogue between Sarah and her friend Enrique. And, the other part of the extended scene is John talking about how he lives, and it also show him handling large assault weapons. This scene was cut because Cameron did not want to show a kid handling large scale weapons.Chapter 49This extended scene has additonal dialogue of the Terminator and John talking to each other while the Terminator drives to the Dyson house.Chapter 50This extended scene shows Sarah stalking Dyson.Chapter 55This new scene shows Dyson, Sarah and the Terminator destroying all of Dyson's equipment.Chapter 67This is an extended scene showing the T-1000 malfunctioning.Chapter 75This is an extended scene of which there are two Sarahs, yet one of them is the real Sarah. This extended scene shows which one is the real Sarah and the fake Sarah. What it shows is that the fake Sarah (the T-1000)'s feet are also malfunctioning, so that is how John could tell beteween the two.SCENES ONLY IN EXTENDED SPECIAL EDITIONThese two scenes are very hard to see, so here is a description.Chapter 24This is the uncut sequence of the T-1000 at John's foster parents' home. The added footage shows the T-1000 searching John's room.Chapter 79This is the orginial ending  for Terminator 2. It is set in the year 2029 and it shows a much older Sarah, now being 64; and a much older John, playing with his daugher at a playground. It also shows Sarah speaking into a voice recorder."	5.0	There are 3 versions of this movie on this DVD!!!!!	2004-11-15	10	10	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AZTL4YGO1Z90O	"Maria A. Rodriguez ""Maria Rodriguez"""	17 years later, it is surprising how well Terminator 2: Judgment Day stands the test of time. The theatrical release (which is reviewed here) is better than the Director's Cut or Ultimate Edition because the movie flows better, inane dialogue and bad story elements that were better left out are still omitted.The central theme of the movie is the value of human life; it sets itself up well and is an example of Director James Cameron's finest works (another being Titanic (1997)). The heroes and villains contrast well with each other, in a movie made before more modern yarns where you can't tell who belongs with which side.The movie is rated R, so expect cursing, blood and violence.	4.0	The pinnacle of 90's action movies stands the test of time	2008-02-04	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A20TFBJEWQ0R40	MARK C LANDIN	This is a very slightly longer version of the theatrical release. Although it's still rated PG-13, there is quite a bit more profanity (including f-word) so keep that in mind if you are watching it with your kids. None of the additional scenes really make a huge difference, which I imagine is why they were edited out, but Cameron apparently thought they were worth including.Some additional scenes I remember:- Sarah getting beaten and tasered in her room in the mental hospital (you don't feel as bad when she lays out the orderly with a broomstick later on)- A scene where Sarah dreams that Kyle comes back to her to warn of the impending T-1000 attack. This leads straight to the first playground dream scene.- Arnold getting his brain switched from &#34;read-only&#34; mode to &#34;learn&#34; mode adter they excape from the hospital.- John teaching Arnold to try to smile.- A daytime family scene at Miles' house. He has a daughter in this scene, although she doesn't ever appear during the shootout. Heavy sleeper, I guess?- Miles destroying his working prototype at the lab using an ax.Again, nothing that significantly changes the plot. Probably 3-5 minutes of extra footage in all.	3.0	A lot more profanity, nothing else of note.	2014-04-10	2	1	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3HLUNEJUT3MSP	Mark Guzowski	From a geek's perspective, T2 extreme is somewhat groundbreaking - groundbreaking in the extra format on disc #2.  Granted, the format is something only an extremist might be interested in, but it was worth the $15 walmart was charging.  The format on disc #2 is 1080/24p (not 1080i).  Also, the sound streams are in 24/96k format - also well beyond the call of duty.  There is a downside to such a format - it needs a special, software-based, playback app.Disc #2, with the special encoding, is probably the only reason to buy this version of T2, and only buy it if you have a serious machine which can play back such an extreme encoding smoothly.I gave it 4 stars because many people probably (a) won't have a decent enough monitor to appreciate the new format in, and/or probably (b) won't have fast enough hw to play it back smoothly with.  But if you do have both, it is a slick format (again, in an &quot;early adopter&quot; sort of way).	4.0	Buy only if you want the 1080/24p format on disc #2	2004-02-09	0	0	0

When I buy a blu-ray product I expect it to play as a stand alone product. Amazon should state up front that you need to be hooked up to the Internet to use this product. I feel that Amazon is being deceptive by not stating this. As far as being hooked up to the internet to play a Blu-ray product goes; it is all driven by the paranoia of the Recording Artists Association. They have put so many copy guards and hoops to jump through that it is hard to just sit down and enjoy a movie or a music album.	1.0	don't buy	2014-06-24	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A36U3HZISSGL2L	Mark Sanne	This limited T2 special edition finally brings out the potential of DVD! Wow! I'm a terminator fan from the first hour, so the 'special edition' was in my LaserDisc collection for years. And although that edition covers the entire SE as on this DVD, the sound quality was (back then) limited to digital Dobly Surround. Not bad, but I always hoped for T2 in AC-3. That AC-3 LaserDisc version of T2:SE never made it to production, but now the DVD has!!! And when you're lucky enough to have DTS playback you'll be surprised by the quality they out into this movie. Ofcourse it had to be good, since it is THX certified, so picture &amp; sound quality are absolutely superb! The dual layer, double sided disc is PACKED with extra's. So much it will take you HOURS &amp; HOURS to see it all. The unique thing about it is, that it's all worth it! Although I keep my LD version, I'm pretty sure it will not spinn too many rounds in my (combi) player!THIS DVD IS A 'MUST HAVE!' NOW GO ON &amp; BUT IT!	5.0	T2 RULES!	2000-09-02	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A23CFKN2CYSUQ2	Mark Strand	"Are you wondering why the price of the Blu-ray version is too good to be true? It's because this is only an average production. This incredible movie deserves much better. The picture and audio are just average (by Blu-ray standards, that is).T2 is a BD-25 (half-size) Blu-ray disc and contains no lossless audio track. In other words, it doesn't come close to exploiting the capabilities of the Blu-ray format, so why bother?Save your ten dollars, and wait for the ""remastered"" Blu-ray version that I'm quite sure will be released in the future. I'm sure it will contain a better image as well as a real, uncompressed audio track. This is similar to what happened with The Fifth Element: The first Blu-ray version of the movie was terrible, and was followed up by a remastered version. Embarrassing to say the least.Note that I am rating the Blu-ray edition of this movie and its shortcomings. I'm frustrated that it's barely an improvement over some of the excellent DVD versions available.One of the best action movies ever deserves to be a ""reference"" quality production that you would use to show off your home theater, but instead it falls far short.The movie itself is of course awesome."	2.0	This Movie Deservers Better Blu-Ray Treatment	2008-12-30	9	9	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1V7JA3W5T6E5K	Mark Tatum	"Starring Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Joe Morton, Earl Boen, and introducing Edward Furlong.In the year of 2029, John Connor has become a rebel. He has tried to protect humans from Skynet, a computer fighting human resistence. Skynet sends a terminator, different from T-800, out to kill a younger John Connor in the 90's. At that same time, John Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect him.After saving John from T-1000 in the 90's, John and the Terminator go to to free Sarah Connor, John's mother, from a state mental institution. Sarah has been held there for years because of the events of ""The Terminator"". When they free her, they go to see Miles Dyson, the leader of Cyberdyne, the same company as Skynet, who has no idea of what it is becoming. All of them go to Cyberdyne and try to destroy it before T-1000 gets ahold of them.Filmed with amazing special effects and an interesting storyline, ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" scores a pretty high rating in my book. This feature ends up being better than the original.The acting was very good in this film. The acting from Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick was all good, as for Edward Furlong, a fair performance. I didn't expect much from him, after all, this was his pre-""American History X"" performance.The special effects in the film are top-notch. They were very well done and even helped the movie win an Academy Award.""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is one of my favorite Action movies ever made. The special edition DVD makes it even more fun to watch, with the picture and sound remastered. You won't be disappointed with the ending, the emotion between The Terminator and John cannot be missed. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" which released July 2nd this year, was a good feature, but lacked the heart that ""T2"" had."	5.0	The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly	2003-07-28	3	0	3

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2EW69GOMN3EA9	Martin Doege	"It is interesting to watch this fifteen years later and see how it holds up. This was the movie that ushered in the era of digital sound, it also showed morphing, environment mapping and these things that were already present in much shorter form inThe Abyss (Special Edition)during the water creature sequence.From the plot standpoint, this is the only Terminator movie that could have worked without Arnie. And maybe this is not a coincidence, it probably was conceived that way. If Arnold would have demanded too big a paycheck, this probably would have become ""Sara and John get chased by the T-1000"". And it probably would have been almost as good. That being said, it is great to have Arnie back, because when the first part had him act like a (pretty scary) machine, here he is in a way more human than in most of his other roles where he plays actual humans.One could almost be a bit nostalgic for the time when Hollywood could still produce carefully thought-out blockbusters that rocked and even had a bit of wit. Watching ""Die Hard 4"" a few weeks ago was a good reminder how deeply the American film industry has fallen since then.As far as the extra features on the DVD are concerned, I am grateful that James Cameron did not include that horrible sugar-coated coda in the theater version. It would have single-handedly wiped out the whole movie, it is so cringe-inducing. (Yes, even more cringe-inducing than Arnold's acting and the occasional bad SFX.)In ""Terminator 2"", Cameron gives us great action scenes, punctuated by slower, more dialogue-heavy scenes. The film is long because it takes its time to draw its characters, and it does not rush to its conclusion but lets us savor it.A few things look a bit ridiculous of course, like the obvious puppet of Arnie when he walks towards the cops at Cyberdyne while being shot at and that determinedly downtempo synthesizer music in some of the action scenes sometimes is a little embarrassing. Most cell phones can probably synthesize better sound today. But that does not detract from the accomplishment of the movie, which is built on character, situation, and a solid understanding of pacing."	5.0	They really don't make 'em like this anymore	2007-07-24	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1OTOUQ5YJZMY5	Martin Hollis	In the 90's, the only action movie apart from Die Hard was Terminator 2, required viewing for a generation of teens (Myself included). Now, almost a  decade later, the movie has finally been released on a format to do the  amazing effects justice. Many of these effects, such as the famous T-1000  truck scene are still unparallelled in modern movies. The DVD also adds in  a rather surprising commentary by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was much more  thoughtful and intelligent than you would believe. James Cameron also  appears to give thoughtful pearls of advice.  However, what really shocked  me was the quality of the sound. This will replace Saving Private Ryan as  THE film to show off your sound system with.  Finally, if you've never seen  the movie, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Unlike many action movies, this  one has a plot, with Linda Hamilton giving an amazing performance as Sarah  Conner, in a mental institution since the first movie.  Excellent Stuff.	5.0	Action movie of the decade.	2000-08-29	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1IJI6LBORTQXJ	"Master Angelus ""Slasher Troll"""	This movie is awesome. Most of us have seen it and most of us love it or you wouldn't be reading this right now. I've owned 5 different versions of this on DVD, including the Skynet Edition. I got the same edition on Blu because I'm switching over my entire collection and this was on sale at the time. First off, I don't own a 60-inch Plasma with a 7.1 Surround entertainment center. I have a 37-inch LCD HDTV with a Sony Blu player. Picture is awesome through most of the movie. I did see lots of motion blur during some chase scenes and grain during some of the scenes with smoke, but I just chalk it up to trying to color match the effects at the time. Which brings me to the ghosting. There's a lot of ghosting in the dark scenes when trying to composite the scenes where the T-100 is morphing. It wasn't that noticeable on VHS and DVD, but with an HD transfer, you can really tell.The sound is horrible on this disc. All of the dialogue is really low, so you have to turn it up. Then, someone yells, or there's loud music or the background effects erupt and my room shakes. I almost gave the dog a heart attack. I've seen this happen when watching TV and notice the commercials are way louder than the show I'm watching. It's a real pain. I was constantly turning the TV up and down. Features were awesome on the DVD. On this disc, you get about 7 trailers, several pic-in-pic docs for side-by-side comparison, 3 deleted scenes from the Extended Special Edition, and a few commentaries. My biggest gripe is the way that the disc is made.The menu is a pain the ass, especially if you have it connected to the internet. It pings your general location and sets up a fake Skynet hunt for you. To top it off, all of those great behind the scenes, making-of documentaries (The Making Of T2 Featurette, T2: More Than Meets The Eye Featurette, The Making Of T2: 3-D: Breaking the Screen Barrier, etc) are on the BD-Live site. So, now you have to be connected to the internet and download all the content. Great, storage. More pain. I thought Blu was supposed to be the new revolutionary storage media where you could put so much on there without the compression. I don't want to have to rely on connectivity to get most of my content. This disc needs a do-over!	3.0	Skynet needs Wifi now? (Blu-Ray Review)	2011-09-22	14	10	4
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AGM4K9JRDZXX6	Matthew D. Davis	SKYNET EDITIONThis movie is unbelievably amazing on Blu-ray disc.  The picture quality and sound quality is superb and for it's age, I do  not think this movie could possibly look any better.  The skynet edition is interesting.  We get 3 versions of the film.  The theatrical, director's cut, and the extended director's cut which is un-lockable with a password and has an alternate ending.  The alternate ending can also be watched separately in the special features so I would recommend watching the regular director's cut since the alternate ending in the extended is not linear with the rest of the franchise and it's sequels.  Although the ending is interesting and worth a look.  As far as special features go, there are not as many as the ultimate edition dvd had but there are still many including BD live features that I have not had the chance to check out yet as I do not have my bluray player hooked up online.I do have some cons with the features.  Many of the features like the behind the scenes stuff are in a picture-in-picture format.  This means you have to be watching the film to view these.  While this is an interesting take on commentary because we not only hear them talking about it, we actually see it, this is not something that appeals to me.  I have never been a commentary guy.  I rarely listen to commentaries and for me to have to watch the whole movie just to watch some behind the scenes stuff does not appeal to me.  Some people might feel the exact opposite.  I personally would rather have a behind the scenes featurette.  The games are also played while the film is playing.  As a matter of fact pretty much all the special features require you to watch the film.  This is why it is over 8 hours worth of special features, because you have to literally watch the film 4 times with each feature turned on.  I do not know what the BD live features are, but I hope to get connected soon to find out.Another issue I have with this disc is the load time.  It takes several minutes to get to a screen that says you are not connected to skynet, you may watch this disc without being connected click here to do so...  something to that effect.  You then have to click that you want to watch the film.  When that part comes on, I go make some popcorn or something because the screen is blank for at least 5 minutes.  It is slightly annoying and I have to really want to watch the movie to go through that ordeal which makes the skynet edition slightly less appealing.  However every player is different and some work much faster.  Also I do not know if hooking it up online would help.  At least it wouldn't be searching for skynet so it is a possibility.Even with the extremely long load times I recommend this blu-ray because it is the best version of T2 available.  T2 isn't a movie you throw on to pass the time, you put it on to experience.  Throw it in, let it load and go make some popcorn.  By the time your done the menus will be loaded and you can pick 1 of 3 different versions to watch.  Sit back and enjoy T2 in 1080p HD with complete master audio!  It doesn't get any better than this!  And I can honestly say there isn't a Terminator movie better than this!	4.0	Awesome on Bluray!	2010-01-30	5	5	0

To me this movie should've at least got nominated for an oscar for best picture of 1991. Hell I would even go as far to say that even Arnold Schwarzenegger should've got nominated for best actor. Well thats just my opinion, the movie has some of the best action scenes to ever be in cinema. Even to this day the CGI T-1000 still manages to impress me, this movie helped pave the way for CGI to be used in movies.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2ZQATS9718JWX	Matthew Wallace	Since I first saw this movie, I've only watched the original version which I love. When I saw Terminator 2 on Prime Movies I decided to watch it because there was nothing on TV. Each of the new scenes and all of the differences between this movie and the original were absolutely terrible and completely ruined the classic. I will never watch this version again.	1.0	Director's cut is terrible	2013-07-30	6	0	6
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2YQC925PTL267	Matt J Taylor	"I bought this version of Terminator 2 because it had an optional DVD that was in High Definition for the computer. What a waste! This WMHD high defintion DVD is so messed up. First problem I have windows media 10, well this DVD does not like windows meda 10 so I had to download a t2.patch  to correct the problem. Unforunately this does not correct the problem, but only makes things worse. This ended up messing up my CODEX for the DVD playback, in simple terms it trashed my existing DVD player. Many DVD's I have do not work now because this DVD's T2.patch corrupted everything! My DVD player now is half the time not detected by windows so when I insert a CD or DVD I get the error message no DVD player detected! If you are happy with windows XP don't use the High definition DVD, or else you might be reinstalling windows later.Ok when I finally Did get the DVD to work on my computer I was expecting jaw dropping graphics; lol here is the difference between hi-definition and the standard DVD: zilch, nada, nothing, no difference! All that effort to get this DVD to work and I discover the standard interlaced DVD looks better on my 19"" TV. Minimum specs to play the high definition DVD are 3.0 GHZ processor, 512mb ram, 128mb video card!  Ha ha ha, that is definitely the minimum because I have 3.2ghz processor, 756mb ram, and a 128mb 6600GT Geforce card and this DVD runs like a slide show! Choppy, computer freezes, glitches, speach and video become delayed. What you really need is more like  Dual 3.6ghz processors and a 256mb 6800 Ultra Geforce card."	1.0	What a disappointment	2005-04-21	20	8	12
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A6FEIT10MESLG	matt phat	T2 is an excellent movie.  The effects, the acting, etc.  The thing i didn't like about T2 was that it didn't have the same suspensful feeling as the first one.  I saw the first one as a little kid, and the red eyeball scared the hell outta me, especially because Arnold had half of his face ripped off.  T2 was definetly a better movie in terms of special effects.  But it didn't have as good of a story line to it.  I also didn't like Linda Hamilton's acting in it.  She's too tough and mannish.	3.0	Great sequel	2004-03-05	2	1	1

The scenes that were added back help round out the Terminator's background, tell more about the designer who unwittingly laid the groundwork for his creation, and explain the overall situation more thoroughly. The original version was 108 minutes, and this version 154 minutes - so nearly an hour more to see. This is my preferred version of the movie, and I think it will be, too, for most Terminator fans.	5.0	Extra Scenes = More Insight	2013-07-12	3	0	3

I've seen this movie many times, but not with the extra footage, and also not in HD before this.  The HD is quite nice too.  So if you enjoyed the original theatrical version, you will enjoy this one.Why four stars and not five?  Because the movie is very good, but I don't think it is great.  There are no real surprises,, or mind-bending time travel paradox twists in the plot.  I think Linda Hamilton did a great acting job.  The special effects were good for 1991, but seem a little dated today.  Anyway, I'll probably still watch this again in the future.	4.0	I really enjoyed the extra footage in the Director's Cut	2014-05-10	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A370Z6I5GBWU44	"M ""Delicious Strawberry"""	This movie has everything that should please anyone - explosions, guns, and cool cyborgs. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a robot, but this time he is the good guy, protecting Sarah Connor's son (the guy who is supposed to save humankind, who'da thunk?) from a different robot (with uniquely different abilities) who was sent to kill John to ensure that Skynet does not have resistance in the future.Overall this is actually a pretty decent film with some really good scenes. T-1000's actor does an especially good job as the evil robot and does a nice job of acting as a cold, determined robot with just one goal in mind.Overall this movie is nearly as good as the first one, watching both of them makes for a great story - you could almost consider the first two movies a duology on their own.	4.0	Classic	2011-01-20	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F	mdizzog	People need to stop acting like this DVD is all new. It isn't that new. You want the best Terminator 2 dvd? Buy the one with thes stainless steel cover. That one has the terminator 2 special edition.This comes with 3 versions(sound familiar?). One of the reviews on here said something like, &quot;You get 3 really awesome new versions!&quot; You don't. You get the theatrical which is not the best but I like it sometimes. You get the special edition with the basically 15 new minutes of extended footage. They worked in the footage perfectly, so it looks just like new. It isn't like xmen where the footage is just added in. The footage here is actually worked in. The third version is alright, but the special edition is the best. The only weird thing is, the other special edition that I told you about has all 3 of these versions plus DTS worked in for all of them.Anyways, I would just buy the original special edition. There is the basic t2 dvd, which is cheap but not that great. There is the special edition, which is exactly like this one, but ill tell you the difference in a minute. Then there is this one, like the other special eddition but missing something. I mean the footage is the same but...NO DTS. I don't really care about the extras, i bought this for the movie. The other special edition has DTS and PLENTY of extras. I would not buy this dvd. You can get a cheaper one with DTS. Think about it. Cheap DVD + DTS = AWESOME. Then there is Expensive DVD + NO DTS = NOT GREAT.Thats the only difference I can see. The extras? They are fine. But, the dvd. DTS, must have dts. Picture is fine in both versions, but no DTS. If you do not have a DTS decoder would I reccomend this? No. You may buy a DTS decoder some day, then you will want to rebuy the movie, so just buy the original special edition, not the EXTREME edition.	2.0	Not the best version, the previous one is better.	2003-10-02	4	0	4

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1FYQ77OKWUGW6	MDT	"Look, I don't really need to sell you on Terminator 2. The movie is probably one of the best action/popcorn movies ever made, and is a pioneer visually. If you haven't seen it yet, then you should definitely buy it in some format or another.This blu-ray set though...Look, the quality of the picture and sound is fine. I really don't have complaints there. However, let me explain what happened when I went to try and play this disc in my PS3. First, it installed a bunch of data, or downloaded it - not really sure - and that took about a minute or so. Most discs show me a small loading screen the first time I put them in of about fifteen seconds or less. After it did that, it loaded up a ""Skynet"" location tracker or some trivial nonsense. This thing froze on a map of the US for about thirty seconds or so before I thought my disc was broken and tried rebooting it. Then I loaded it up again, it froze there again, and I quickly searched the house trying to find my receipt. After about a minute of idling and not touching the system after I thought it froze, it suddenly sparked to life again, trying to freak me out with ""Skynet"" location statistics, but it doesn't seem like it was able to get a good grasp or any info of where I was. The only option you have is ""Continue."" You hit that, and FINALLY you can go to the main menu, where you can choose which version of the movie you want to watch. Your options are ""Theatrical"" ""Special Edition"" and then ""*****"" which says you can't unlock it unless you punch in the secret code. Where's the secret code? I have no clue, probably at the end of some special feature or possibly it flashes on the screen after you watch the movie once in Theatrical mode - probably some stupid thing like that. Without spoiling it, I googled the answer (Which, if you're mad that I'm not sharing the secret code, you can easily Google it yourself), and punched in the code to be treated to my third option now being for an ""Extended Special Edition"" which was 3 minutes longer than the Special Edition.The fact that there's three cuts of the movie - no complaints. I like that, I like to compare and contrast and what have you. The fact that the third cut is only accessible when you punch a stupid code - That's something that would be cool to unlock a gag reel or something, but another cut of the movie new to blu-ray or any other format? That's just cruel. And stupid.Then, on top of all this, the Extended Special Edition has 80 CHAPTERS programmed into it. Know what I use chapters for? To know around which part I might have stopped a movie so I can skip ahead. This is convenient for me. It becomes inconvenient when there's 80 chapters, meaning almost every chapter is about a minutes and some change long. One chapter near the middle of the movie was only about forty seconds long. What's the point of that? I could hit fast-forward and get there faster.Whoever designed the DVD menu and the chapter layout must truly sympathize with the Terminators as all it seems designed to do is inflict anger and despair from humans interacting with it. I give them points for creativity and effort, but when the effort and ideas go into things that stop people from enjoying their disc or being able to utilize its features, then it's production for production's sake and nobody benefits from it. So I really hate how clunky and dumb the menus are in this release. Everything else - excellent. Special features, commentary, sound and picture quality - all good there. Menus? Chapters? They can go right to hell."	3.0	Good movie, Aggravating Release	2014-04-03	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1D2ZN57YG2NMH	Media Lover	This is one of the coolest Sci-Fi movies of all time. It doesn't live up to The Matrix in my book, but definately holds it's own and stuns the audience with eye candy and good storytelling.The T-1000 is awesome, he is liquid metal, so he can shape shift into other peoples forms. He also slices and impales victims, which can be disturbing.See this film, but be prepared for the high intensity level.	4.0	The Best Terminator Film!	2005-04-04	6	0	6
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I have to say I would choose the HD release of this movie, for starters because my boyfriend has an HD player, and it also has a lot of extra scenes which were cut from the director's cut, but for once, add a lot to the film itself. At the moment, people are still sitting on the fence or choosing one or the other format. Some people prefer Blu Ray, some people prefer HD. I can't get into this, as I haven't watched any Blu Ray movies. But we'll soon see which will be the video cassette, and which will be the DVD. Soon I hope.There are so many editions of this movie out there, it's hard to know which one to choose. Personally, for me it would be this one (well, the HD release which isn't listed on Amazon for some reason) the director's cut, as those always win hands down with me. James Cameron does the best movies. I just wish he'd change his mind and release a special edition of True Lies. A Classic!!!This movie is said to be one of the best sequels in Scream 2 - which is in fact itself a sequel. And indeed it is a great sequel, with the only slight annoyance being Edward Furlong and his ever changing voice! (He is clearly much younger in the desert, for instance, than in other scenes. His voice began to break and had to be pitched to one level in post-production.) With Linda Hamilton looking about as unfeminine as Madonna is now, and Arnie as the good guy this time round (Arnie said during the making of this film that he would never play another evil character again, but he later played the villain Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin), this is truly a great sequel. Although I do prefer Nick Stahl as John Connor in T3, than Edward Furlong.There seems to be a lot of twin stuff in this movie, as Linda's sister, Leslie came in to be a double in scenes involving two ""Sarah Connors"" (i.e., when the T1000 was imitating her), and in a scene where Sarah removes the Terminator's CPU, and threatens to destroy it, her sister is basically in the mirror! And also identical twins Don Stanton and Dan Stanton played the hospital security guard and the T1000.If you were a fan of Michael Biehn in the first movie, he makes a reappearance in this, in Sarah's dream sequence, and warns her that THEIR son is in danger. She has to save him, etc. They kiss and then she wakes up. This is the only scene that Michael Biehn was in, and appeared in some promotional trailers. Cameron cut the scene because he thought that audiences who had not seen the first movie would be confused by the appearance of Kyle. But it is included on the cut shown on the DVD.Many scenes included on the DVD for you enjoyment and not in the theatrical release include:--> A hospital scene was cut that took place directly after the pre-med students peer into Sarah's room. The doctor reminds the orderlies to make sure she gets her medication. The cut scene was of the staff coming in to give her the pills. They smack her in the gut with their batons and force the pills down her throat, then kick her while she's on the floor doubled over in pain. (This scene had to be re-shot several times because actor Ken Gibbel wouldn't hit Linda Hamilton properly with his nightstick. The scene was very physically demanding and Hamilton was furious with Gibbel because he repeatedly botched it. She got her revenge in a later scene where she beats Gibbel with a broken off broom handle - the blows are for real.)--> After the T-1000 kills John's foster parents, he ventures outside to get the dog to shut-up. He reaches down and snatches the collar off the dog, thus killing the dog. On the collar is stamped the dog's name ""Max"". The T-1000 realizes he has been duped by John (actually the T-800 imitating John's voice) by calling the dog ""Wolfie.""--> After killing the dog, the T-1000 goes to John's room to try to find any clues as to where John might be. He stalks around the room waving his arms and ""feeling"" things on the shelves, on the walls, etc. He eventually stops in front of a poster, realizes there is something behind it, rips it down and finds a box of mementos (pictures, and the like). This must be where the T-1000 figures out about the desert compound that Sarah, John, and the T-800 head to after the hospital. James Cameron decided to cut it because it made the T-1000 look too much like it had x-ray vision.--> At the abandoned gas station, a scene involved Sarah and John talking with the T-800 about learning. He tells them that his CPU was switched to read-only before being sent out. Cyberdyne doesn't want them to learn too much while on their own. John asks can it be switched and he says yes. You then see the T-800's face in a ""mirror"" talking Sarah through the procedure. A puppet was used for the foreground Sarah to work on and Linda's twin sister Leslie was in the mirror mimicking Linda's hand movements. After the CPU is removed, the T-800 shuts-down and Sarah places it on a table. She picks up a hammer and tries to smash it to render him inoperative. John stops her and says they need him. He starts to show authority for the first time and says to Sarah, ""How am I supposed to be a world leader if my own mother won't listen to me?""--> A scene in a Skynet-free future, with Sarah Connor as an older woman giving a monologue about how John became a senator.Given Arnie's $15 million salary and his total of 700 words of dialog, that translates to $21,429 per word. ""Hasta la vista, baby"" cost $85,716.This is a great sequel, and well worth getting, although if you find Edward Furlong an annoying little brat like I did, then watch T3 and have your faith in movies reaffirmed."	4.0	Theatrical release on Blu Ray OR Director's Cut on HD?!	2007-08-23	8	2	6

You may have to press &quot;enter&quot; after each number  on certain DVD players.  An easier method is to just select title number 3  from your remote.The picture quality and sound quality are top-notch on  this DVD and it is my top choice for showing off my system to friends and  family!  It includes Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 ES and Dolby Digital 2.0  mixes.  The EX and ES designations refer to a new standard that includes a  sixth channel of sound that is designed to emanate from a rear center  speaker.  I have a 5.1 setup, so I couldn't test this feature, but it's  nice to know it's there.This release comes in two formats; either a  DVD-18 disc or two DVD-9 Discs.  The DVD-18 is a double-sided, double layer  disc and contains the entire 6 hours of material on one disc that needs to  be flipped and the DVD-9 is a single-sided, double-layer disc which has the  material on two discs.  Don't worry, the content on both versions is the  same.  The two disc version might be preferable for DVD changer users.  Due  to manufacturing limitations with the newer DVD-18 format, the DVD-9's were  created to better meet demand.One really cool thing about this title is  that the trailers for Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS play according to which  audio setting is selected.  These are nice to demo your system with!  Also,  the THX trailer at the beginning was customized for T2 as a bonus.If you  love this movie, get this version now!  It has enough bonus materials to  warrant a purchase even if you already own the previous release on DVD.  This is an awesome special edition that betters the Laser Disc special  edition at a quarter of the list price!  There are English and Japanese  trailers, 700 storyboards, a 26 person audio commentary, making of T2 and  T2 3D featurettes and DVD-ROM material as well.Last, but not least, you  get &quot;THX Optimode,&quot; a tool to properly adjust your home theater  audio and video settings for optimum enjoyment.  I recommend Video  Essentials or Avia Guide to Home Theater DVDs for critical system  adjustment, but this is a great tool for free!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A38X8HSAUV9G59	Michael	*spoiler alert*Possibly the best of the 3 movies, but that's up for debate. I think the T-1000 was most brutal of them all, lucky for them they just happened to crash into a iron works, probably the only place that could kill it. Kind of similar to the 1st movie when they happen to go inside an automated factory with a hydraulic press open just enough for them to crawl through and smash the terminator. Perhaps that's the time paradox effect kicking in. The Directors cut includes the scene where they reset his learning capability, a good scene that they cut perhaps just because the movie was a bit too long for their liking. The only part of T2 I didn't enjoy was anytime we were at the funny farm with Sarah and her bad language, and the nuclear bomb nightmare was a bit too much for me, but if that doesn't bother you then you love this movie in its entirety. So go watch it. now!	5.0	Great Movie	2014-05-19	0	0	0

The extended cut is nice because it allows you to see how the deleted scenes fit into the movie, and unlike many movies, the deleted scenes were given full production, i.e., they are finished celluloid, not just spot copies or some such.

This is my second Pioneer Elite blu-ray player, the first one purchased two years ago, so I'm familiar with blu-ray's iphone-like need for constant software upgrades. All my other blu-ray discs play perfectly, and it's all playing on a Runco VX-22d 3-chip 1080p projector, so that's not the problem. I think it's inexcusable that a disc is distributed that won't work on a modern higher-end system, much less a more mainstream system. Sometimes a company can get a little too cute with pushing the envelope on specification reqirements, and I think that's what we have here.

Hidden buttons, no explanations and incorrect instructions just add to the nightmare of navigating this disc. Once you get around this extremely obscure method you can get access to a lot of good material on the making of the disc.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3W3C3M6RM4GT2	Mike Nickky	James Cameron's Sequel to his original ground breaking science fiction epic is not only a ground breaking achievement in special effects but is a compelling look at the danger of greed and the abuse of technology. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator and is a good guy this time around protecting a young John Connor from a more advance-killing machine named the T-1000 played with deadly precession by Robert Patrick. Linda Hamilton returns as Sara Connor, and has been preparing her son for the future war to come. Her performance is a great continuation of the character she played in the first movie, and she has been through the ringer for her knowledge of what's to come.  The special effects are ground breaking, and they do hold up well over time, maybe because they were done with a sense class, and not overly done like the movies we have coming out now.  It's rare that a sequel could be better than the original in every way, but this is a prime example of that fact.A true science fiction classic.	5.0	The best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back.	2003-07-22	1	0	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1O1W2VQZWXDRR	M. Kell	I've had a blu-ray player for awhile now (PS3) but recently purchased an LCD TV and couldn't wait to check out a DVD on it and get the full on experience.  I thought Terminator 2, one of the best looking films of all time, would be a great movie to start with.  Upon popping it in I was instantly disappointed.  There is virtually no difference between this and a standard release.  Trust me after a couple minutes you're looking hard for a reason why you just paid $25 for a DVD and when you can't find anything of consequence you're gonna be disappointed.I mean, obviously it's going to look better on a nice LCD TV but that's about all I got.  A total waste in my opinion.  I hope I can find some blu-ray discs of some decent quality because this has nearly crushed my confidence in the technology right from the get go.  No way I'm picking up more expensive versions of movies for the same picture quality.  Start checking out reviews before you buy because it's no worth another cent if this is what you get.	2.0	So much for modern technology	2007-11-26	20	10	10

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	After a stream of hits that peppered the '80s, Writer/Director James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger reunited after almost seven years to work on the long-awaited sequel to the ground-breaking &quot;Terminator.&quot;  They did that and far more.  &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot; succeeds not only in terms of white-knuckle action sequences, but it also deeped the mythology of the Terminator Saga to greater depths than almost anyone thought possible.  Arnold returns to his best role by far as the Terminator, a cyborg in this film sent to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) as a teen from a superior liquid-metal morphing machine (Robert Patrick) sent by Skynet in the future to kill Connor.  Also added to the rag-tag team of Connor and the Terminator is his Connors' mother Sarah (a terrific Linda Hamilton) buffed-up and ready for the impending holocaust.The film kicks off with the one of the most breath-taking opening sequences ever.  Set in the future, the machine armies and the human armies advance on one another in  lazer-filled combat.  Even though the scene is far grander than the low profile hit and run missions of the original, it still maintains the intimacy that made those secrets all the more engaging.  From there, the film transplants itself to 1992 Los Angeles, where Sarah Connor is locked up in a mental hospital and John Connor is held up with foster parents.  Out of nowhere, two terminators from the future show up, both with different intentions about what to do John.  After giving the seemingly unstoppable T-1000 the slip, the T-101 and John go after his mother and later mount a daring, and damn near sucidal attempt to alter the nighmarish events of the future by trying to derail the progress of the computer company Cyberdyne.What also makes &quot;Judgement Day&quot; such a great movie is the well-formed relationships between John Connor, his mother and the T-101.  John rocky relationship with her mother is played out as is the growing attachment they both feel towards the particular machine that is protecting them.  The relationships germinate throughout the film, growing and blossoming as the plot thickens and boils over in a tense and spectacular in the Cyberdyne building and a metal refinery.  So much credit is due to writers William Wisher and of course James Cameron.  Cameron also provides quick, fluid and often intense pacing over the films' near 150 minute running time without letting down on the story or mythos, which is what makes the Terminator Saga so enduring to begin with.	5.0	A Sweeping Sci-Fi Epic that Surpasses its Predessor	2003-09-30	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2KWTBNN59VTPC	M. Love	The previous DVD version of T2 had &quot;English (Descriptive Video Service)&quot; as one of the audio tracks. This new one doesn't.I realize it was intended for blind and visually impaired people, but I liked  listening to someone describe the non-verbal action of the film. Since I'd  already seen the movie many times, it allowed me to walk around my house,  doing other things while I &quot;watched&quot; the movie. Since the track  was included in the previous disk, I kind of wonder why they didn't keep  it.I'm thinking about &quot;upgrading&quot; my T2 DVD to this new  version.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ADOSOJ9HJAHDU	"M.M. ""Muppet Fan"""	When I saw the first &quot;Terminator,&quot; I was hooked. I thought that it was one of the most fantastic combinations of sci-fi, action and drama I had ever seen.  I was reluctant about the sequel at first; I'd already been  exposed to insipid sequels to many films that couldn't hold a candle to the  original.  But then, I saw it, and I have loved it ever since.  This sequel  to James Cameron's 1984 movie adds to the story without diluting or  drastically changing the storyline, which is a great thing. It picks up  where the last one left off, albeit 10 years later. Another Terminator is  sent back in time to destroy the hope for all mankind.  This time, instead  of Sarah Connor (whose son is the future salvation for mankind in a  post-apocolyptic universe) being the target, it is her son John (who is  still a child) who becomes the subject of termination.  Rather than have  Schwarzenegger play the dreaded evil Terminator of the first film, Cameron  instead has him play a Terminator who has been reprogrammed to protect  young John from the dreaded T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is a Terminator  with very advanced characteristics.  Sarah Connor herself has been  separated from her son, declared legally insane, and spent the years since  her first Terminator experience building herself up physically and  emotionally, becoming very military-like, to prepare for what she knows  will come.  It is up to John and his Terminator protector to save both her  and try to change the course of history as it will come to be known. But  can they do it?  Can they really alter the past in order to preserve  humanity?  And will they be able to avoid the T-1000 long enough to do it?  I was on the edge of my seat while these questions were being answered.  This film is the perfect blend of special effects and storyline, a great  sci-fi/action film with a very human heart.  It is great, and I love to  watch it whenever I get a chance.	5.0	One of the few sequels that was just as good as the original	2000-02-07	14	12	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A17J8CYSYGCLEP	Movie Dude	Just when I thought I saw the best action/sci-fi flick of all time (The Terminator), Terminator 2 came out and I was even more amazed. Both of these movies prove that James Cameron is very talented as well as creative. Now on with the review... T2 is just as good as the first Terminator if not a little better. T2 might not have been as dark as the first but that is a matter of opinion. The role of Arnold changing from killer to protector thrilled audiences greatly and it was neat seeing John Connor trying to teach the terminator to be more human. And just to top it off, we have a more advanced killing machine (T-1000) whose mission is to terminate John Connor. I really liked that the T-1000 could not only imitate people but also wore a police uniform and had a little bit of personality to make people think it was human. The special effects for the T-1000 were excellent and Robert Patrick was very believable as a deceitful killing machine. Linda Hamilton did just as good of a job playing Sarah Connor in T2 as she did in the first movie. I liked the more fearless character of Sarah in T2. Edward Furlong who played John Connor did a good job playing a 10 year old even though I think that Edward at the time was really 13 years old.(He certainly had the foul mouth of a 13 year old in this movie). Anyway, Terminator 2 definately ranks up with The Terminator and should be enjoyed by all action/sci-fi fans.	5.0	superior sequel to the Terminator	2003-07-04	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A20DRRKAN5Z9Q	Moviedude	"I'm going to write this review in 2 sections because of my differing feelings about the film itself, and its presentation.First the movie. This is a beautiful version of T2; crisp and richly saturated to the point where it looks brand new. Digital effects often do not age well, but the admittedly early CG in this movie looks fantastic even 2 decades later, as do the masterful animatronics and prop effects. Terminator 2 remains a fantastic hallmark of dramatic action, fusing horror and sci-fi in an amazing unity of pure awesome that feels far faster than its 2-hour running time. Unlike T1, the BD is a definitive step up from DVD for this film, and I can recommend it to fans without hesitation. If you are watching the movie for the first time, this is the way to do it. I've seen T2 probably at least 20 times, but watching this I noticed a load of new stuff. You also get a good deal of deleted content here if you've only seen the theatrical cut before. Most significantly, Miles Dyson, the character who kind of INVENTS SKYNET, was relegated to a bit part in the theatrical cut. Here he and his family (including a daughter who was completely removed in the TC) are far better developed.Now, the disk. This is possibly the most IRRITATING BD I have ever seen, and I own like 3 from Universal. When you first load it, it launches ""Skynet"" which looks up where you live and a bunch of local information as it ""targets you for nuclear strike."" It's a cute novelty but it took me over 2 minutes ON DSL and was UNSKIPPABLE. You may not have to put up with it if you turn off your wireless or whatever, but the bottom line is you shouldn't have to wait through a pointless novelty to see your movie. Once you're actually in the menu, you will find that although the theatrical and special edition cuts of the movie are available, the longest director's cut is PASSWORD PROTECTED. This isn't a trivial menu thing, it actually wants a password. I'm told you can skip this using root track selections instead of the BD menu, but it's still an example of the interactivity of BD menus totally running away from the viewer's needs.SOOOOOOOOOooo.....If you like T2, buy this movie in spite of the menu. If you haven't seen it before, buy it but brace yourself. If you don't like terminator and you're just a sad sack who buys every ""important"" movie that comes along for collector's value, then I recommend that you get the limited endoskull edition of this off eBay and just watch the DVDs."	4.0	Fantastic movie, UI goes a little overboard	2011-07-19	6	6	0

The sound is GREAT!!! if you do not have a good surround sound system....you are NOT doing this movie any justice. For those of you who have Blu Ray and are thinking about buying this movie on Blu Ray...save yourself some money and just buy the standard DVD Extreme version.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3DKCBKDEO2GS3	Moviegeek	I have seen all versions of T2 and the Ultimate Edition DVD is the one to buy:T2:Extreme Edition DVD is just the theatrical release with very little extras.This version comes in a metal case and on disc 2 is a PC version of the film(don't ask me why).T2:Blu Ray is the theatrical release with very little extras,the HD transfer isn't much better than the SD version.This version comes with the standard Blu Ray case.T2:Ultimate Edition DVD has three versions of the film plus it's loaded with extras on the second disc.You can spend days going through all the extras on the second disc and if you hit a wrong button on your remote the terminator will threaten you.This version has the easter egg(82997) that allows you to view the directors cut which in my opinion is the best version.This version comes in a plastic case with a cardboard jacket,it includes an informative booklet.The picture and audio quality of all versions is outstanding.	5.0	Arny At His Best	2008-05-14	3	3	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	As sequels go, this is one of the best - along similar lines to the same director's 'Aliens', it's bigger, more expensive, and louder than the original. It isn't quite as good, but I'll get to that in a minute. 'T2' was released at the height of Arnold Schwarzenegger's majesty, and viewed  in almost every way it was a triumph, combining state-of-the-art  computer-generated effects, the biggest movie star in the western  hemisphere in the one role he was most suited for, and a director noted for  his command of technology, and a more family-friendly tone (to suit the  caring, sharing mood in the early 1990's). Even at the time, it didn't seem  perfect, though. After a promising start the film slows down disturbingly,  with two plots fighting each other to a standstill - Robert Patrick's  effectively stoic T1000 disappearing from the narrative for the middle  section of the film, to be replaced by a less-interesting, more pyrotechnic  subplot involving the destruction of Cyberdyne Systems, inc. Still, the  film is of such quality that this can be forgiven, as can the cliched  finale, set in what Roger Ebert would describe as an 'abandoned flame  factory'. A few years later there was a 'special edition', with a few  decent extras which clarified the story without slowing the film down, and  now there is a DVD. a glance at the contents reveals good stuff  (essentially: 'making of', lots commentaries that nobody will ever hear,  the special edition elements, trailers) and bad - six hours of footage on  one CD does not bode well for picture quality. It would have been nice if  the accompanying 'T2:3D' iMax presentation could somehow be included, but  you can't have everything.	4.0	'Move quickly to see the view'	2000-07-14	10	5	5

In my opinion the quality of the restoration and transfer even in regular (non-HD) mode easily surpasses the T2 ultimate edition.  Too me it looks just as good as a Superbit DVD if not better!Buy this DVD for the stunning quality and the Ultimate edition for the features, (although I believe this one has the better commentary). Director Cameron's scientific/technical grasp is quite apparent throughout the commentary and I enjoyed his sense of humour.My only gripe is the fact that the HD DVD-ROM mode is of the theatrical version and not the director's cut, other than that I would say this DVD is faultless and worth every cent.	5.0	Extreme Audio and Sound for T2 Extreme	2004-10-24	3	2	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AB5DVSNPX1JSK	"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown"""	Terminator 2 is a rise above most of the other action movies that have been filmed in the past two decades.  And it's got more than special effects to brag.Unlike a lot of other action flicks of the modern age, this film combines special effects, actions, and good drama to the fore front of this movie.  Most action films will depend on its indulgence and concentrational value of their special effects and action sequences to sell tickets and encourage rentals.  Not T2.Oh it has its action, its special effects which will keep you on the edge of your seat.  But it has even more to offer than just that.  A great storyline.In the first movie, Arnold was the villain robot out to murder Sarah Connor.  Now he returns as the good robot who is ordered to protect John Connor from an assassin robot.  The assassin robot played by Patrick is T-1000 a highly advanced machine that is made of liquid metal.  Sounds cool huh?  Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor and is kind of on the deep end, on the edge of going berserk, very different than her character in the first film.  But this is great character development and acting.  If you knew that the world was going to end wouldn't you be a bit edgy?  Exacto Mundo.What I like the best out of this film, is the growth of John and the Terminator together.  The Terminator will pick up certain principles and morals during the film, becoming sort of human because of the influence of John.  I thought this was superb, it gives a dramatic and emotional element to this film.Without the bonding of the characters around each other, this film would be nothing more but a waste of great action sequences, which a lot of action films seem to do.  You need a human element in a storyline as well as a point to why it's being told.  A point, meaning what makes this story so entertaining, what is this film about?  And T2 has an easy answer to that question.  Which you'll learn later when you see it.If you haven't seen it, see it.  You'll like it.Grade: A	5.0	T2: you must see it too!	2003-08-15	0	0	0

Murdock	"I'm not going to write a review for this film because everything about this movie has already been said by critics and audiences alike. I'm a big fan of this movie and can watch it again and again, so I'm going to restrict my review to the special features of the Extreme edition of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The code '82997' does not work here. At the main menu of disc 1, it lists Play Special Edition, sensory control, and jump into timeline (go to scene selection). The movie is in widescreen format. Some, not all, of the deleted scenes are included in the Special Edition, such as Sarah Connor's dream of Kyle Reese and John Connor teaching The Terminator how to crack a smile. The alternate ending isn't included in the Special Edition. You also have the option to listen to James Cameron and William Wisher's commentary for the film.Now, onto disc two which has the special features. To watch the theatrical version, you have to upload it on your PC. Depending on your computer's capabilities, this may or may not be doable. I tried loading disc 2 on my PC to watch the special features and, after numerous attempts of it not loading, I finally gave up. Only two of the special features on disc  2 can be played on your DVD player and that is ""No feat but What We Make"" which is a 24-minute discussion about how T2 was the breakthrough film in computer special effects and its influence on the industry and ""T2: On the Set."" The rest of the features has to be uploaded on your computer.While it's not quite Extreme, it's still a good (and inexpensive) edition to add to your DVD collection."	3.0	Not quite Extreme but Still a Good Edition Nonetheless	2014-05-11	1	0	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1ER6IYOMM8VCT	"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK"""	"I went back and watched the original Terminator film before I sat down to watch this slick and entertaining sequel. While the original is darker and gritty, the sequel is much more tongue and cheek. Arnold returns as the iconic cyborg, but this time he's the good guy! Having a huge budget increase this film is much bigger with groundbreaking FX(for the time). One could argue that this is a ""Hollywood"" sequel that sold out, but I think what Cameron did with the sequel is pay respect to the original film and do a lot of the things he wanted to do the first time around, but couldn't because of budget restraints.What I love about the sequel is that the characters are much more developed and I guess that is the trade off for not being as intense as the original. This time there's a new metallic menace played wickedly cold by Robert Patrick. It would have been nice to have Lance Henriksen in this role as he was Cameron's first choice for the original Terminator, but Patrick's sleek morphing shapeshifter is a perfect counterpart to Arnold's bulky brute. The Extreme edition which I'm reviewing is disappointing as it doesn't have that much in the way of extras considering it's a two disc set unless your counting the material that can only be viewed on a computer! It also has the theatrical version of the film which is only viewable on your computer too!??? This is ridiculous, extremely irritating and down right shameful! I couldn't tell what was added to the film for the most part despite it being 16 minutes longer, but I did feel the film drag a little and this could be due to the extra footage?Overall this film is truly a fun time and fans of The Terminator should be happy with this installment. To me the first two films complement each other so well and neither would be as good if the other didn't exist."	5.0	A GREAT SEQUEL THAT PAYS RESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL!	2009-12-16	1	1	0

The incorporation of CGI to create the t1000 broke new ground. Arnold also reached his high at this point. A new standard was set for movie makers.  All the great special effects such as the Lord of the Rings exist because James Cameron took the chance which he has done many times.This DVD is almost perfect.  The picture is flawless and a THX soundtrack that sang from my sound system.  The new digital transfer was bright and crisp.  I was using an audioquest YIQ-2 which brought all the details to life. I am so glad that the industry is taking the time to redo movies that mean so much to film lovers. The second DVD is loaded with hours of special features, hours of insight on the how and why of the T2 consumed my nights for several days.  Artisan Entertainment has my applause on their release of T2 DVD. Lastly the case is interesting but I had problems with is cutting the edge of the plastic of the DVD.

It felt forced and a bit silly.  Will the mother show her love for the son or just be this hard-a$$ed Biatsch?  Can a terminator be more like a human than a machine....like a father?  No problemo.  He'll even salute you as he martyrs himself.The repeated dream sequence of a nuclear holocaust blasting a playground.  Idk, it just got old and tiresome.The obvious plot busters:  He's missing an arm NOW, its stuck in the machine over there....and you throw the arm from the past into the molten steel to destroy it....but that's just one arm...there are two arms!  Go get the other ARM.  That's you're whole purpose, to destroy the materials that can later be used to build skynet...and you forget the other arm?  The fate of the world, the impending nuclear crispi-fication of the innocent kids on that little playground, it all hinges on you suddenly forgetting that there are TWO arms.Oh well...I like the chase scene where Arnold flips the sawed-off shot gun round and round to reload it.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3FYEE0T4E2LSK	Munchguy	"The Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition DVD is a must have! You get three full versions of the movie, and there are over 80 chapters for this 2.5 hour epic! The theatrical version has everything you remember from seeing in the theater and on cable. The special edition gives you the same film with deleted scenes. And the extended version gives you the alternate ending, which was thankfully rejected by preview surveys. Not to say it's bad, but the ""open highway"" ending fits better with the overall themes of the film.If there was any movie to be fanatical about, Terminator 2 is fantastic choice. And the Ultimate DVD offers a fanatic's dream. The featurettes and documentaries are numerous and detailed. Remember, with ""T2"" came out, brand new special effect techniques were being developed and implemented. Some folks had the right idea by documenting EVERYTHING in the process of making this ground-breaking film, it seems, and you have the privilege of viewing the behind-the-scenes secrets that elevated movie-making standards for the 90s.This film thoroughly entertains with each viewing. A solid story, themes of fate, humanity, and morality ooze from the three main characters: the T-800 (Schwarzenegger), John Connor (Ed Furlong), and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Trying to make sense of the destiny the world is hurtling toward while battling the nearly invincible T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in some amazing and stylized action sequences, the trio cannot help but understand more about themselves and each other. Even though one is a machine, his CPU is ""a learning computer."" With a childlike innocence that is neither contrived or overplayed, The Terminator slowly learns what it means to be human while willfully protecting John and Sarah. He protects what he does not understand for much of the film. The unique dynamic between the three characters, a protective, empowered and courgeous mother, a young, but resourceful, streetwise child, and an unemotional learning machine, is well played.There is something new to see each time, which will make the three versions with over 20 commentary tracks something worth revisiting time and time again. This is not just an action film, but the action alone could sustain someone not interested in the themes or philosophies behind it.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A20XMOTPQXI3VH	Nathan Butler	First off, this DVD sets new standards as to extras for die-hard fans. There's no argument there.  I do want to warn fellow T2 fans though.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; version of the film on this DVD is *NOT* new.  This is the exact same &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the film that was released back in 1994 by Live Home Video as a boxed set of the Special Edition on VHS along with a supplemental tape, which included the American trailers (also on the DVD) and &quot;T2:  More Than Meets the Eye,&quot; which is also on the DVD.  The only difference in MTMTE is that the credit is given to Showtime, not Live.  If you already own this older Special Edition, and that's all you are interested in, don't buy this DVD.  If you're a die-hard fan, though, who loves the idea of tons of Featurettes, a script on the screen, and, best of all in my opinion, a widescreen version of the Special Edition we saw six or seven years ago, this is still a very good buy for the 30 bucks or so you'll end up paying for it.  Just don't confuse yourself into thinking that this Special Edition is different (other than widescreen) than the original VHS Special Edition because you'll be disappointed.  No, the scene with the T-1000 rubbing John's belongings is *not* restored, nor is the &quot;old Sarah&quot; ending.  Those are still on More than Meets the Eye, but not in the film itself. If you're a big T2 fan, you'll love this DVD. If you're a fan that only cares about the Special Edition content, that cares nothing for featurettes, and who already owns the VHS Special Edition, you might as well hang onto the money and wait for T1 to come out on DVD.	5.0	Awesome, but the never before seen Special Edition isn't NEW	2000-12-29	2	2	0

It is a very good action movie with good special effects, fun performances, and good violent sequences, but there are so many plotholes  it's hard to think about the movie itself.The first big mistake was the  casting.  This film supposedly takes place 11 years after the first one,  giving John Connor the age of ten.  So what do they do but cast  fifteen-year old pubescent Edward Furlong as the kid.  I like Furlong as an  actor, but he sure wasn't very convincing as a ten-year old.  Also  established is that in this film Sarah Connor is twenty-nine, even though  Linda Hamilton, at the time, was nearing forty.  She didn't look that bad,  though, it's just that I don't see how we can be expected to believe she  was 18 in the first film.And then there's the famous truck on the  bridge.  How did the truck build up that much speed going sideways on a  bridge?  How did it even turn around so that it was facing the side  wall?And then there's the whole future.  Let's recap from the first  movie.  The machines have lost, so they build a time machine, and send a  terminator back through time.  It has to go naked, as dead stuff won't go  through, and its chassis is protected by its flesh.  The humans steal the  time machine, send though a soldier, and destroy the machine.Now, the  machines don't have the time machine anymore to send back a second  terminator, and even so, if you think logically about time travel, how  would they know if the terminator had failed the first time.  As far as the  future is concerned, it just goes on.  But even if, somehow, they realized  their plot had gone awry, and managed to build a second time machine in the  face of defeat; how did the send back the liquid metal terminator -- he's  got no living components; he shouldn't be able to go through.  Or, if it's  a new model Time machine that allows metal, why didn't they send back  guns?This movie, although the acting was pretty good, didn't have much  of the human element of the first movie, not for lack of trying, and too  many scenes seemed lifted straight out of the first movie, including  dialogue and the truck chase.There's just too many contradictions,  plotholes, and oversights in this movie to make it great like the first one  was, it was merely an enjoyable action flick.	3.0	A good action movie	2000-07-02	38	14	24

It's a movie.And it's one of the best ever made.This should be a core part of any blu-ray collection - part family drama, part science fiction, part action, part dated jokes and references, part anti-corporate warning.Please stop reading reviews and go watch it.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	It's pretty obvious that with the looming release of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in July, this new edition release of Terminator 2 on DVD is pretty much a money making ploy by Artisan to cash in.  All that aside (and despite the constant comparisons between this and the previously released Ultimate Edition), this Extreme DVD isn't all that bad.  The new commentary by James Cameron and William Wisher is interesting to hear and I find much better than the pre-recorded and overlapping one found in the Ultimate Edition DVD.  The picture and sound are unbelieveable; never before have I seen or heard the film in such rich picture and sound quality.  The other special features however, are absolutely not worth owning if you already have the previously released Ultimate Edition.  Besides the two featurettes, you get to watch the extended version of the film on Disc 1, and the theatrical version on Disc 2 if you have a DVD-Rom drive in your computer.  Plenty of other special features like those featured in the Ultimate Edition DVD would have been more than welcome here, especially if you missed out on owning the aforementioned DVD.  As we all know, the film itself is an action/sci-fi classic that set the standard for modern day computer generated special effects and continued a complex yet compelling storyline.  All in all, if you did miss out on the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, this Extreme DVD edition is worth picking up, but if you already own the Ultimate Edition stick with it.	4.0	Is this new DVD worth it?	2003-06-07	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3K7QEDZZ3ST4S	"""nimrod18037"""	&quot;Terminator 2&quot; is one of those rare instances where a sequel lives up to its precedor. While &quot;The Terminator&quot; is a darker, more ominous film, T2 is a more streamline action/popcorn movie. The plot here is still very strong, and with the addition of great acting, awesome effects, impressive action sequences and the genious direction of James Cameron, you have another one of the greatest sci-fi action movies out there.Here is the basic plot of this movie. John Connor is a young boy in our present day. Another terminator is sent from the future to try to destroy him, this time the advanced T-1000, a liquid metal terminator that is virtually invincible. Arnold is back, of course, this time as the good guy, a &quot;good&quot; terminator sent by the John of the future to protect his past self.The movie itself is a masterpeice. As the plot iteself advances during the movie, you connect with the characters quite emotionally, making the ending all the more impacting. Robert Patrick is perfect as the villian in this film, just as Schwarzenneger was in the first. The special effects are out-of-this-world, and the action scenes are some of the best ever on film. And, like the first, there is just the right amount of dark humor thrown in to keep the movie from being too serious.NOW ONTO THE DVD EXTRAS! This is one of the best DVD's to have ever been released just for this reason. There are over 6 hours of extras here, everything from movie trailers to behind the scenes footage, commentary; everything a fan could ever ask for. And the quality of the DVD is incredible, too, the sound and picture are both some of the best I've ever seen. Simply put, this is a DVD that belongs in the hands of anyone who owns a player, especially for Terminator and action movie fans. If you like this, may I also suggest the following, and vice-versa.

T2 is one of the few movies I saw as a child (teenager actually) that still blows me away as an adult.  All the characters were cool and worked together well.  I loved watching the relationship between John and the Terminator grow into a solid friendship.  It was also cool watching Sarah overcome her prejudices against the Terminator and realize that he's really not the same as the one that tried to kill her 10 years earlier.  That liquid metal T-1000 was just about unstoppable and was pretty scary.I remember being quite shaken by the scenes of the burning playground at the beginning of the film and by the nuclear holocaust scene.  They were very vivid and kinda frightening (I was only 13, remember).As for the DVD itself, it has the clearest and best picture I've ever seen (there's really something to that THX stuff).  I love the DTS 5.1 sound.  It really seems like you're in a movie theater.My fave version of the movie is still the theatrical version.  The 2 extended versions are overlong and none of the added footage is really necessary.  However the parts where the T-1000 are malfunctioning in the steel mill and melting into the floor could've been left in to show that he was starting to lose ground.Also (pet peeve) the movie says John was 10 (in the police computer readout), but this is a mistake.  In the first movie Sarah was 6 months pregnant with John in November 84 and then gave birth to him February 85.  The 2nd movie is set in the summer of 94 (because the Terminator told John that his future self reprograms him 35 years from that time; 1994 + 35 = 2029).  Therefore John is only 9 and will be 10 in February 95, but that's just a small pet peeve.  Overall, it's the best DVD ever.	5.0	Phat DVD	2002-07-12	2	1	1

So why haven't I watched it after all this time, well let's look at the pros and cons of T2:Pros:1- A successful sequel of a blockbuster T1 (check the votes).2- A successful first use of computer animation technology (1991).Cons:1- More than 2 hours.2- Noticeable difference between animatronics and animation.I always fancied unstoppable killing machines that are believable and innovative. The T1000 liquid metal tops the list with its amazing ability to change shape and solidify at will. I even thought about the scientific feasibility of such a machine, but that only leads to contradiction with some scenes in the movie, like when Arnold shoots the T1000 to many pieces when it was frozen, you don't see a central module that supplies the energy to drive it, or an intelligence module (CPU) that contols it. And if it doesn't have a central module, then it would not need to see from its ""eyes"" or hear from its ""ears"", its entire body can be used to sense the world around it. Other than that, great movie with great special effects."	5.0	15 Years of Novelty	2006-05-17	7	3	4
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AM1OKBJEBC87R	"""osiris_mg@hotmail.com"""	The first Terminator - sent through time to destroy Sarah Connor - has failed. But the nightmare future portrayed in T1 remains to haunt the present. 10 years after the events in T1 a cyborg built of a mimetic poly -  alloy (liquid metal) is sent back through time to destroy the child John  Connor.A reprogrammed T-800 is also sent back, with a neat twist in  plot to spice things up. Some stunning action scenes mark the battles  between the two near - indestructible opponents, but this is not all there  is to the movie. Indeed Robert Patrick's T-1000 character drops out  completely for a third of the movie, a time in which the director draws the  attention of the audience to some of the larger issues through dreams and  revelations between the characters. The themes concerning fate, technology,  and what it is to be &quot;alive&quot; are certainly near as big as themes  can get.The T-800, which to some viewers has apparently appeared  warm/fuzzy is in fact no such thing, and there are many scenes - many! -  where the sheer coldness of its nature and single minded pursuit of its  goal to protect its target are exposed for the simple programming that they  are. There is no &quot;love&quot; or dedication in the human sense,  although the cyborg learns new persepctives through its travels,  culminating in a surprisingly emotional scene at the close.As often  mentioned, the snake-like, liquid metal adversary is a masterpiece both of  acting and special effects, and ushered in a new era in computer graphics.  Although not as dark as the predecessor, this film was certainly prettier,  and explored a wide range both of film styles and themes.Very cool.	5.0	No film in the 90's topped this..	2000-01-25	24	22	2

It is easily the best of the three movies and is also a &quot;must have&quot; for DVD collectors. It has a good story, great sound and music (esp. in DTS-ES), and special effects still great to watch despite being 11 years old.About the Extreme version though, I am passing this one by. If you can still get it, pick up the older Ultimate Edition instead.If you look hard enough there are 3 versions of the film as opposed to only the 2 in the Extreme version. As far as the windows media support in the Extreme, how good can it be? Who really cares for it if you have Dolby digital, and DTS support anyway.One more thing about T2.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2XR54R8DUGDUW	Patrick Prevenas	&quot;T2&quot; is, in fact, one of the most well-written, poignant, and utterly human stories that has ever made it onto the screen.  James Cameron has always  been a master of telling beautifully human stories that he can dress up  with a lot of gunfire and explosions in order to create an all-around hit  between the people who &quot;get it&quot; and the people who don't.  I feel  that the greatest tragedy of &quot;T2&quot; is actually most of its  audience's inability to grasp the more meaningful human moments in the  film, particularly in the brilliant and shattering role reversal played out  between Sarah Connor and her worst nightmare, the Terminator, when she sets  out to alter the future at the expense of another human life and suddenly  realizes what she has become--while the Terminator is now the one  protecting human life!  This is phenomenal storytelling, and anyone who  thinks that there is &quot;very little&quot; to the film apart from the  groundbreaking special effects seriously needs to take another long, hard  look at the intricate plot and character arcs that James Cameron so  masterfully created and seamed together in this magnificent movie.  The  added 15 minutes for this Special Edition tremendously enrich the character  arcs, in fact, and I am so delighted that it has finally been made  available on DVD.  So pick it up, and make sure you pay enough attention to  appreciate it for the beautiful tale of humanity that it truly is!  :)	5.0	Awesome!	2000-08-29	0	0	0

First, the load time is long and freezes on the screen which made me believe I had a faulty disc. Then it goes to the main screen with menus. Accessing the movie is simple but I still can't find any of the promised 8 hours of bonus features. The drop down menu icons are not easy to navigate and the last one takes you to some Bluray Live page that takes another minute to load. And there, more crap menus that take you knowhere, hang, or say no classified access. Even the picture in picture add-ons to the movie didn't play and I have a strong internet connection. Here's how it works, you click on a tab for a feature and then play the movie, not really knowing what the hell you've just clicked or how it will function. If wrong, you have to go back. But it doesn't end there as more menus appeared during the movie with more vague tabs that said things like, &#34;Access Protocol&#34; or some crap.

""pchin"""	Gosh in my entire DVD collections, Terminator 2 is the worst one as I spent so much on double/triple dipping from the Ultimate Edition to the Black Edition to the Extreme Edition...When it was initially released in Blu-ray, I got it though knowing it has no extended scenes. Now here comes another edition that will suck our money again!I really hate such marketing plot but being a T2 fan, I just can't help it...Geez if they release another edition again I shall go nuts!!**********Update: The video quality is slightly better than the original released Blu-ray but the audio quality surpassed the revious BD!The previous Blu-ray release of 'Terminator 2' featured only a Dolby Digital EX mix, and no true high-res audio option but this one the studio gives us a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 6.1 Surround track at 48kHz/16-bit which sound much superior than the old one!	4.0	Another Edition Again??	2009-03-23	12	3	9

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3UA40JOD3BE1M	"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!"""	"Just like the original ""Terminator,"" I can't imagine anyone reading this review, or looking at the Amazon entry and thinking about buying the film in it's ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD version, and not actually knowing what the film is about. The original ""Terminator"" became an icon; it entered our collective memories - ""I'll be back!"" - became a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic urban legend with a life all it's own, and ""T2"" is the next step in its evolution.And `evolution' is a good way of looking at it. ""T2"" is not some cheesy installment in a bloated cinematic franchise, designed to generate mega-$'s for all concerned, while shortchanging the viewer with a bland or worthless story line, cardboard FX, and Z-list performances. No, ""T2"" is a legitimate continuation of the original ""Terminator,"" creating more of the backstory and mythology of the ""Terminator"" universe, and taking us closer to the day when Skynet achieves consciousness and decides to wage its war of global extermination against Mankind. In fact, the genesis of the ""T2"" story can be seen in one of the deleted scenes contained on the ""Terminator, Special Edition"" disc; Sarah Connor, tired of being hunted, decides to take the fight to Skynet's creator, the Cyberdyne Corporation, which, as shown in yet another deleted scene, is where the climactic fight against the original terminator took place!And this, literally, is the key to ""T2."" When the original terminator was crushed in the press, the company salvaged its CPU/chip, damaged and inoperable, plus one arm. It's the research done on the CPU that leads to the computing breakthrough that leads to the creation of Skynet, which created the terminators in the first place! And just as Skynet sent a terminator back through time to ensure John Connor couldn't interfere with its plans, Sarah Connor attempts to stop the creation of Skynet itself in the present... you see where this is going? There're probably a couple of pretty nasty time-travel paradoxes involved in all of this - maybe we should ask Dr Who! - but it doesn't matter, the story carries you effortlessly along and doesn't let you start going `round and `round in those kinds of ever diminishing circles!The basic set-up is as follows, having failed in killing Sarah Connor in the original ""Terminator,"" Skynet dispatches yet another terminator, a state of the art T-1000, this time to kill John Connor while he's a young teenager. And just as before, the adult John Connor dispatches a guardian, in the shape of an old T-800 terminator, reprogrammed to protect him at all costs.And it's the difference between the two terminators that is one of the main joys of the film. The T-1000 is a shape-shifting ""liquid metal"" creation, able to morph into almost any guise it needs, as long as the end result is the same basic size, or volume, as itself. This basic characteristic is one of the elements that delayed the making of ""T2."" James Cameron had the idea for the ""shape shifter"" when making the original ""Terminator,"" but it took the intervening years for cinematic CGI FX to catch up with Cameron's imagination, so the T-1000 could be portrayed convincingly on-screen!Robert Patrick plays the ""human"" T-1000, and his performance is as different from the original terminator as is the technology he represents. ""Ahnald's"" original performance set the standard, relentless and robotic, unstoppable, like a semi spinning out of control on an ice covered freeway; get out of the way or be obliterated. Robert Patrick gives a more subtle, more nuanced, performance; he's smaller, sleeker, faster, his is the relentlessness of a shark moving in for the kill, a thing of terrible beauty that cannot be swayed or negotiated with. But the T-1000 also knows something of human frailty, of pain, and how to use it to its advantage. Whereas the original terminator simply slaughtered anything that got in its way, the T-1000 actually tortures Sarah Connor in one scene in an effort to make her give up her son, telling her, ""I know this must hurt...""""Ahnald's"" performance, as the old-tech T-800 model terminator, is also more varied, and this is explained in, what I think is, the most important scene deleted from the original theatrical release, but reinstated in this ""Ultimate Edition."" Sarah, having been broken out of an asylum by her son and his newest bestest buddy - his very own terminator! - is holed up in a disused gas station with John and the Terminator. The T-800 explains, while Sarah digs bullets out of its back, that it's possible for the terminators to learn, to adapt to their environments, but a switch on the CPU has to be reset to allow this behavior; the default setting is the unstoppable hunter killer, with no need of subtlety. But here's the catch, to make the change, which will allow the Terminator to better protect John, the CPU has to be removed, effectively shutting down the Terminator, then reset and reinstalled. The CPU is removed, but Sarah tries to destroy it, saying it'll be one less terminator, and John, exerting his authority for the first time, convinces his mother that they need the Terminator if they are to survive, and more importantly, stop the creation of Skynet. From here on in, the film roars to its finale as Sarah takes the fight to Cyberdyne by, literally, zeroing in on Dr Miles Dyson, the scientist who obsessively cracks the secret of the original terminator CPU.""T2"" lacks the sheer visceral punch of the original; it's a more refined, mature, and carefully thought out film, but that's no criticism, the set pieces will blow you away, and the CGI, absolutely state of the art at the time, STILL stands up today. This is controlled action and mayhem for grown-ups, and ""Ahnald"" was true to his word when he said, ""I'll be back!"""	5.0	Terminator reborn...	2003-01-04	3	2	1

Figured they'd get it right on the second try, so waited till now when i wanted to watch T2 to try it.  Surprise!!! This one doesn't work either.  Now its after the return period.  Bottom line, I wish Amazon wouldn't advertise a great price on a Bluray just to play the &#34;lets see if they return it&#34; game.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2OFAZ3JHD6ZRV	Paul	Not only is this one of the most entertaining action films ever made but the Ultimate DVD Edition is probably the best DVD released so far! It's got an overwhelming amount of info about James Cameron's making of the film, everything about the film and the list goes on and on. There is over 6 hours of bonus material. Incredible. Anyway, about the movie, it is a continuation of the Terminator saga where the T-1000 is now the protector of the future human leader of the resistance, John Connor, instead of the ruthless killer in the previous movie. T2 is laden with eye-popping action and special FX and also powerful emotions. I can't think of one thing I dislike about this classic movie. If you have not seen it, You my friend have been living under a rock for the past 12 years. Pick up this awesome T2 DVD ASAP!	5.0	It Will Blow You Away.	2003-03-25	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ASQJ70OUKL0HT	paul	The first Terminator film was very low budget, but ultimately succeeded in terms of a fantastic storyline and a menacing villain[Arnold as the terminator]wich led to its immense box office success. Everybody suspected a sequel, and so it came, in the form of Terminator 2:Judgement Day, a bigger, better, more action packed sequel.John Connor has now been born and is now about 13 years old. Now he is the target for the brand new T-1000, a liquid metal killing machine whose mission is to destroy him and ultimately ending the future of the machines in which he is the leader.But like in the first film, the future resistance is able to send back a terminator aswell, but to protect young John.The good terminator[played by arnold] finds John first, and they both go on the run from the T-1000, in which Arnold is no match. Which follows is a sequence of events that keeps you on the edge of your seat with awsome special effects and some truly amazing stunts. Of course this is a James Cameron picture, no surprise. The maestro of big budget event films.This is an amazing action film which most people will love, and to boot it is an amzing DVD loaded with special features and some really slick menus.A must buy DVD movie in every respect.	4.0	THE blockbuster	2002-03-03	2	0	2
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AWFPO0SDMD4QR	Paul	As I opened my Amazon.com box revealing a shiny outer metal casing for this DVD, I knew I was in for something special.  This &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; impressed me even before opening the plastic wrapping!  Soon, I slid off the metal T2 casing revealing a beautiful 2 disc DVD package.  The graphics on the outer casing and on the discs themselves are quite creative.  The booklet is also impressive....30 pages of photos and interesting facts concerning James Cameron, his crew and the film.  It also has a detailed list of the chapters and a list with information on the restored footage.  OK...so far I have a huge smile on my face, and I haven't even popped the DVD into my player yet.  By the way, if you plan to keep the booklet inside the DVD case, make sure you close it tightly!  This booklet is so thick, you'll have problems keeping the package closed!  Anyway, I finally pop in Disc 1.  The animated graphics are terrific!  Disc 1 contains the theatrical release of the film, the special edition with restored footage, and the magic &quot;easter egg&quot; ending.  It also gives you an assortment of audio options including Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0.  You also have the choice of audio commentary by 26 cast and crew members!  What I thought was really great about the commentaries was that the name of the person talking is shown on the screen with their credit, so you always know who is talking without getting confused.  That was a pleasant surprise.  You also have the choice of English subtitles and &quot;Mission Profiles&quot;, which are biographies of many cast and crew members.  You can also jump to any scene you want with an impressive &quot;timeline&quot; graphic.  Being THX certified, this disc also contains a THX set-up.  OK...so lets talk about the DVD.  I decided to watch the &quot;Special Edition&quot;.  After a very impressive new THX logo, I sat back and watched the film.  Instantly, the sound was top notch.  If you have a subwoofer, you may have to make sure that anything hanging on your walls are securely fastened.  The remastering job on this film is amazing.  The stereo separation, the ambience, vocals and music all sound incredible.  This film really set a new standard for sound design when it was first released, and this DVD compliments the sound department to the fullest.  You are thrown into a surround sound environment that is addicting and thrilling. Even those with simple 2 speaker set-ups will be happy, but those with advanced surround systems will have some explaining to tell the neighbors.  This DVD is a great test for your system.  A true audiophonic, stereophonic thrill.  OK...enough about the sound...what about the picture?  Well, the picture is also superb, with incredible detail and beautiful deep blacks.  Color saturation is beautiful with deep blues throughout the film.  The transfer is incredibly clean.  Can you believe that I can STILL see the wires suspending Arnolds motorcycle as he jumps into the canal!!?? (Chapter 21, I believe.)  Anyway, the widescreen presentation of T2 is definitely the &quot;ultimate DVD experience.&quot;  **By the way, SLOWLY type in 8-2-9-9-7 in the main menu AFTER you choose &quot;Special Edition&quot;.  This accesses the secret &quot;Extended Special Ediion.&quot;  (different DVD players may require you to press 'enter' after each number, while others may not.)**  OK...let's talk about disc 2 which contains all the supplemental material.  The opening graphic animation is really great.  This animation brings you to the main menu.  The main menu is subdivided into 3 sections....&quot;Information Programs&quot; which has 3 featurettes, &quot;Making of T2&quot;, &quot;T2, More then meets the eye&quot;, and &quot;The making of T2 3D&quot;.  The second section, &quot;Visual Campaigns&quot;, has a &quot;Teaser Trailer&quot;, two &quot;Theatrical Trailers&quot;, and a &quot;T2 Special Edition Trailer&quot;.  The thrid section, The &quot;Data Hub&quot;, has all other supplemental material.  This includes 574 still frames of the final shooting script, original storyboard sequences, a bunch of video sequences including videos of James Cameron, the co-writer, the effects designer, stunt coordinator, interviews with cast and other crew members and a BUNCH of other stuff that will keep you watching until T3 is released!  The &quot;Data Hub&quot; also contains an impressive graphical behind the scenes story of T2, or you can choose a video featurette with behind the scenes footage....both very impressive.  For you PC people, you can also watch the film while reading the script and looking at the storyboards.  You can also link to online T2 websites.  I won't ruin all the surprises of this disc, but I recommend you to experiment with this disc...there are a few other surprises that I won't go into detail about.  In conclusion, I want to applaud everyone involved in the making of this DVD, especially the Creative Supervisor Van Ling.  It is simply one of the BEST DVD's available and gives everyone a reason to own a DVD player.  Much time was spent in producing this package, and it is worth every penny.  Full of surprises, top notch audio and video quality with THX certification, and an attractive outer case too!  This is what all future &quot;ultimate editions&quot; should be compared to, because &quot;Terminator 2-The Ultimate DVD Edition&quot; is why DVD was created.  I recommend this DVD to EVERYONE....especially to those who are DVD fanatics, fans of the Terminator films and/or James Cameron, or you simply want to 'show off' your home entertainment system.  Buy this DVD package and enjoy!	5.0	Terminator 2: The ULTIMATE DVD EXPERIENCE!	2000-10-30	139	122	17

I can't wait for True Lies 2 because Cameron has twice shown himself to be a master of action sequels, first Aliens and then T2.I found myself almost cackling with maniacal glee as stepped through the almost endless selection of options.  This even surpasses The Abyss as the best DVD package I've seen.I'll agree that the &quot;extra-special easter-egg&quot; edition isn't really something to write home about, since the ending 2029 coda was left off for very good reasons.  I do take issue with the earlier reviewer who said that this suggested Cameron needed to be &quot;reined in.&quot;  Cameron himself cut those scenes, just as he was the one who cut both Aliens and The Abyss for length.  Cameron knows the marketplace as well as anyone, but he also knows how to package these director cuts better than anyone.	5.0	A great presenation of a great movie	2001-01-02	1	1	0

This way the consumer can make an informed choice, knowing exactly what they are buying.Production studios must realise fans such as myself are becoming very exhausted and bored with such commercial antics, hence why a majority of us purchase from other countries. if this continues we will loose great faith in companies such as Artisan and end up just waiting this the film is released in a final ultimate box set, even though when you believe it is the final version, an improved set is released...Will Artisan be willing to send a copy of the Extreme edition to all fans that purchased the Ultimate edition free of charge if the consumer has proof of purchase? Only then they may convince me to own the Extreme Edition DVD set.Although Terminator 2 is an all time classic, the attitude to the consumer from produciton studios is dubious and wearing thin, hence 1 star."	1.0	An extravagantly titled but ultimately deficient DVD	2003-06-30	25	17	8

I just played this on my $98 Magnavox Nb530mgx profile 1.1 player, and....""no problemo"".Terminator 2: Skynet Edition, has a notorious reputation for not working on some newer, more expensive, internet capable Blu Ray players. Many have said it'll only work on a profile 2.0 player or that you need a code for a profile 1.0 player. The Nb530mgx is a profile 1.1 player without a internet connection and it booted up and played just fine. No firmware update or code needed. It took a couple minutes to pull up a message stating that it knows I don't have a profile 2.0 that it's not connected to the internet. That I should get one to take advantage of all the features but that it'll load up anyway. It took another minute and filled in 3 triangles on the same screen and I was at the main menu. I went straight to the extended version, pressed play and it started up as normal. I recommend for those that have it or will buy it, just be patient and let it load up. If it did for mine, I don't see why it won't for yours.There's not much I can say about T2 that hasn't been said 1000 times. It's a classic, still holds up very well, one of Arnolds and James Camerons best movies, good effects, good action scenes and so on and so on. It's all true. You can watch it again and again and it's always good.I found the picture quality to be slightly better than the last T2 Blu Ray, which was disappointingly identical to my upconverted T2: Extreme DVD (which is still a very good version). I wasn't expecting a big leap here so that's fine. It's still very clean and close up shots are nicely detailed. It just doesn't pop like newer transfers.It's the audio that really sells this one with a pleasing improvement over the previous version by providing the lossless, 6.1 DTS-HD audio. For those with capable receivers, it's well worth the double dip.T2: Skynet Edition is definitley THE best T2 to get for the audio and video. I'm sure that many will love the extras and internet enabled features as well. For me, I just want to enjoy it in it's best possible audio and video available and I did and know I will continue to in the future. T2 is a fun film and Amazon has frequently offered the Skynet Edition for $11.99 which is an incredible offer. For those interested, go for it. Although there's no guarantee it'll work in your player, for $11.99, it's worth the risk. Highly recommended."	4.0	No Problemo on My Profile 1.1 Player	2009-12-23	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3NQVOK6LNF5KQ	"Philip Kahn ""tigerhawkvok"""	Terminator 2 is arguably Schwarzenegger's most famous role, and the plot by now is fairly well known.  In the original Terminator, Schwarzenegger had been sent back to kill Sarah Connor before she could give birth to her son, John Connor, who would destory SkyNet in the future.  The plan goes awry when Kyle Reese not only sucessfully protects Sarah, but fathers John.  In Terminator 2, SkyNet tries again, this time with Schwarzenegger's Terminator character playing the role of protector.Considering that this film was made in the early 90's, I was astounded by the quality of the transfer.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2XW3V01Q8K7RO	"Platon Murenin ""Platon!"""	Well, the movie itself is spectacular. Effects, acting, directing, all are top notch. So, let's look at the Blu-ray itself.The Sony Blu-ray player that I watched the movie on is not connected to the internet (or, if it matters, never has been connected). So, after I put the disc in, it took a minute or so before it told me that there is no internet connection. From the choices such as 'retry' or 'cancel' I pressed cancel. It took maybe about 5 minutes or so to load the disc. Not a problem, I was there to enjoy the movie and not to accomplish a timed race. After it loaded, all of the menus were fine. It was easy to navigate, no problems whatsoever.There are 3 versions of the movie on the disc. Original theatrical, extended (with, if I remember correctly, extra 15 minutes or so) and the last one is Director's cut, I guess, which, on top of the extended version adds extra 5 minutes or so. That's the one that I chose. Like many wrote here, the CODE IS 82997. The movie played perfectly fine.Quality was absolutely excellent, both audio and video. Amazing restoration! If you are thinking about the DVD, here is the link to a much more specific video/audio/bonus material review - highdefdigest[dot]com and search for this movie.There are plenty of bonus material as well, for none of which you need an internet connection. Bonus material includes:*Audio Commentaries*Deleted Scenes*Theatrical TrailersAlso there are 8! interactive modes, which are played within the movie itself, so, I guess if you want to see/hear all of them you would have to watch movie 8 times. Modes include picture-in-picture storyboards, scripts, trivia, and how its made type of things. Fun to watch. If you really think about it, it's not like you're re-watching the movie over and over again, because each time you are focused mostly on the interactive mode of your choice, instead of the movie. Also, you can skip from one to the next, so you don't have to watch the movie again and again, if you don't want to.For more info about the DVD, such as audio/video quality, special features explanation and more, go to highdefdigest[dot]comLike I said, movies itself (any of the 3 versions), bonus material, and interactive modes DO NOT REQUIRE an internet connection. Also, don't let few minute wait at the beginning to discourage you. Make sure, however, that your Blu-ray player is a Profile 2.0, either by just connecting it to download an update, or doing it from disk, manually.	5.0	Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray]	2010-01-06	4	4	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AYWIO6OYAGFGQ	"pm444 ""pm444"""	"OK, so the movie itself has been around so long that anyone who is considering buying the second Blu-Ray release already knows and loves the film. I held off getting the original Blu-Ray release because of less-than-stellar reviews of the image quality.  This one seems to have taken care of that problem.  I have watched ""T2"" many times on DVD (the ""ultimate"" edition), and the Blu-Ray transfer is definitely superior.  The audio seems about the same to me, but I only have a 5.1 receiver and it doesn't support HDMI, so I can't really take full advantage of the lossless audio.However, I can state without reservation that this Blu-Ray disc has the slowest loading time *by far* of any that I own.  I'm not exaggerating when I say it takes at least a minute or two for the initial load, and then all you get (unless your Blu-Ray player is connected to the internet, which mine it not) is a message from ""Skynet"" that you're not connected to the internet.You're then given the option to ""retry"" or ""cancel"", with no explanation of what to do if all you want is to watch the movie.  If you hit ""cancel"", you wait for a very long time (5 minutes at least) for ""Skynet"" to connect to its ""mainframe"".  I guess they're trying to be cute with all this Skynet stuff, but they fail miserably.If you inadvertently hit ""stop"" on your remote while watching the movie, you get to go through the whole ordeal again.  It's worse than discs that come with multiple previews (*cough cough* Disney), because at least you can skip through those.  This one won't let you go to the top menu, or anything else, until it's ready.  You just sit and wait for it to finish loading.  Granted, I haven't recently upgraded the firmware on my 4-month-old Sony Blu-Ray player, but since the disc plays fine once it has loaded, I don't think this is the issue.Once you get to the main menu, it's clunky, awkward, and slow to respond. You'll think you've made the selection you want, only to discover that the disc can't quite keep up with you.  It's all very annoying and totally unnecessary.  I have many other discs that offer all sorts of enhancements for players that are connected to the internet, and none of them makes you go through all this endless waiting.  Some reviewers here on Amazon have reported that they've given up on the disc, assuming that it would never load, so all I can say is, be patient, it may take 5 or 10 minutes, but don't give up, it may surprise you (or maybe not).So, my final rating is 3 stars for a favorite movie with what's probably the best video transfer we'll ever get, but with this absurdly slow load time and ridiculous menu, I cannot give it the full 5 stars I would have otherwise."	3.0	SLOW to load, and a very annoying menu	2009-05-20	11	8	3

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A22HKEBLKHT9G0	Professional Amateur	"Be warned: The reviews on this page praising the plethora of behind-the-scenes featurettes refer to out-of-print DVD editions, NOT the single-disc Blu-Ray you see on this page.The Skynet Blu-ray contains NONE of the many documentaries and behind-the-scenes features found on previous T2 releases.  For those, you will have to seek out an old standard-definition DVD release.  This Blu-ray contains only the ""Special Edition"" director's cut and two commentary tracks (1993 & 2003).  Besides that, the menus are annoying and painfully slow to load.The picture quality is adequate but substandard for a Blu-ray release, probably owing to excessive grain reduction and the fact that the theatrical aspect ratio was created from a ""soft crop"" of the taller 35mm negative.  Fans of the old DVD and Laserdisc special features recall a one-of-a-kind demonstration of how the pan-and-scan (4:3) home video crop included more vertical picture (but slightly less width) than the theatrical crop.  This was common filming practice during the VHS era.  One would have hoped the Blu-ray transfer to restore the lost height, instead of replacing it with rasterized black bars and 25% wasted resolution (turning 1920x1080 into 1920x816), but no such luck."	1.0	NO SPECIAL FEATURES on Blu-ray edition	2013-11-01	5	5	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3L82W00V1GTKJ	P. Whitlock	A decade after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) destroyed the original Terminator, a second unstoppable killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the post-apocalyptic year 2029. But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000. One of the most popular films of the 1990s, James Cameron's action masterpiece is both a thoughtful look at violence in human nature and an exciting, nonstop thrill ride.	5.0	Great Movie	2004-10-24	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3FOSBM4MMUFER	Randal J. Batty	"Every cast member was great in this sequel to ""Terminator.""  In my humble opinion, Linda Hamilton provided an Oscar-worthy performance of a highly distraught/borderline insane protector of her son.  Her transformation from ""Terminator"" to ""T2"" was amazing and displayed the range of Hamilton's acting ability.  Though Arnold certainly provides the gravitas, Hamilton provides the fragile consciousness of a human being besieged by a horrific reality and destiny.  Kudos too for Edward Furlong for portraying an inescapably repressed yet resourceful teenager.  I was stupefied and angry that Hamilton and Furlong were dumped for T3.I'm a Christian Bale fan, but I was disappointed that he totally ignored Furlong's early sculpture of the eventual resistance-fighter John Conner.  A bit of continuity would have helped the franchise.  It's a pity that James Cameron let this fascinating drama slip out of his hands.  He dumped Linda Hamilton and everything connected with ""Terminator.""  The same thing happened after he directed ""Aliens.""  I don't know the Hollywood politics behind any of this, but I can't help but view Cameron as a fair-weather friend.  His success with ""Avatar"" is deserved but the drama of the flick is not up to the caliber of ""Terminator"" or ""Aliens.""So, now, Linda Hamilton has seemingly disappeared from major theatrical releases.  Whatever the particulars, I can't help but feel sorry for her, as she turned in a stunning performance with ""T2.""  Maybe there will be a place for her in the next ""Hellboy"" movie.

There was very little wrong with this ground breaking movie.  The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is due to John Connor.  As in 1991 when the movie came out, I just couldn't stand his character.  When he wasn't crying he was being a petulant puerile teenager.  Now, I know that that was the intent, but boy he made me sick.  Honestly, that says a lot.  For as much as he irked me I still absolutely loved this movie.  Even watching it yesterday through the sophisticated eyes of over 20 years of CGI advancement, T2 still holds its own.  I remember when this movie was cutting edge and ahead of its time.  T2 took movies into a new direction much like Star Wars did 14 years before it.  CGI is now an integral and necessary part of movie making and T2 really kicked that off.

Some will not like this but it does not look like plastic as is the case when too much noise reduction is used and to my eye it brings out more clarity and fine detail. Blacks are ok but can be on the grey side and a bit too bright.Sound is great with the DTS-HD MA 6.1 lossless track. Only negative I can hear is that some sounds are in the wrong location in the sound field.The extras are a bit underwhelming and mostly recycled.

I'm pretty sure the PS3 is not on it's way out as all other discs I have played recently work fine.

Both are sequels that significantly up the special effects ante, along with the body count, and both feature two of the movies most dynamic kick-[...] heroines, Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton"" in the former and Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the latter.Besides doubling the action of the first, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" also doubles the cyborg quotient by returning Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role that he was born to play (this time as a ""good"" cyborg) and bringing in a more than equal combatant/foe in the from of the Robert Patrick as an ""upgraded"" model.  The movie adds an element of surprise in the form of the much smaller (and less developed) Patrick as a superior model to Arnold's character, able to best the strongman in many a scene.The movie also brings back Earl Boen in an expanded role as the befuddled ""Dr. Silberman.""  He brings needed comic relief in a film that is short on words but long on action sequences.James Cameron may have felt on ""top of the world"" a decade later with his Oscar-winning ""Titanic"" but it is for the first two ""Terminator"" films that he probably made his greatest cinematic impact."	5.0	"Owes just as much to ""Aliens"" as it does its predecessor"	2007-06-16	2	2	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A39W3263A9HCMN	"Renfield ""Up the Irons"""	"I seriously am considering lowering the rating right now, but ah what the hell.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I was excited about buying this release because it was great to finally have T2 on Blu-Ray. At HMV, I found two Blu-Ray editions- the original Blu-Ray release and this. With this having more extras and having a better transfers (according to source), I picked this one up.I popped in the disc, expecting it to be like what others had bitched about, and it worked perfectly. I have an LG BDP300. So anyways, after 30 seconds of a blank screen, I get this message saying that Skynet ""does not recognize the network connection"". I chose ""cancel"", knowing my Blu-Ray player does not connect to the internet. Then during the loading screen (which lasted for at least a minute), it said that there was no connection and that it would load with a full menu.It really pisses me off that they'd do this. All I ask is just for a proper release and not try to be all cool with this ""skynet"" stuff. I mean, if anything I bought it for the fact that it was the movie in Blu-Ray, and that'd be effing awesome.The menu, whilst looking cool, is slow, clunky, and almost not responsive. You'd select something, and then it would take 10 seconds to show. I thought it was just my player, but no, other reviewers are saying the same thing. The popup menu is no different.By the way, if anyone's wondering, yes I did figure out the password to watch the director's cut (another fail- WHY do we have to put in some stupid password just to watch the clearly superior cut of the film?). Those who are wondering, it's 82997.When you start playing either version of the movie, you get the Lionsgate splash screen which you can NOT skip, the DTS HD Audio screen, the THX screen, then the StudioCanal screen which you also cannot skip. This is annoying, I just wanna see the movie, mmmkay???The picture looks great, and was worth the purchase alone. This is probably the best transfer of T2 we'll ever get. The sound is explosive too- if there's such thing as an eargasm, then fast forward to the finale in the steel mill and you'll have one. It has to be heard. The director's cut is well restored here. Nothing has been tampered with, as well as they added in an extra set of credits showing credit for the Director's cut.The extras were fun too. I loved the in-movie experience, as well as all the games and gizmos, especially the Picture-in-Picture feature. Just excellent. There's lots of commentaries, including the one with 26 cast members- that one is fun, hilarious, and cool. But that said, why do I even need to connect the thing to the damn internet just to be able to access some special features?So if you want extras, and a good transfer, I guess buy this release. But wait until Lionsgate corrects this release, which hopefully they do. If it just so happens they do, I'll upgrade for sure, but right now, I'm scratching my head over this clunky and unorganized mess of a Blu-Ray release. I guess I'll keep it for now thought, because this is a movie I can watch again and again."	3.0	I'll be back... when Lionsgate corrects this release	2009-06-02	26	20	6

The second disc of this 2 dvd set is recorded in encrypted Microsoft Windows Media 9 format. I purchased it based on my very favorable experience with ""Coral Reef Adventure"" (also on dual dvd and WM9 Hi-Def dvd formats).For those not familiar with the WM9 Hi-Def format, it will only playback on a Windows XP computer with the latest version of Windows Media 9 installed. Furthermore, the disc will insist on installing the InterActual DVD Player, version 2.0. This, would be OK, in my opinion, were it not for the fact that: (1) the installation of the player requires an update, which, in turn, requires that IE6 be your default browser; if not, you get into an endless loop trying to install the update from a non-windows browser like Mozilla Firefox or Opera; and (2) unless you are under 13 year of age, the InterActual player insists on collecting ""annonymous"" demograpic info every time you play this ""hi-def"" version of the film. It also insists on the user providing his correct email address, zipcode, sex and age! Of course, you could provide misinformation here. Having paid good money for this 2 disc set, I see no justification, at all, for any form of snooping on my viewing habits - annonymous or not. Nor do I see why I should be forced to provide info about myself. If this doesn't change ASAP, this will be the last time I buy any Microsoft Hi-Def movie disc.The WM9 Hi-Def version of this film is only minimally better than the standard dvd version on disc 1. On a good playback system using a decent progressive dvd player with component output to a good plasma or CRT monitor, I think the standard dvd displays about 98% of what you see on the so called ""Hi-Def"" version on disc 2, and you don't have to jump through hoops to install it and be annoyed by unwelcomed snooping of your viewing habits. Interestingly, another hi-def flick using WM9 called ""Coral Reef Adventure"" doesn't have any of the drawbacks of T2, and is an awesome hi-def experience at either 720P or 1080P. ""Coral Reef Adventure"" is very highly recommend and does not require installation of the InterActual Player. Also, Coral Reef Adventure will show you what a difference there is between the standard 480i dvd version and the 720P/1080P Hi-Def version - provided you have the right equipment(for 720P you will need a 2.4 GHz cpu; 4x AGP video card and monitor that can display 1280x720. For 1080P, you'll need a 3.0+ GHZ cpu; 8x AGP video card and monitor than can display 1920x1080.As for T2 - Extreme Edition, if you must have this version, skip disc 2 and watch disc 1 only, better yet, buy T2-Ultimate Edition instead.I give disc 1 - 4 stars for the film and display quality.I give disc 2 - 2 stars because of the difficulty created by Microsoft's Draconian installation and the InterActual Player's unappreciated demand for any form of user personal information and ""annonymous"" demographic snooping."	3.0	T2 High Def Windows Media 9 version a Bust	2004-03-17	5	3	2

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2FOXCU3B53TCW	R. Kennedy	"The T2 Extreme edition bonus disc has the theatrical version of the film encoded in High Definition (HD) using the windows media series 9 codec.  This encoding looks brilliant and is far superior to the normal DVD on direct comparison.  It must be played by a Windows computer and requirtes a 500K patch for windows media 10 users.Unfortunately,it also requires you use the included InterActual DVD player to play the protected content.  That DVD player sucks, but is usable. My problem with it is it would exit out of full screen if I tried to use my KVM, so I had to put down the mouse to watch the movie. Another small issue is that, due to the DVD format, the movie was broken into 2GB segments (4 in all) and there was a 3 - 10 second delay whenever it loaded a new segment.  No big deal.The encoding looks brilliant on my 1280 x 1024 flat panel monitor (presumably 720p) but it appears as though the encoding is even higher, perhaps 1080.  It played relatively stutter-free on my 2.4ghz Dell desktop w/ 512MB RAM and an NVIDIA 5700 fx ultra 128MB video card.  I should note that I couldn't get interactual to install on my other computer (and was therefore unable to watch the content on that computer) due to it's inability to ""initialize the audio subsystem.""  I didn't particularly troubleshoot this though.So, for those of you out there that are sick of waiting for HD to get out of the realm of only broadcast TV (where it's not available to so many) and simply can't wait for the HD DVD to be accepted, manufactured and flooded with re-releases, then WMVHD (Windows Media Version High Definition) is for you.  There are ~10 titles out in the format now and they can be previewed at wmvhd.com.  Most of them are IMAX films.I want more releases on WMV! I'm addicted to HD and can't get it anywhere yet!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3SAT2IAWSKSTN	R. Mann	"Well I am not going to review the movie because you probably already know how great it is. Instead I will just speak for this edition of the movie- The Ultimate Edition DVD. Whether you get the dual disc set or the dual sided single disc set makes no difference since the same content is on each pressing.Ok now for the technical stuff. This is the best edition of the movie to own for several reasons:1.) DTS! Forget Dolby Digital, there is a night and day difference when you watch a movie in DTS and this is a fine example of what a film should sound like. DTS makes much better use of the center and surround speakers. The Dolby version just drowns them all together. Also the Extreme edition does not have the DTS track, only the Ultimate.2.) You get all three versions of the film on one disc! Theatrical, Special and the Extended Special version. The third version was cut from the Extreme edition (probably due to inconsistency with T3 being released that same summer) and the Theatrical can only be seen in HDTV via a super fast computer on the Extreme edition. With the Ultimate edition you get it all without the need of fancy super expensive computers and a small screen.3.) Extras! There are so many extras on the second disc I can almost promise that if you were sick, you could sit in front of your TV and by the time you finish watching all the bonus material that you will be over your cold/flu/fever lol. Those of you with ""The Abyss"" (white box) know what I'm talking about.4.) Last but not least is the neat metal case cover this Ultimate ed comes in. It is aluminum; I repeat aluminum not tin like the Extreme edition's (which had a tendency to rip the case's spine and artwork). Aluminum is more expensive than paper so granted they only made the first production with the aluminum, but they can still be found. I would be perfectly happy with the paper case cover, after all you are mainly concerned about the movie right- not the case cover lol.So there you have it, several reasons why the Ultimate edition is the best version of the movie to have on DVD. To play the Extended Special version, you will need to enter a code for the Easter egg to work. This is very easy, with the timeline menu up and running, click on the special edition choice. Then with ""play special edition"" highlighted, enter 82997 (August 29, 1997 for J-Day) somewhat quickly and you will hear a sound effect while the other eye of the Terminator T800 lights up and now you will see a third menu at the top saying ""play extended special edition"". Now both eyes of the T800 are light up and at the right in yellow you will see ""THE FUTURE IS NOT SET"" and that's it. There are a few Easter eggs on the bonus disc as well. You can search Yahoo or Google to find those. Enjoy.Since Amazon sometimes mixes up the different editions of the same movie, I will mention a little about the Extreme version. It says is is from a brand new film transfer, but comparing my girlfriend's Extreme ed. to my Ultimate ed. I could tell no difference. Also the Extreme is very lacking in the extras department. However the HighDefinition (disc 2) is really neat and a big difference in quality over the normal 480i version. But it just takes a fast computer and a good display to reap the benefit Artisan and Van Ling wanted to provide you."	5.0	T2 Ultimate- most value packed dvd ever	2005-12-14	6	5	1

While all the top reviews refer to the Ultimate Edition with all the special features and bells/whistles, unfortunately that version does not exist on Blu-Ray yet.  What you get is a Blu-Ray version of the theatrical release, and that's it, no extras, no branching director's cut -- hasta la vista, baby.Why Amazon continues to mix reviews from completely different products on the same page is beyond me, especially once people start writing reviews about the actual edition being sold.  Why not link to the reviews to avoid confusion?  It's my fault for not looking at the note underneath the review titles this time, but it's an honest (albeit noobish) mistake and I'm sure it happens frequently.Still, for under $12 it's not a bad deal, and luckily I already haveTerminator 2 - Judgment Day (The Ultimate Edition DVD)on DVD (which I highly recommend to any hardcore FX movie fan or film student for its extensive behind-the-scenes footage and dual versions of the film).

Once inside he eventually corners Sarah and John.Sarah empties her shotgun into Patrick,but runs out before she can execute the coup de gras.Ah-nold appears just in time to save the day sending Patrick into a tank of molten steel,in which he disintegrates.Ah-nold is the last remnant of future technology left,and he asks Sarah to lower him into the tank so he can be destroyed.The film ends as Sarah ruminates on a better future for mankind.Filled with then,state of the art CGI and morphing techniques,Terminator 2 still stands out as an excellent film today.Cameron does a nice job at the start of fooling us all into thinking Ah-nold is the bad guy once again.The film flows nicely and again there are few moments to rest in this film.The only moments of such that come to mind are their trek to Mexico,where they regroup before the movies finale.Other than that it is go,go,go.Patrick's character brings the threat level a notch higher than even the first movie.His model of terminator is that much better than Ah-nolds and his liquid metal composition makes for an almost indestructible opponent.The Sarah character has become that much stronger emotionally and physically,as she has prepared both herself and her son for the inevitable battle ahead.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and in this extreme edition,is clear and crisp.This two disc single sided collection has disc one offering up the 152 minute extreme version and it's a great version at that.The outer dust jacket that can be slid off,tells you that these DVDs contain""multiple""versions;as in more than just two,but two are all you get.And to get the original theatrical version,which is on disc two,you have to play it in your computer and have a system with Win/XP and lower to run it,with an internet connection.Extras on the first disc have commentary and the film is THX optimized.The second disc has,along with the other film version,a couple of featurettes and some other computer spawned specials.All in all Cameron actually topped the first Terminator with this one.The S/FX were far and away that much better.The story just keeps rolling along as the trio of Ah-nold,Sarah and young John try to outrun the seemingly indestructible Patrick;who just never stops coming.4- 4 1/2 stars."	4.0	"""Hasta la vista, baby"""	2012-11-20	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	&quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot; is one of the great entertainments. First released in 1991, it still feels as fresh and new today as it did back then. Director James Cameron (Titanic) presents a stylish, spectacular yet intelligent action piece that also has some of the best special effects ever conceived for a motion picture. The screenplay is intricate, the characters entertaining and interesting, and there is a lot of style in the photography and camera work. The performances are also superb, especially Linda Hamilton's. The film's technical credits are so immpecable that even today I've seen few films that match it.  The action sequences are fantastic and incredible. The T-1000 is still probably the best film villain of the last decade. This is a pulse-pounding, bone-crunching, sometimes visceral action picture that raises the bar for filmmakers of the action, special-effects genre. I think only Michael Bay has recently produced anything that can compete with James Cameron's second best film after his masterpiece, &quot;Titanic.&quot; &quot;Terminator 2&quot; is a great entertainer.	5.0	Excellent Action Picture.	2001-03-15	1	1	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3S175V6UMWDSU	Robert	"TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY1991 / 137 min. / Rated R.Synopsis: The cyborg who once tried to kill Sarah Connor must now protect her son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), from an even more powerful and advanced cyborg.After The Terminator earned nearly $80 million at the worldwide box office, and did killer business on home video, a $102 million-budgeted sequel by writer-director James Cameron was unleashed less than 7 years later. For me, T2 was my first exposure to the Terminator franchise. I was dragged along to see it opening night with my sister and brother-in-law. The spectacle of the film certainly blew me away at the time. After seeing the movie, I obviously went and rented the first, and since then, I had eagerly awaited a third film - but let me not get too far ahead of myself here.By the time Terminator 2 rolled around, Arnold was already a big star. He was coming off such hit films like Predator, Kindergarten Cop, and Total Recall, so in hindsight it's not too surprising that his return would amount to him being transformed into the good guy but that he'd also receive much more dialogue. Beyond that, Arnold's new look of black leather and sunglasses are just classic. As it should be, he is the highlight of the movie. The bad Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), is visually impressive (especially for its time), and the action is first rate, as is its CGI effects. The latter, handled by Industrial, Light & Magic, is perhaps the most famous and groundbreaking element from T2. We do, however, get more classic lines from Arnold - most notably, ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" - and we get a better performance this time around out of Linda Hamilton.The dark and gritty tone of the first film is replaced, however, with a much sleeker and polished blockbuster feel. It certainly has an overload of some snazzy death-defying action sequences, some witty humor and even by the conclusion, you get a little sentimentality thrown in for good measure.Critically speaking, the biggest issues I have with the film is that it does get a bit too heavy handed, it has inconsistent pacing (it needed more tightening) and admittedly, Edward Furlong is a bit on the whiny side. Nonetheless, T2 starts off exceptionally well, loses its footing at the midway point and recovers for a satisfying conclusion. It's an entertaining enough follow-up and it's undoubtedly one of the most influential films of the past 20 years. The film did manage to achieve a worldwide gross of $519 million in 1991 which to put into perspective for you, only Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and E.T. had grossed more at that time. T2 would be nominated for 6 Oscars, winning for sound, make-up, visual and sound effects.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"A strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a figure in a sphere of energy... It is the figure of a naked man... 'Terminator' has come through... He stands, and impassively surveys its surroundings...His physique is massive and perfect... His face devoid of emotion... He's not here to kill Sara Connor... His mission now is to protect the future savior of mankind, her son John... Thirty years from now, Terminator was reprogrammed to be John Connor's protector here, in this time... Terminator would never leave him... Terminator would never hurt him... Terminator would die to defend him against any danger...But Skynet, the computer which controlled the Machines, sent an advanced prototype back through time, to destroy the leader of the human Resistance, little John...T-1000 is very menacing... His features are handsome bordering on severe... Its face is simple, unformed... His eyes are gray ice, penetrating... He is certainly not built like Terminator with complex hydraulics and cables... He is human-shaped but far from human...Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the super-hero... He never threatens, that's a human thing! He just takes... He can jerk any knife out without slowing a stride... His hand blurs out like a striking cobra...We watch him smashing the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand... And when the bullets rake his chest, he doesn't even draw back... We observe him in slow motion how he fights for control, how he jumps his bike, sweeps a street kid off his machine with one arm and swings him in front of him...Robert Patrick is a super-villain, a perfect chameleon... He can change shape and color... He can imitate anything it touches, anything it samples by physical contact, any object of equal size...He is a 'killing machine' with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society... He looks and acts exactly like a 'cop' but with quite a few surprises... His arms and fingers can be turned smoothly into something else... He spins at a sound... His blow is lighting fast... He pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol... He is cool, alert, confident in his power... His expression emotionless and judgmental...Linda Hamilton is not a mission priority... She is the same woman we remember from last time... Her body is straight and taut... Her arms are lean and muscular... Her eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered animal... Her voice is a low and chilling monotone... Her expression cold and impassive... She is defiant and intense... She looks hard...Hamilton seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.. She draws her knife from its belt sheath, and idly starts to carve something on the table top, the letter ""N."" Something changes in her eyes... Her face is an impassive mask... We see the forces at war behind her eyes... She has become a 'Terminator,' intending to change the future somehow...Edward Furlong is young John Connor... He is a ten-year tough delinquent, targeted for termination... He has short yellowish hair and a sullen mouth... His eyes reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel... His interactions with his 'protector' give the movie effective moments of psychological depth...He reluctantly shows his friend a shot of his mother, pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border... John doesn't know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years, and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in time to become his father...Joe Morton is Miles Dyson, the star of the Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation... He is a man in a hurry, a man with much to do... He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.. In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor... He can be the man most directly responsible for 3 billion deaths on August 29th, 1997... The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day, will live only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines...His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching terror... This is a man ripped out of normal life into a grim world... He looks up, through his pain and incomprehension, and asks himself: Why is this nightmare happening?The level of violence in Cameron's film is pretty intense... The special effects are outstanding... They look realistic... The action scenes are amazing, very well executed... James Cameron tries to provide a message of peace... The music score is almost perfect... The plot is intriguing... The motion picture features excellent performances...'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is a blazing big-budget sci-fi thriller, very creative, to be entirely experienced...

You have specials, interviews, never seen before scenes (this is really cool), and many other things.... BUT.. you don't have subtitles in other languages, and in my case (I live in Peru) it's crucial, because my family can't watch a movie in pure english.Other aspect I dislike is the single layer disc... but I think by the time the DVD was made, double layer technology didn't exist.But I don't regret I bought this DVD, the special edition with all the new scenes is just great... I wonder how could they cut the scene when Arnold gets his head open.As 99% of people who read this reviews are from english-speakers countries, don't hessitate buying this title, it rocks.	5.0	Excellent version... but lacks something	2000-12-26	3	3	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AS5UW6H9UPTJX	"Robert Salmon ""Tinderbox"""	The first thing you see when you open the case is a notice from THX  warning that some DVD players may experience &quot;navigational  difficulties&quot;... their code phrase for saying that they shipped buggy  software.  That's a bad sign, and the notice is accurate because the extra  documentary materials relating to the making of the film would not work at  all on my player.I was very disappointed, because the making-of  segments were why I paid extra for this fancier edition.  Seems they must  have been on a deadline and rushed out a faulty product.  That's a shame,  because what is there that DOES work is very well done, and of course the  film itself, both versions, looks great on DVD.So beware, especially if  you don't have a recently-made player.  Unfortunately, there is no mention  of this problem on the outside of the package, or any listing of player  brands that their disc isn't compatible with.  To make sure, you could go  to a store that sells both DVDs and players, then try out this  &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; disc on the same model player that you own at  home.  It's an expensive disc, and there's no reason to spend the extra  cash if the features won't work for you.NOTE that this is only a problem  with some of the supplemental materials and not the two included versions  of the film itself, which play normally.	3.0	The extra features WILL NOT play on certain DVD players.	2000-09-04	0	0	0

I loved the high definition transfer, the clarity really holds up well even the special effects while dated by today's standards held up well especially in high definition.  The biggest reason I picked this up was due to the pricing, for a blu-ray with all of these features and at a low price, especially for a movie I'd consider to be a classic, it's hard to resist.  One note to warn some people, older blu-ray players without much internal memory may prevent you from loading all of the features, and some features do require internet connection, but there is enough content on the blu-ray that you won't feel as though you are missing too much.Pros:* High Definition* Low Price* Great features, behind-the-scenes, and very well done menus with great animationCons:* Some content requires internet connection and/or internal memory on your blu-ray player.	5.0	T2 - the way it was meant to be seen	2012-04-10	3	2	1

The picture and sound are great, and you can choose between the theatrical and extended special editions, as well as a third cut that has two more deleted scenes (including a different happy ending) if you enter a code (82997) in the menu.Where this edition fails is with the special features. The packaging advertises 8 hours of features, but it's a complete lie. Those features are not on the disc, they're on the internet. If your player isn't connected to the internet, you'll never see them. From reading other reviews, however, it seems that disconnecting your player from the internet does give you a better experience with this Bluray, because it prevents the painfully long loading process as ""Skynet"" takes control of your player.Despite the low cost of this edition, if another Bluray edition is available with the extended cut of the film and with special features actually on-disc and in the box, then that other edition would be the version I recommend."	4.0	"The ""Skynet"" Edition is weak"	2012-08-16	5	5	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3ARJ16772TKHT	"Ryan D. Peterson ""Garlonuss"""	This is one of the rare sequels that not only lives up to but surpasses the original. The music and effects have been ramped up a notch, and the pacing is perfect for the story they are telling here. More importantly, however, the interaction between the characters is just perfectly done and the story has some very deep overtones. The idea of taking your destiny into your own hands is portrayed here excellently.Speaking more of the minutia of the movie, the role reversal done with Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator character is a wonderful touch. The idea of a villain reformed is great. Plus the fact that this machine spends much of the movie learning what exactly it is to be human. One particular line at the end is delivered very simply but very poignantly: I know now why you cry, but it is something I can never do.This movie is the rare one that is effectively action-packed, spectacular, poignant, touching and insightful.	5.0	T2: No Sophomore Slump	2008-06-17	0	0	0

More interesting to me is the transfer quality of the movie itself.  I bought the original T2 on bluray when it came out and loved how it looked and sounded.  I bought this one for the extra features and extended edition.  I knew it was supposed to be remastered for audio and video, but honestly I wasnt expecting much, I mean bluray is bluray right?  Wow, I didnt know I could be so wrong.  Obviously I knew different movies could have different quality, but I was shocked at how much better this one was.  I just put it in to watch last night and I was blown away.  Usually I get pretty mad at a studio releasing a dozen versions of a movie over and over, but Im glad this one came out.

Example, you get OVER 20 ""making of"" or ""behind the scenes"" The DVD has ALMOST every feature except camera angles. It has 3 versions of T2 on it (one is hidden. (...) ). Besides that let's look at my review:TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAYT2 is a classic! Ask anyone. The movie starts out about John Conners when he is 13 years old. (...) He meets up with the T-1000. A newer and better robot than T100. Don't worry, T100 is back! He is now here to protect John from the T1000 because jhe failed to kill Sarah Conners from the first film. Sarah is in a mental home because no one believes her about Terminator. They think she's another looney. So she's locked up for quite some time. The doctors said if she gets better she can see John again-They lied. With help from T100 she escapes the ""cook"" house and feels funny because T100 is nicer then from 1984. Finally, you find out about the company who made the Terminators. And it becomes a bloody battle between good and bad! What great viewing for all of the family.

Well anyway enough about that, this was James Camron's best film so far.(He coulda made Terminator 3 everything it shoulda been, but NOO he and Linda Hamilton go there seprete ways and he won't direct it.  He still coulda directed it tho!)Special Effects are crazy, and high budget material.  Seeing a man made of liquid metal, go through things, regenerate, and get holes in him every time he got shot, is pretty freakin' amazing.  I mean the special effects were something thats still looks good today, even after 14 years.Arnold being the good guy was just like whoa, ok this isn't what I was expecting, I was expecting for him to get payback, but hey beggers can't be chosers, but T-1000 was just the perfect machine, 800X better than the terminatrix in Terminator 3 which was composed of liquid metal and machinery.  That's retarted.  Liquid Metal is nealy invincable, but with macheniery inside it can easily be destroyed.  I gotta stop, cuz this is not a review for Terminator 3.  Anyway, Robert Patrick's performance was great, but it would have been cool to see Sylvester Stallone as him.  2 terminators, 2 of hollywoods bigest macho actors Jam packed in 1 freakin' movie.This movie surpasses the 1st in just so many ways, it's almost a perfect improvment!  Anyone interested in Sci-Fi had to have sceene this.  Anyone who usally hates dissapointing sequals ex. Matrix Reloaded, this will nearly make you forget about the first one.Peace	5.0	The hunter is now the hunted	2005-01-18	3	3	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AI5EIS34J73QB	Sam	"I played the T2 Skynet version on my Sony BDB-500 (no Internet connection and no memory stick) as my BDB-550 is out for repairs.  I haven't updated the firmware in a long time.  When the disk loaded, it displayed a message saying that I had firmware 1.1 and wouldn't be able to access the special features.  As I only wanted to watch the movie, I couldn't have cared less.What really annoyed me was having to find the stupid access code (821997) on the Internet. The kids who thought of this are just way too cool for me.Having gone from VHS to DVD to finally Blu-Ray - Skynet edition, this disk blew me away.  The audio/video quality is fantastic which can be best appreciated with a good receiver and speakers.  We have 4 massive tower speakers and a very large center speaker.  We also upgraded to a Sony 52"" HDTV so the picture is like being in a movie theater (proportionally speaking).I was anticipating more sound from the rear-speakers but I wouldn't downgrade the review from 5 to 4 stars over that.The image is crystal clear like a newly released movie.  Although the sound was a bit dull in a few scenes (e.g. the fight between the terminators in the factory towards the end of the film), I was extremely impressed.If you have a mediocre A/V setup, you might not be able to fully appreciate the enormous improvement over the DVD version."	5.0	Fantastic audio/video quality.

Despite what it says on the menu, it is not the plain special edition. It actually includes all the possible deleted escenes they ever took out (t-1000 scanning john's room and the alternative ending are accesible via watching the movie on ""interactive mode"").And some people are saying that the only way to see the theatrical version is by playing the disc on your computer's DVD-ROM, on windows media 9 series. Well, that is not true. You can watch the theatrical version on your normal DVD player. Just highlight (red) ""sensory control"", then on your remote control press the ""right"" button 5 times.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	Watch this movie if you want to live.Terminator 2 is a great sequel!  John Connor is a little punk with a juvey record with the LAPD.  His foster parents aren't much better.  While he is taking joy rides and robbing ATMs, two Terminators arrive from the future.  One, the Arnold Schwarzenegger model, is there to protect John from the second one, the T-1000, made of liquid metal and can form any shape.The movie is mostly chase scene, really.  The unreal truck scene where this huge rig is flying off a bridge into the LA sewers.  Lots of car accidents ensue as John Connor dodges him.The scenes where people get terminated are especially gruesome:  John's foster father gets sliced through the head while drinking from a milk carton.  Not a pretty sight.  Or when a security guard says it's his lucky day before getting skewered in the eyeball.  Yuk.It does not take Sarah Connor long to learn that the Arnold model is her pal, as they ride through the streets of LA being chased by the T-1000.Family scenes are a bit intense as well:  After John gets his mom out, thinking he just saved her life, she yells at him how stupid he was for doing that and that he's much more important than she is.  *sniff*Another cool scene when they take the CPU out of Arnold's head.  She wants to smash it!  John says no, and 'if I'm supposed to be this great military leader, why not listen to some of my ideas once in a while?'  The dialogue is pretty good, though chain smoker Linda Hamilton does go a bit splooie sometimes -- probably due to her stay at the spin bin.Funny scenes:  John trying to teach Arnold to lighten up!  Hasta La Vista, Baby.  And how about that snake farm?Chilling scenes:  Children playing in a playground laughing just before a nuclear fireball.And of course the search for Dyson, the inventor of the cyber chip that starts Skynet (which he also got from the pieces of Terminator from film no. 1).The film is full of action and suspense, some humorous interludes and overall a fun, occasionally gory, sci-fi film.Highly recommended.	5.0	Watch If You Want to Live!	2010-05-23	4	3	1

As far as Blue-ray goes, the Skynet edition certainly meets my expectations. The first movie (on Blue-ray) is slightly improved over the DVD release due to the age of the original source, but this version of T2 is what I expect of a high-def transfer to be. The picture of this transfer is clear with multiple versions of the film and  several special features included, this is the version to go with for a complete high-def experience.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AONNVIQXNOUGG	Sean Devlin	Whem i think of sci-fi i usually think of good effects (The Fifth Element), decent actors (Kurt Russell, Stargate) and an odd story (The Fifth Element, Stargate). But T2 does the unthinkable by using all 3 of these qualities and blending them almost perfectly. And its a sequel (whats next? a good Burt Reynolds film!).Of course the effects are a littlke out of date by now and the stories been copied a thousand times (The Sherminator - Amnerican Pie for gods sake!)but the sheer class will never be redone.Arnauld stays off the &quot;Sarah Conner?&quot; lines and even comes off life-like - pity hes playing a machine. Kudos to James Cameron for making this a more memorable affair than the originalk;although not as hard-hitting.Any bad points? Not enough of Jason Patric's liquid metal effect and no character that measures up to Michael Biehns Kyle Reese of the original.As you can see, the good points outway the bad and make this one of the best sci-fi ever. But can an extreme edition DVD (coming soon)retain the top sci-fi DVD place from The Matrix Revisted edition?Buy either edition, there baisacally the same.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day is as close to a perfect sci-fi adventure as you can get and is easily the best in the series thus far.  For these two reasons, I give this product 5-Stars.  Unfortunately, the price tag for this collection is grossly out of proportion to the age of the film, and the fact America is in a recession.  No single film, despite cool packaging, is worth over $50.00.  Period.  My advice is to hold off buying this blu-ray edition of T2 until retailers mark it down considerably.	5.0	Great Movie, Greatly Overpriced	2009-02-28	26	6	20

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A275NAX5OLEU3L	Sello	In this much anticipated sequel I think most people wondered how the bad guy could end up being the good guy. The clever plot gets around this quandary. The special effects for its time were superb. The flashback scenes were a tad overdone in my opinion but may have been deemed necessary by the scriptwriters to fill out the plot. Hasta la Vista Baby became part of our vocabulary in large part because of Arnold's delivery of the phrase. The first time I saw it I was blown away by the flowing metal special effects of the &#34;new&#34; terminator. Apparently I wasn't the only one since several the concept was quickly cloned even in the world of advertising.On second viewing Judgment Day still packs quite a punch.	5.0	Arnold Shines in this Sequel	2014-05-31	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1R6347DZ96NK1	Shadi Mirza	You know, if more people took DVD making as seriously as James Cameron does on this DVD, it would probably make me a lot more excited about the potential of the medium.  Most DVDs in recent release have had little to no extra content.  But I digress.T2: Ultimate Edition is exactly that. This is the absolute perfect release that fans of this fantastic movie have been waiting for. I'm pretty sure the extra features on this disc reach near four hours, and all of it is interesting.The best thing about the disc is that you can watch the movie in two very distinct (and one rather similiar) ways.  The first choice is to watch the DVD without the deleted scenes reinserted. This is okay for purists who liked the original cut, but it [stinks] in my opinion.  The deleted scenes are all integral in understanding what the original version of the movie was supposed to be.  There are quite a few brilliant scenes that will have you angered when you realize how good they are.I can't ruin anything for you guys. The content on these discs has to be scene to be believed.  It is simply amazing, and the perfect testament to one of the most important (SFX wise) movies ever released.  A groundbreaking movie, and a groundbreaking DVD.	5.0	Sweet merciful lord.

You can also watch the behind the scene of the specific scenes while you are watching the movie by pressing Enter when a Cyberdone logo appears. Disc two contains some features just for your fun and two new documantaries and the theatrical version of film in high definition which I wasn't able to play it, Because it requires a powerful PC. Note that one of the requirements is a 3GHZ processor. And it has an amazing metal case which distinguishes this DVD from all the DVDs you have ever bought.Don't ever think that you don't need it if you have the Ultimate Edition. You should have both of these DVDs. And I don't know how much longer we should wait to see a new release of T2!!!!!	5.0	Extremely Great	2003-06-30	0	0	0

The hi-def transfer is inferior to most, and no effort was made to create the usual smooth-navigating Blu-ray menus.  The disc navigates like a standard DVD, with pauses in between menus and the same minimalist set-up.  If you own the DVD, it is not worth $10 (or more) to add this Blu-ray disc to your collection.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A297HOYHX10FOD	"S. Harris ""Steve Harris"""	During the early 1990s when Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released on video and when I first seen it I was intrigued on how they went about making the movie tell more of the story where the first movie had left off.  There is one thing that I heard some people say is that James Cameron tried making this a family film and I have to say that no family film would go about having a 'R' rating.  Not only that what family film would have such language as the 'F' word in it, and I wonder what those people are thinking.  If there's anything I can say is if there is any in here that shows it as one I want to know, but it may have borrowed lightly of those kind of movies cause of John Connor only being a child in the movie.  Although in the last movie there was only one terminator sent back, this time two of them are sent back, take a guess which one is on what side.While I grew up watching the theatrical edition of the movie, after picking up this version on DVD I was surprised that I got a copy of the movie with 16 minutes more of movie and wondered what kind of extra footage was restored back into it.  Some of the extra footage did help me better understand some points of the movie so I can see how some decisions of the movie came about as it got to that point in the movie.  The bonus features of the film, also helped me understand how they went about it as it took on the use of CG which at the time wasn't all that big at the time of the making of Terminator 2.  Overall I give it 5 stars out of 5.	5.0	There is no fate but what we make for ourselves	2011-02-24	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	In the first Terminator, Schwarzenegger comes back in time as a cybernetic killing machine bent on killing Linda Hamilton who unknowingly will have a  child that will grow up to conquer the technological human inventions that  end up using their artificial intelligence to exterminate humanity.On  the Terminator's heels is a human from the same time period, best friend of  the hero, John, who's mother is in peril in the past. In the ultimate  paradox, we find out that it is John's best friend (Michael Bein) who is  actually John's father.Ok, we're in the second movie and now  Schwarzenegger is one of the good guys, sent to protect John as a child as  the T-1000 (a morphing bit of liquid metal that can take on any form) comes  to kill John as a child since the attack on his mother didn't work.The  plot has a billion holes in it... why didn't they just send back a  termiator back to the 1800's a kill John's great, great grandfather  instead. It would have been impossible for people of that time period to  have a defense against the terminator. The terminators have to use the time  machine in the nude, even though they're entirely metal on the inside...  sorry folks, that's just stupid. I could go on all day about  inconsistencies in the story, but I'm still giving this film 5 stars.The  action is so fast and the acting so believable, it's not until after the  movie is over that you even notice these inconsistencies. This movie  abounds with special effects eye candy, exploding cars and tons of bullets  and fight scenes.  This movie will never get old. I've watched it several  times and it never ceases to be entertaining. This series really opened up  a new genre in sci-fi &amp; action and in many ways it's timeless. Edward  Furlong presents the most convincing performance of a troubled youth who  has grown up without a male role model and looks up to the loyal, yet  emotionless terminator who has come to rescue him and his mother.There  is a lot of violence and tons of language, so this isn't recommended as a  family film... but for sci-fi, special effects junkies, this movie fills  the bill.	5.0	the paradox comes to fruition	2000-07-29	6	6	0

The third movie was a bad ""B"" movie and the fourth was more of a poorly made Matrix sequel than a Terminator film.  T2 is by far the best Terminator movie and the best movie Arnold has ever been in.  The skynet edition Blu Ray includes the extended director's cut which explains more clearly how Arnold's character comes to appreciate the value of human life.  It also does a better job of portraying  John Connor as a future leader in a scene where he prevents his mother from destroying the terminator sent to protect them.  The picture is clear as a day and the sound is great.

We have found that Sci-fi is quite enjoyable eventhough most of the genre's fans are complete losers who live in their mothers' basements, weigh at least two-and-a-half bills, and have multiple computers(one of which is loaded and overrun with viruses if you get the drift. When you think Sci-fi, one of the films that pops to mind is T2. In the 90's it was the big budget action movie, starring The Immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger and written by James Cameron.  Yeah, the same dude who did Titanic. If you could get inside info on things like ""Did Arnold threaten Cameron's life on-set, or did he just call him an emasculating name?"" wouldn't that make a better feature on the DVD than ""Oh, so that's how they made that dude appear right out of the floor? That's pretty cool."" Oh, boy!But, this movie was totally awesome. You had many soundboard lines to laugh at just because of The Arnold Voice. You had tons of cool explosions. You had a lot of sweet guns and explosives. You got to make fun of Sarah Connor because she was absolutely nuts. Pretty much everything you would want in a great guy movie, except for hot chicks. Oh well, you can't have everything. The concept was sweet. You had Arnold who was a now obselete Terminator, if there even is such a thing, assigned to protect John Connor. However, John and his mother, Sarah Connor, are being hunted by another, updated Terminator. Now, Arnold was made out of metal, so he could be crushed or something. But, this other dude was made out of liquid or something. So if you shot him, this giant hole would open up then start to close immediately. Awesome! How is Arnold going to take this thing on?Because he's Arnold. That's why. If you learn anything reading Sid's reviews, learn this: Arnold is the man. He is undefeatable and undeniable. We wish he could be president. So, on Sid the Elf's recomendation, watch Terminator 2. You will absolutely love it."	5.0	Sid The Elf's thoughts on giving T2 5 stars: No Problemo.	2007-11-27	1	0	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2EEHHA0G0FIDP	Simon Gifford	Most sequels are criticised because they are just inferior rehases of the original film. &quot;Terminator 2 - Judgement Day&quot; is that rare thing - a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron  piles on the grit, black humor and superb action in what is a worthy sequel  to his 1984 horror fantasy classic &quot;The Terminator&quot;. As well as a  great story, this film has eye-popping special effects (which set new  cinematic standards back in 1991 and still look incredible) and one of the  most invincible villans ever imagined.Arnold Schwarzanegger makes a  re-appearence here as the Terminator, but this time he is the good guy. He  is sent back through time to protect a young boy called John Connor (Edward  Furlong) from the T-1000 Super Cyborg, (Robert Patrick), a more advanced  Terminator whose liquid metal shape changing abilities make him seemingly  unstoppable. John Connor will eventually grow up to become the future world  leader and save mankind, which is why the T-1000 wants to kill him.This  film also benefits from great performances from its human stars. John  Connor (Furlong) and his mother Sarah Connor (making a reappearence here,  played by Linda Hamilton) make the characters seem very believable - so the  viewer feels sympathy towards them. Schwarzanegger also adds nice deadpan  humor - &quot;Were you gonna kill him?&quot; John Connor asks  Schwarzanegger of one victim. &quot;Of course I was&quot; snaps the big  man. &quot;I`m a Terminator&quot;.The British viewer gets extra value  for money here, as there is extra footage not seen in UK Cinemas.

Kochel ""Sam K"""	Hello,There are many great movies from the realm of science fiction and this is one of the best and most family friendly too. This movie has great fighting scenes, great special effect, cool characters, and a cool story. If you are really really picky about the realities of time travel then you might have issues with this movie, but then you probably aren't watching that much science fiction anyways. Another movie that is scarier, but also great in the way this movie is the movie Aliens, the second movie of the 4 movies about the acid-blooded, egg laying aliens and the character Riply. However, I think this is a movie that is more appropriate for little kids (not too little), and a movie that can be watched over and over again, as it's just plain fun!	5.0	Amazing movie, all time favorite	2006-01-06	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2GJDOQL63SDM7	Slothmo	If you already own the Ultimate Edition DVD, I don't recommend cashing out the extra money for this version because it isn't really xtreme with the exception of the new telecine master and the kick... 5.1 sound. The features are bleak with the exception of the New audio commentary with James Cameron and a couple of DVD-Rom features. If you have the UE, rent this version and watch the new master because it is the best the movie has ever looked. If you don't own any copies of T2, I suggest you buy this version but don't expect alot of features because there are like 2-3 documentaries and DVD-ROM material that is about it! But if you really want to get in depth behind the scenes material find a copy of the Ultimate Edition if it is still available. The movie looks and sounds good on there but it isn't as good as on the Xtreme. If you have a widescreen TV and want to see how good the new master is, go out and check it out because there isn't a single scratch on the screen not even dust or anything other than the crystal clear video. The sound is pretty dynamic but you have to have a really good system to hear it. I had to turn mine up to 35 to get the real effect. Well anyway, see the new master!	5.0	Not a must own DVD if you already have the Ultimate...	2003-07-03	1	0	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1T6KRLNTR3NOF	Slowestrider	PQ and sound are top notch as reviewed in most posts. PQ cannot compares to current top crop Blu Ray but consider when the film was produced, it should get a 5 stars for PQ and sound.I really want to comment on the access issue or the lack of it. Due to some posted problems or long delay in viewing this version, I put off buying this version for a while. There was no issue at all with my Samsung BP1500 player. The first screen indicated my player is not hooked up to the internet, there was option of connect or cancel. I pressed cancel. About 5 or 10 seconds later, another screen pop up stating that my player is 2.0 version, I pressed enter. It then came to the menu screen. I scrolled down and choose the special edition. A couple more clicks, no problemo as Arnold mentioned in the movie. : )I also want to comment on the great service from Amazon. Most of my purchases came earlier then predicted arrival time. This disc and two other items didn't arrived as stated. After emailed to Amazon, this disc and two other items arrived the next day. The original ship item still somewhere lost in transit. 5+ stars for Amazon service!!!	5.0	No issue at all when view without internet hooked up	2010-01-02	2	2	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ACVQ6OMN2T773	S. Mayo	Looking around, it seems that people like this movie better than the first Terminator. I can't say I agree.The second movie does have things going for it. The special effects are great, and have held up pretty well. Linda Hamilton gets to play a desperate brain case, and really threw herself into the role. But I don't think Arnold is quite as convincing as a hero, not after his great, soulless, menacingly evil role in the first movie. (Insert your own joke about California, here). And the foul mouthed little punk - sorry, the future savior of mankind - was very irritating, most of the time he was on screen.And ignoring the paradoxes (which are half the plot), would you really sent a blithely homicidal robot back to be controlled by a nasty little criminal punk of a 10 year old? You're gambling your own existence (and other peoples') on this little wacko's whims. It all gets several points for the coolness of having a kid with his very own Mega Robot of Death, but it really snapped suspension of disbelief for me. Unlike the first movie, you have to park your brain somewhere to enjoy this one. But it does repay you with a nice ride, after that.	4.0	Thrill ride, but with some flaws	2009-07-14	2	1	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A345CAZWU272WJ	SMB	I have the Ultimate Edition.  I thought that the extreme edition had a lot more special features not including the remastered picture and sound.  I was totally wrong.  MOST of the special features are dvd-rom features and I don't have a dvd-rom.......and those features aren't really good anyways.  It has a very good 25 minute long documentary about the use of computer generated special effects and how t2 started the large use of these special effects.  That's basically the only worthwhile special feature that it has.  The special features were really disappointing, but I'm fairly sure that the picture is much better (more colorful and richer) compared to the ultimate edition's picture, which makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch.  The movie is great, but the special features are lacking...... as for the ultimate edition.....the special features are abundant and the picture isn't too great therefore making the movie a teeny bit less great.  It's up to you.......a lot of special features (if you can still buy the U.E.)....or a great picture........or else just buy both and you can have everything........like I did.	4.0	the movie is definitely 5....but extreme????	2003-12-29	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AMGGZCWY3VNZC	S. Morales	"This review is on the Blu-ray disc of T2, not really the film itself. As we all know, T2 is one of the greatest sequels of all time, as well as one of the greatest and most critically acclaimed action movies of all time - fantastically written story, wonderful acting, top notch effects (even over 20 years later!), and a good steady pacing all make T2 a classic that will live on for even more upcoming generations.Finally we have the film on Blu-ray, and needless to say, out of ALL the versions that have already been released of the film in VHS, Laser Disc,and DVD formats, this SkyNet Edition is the one to own. It contains ALMOST everything all the other versions did, minus some things a previous THX certified 2-disc DVD edition did, at least of what is readily available on the disc itself. What do I mean? Well, even though Blu-ray can fit a lot more memory than DVD, there is simply TOO MUCH content from those older DVD editions that was able to fit on one Blu-ray disc. Therefore in order to get the fullest effect of ALL the other special features that were on the previous DVD versions (T2 3D making of, behind the scenes, etc), you will have to download them, hence you require a Wifi connection. There are more details but you'll just have to get the disc to find out, as I'm not a techy head hence do not really understand the details. Yet the film does have a plethora of content. I will also add that this version DOES have both versions of the film - theatrical and director's cut. There is a picture in picture and quiz and facts modes that can be set while watching the film, which the previous DVD versions did not have (because they couldn't, as only Blu-ray has the ability for various picture in picture while a film is playing). For this, I removed half a star, but it was not the only reason why, the rest has to do with the presentation itself.T2 on Blu-ray really only looks and sounds as good as the TV you have it hooked up to. On a fairly recently released Samsung 42"" plasma, the film is a good Blu-ray transfer, though could've used perhaps an extra coat of cleanup. For the most part, the film looks very clean; most blacks are deep, shadows are smooth and colors are a bit richer. Still, the way this film is glossed over for Blu-ray seems sort of ""flat,"" and that same cleaner look that most older movies have, only due to the fact that there is only so much you can do with such old prints. I mean, it's no Lord of the Rings or Tron Legacy BD, and obviously they did not go through the same trouble to make sure it looked as good. It's a basic Blu-ray gloss over; it looks good, but a couple of more days in the workshop could've made it look fantastic. You will still notice some portions of grain and some left over ""pops"" and elements of random distortion from the original film print. Again, this is practically always the case with older films; another film you would see this in is the Blu-ray version of The Neverending Story. A cleaner movie, yet a somewhat ""flat"" look.Audio-wise, the movie sounds good, yet at times can be uneven. All sounds come out richer than before, yet depending on your television the movie can do the ""low then loud then low"" game, or the ""flatter when louder sounds come off"" game. In other words, on an older HD television, you may get the irritation of having to deal with low sounding dialogue and quieter moments, only to be shocked when an explosion or gunshot hits, then all of the sudden the volume will go full blast, causing you to play with the volume continuously throughout the movie. On a newer television you'll get the ""let's make them hear EVERY sound"" effect game. That is, when some louder portions come up you'll notice the overall ""volume"" of that specific sound will lower in order to keep even with the rest of the movie. Moreover, sounds that were once lower will be purposefully raised so that they'll be audible.Examples of this are in the beginning when the Terminator first acquires his clothes, he leaves the bar and ""Bad to the Bone"" begins playing. The song itself is normally supposed to sound louder than the rest of the film, but you'll immediately notice it's weaker and flatter tone due to the sound mixing trying to keep even. It doesn't deter too much, but it's still noticeable. Another example is when John Connor and his friend are riding his motorbike to the mall. They're blasting the stereo and John enters the tunnel area. At one moment his friend chants ""yeah!"" to the music, and normally this sound is lower, because obviously the bike is going and the song is playing, so his voice wouldn't be able to speak above it too high. Still, due to the sound mixing and in the attempts to try and keep it all even, you will hear his ""yeah!"" louder to an almost awkward and unrealistic sense. I dunno, in my opinion, a well mixed film soundtrack should keep as close to the original release as possible, in all volume levels and tones, yet just be, you know, cleaner and crisper. May Blu-ray discs seem to come off in their sound mixing in the same way, and though it's nice to have even volume during the film, it becomes a little too apparent at times, taking away from its theatrical originality.Due to these reasons I give it 4.5 stars out of 5. Yes it is the definitive version of T2 to own (and hopefully the last ever released), but these flaws still do exist."	4.0	(4.5 Stars) The Definitive T2 Version (Blu-ray Disc Review)	2011-10-29	9	9	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AL7DOIT8R4W40	"""socko130"""	Terminator 1 was a great movie but after seeing T2 you can easily see the difference between the visuals between the two.  The DVD features are packed into this thing.  The commercial on TV mentioned 3 versions on the CD:  Theatrical (120 mins), Special (156 mins), and a Hidden Alternate.  I have no idea what this is.  All I know is that I'm gonna sit here and play with this remote until I find it on this DVD.  If any of you know anything about this hidden alternate stuff or have found it, email me:  socko130@hotmail.comOne of the greatest things about T2 is that you have no idea at the beginning (unless your friend tells you before you see it) which terminator is the protector and which is the killer.  Both of them kick some butt at the beginning.  When Arnold gets his clothes it was a little giveaway that he was the good guy.  Other than that, it's pretty cool all the way up to that scene at the video arcade when both terminators whip out their guns and you have no idea whats gonna happen until Arnold says &quot;duck&quot; or whatever.  Classic.  James Cameron has yet to make a crappy film.  NOT THE ULTIMATE EDITION DVD, BUT THE ULTIMATE DVD.	5.0	Please.	2000-08-31	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1CJ2SOEBZTGG7	Special Features Specialist	(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary:  WHOA!  Holier-than-thou Cameron actually recorded a scene by scene talkfest with co-writer William Wisher.  We are told how much we should appreciate it due to the fact that Cameron dragged his lazy behind downstairs to record it in his private screening room.  That aside, it's a good listen that provides nice insight, to T1 as well which had this feature sorely missing.Deleted Scenes:  Cameron is even watching his original near three hour cut, with some interesting moments that had to be sheared.Behind the Scenes:  Much like the &quot;Superman&quot; DVD, this is one of the rare care packages that features three different explorations of the making of the film.  You will not go away wanting more.Misc:  Silly features for diehards to play with on their computers, like morphing personal photos or building your own T...erminator.  For once even the box is worth a mention, a cool 3-D, shining silver cover and case.Overall:  I'll get hammered for only giving four stars, but I love my outtakes and screen tests, and none are here.

When you press the button on the side, after flicking the on switch on the bottom, the eyes light up red and it plays certain sound clips from the movie. I read some reviews that said the skull was flimsy. I don't know about that. Sure, it's not as sturdy as it would be if it were made from metal, but it's not paper-level flimsy. I wouldn't play with it or anything, but it will certainly hold up to simple holding and looking at. The only bad thing about the set is the incredibly dumb move of having all 6 discs stacked on top of each other. Doesn't everyone know that dvds can get scratched up pretty good. The set does come with a regular dvd case that you can put the discs in, but that too is a stack case. I'd suggest tracking down a 6 disc regular case, sort of like the case of the Real Ghostbusters complete set or the A-Team set and using that instead.	4.0	Awesome !	2010-07-19	2	1	1

However, whatever idiot made the menu system had to have gotten the ideas from Satan! It will take you a minimum of 6ish minutes just to get to the menu to choose your movie. It goes through all this Skynet crap which is only cool the first time. If you have it connected to the internet you get even more crap popping up. If you don't you sit at an error screen reading how you should connect to the internet to benefit from garbage you don't care about.So when you finally do get to the menu, it doesn't stop there! Now you get to sit through a bunch of short screens that make a bunch of sound to say HEY LOOK GUYS, WE DID SURROUND SOUND WORK YAY. Guess what! You can't skip any of this either!Bluray has been a huge disappointment with these scenes you can't skip but this one....this one takes the entire cake.	2.0	I JUST WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE	2014-04-26	0	0	0

When I recieved my copy of the Ultimate Edition, something was wrong. I have a rather slow DVD player so I had to watch something else first to warm it up. But it was worth the wait. I had no idea that they could fit so much extra stuff onto one DVD.Three versions of the film, three documentaries, four trailers, audio commentary, spectacular picture and sound, kick [butt] animated menus, talent profiles, script and a full supplement that will take you until Judgment Day to finish reading. Awesome!Onto Brandon's DVD scale:Movie: 5/5. Arnold's greatest movie ever. Cameron's best too.Picture and Sound: 5/5. As good as it's ever gonna get.Extras: 5/5.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	A couple of things to point out. The Blu-Ray in this release is a new remaster from the previous blu-ray so it will look better and it has a number of special features never before available (mainly a picture in picture behind-the-scenes sort of thing). Just because this release is remastered doesn't mean the visuals are going to be perfect. The source material has inherent grain from the film used in the release. It will still look great, but don't expect crystal clarity. This Blu-Ray release will also have its own single disk release so you can get the new remaster without the expensive packaging.So what else does this collector's edition give you? Well it gives you what's been out there for years. You get the Ultimate Edition DVD set and the Extreme Edition DVD set with all of the special features of each. You heard me the DVDs... as in not high definition. This particular release is just for the people out there who absolutely must have a  Limited Edition Terminator 2 Complete Collector's Set with little head package and all. The rest of us already have these DVDs. And if you don't you really need to think about it. Is it worth spending $120+ for something you can get for $50 or less if you purchased the disks separately? The new T2 Blue-Ray should be had for less than $30 and the DVDs you can get for $10 or less at any local Best Buy, Target, Wal Mart, etc.Save your money.

Schofield ""moviefreak1980"""	"Terminator 2 Judgement Day is one of those rare films that not only is better then the original film,but one of those films that is so groundbraking that you'll remember it for a long time.While the original film is groundbraking in it's own right,the sequel is so much more.T2 like the first,starts off in the year 2029,where the Human Resistance and the machines of the future built by Skynet are still fighting.Again Skynet is trying to destory man's future by changing the past,but this time the target is not Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton),but the future leader of the Human Resistance,her son John(Edward Furlong).Skynet as made a new terminator call the T-1000(Robert Patrick)to kill young John Conner.As before,the Resistance sends a protector for John,but this time it's the Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger)itself.Even though T2 is now 13 years old,it can still wow you with the stunning special effects that people still talk about years later.T2 is a great film to watch over and over again and is my fifth favourite film ever made.Alot of the images of T2 are really hard to forget,like the destruction of L.A. on Aug 29 1997.The DVD is one of best DVDs you can buy,loaded with special features like ""The Making Of T2"",""T2 More Than Meets The Eye""and ""The Making Of T2 3-D,teasers,trailers and what I think is awesome is you get two versions of T2,the original theatrical release or the special edition which you get the deleted scenes are put back in.I think that T2 is James Cameron's best film to date and like the first one,it makes us ask the question that the least person amongest us,could become the most important person in the future."	5.0	One of the only sequels to surpass the original	2003-02-19	0	0	0

I mean i love blu-ray and i want one so bad but u gotta pay up the nose just to get one, at least players are becoming more and more affordable but i dont want to have to convert all my 700 dvds to high def formats. it's interesting how Artisan backed this movie and now it doesnt exist anymore as soon as the high def battle started, Lionsgate is now mastering all thier old movies and they back up blu-ray 100%, it just makes you think what coinsidences emerged with all this, terminator 2 on standard dvd is in high def (for us in the US anyway) it cost me 5.50 its just a big mystery to me...	5.0	Let's Shed Some Light	2007-05-26	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A18CRS4FLVH5YW	"Star Sailor ""Worldwide Traveler"""	I was expecting to see three versions of the film as it was advertised  earlier on when they were feeding the market frenzy to the buying public.  Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding DVD package, it has all kinds of  extras, literally everything you would want to know about the whole  Terminator 2 film.  All the stuff that was released on the VHS edition back  in 1995 is all here!  Plus a whole lot more!  It gets kind of ridiculous  actually since there is just so much of it.  One thing I do have a  complaint about is the navigational control of the supplemental disc, when  you press a button for a certain area it either takes you to the main menu  or you have to keep pressing the desired button to get you where you want  to go.  That's kind of frustrating and those clever people at Artisan have  put a notice in the DVD package making people aware there may be  difficulties in navigating those controls.  If they knew there were  glitches, than why did they even release all of this in the first place?  Hmmmmm.  I was impressed with the Terminator 2 3D documentary, I have never  seen that attraction at Universal Studios and now I am totally stoked to go  there the next time I go to California.  Another problem with all of this  is the keep case they give you, there is too much stuff for the small  packaging they provide you.  I can't close the keep case and the cheap  aluminum cover is kinda lame.  If you put both discs and booklet in there,  it just doesn't fit.  Why didn't they do the same thing as Independence Day  with a keep case that holds everything? (By the way, Independence Day is  the greatest DVD package made yet next to Fight Club).  I am really glad I  didn't pay the full price that everyone else is having to pay.  Word of  advice, buy these DVD's before they are release, always pre-order since you  save between 10 and 15 percent everytime and you don't feel as bad in  buying your selection if isn't everything that you wanted.  If you're a  huge T2 fan, this DVD is a must have.  If you found the movie  &quot;amusing&quot; you'll probably like ID4 or Fight Club a lot better if  you don't own them already.  The only question now is-&quot;What about the  original Terminator movie?&quot;	4.0	Outstanding package but slightly disappointing	2000-09-04	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AJDYDG7YZY9QL	Stephen A. Haines	Robert Patrick's appearance as Duchovny's replacement on The X-Files reminded me of the  only other time i've seen him, as the evil robot in T2.  An actor without a speaking role is  difficult to assess, so there isn't much to be said about him here.Schwarzenegger, on the other hand, has a tough job here in trying to match Linda Hamilton's  performance as the concerned mother.  She dominates this film, bringing feminist strengths to  a new intensity.  Her breakout from the hospital must have taken all the energy she possessed  and very nearly overrides the remaining scenes.  Certainly, her conniving tactics in  accomplishing it stick in memory far more than the remainder of the film.  The scene of her  struggle in the foundry seems a bit overblown, but was a necessary climatic build.  Cameron  may have overdone it a bit here, and it's impossible not to wonder how much of it is  Hamilton's own drive to show her toughness that prolonged it.Arnold turns in a performance superior to most of what he'd done prior to this film.  His  change of character from the earlier Terminator is unquestionably genuine.  It's a forecast of  what he achieves in later films.  Having seen this film prior to watching the original  Terminator made the comparison even more stark.  Never having been a Schwarzenegger fan  before seeing this, it made a convert of me.This isn't a film to see on a regular basis, but Cameron's abilities deserve more than one  watch.  Clearly, this film is designed for the Schwarzenegger buff.  If Cameron feels Arnold is  worth directing, we must all sit up and take notice.  For that alone, this film is worth adding  to your collection.	4.0	Enough action for girls and boys alike!	2001-02-21	1	0	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A27HFEVFEECMF1	Stephen Moser	Ok,  this movie is really good.  If you've seen the first one you know that in the future(well acctually Judgement day...According to the movie,  was suppose to  have happened 4 years ago)a program called Skynet has waged war on mankind with an army of robots.  However a man, John Conner,  insures the victory of the humans over the robots.  Knowing its own doom,  Skynet created a new type of robot.  Something that feels no pitty, no pain, no fear...The Terminator.Skynet sent the terminator back in time to kill Coner's mother before he was even born.  But Conner,  sends back a soldier to stop the terminator.Now in this,  the sequal,  young Conner is with foster parents and his mother is in a mental institution.  Skynet,  in an attempt to assasinate Conner,  sends back another Terminator in time to kill him.  However, Conner(from the future) reprograms another Terminator to protect  young conner.  Now,  in the preasant day,  the two terminators fight a battle wich will decide the future of the planet and mankind.With alot of action and some neat terminator effects,  this movie is on of the best around, though the original &quot;The Terminator&quot; will always remain a classic.  I very highly reccomend that you see this movie and the original terminator.Did you find this review helpful?  If you did, I ask that you please vote.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	I really looked forward to seeing this on Blu Ray and love the excellent video transfers and multiple versions of the film.The audio is good to excellent with ample use of the home theater's surrounds and great detail in the low frequencies.The video transfer is crisp and clean, very detailed.  The entire film holds up just fine with the years and this film, like Aliens to its predecessor, Alien, actually raised the bar to a higher standard.  If I have any complaint it would be the ultra slow loading of the various extras,  you need patience with this disc, but your patience is rewarded in the end.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	5.0	Terminator 2: Judgment Day-Skynet Edition-on Bluray	2012-04-28	3	2	1

I already own it on dvd but cant wait for the ultimate edition,but my neighbours probably can (sorry guys).I was lucky enough to see it at a private screenig by carrolco in 1991 &amp; so saw the complete version but i am looking forward to seeing it again complete.roll on T3 in 2001.

If you are a Terminator fun this DVD is a ""must"". ...I received a 1-disc version, this is the first one double-sided & double-density disk I owe. The disk Menu looks very nice, giving the viewer ""this"" special feeling before he watches the movie. The picture quality is fantastic ! The sound quality is just amazing, especially when listening on good ""hardware"". My 6.1ch Yamaha (DSP-AX2) plays all tracks with speed and details like any other DVD movie before. Sometimes I feel a lack of sounds from ""surround channels"", but it's rare. Included extras like THX EX test and fantastic THX logo shot, where you can hear Arnold reloading his ""Winchester"" right in the ""rear-center"" channel, gives the idea how DD-EX or DTS-ES should work. There are 3 versions of movie included on DVD disc. But watch out! The third version called ""extended special edition"" is accessible only when entering valid code from your remote control. Well, this is a great example of so called ""Easter-egg"" that I love and enjoy every time I play DVD disc. It's a real Ultimate Experience."	5.0	Fantastic Picture, Ultimate Sound !	2001-01-25	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A12A8LU93A132U	Steve	The special edition DVD is simply a must have in anyone's collection. Three featurettes are included; one for the original version, one for the special edition and one for the Universal Studios 3D show. It would have been nice to see the whole 3D show, but I guess you have to go to Universal Studios to see it. A 50-chapter supplement composed of text notes inter-cut with interviews and special features. Design, pre-production, locations, training, weapons, sound, editing, publicity only touches the information given. You name it they covered it. I especially liked the sound chapter where they broke down the various sound elements so you can hear them isolated from each other. The audio commentary is very good coming from just about every cast and crew member involved. Subtitles are given so you know who is talking. Some of the material is reused though. For example, some of the audio commentary is from interviews used in the featurettes. Sixteen deleted scenes are added in the special version, 18 for the extended special version. To get the extended version enter the roman numbers seen to the right of the main menu; they look odd, but trust me they are roman numerals. I already had T2 on DVD, but the special edition, just for the delete scenes alone, makes it more than worth replacing it if you already have it. The extra scenes give extra depth to the story and the characters. Most bonus features become boring an initial viewing, but I think the ones on this DVD can easily be seen again and again. Overall, if you were stuck on a desert isle, this would be the DVD to have.	5.0	A special edition DVD review	2000-10-10	1	1	0

How wrong that review was! I am a true videophile. I bought the earlier blu-ray of T2 that came out last year for $10, and it looked terrible. It was grainier than the Ultimate DVD, but this T2 version is amazing! I love to be able to see the hairs on a person's arm, and the individual pores on their face.  This Disc delivers all of it without typical over-pixelation!  What do I mean?  Certain discs (like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" blu-ray discs) are digitized too much, causing you to see tiny pixel-dots everywhere; in faces, in the sky, etc.  Some people think this makes the picture more vivid, but the unnatural pixels everywhere is really annoying to me (especially with a 65"" LCD TV).  This T2 transfer is fantastic!  There is no annoying pixelation anywhere, but the picture is crisp and clear.  You will see pores on the actor's faces, every detail is rendered flawlessly.  This is as good as my other favorite Blu-Ray transfer ""The Bucket List"", which is also just as clear! No matter what you prefer, there has never been a better transfer of the film, ever.  The audio is also stunning, and you get all 3 versions of the film with the same clarity.  There is no need for any other transfer to ever be done.  This T2 edition is true to the original film, and it is a spectacular addition to any blu-ray collection."	5.0	The Best Transfer yet! Finally all 3 versions on 1 disc.	2009-05-26	5	4	1

There's no Special Features what so ever besides audio commentary from James Cameron and Co-Writter William Wisher and another commentary from The Cast and Crew.

In fact, this is even better than the original. It has more excitement, better special effects and action sequences. The &quot;liquid metal&quot; special effect is amazing. It's one of the best pieces of special effects I've ever seen in an action or sci-fi flick. The ending kept me on the edge of my seat, and the whole movie just blew me away! It's that thrilling and exciting! There are three classic lines in the movie: &quot;I'll be back&quot;, {also from the first film} &quot;Come with me if you want to live&quot;, and best of all, &quot;Hasta la Vasta, Baby&quot;. Those lines have been quoted, I think, from fans of the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A17Y465UXZOJE3	Stickman	Okay, everyone knows this movie. One of the greatest of all time and it set the standard for this type of movie until The Matrix came out. Still one the very best and I watch it often.Now, to this particular disk: Skynet BluRay Version. I bought our bluray player (Sony BDP-BX1) just 3 months ago, so I didn't think we'd have any problems.However:1. You MUST have internet access hooked up to your bluray player. I had to go out and buy a 50' lan cable just so I could reach from the home office to the TV room. And it has to be plugged in to watch the movie. Unless your TV or HT room has internet access, you'll need a LAN cable laying on the floor during your movie watching. (and it cost me $22 for the cable. More than the movie.)2. You should have an extra memory stick plugged in to access some of the features. It told me I needed at least 10.5meg. I didn't plug it in, just skipped that part.3. It takes FOREVER to load. I'm talking a good 15-20 minutes from the time you put the disk in untill you see the first scene of the movie. I am not exaggerating.Also, I had to UPGRADE my brand new Sony BD player. It would not run at all until I ran the update. That itself took about 25 minutes. But of course it's a one time deal.Also, there is very little help or information on how to access the various parts of the disk. I still have not done anything but watch the movie one time. It was so frustrating, I just wanted to get away from it.The movie is great, but really I would not have bought it knowing all that I do now. If you just want to watch the movie and don't want to wait 20 minutes to start watching and you don't need all the other junk that goes with it, (which you have to have internet access and a LAN enabled player, plus a memory stick plugged in) skip this version.PS, I'm rating this disk 1 star. The movie is of course 5 stars, but the ordeal rates only 1 star.	1.0	Really trying on my nerves, for me, not worth it.	2009-06-08	31	18	13

Without this film and its revolutionary use of CGI, Lord of the Rings et al may never have happened. But it isn't just the effects, it's the story. Cameron excelled with his script here. Not only is there thrills from start to finish, but there is tenderness, thought-provoking vision, and, at the risk of alienating a whole demographic of viewers, social commentary. Everyone who wants to write a movie script should study this film, then we might not be inundated with contrived drivel year after year.

I won't get too wordy, because everyone and their mother knows this movie inside and out.  It was one of the most influential flicks when it was first released, especially in the terms of visual computer effects.  The effects still hold up, after all this time.  James Cameron, Stan Winston and the team of practical and visual effect folks on this movie are at the top of their game, delivering a movie that looks better than a lot of todays FX fests.I'm one of the few that actually prefer the first one over this one.  To me, the original Terminator was scarier and creepier.  The thought of an unstoppable killing machine on your trail with the only human (yet very resourceful) Kyle Reese to protect you was a terrifying one.  It was more of sci-fi meets horror and it was extremely effective in what it set out to do.  The sequel is more of a blockbuster sci-fi action movie that does what it sets out to do just as effectively, so which one you prefer probably depends on what genre you prefer your Terminator in.  That said, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is still flat out full of awesome.  It does a lot of things right; you have Arnold at the very top of his game, Robert Patrick makes a very worthy opponent as the liquid metal T-1000.  The action is top notch and delivers the goods in very satisfying ways.  The major flaw I find in the film is that it suffers ""Annoying Kid Syndrome.""  I understand that John Conner is an important part of the story and in fact what drives the story along.  But man does he come off as a whiny little brat.  Cameron has a little too much fun trying to make Conner the quintessential early 90s rebel teenager with all the outdated slang and annoying attitude that goes along with it.  Sorry, it just seems too self aware and corny, especially for this day and age.  That aside, I did like the relationship John developed with the Terminator, I felt that part of the story rang true.  A boy and his killer robot.  Like I said, though, I won't get too wordy, you already know if you like this movie or not.The blu ray portion of the movie, I feel is kind of a mixed bag.  I've always like the blue-tinged look of the movie and it's about as sharp and crisp as I've ever seen it.  I'm currently in between surround sound systems at the moment, so it would have been nice to have a 2.0 audio option to help out with the sound on my TV.  I'll be honest, I don't have the ideal setup to fully take advantage of the Blu Ray experience, but I would imagine that the surround sound audio option is fantastic for those that have it.  For those with wireless internet turned on, the menu (while it does take a loooong time to load) becomes unsettling, as it takes on the persona of Skynet who is tracking your every move.  It's almost durn near convincing as I find myself looking over my shoulder now to see if Skynet is hovering behind me somewhere watching me type this out.  Of course, it's probably in my personal computer too.  Dang.  Anyways, I thought that was a nice touch to give it a feel of Terminator conspiracy.The special features are where I feel a little cheated.  Now there are directors and crew commentaries, and that's always nice, but other than that, there's a few deleted scenes and promotional trailers for the film.  The regular DVD had a ton of special features and I love me some special features.  I will say that the Blu Ray Live portion of this DVD has the most stuff I've seen in my meager Blu Ray collection.  You can watch a nice 30 minute making of doc, another doc that takes you behind the scenes of the ""extended version"" of the movie with all the scenes put back in and whatnot.  There's some Japanese promotional trailer material and stuff of that sort.  It sort of makes up for the lack of special features and docs on the main disc, but it would have been nice to see a more current in depth look at the making of the movie with the people involved in the movie.Despite the gripes, I enjoyed the Terminator 2: Skynet Edition Blu Ray immensely.  It's a fun action movie on a great format for that type of movie that you can find for an outstanding price at the moment."	5.0	Great Presentation of the Great Sci-Fi Classic	2012-01-04	7	7	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A31FW2MS2EV9UX	Sunny Lim	This is my favorite movie and the ultimate edition adds more kick to it!What else can be said about this movie? Basically, Ahnuld plays the terminator sent back from the future to protect John Connor, Earth's future resistance hero from a more advanced 'liquid metel' terminator.The first time I saw the morphing, I was so impressed and the special effects still looks great now. The action is also super. Ahnuld looks great with the minigun!The ultimate DVD edition is so chockful of good stuff, you just have to get it.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A26A8T38C2GQD7	Taheen Lopez	After he pushed the envelope of computer-generated special effects in THE ABYSS, director Jim Cameron turned this hotly anticipated sequel to THE TERMINATOR into a well-written, action-packed showcase for advanced special effects and for one of the most invincible villains ever imagined.TERMINATOR II: JUDGEMENT DAY is a legitimate sequel: there's more story to tell about a hulking, leather-clad android (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who arrives from the future to protect a rebellious teenager and future leader (Edward Furlong) from being killed by the tenacious T-1000 robot (Robert Patrick), whose liquid-metal construction makes him seemingly unstoppable.The fate of the future lies in the balance, with Linda Hamilton (who would later marry her director) reprising her role as the rugged woman Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton)whose son will change the course of history.Additionally; TERMINATOR II takes me back to memory lane to when it was theatrically released in the Fall of 1991 when I was 18 going on 19 years old and a Freshmen in college.	4.0	Come With Me If You Want To Live	2014-01-07	0	0	0

However, if all you want to do is watch the movie, forget it! I am not even going to go into the special features since they are well covered in other reviews. So if you just want to watch the movie, you have to cancel the attempt to log into ""Skynet"", then it tells you that if you want to get the full  Blu-Ray features you NEED the internet connection, and you have to wait a bit there. After a few graphics, you get to pick a version, theatrical or special. Ok, you have picked your version, and now you can watch your movie right? Well sure, after all the promo screens for Lionsgate, a special T2 THX bit, and several others eating up time that you can't skip. So now you can watch the movie. Ok, it's not the first disk with all that stuff, but it takes longer than any I have come across before, and be careful not to stop it, (or in my case bump my remote) because you can't get to the menu to choose scene select until you have gone through every second of that stuff, AND when you do get to the scene select, you only get to look at one choice at a time, not a page with four or six scenes per page. I know to some people this will sound really picky, but what I am getting at it that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to just put in the disk and watch it.

I really shouldnt call T2 Extreme another edition of T2, because really &amp; honestly it's more of an extenstion to T2 Ultimate, on the 2nd disc all you'll find is 2 new documentaries and DVD ROM features, not like the Ultimate which has more features than you can count.

I have a Sony BDP-S300 player and the same thing happened to me that happened to another reviewer. A screen came up from ""Skynet"" saying that you need a 2.0 player and the blu ray player I have is only a 1.0. The menu finally came up and I selected the Special extended directors Cut(more on that later)and it started to play until it got to the studio canal screen and at 23 seconds it did not move. So it is the blu ray player and not the disc. I repeat: NOT THE DISC BUT THE BLU RAY PLAYER. Proof of that is then I took the disc and put it in my PS3 and it work perfectly due to the fact that it is hooked up to the internet.Once I put it in the PS3, the Blu ray got friggin awesome. Skynet tells you that you are connected and it gives you the city you live in with area code, your email address, the degrees outside where you live and other goodies that only skynet would know. Then once you are pass that it ask you to select a version.For everyone wondering there is all three versions of the movie on here just like the Ultimate edition. You type in the same code to get the special director's extended edition as on the Ultimate edition which is 82997. There is interactive menus as well as triva games and quizes you can do while you watch the movie as well as picture in picture. I havent watch everything yet so I cant tell you all the special features but there is a bunch more. The picture and sound is fantastic and I am glad that I waited for this version of the blu ray as it is basically the Ultimate edition dvd on blu ray.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1WPYY2XLOKAT8	The Completist	I purchased this Blu-ray recently and found it to be a waste of money.  YES, TERMINATOR 2 is unspeakably awesome; YES, TERMINATOR 2 on Blu-ray is a good thing...BUT NOT THIS VERSION.For one, it's THEATRICAL CUT ONLY!Second, this version is EXTREMELY BARE BONES: it's just the movie and 2 commentary tracks (one from 1993, the other from 2003) and THAT'S IT.  For a movie with so much technical precision and BTS material found on previous releases, this is a GRIEVOUS oversight.Third (and final), the transfer is TERRIBLE.  The original film is a bit grainy to begin with, but in previous VHS and DVD transfers it was never enough to be distracting.  Here, in 1080 resolution, the grain is so bothersome that it strikes me more as digital noise--even STATIC at worst--than actual celluloid texture.  I get the feeling they went through the HD transfer process as fast as possible to cash in on the HD market.  It looks little better than what the old DVD version would on upconvert.Interestingly, I recently bought THE ROAD WARRIOR on Blu-ray and noticed the difference.  Both ROAD WARRIOR and TERMINATOR 2 have roughly the same amount of grain in their image (and the VHS and DVD transfers were comparable), but the Blu-ray transfer of THE ROAD WARRIOR is GLORIOUS, and the grain actually accentuates the image (worth every penny); logically, the TERMINATOR 2 image should be on par at LEAST, but instead it underperforms.So don't buy this Blu-ray release of it yet, because if history is any teacher, TERMINATOR 2 is going to receive the same double and triple-dipping treatment it did on DVD, and the next release is likely to have a better transfer and bonus features...the same thing already happened with THE FIFTH ELEMENT.	1.0	WAIT!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3NQSMTG612AF	TheTruthHurts	"4.5 StarsDespite Hollywood's greedy attempts to continue the ""Terminator"" franchise without the involvement of its master, James Cameron, I believe that this movie, which was one of the most amazing of the 90's and was truly revolutionary (honestly, CGI today doesn't look much better than it did 15 years ago when T2 was made), ended the series perfectly, with the T-800 giving his ""life"" to save the human race. Skynet had been destroyed, all existing chips had been eliminated, and there was simply no plausible way that the future had indeed not been saved. Therefore, T3 really had no basis for existing anyway, which, I assume, is why Cameron wanted nothing to do with it. Anyway, ""Terminator 2,"" while not Cameron's best film, has the best action sequences of any film he produced (although ""Aliens"" is pretty close). Personally, I place T2 behind T1 (his best) and ""Abyss: Special Edition;"" it isn't quite as powerful as ""The Terminator,"" because, needless to say, it's a sequel and we have already been shocked by Cameron's bleak vision of the future, but without question, T2 is indeed unforgettable, like most of Cameron's amazing films. It's definitely one to own, and if you've got a fast computer (like me), the HD version on Disc two of this edition is simply amazing in comparision to ""regular"" DVD (three times the pixels and twice the frames = much, much better picture). Definitely one for any serious collector to purchase."	5.0	The true end of the series...	2005-10-21	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A238M34Z3X2IBD	Thomas E. O'Sullivan	After nearly ten years T2 is still snappy.  And with this new DVD ULTIMATE EDITION, you can't really go wrong.  If you already have bought T2 on DVD  before this release, you will not feel cheated if you buy it again...  because this one is the complete package.  As for bells and whistles and  added value, T2 is a ten all around.  Excellent menu interfaces (level by  level inside SKYNET HQ), a host of extras that will keep both DVD and  PC/DVD ROM owners busy for hours on end... and I mean hours (from script,  to movie(s) - three in all, to 700 storyboards, inside MAKING OF's - the  film and the T2 3D ride, audio commentary - and on and on and on...).  Also, it comes complete with a metal slip case... real metal, real nice,  and very cool... and I mean cold (when I bought this the other day the  stores air conditioning had chilled the slip case to ice cold... my hand  fogged it up when I was holding onto it).  T2 ULTIMATE promises and  delivers just that.  The tranfer is sharp (the images in the film are very  clear... very percise and dead on).  The sound, very visual when you have  the right system (and even if you don't - it's still very nice).  One of  the best packages out there... highly recommended.  PLUS! - we have an  EASTER EGG, for those of you who don't know what that means... we do have a  hidden MODE to play with.  It's an extra run of the film (making it three  in total for the disk).  It's the SPECIAL ADDITION, but with the FUTURE  CODA scene replaced at the end.  For those who don't know the FUTURE CODA  scene and why it was cut... you'll have to review the DVD and movie.  To  get to the E.E. follow these instructions:Directions:The hidden  alternate version is 156 minutes. It contains the Future Coda ending and  the cut of the movie is the special edition. To get to this third cut of  the movie, click on Special Edition from the main menu. Highlight Play  Special Edition and press 82997 on your remote. The words The Future Is Not  Set will appear in the right hand portion of the setup screen and the left  eye of the Terminator will light up. Now you can click on Play Extended  Special Edition. If this does not work try 8 enter 2 enter 9 enter, 9  enter, 7 enter to achieve the same effect. Or, press title 3 and it plays  the hidden alternate version.There you go... you've got it all.  Enjoy.	5.0	SHINE THEM ON	2000-08-30	99	86	13

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3U5HKDHPYBAK3	Thomas P. Troyer	Most people have seen Terminator Two at least once. There is little need to critique it other than it's a great movie. I decided to see it in blu-ray so purchased this edition. When I put it into my new Sony player with WiFi, it said that it did not have enough memory to play this Blu-ray. Memory? I tried it several times and nothing. I asked a few people if they had experienced this and got no help. Finally, I changed a setting on the player to DVD rather than BD which really makes no sense since the directions said it would play this type of disk,BD.And after a couple of tries it played. I'm not convinced that the player setting was wrong and I don't think there is anything wrong with the Blu-ray disk. If anyone knows anything about this problem, please let me know.	5.0	Always fun to watch	2013-03-15	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3LHBZNW1XEDE2	Thomas Rehorst	"This review is not about the movie itself or the special features on the blu-ray disc - there are many other reviwes who already covered that part. For that I gave the movie the rating of 5 stars.This review is about technical issues some users and reviewers seem to have (which included myself)I think I figured out what the issue with the disc not playing on certain blu-ray disc players is - here we go:First let me explain that several movie companies (Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal, ... etc.) at times offer a feature on their blu-ray discs which is called ""BD Live"".BD Live is a special feature which offers additional online content, accessible from the Internet through your Blu-Ray Disc Player.Usually this feature is optional and you can access it through the Special Features section on the disc or it has its own category on the disc menue.However it means that your Blue Ray Disc Player needs to be ""BD Live ready"" to be able to access that content. So the first thing to check is if the blu-ray disc player you own has the ""BD Live readiness""!Well, my blu-ray disc player is a Vizio and does offer BD Live - so far so good. However when I tried accessing the BD Live feature on various blu-ray discs (e.g. 'Sherlock Holmes', 'Terminator:Salvation') I always got a message from my player stating ""no storage media available""...It took me over three months (until yesterday) to figure out that the error message practically meant that I have to put a Flash drive in the USB port of my Vizio blu-ray disc player.Once I had put a 2 GB flash drive in the USB slot the BD Live feature of my 'Terminator Salvation' Blue Ray disc worked.And be warned: It takes minutes for the features to download from the Internet if you have a slow Internet connection like I do (DSL)After I was successful in getting the BD Live option to work I returned to my T2 disc, which refused to play in the past and simply locked up my player, ready to give it another try.Voila! This time the disc played and the features are really awesome and stunning!So the crux with the T2 Skynet Edition is that usually the BD Live feature is OPTIONAL (which makes sense, since not all blu-ray disc players offer the BD Live access), but in the case of the T2 disc the BD Live feature is MANDATORY!This means your blu-ray Disc Player needs to have two things for the disc to work (= play):1) The Player needs to have the BD Live readiness2) The Player needs to have a storage device (such as a flash drive) connected to the USB port. (I don't know if there are possibly players on the market that have storage space internally, mine doesn't)If you don't have both features your disc simply won't play, which is a shame and a stupid concept on the part of Warner Bros. They should have made the BD Live content optional or at least offer a bypass option.This is my theory gotten out of my personal experience and I hope it is helpful for buyers of the blu-ray disc to avoid frustration over the issue!"	5.0	Technical issue with Blu-Ray Disc - A Theory	2011-02-09	31	30	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1ZXN0UA0ZN21I	Thomas R MaCoy	Terminator 2 probably ranks, in my opinion, as the best action movie ever made. The story, if you don't know it, is as follows: Humans create a superpowerful computer that mostly destroys the world, and to crush the remaining resistance, send a machine back in time to destroy the human's leader, John Connor. The resistance sends a warrior back as well, to save him. In the first Terminator, Ah-nold (say it right!) was sent back the kill John's mother; in the 2nd one, Ah-nold goes back to protect John from an even nastier machine.  That's how the plot starts at least, however rather then go through with it, halfway into the movie it takes an interesting twist and the three heroes (Ah-nold, Linda Hamilton as John's Mother, and John himself) end up trying to prevent the computer from ever being built. Naturally this leads to an ugly time-travel paradox mess that I won't even try to sort out, but you don't have to get into the particulars to enjoy the movie.  The acting is quite good; this is really the only role that Ah-nold can play really well, because the machine is emotionless, and his is good at it. Hamilton gets a trifle annoying in one scene, and in a few others is just, well, crazy, but other then that she is also fine for the role. Lastly, Edward Furlong is excellent as John Connor, ten years old at this time, and not growing up in the best of environments. Watching the relationship between the boy and the machine really sets this movie apart, and leads to a surprisingly moving conclusion.  And naturally, the real part of an action movie, the special effects and action scenes. The effects are astounding. Even today, ten years after the movie was made, they still look incredible. The highlight is the enemy terminator changing its form, and it seems doubtful that it could ever get more real looking. The action itself is also great, ranging from obligatory car chases to Ah-nold and the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) beating each other up. Every scene ties together well, and action and story shift together seamlessly.  Finally, a word must be said about the music: it is incredible. Composer Brad Fidel created a perfect score for the movie; at times the music sounds totally techno-machine like, for other scenes, notably the journey into the desert, it could almost lull you to sleep. (It sounds bad for an action movie, but it's actually not)  The only bad part of T2, as noted, are the whole twisty time travel dealings and the fact the Hamiltons character gets somewhat annoying once or twice. That aside though, T2 is a superb action movie, blending excellent special effects and action with an interesting and involving plot. And of course, everyone loves Ah-nold.	5.0	At last, a sequel better then the original	2001-01-21	1	1	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ALF6CCQWB4YST	Thunder Diesel	I got this one (Extreme Edition) & (The Ultimate Edition.) At first I just had the Extreme then got the Ultimate & the reason why I got both is because the Extreme HAS BETTER PICTURE. I was disappointed when I got it & saw that it had no booklet or insert, & also no (well that was for a limited time) Metal slipcover. Also on the Ultimate it didnt have a metal slipcover but it had the 32 page booklet & a insert. This has BETTER PICTURE THEN THE BLU RAY TERMINATOR 2 DISC (Well I say so). The 2nd disc is just junk its so you can play it on your PC & it plays it in 1080p HD but you have to do alot to get that up & running so I'll never do it & has 18 mins or so of never before seen stuff.

However, there is a major &quot;bug&quot; with the disc when  attempting to view the supplemental material on disc 2.  If you acess the  option that allows you to view the entire supplemental track in its  entirety the &quot;chapter&quot; list screen is displayed but then goes  into a &quot;wierd&quot; loop that never allows you to &quot;run&quot; the  full supplement.  Also, if you attempt to access the &quot;chapter&quot;  browse option the same bug manifest itself when you select chapter 2.  I  would have thought with all of the promotion taking place for this disc  there would have been better testing of the disc before mastering it.  Maybe the studio will own up to this oversight and &quot;repress&quot; the  disc and allow me to swap out the &quot;buggy&quot; one.  I welcome anyones  comments to the contrary as to my &quot;discovery&quot; of this issue with  the disc.	4.0	Great Disc - But you let it go out with a big BUG!	2000-09-01	1	1	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A39QYCBKS4D6E7	Tim Case	It took me a long time to decide how to get the Terminator collection in my blu-ray collection. I LOVE the first 2 Terminators as did almost everybody else on Earth and the 4 star rating has nothing to do with the actual movie, only this release of it. This is the Skynet edition. I have played it on my laptop, my desktop, and my Playstation 3 and since I keep everything up to date I had absolutely no problems playing it, however, they did to much with this and it is almost a pain to navigate the menue. When you choose to play the movie it gives you 3 options, Theatrical version, Extended version (which is the one that was on my special edition DVD when I had it a long time ago, and one that you have to put a code in to see it. I have not looked into this at all and I am sure I will figure it out in a matter of minutes when I want to (which will be soon), but are you kidding me? You want me to unlock something or figure something out to watch a version of the movie?!? Without knowing what this version of the movie even is or anything this gets a star taken away. I want to put a Blu-ray in, select which version of the film I would like to watch and watch it. If I want to do ANYTHING else with a movie (which I never do) that is what the special features is for. I dont want to mess with the stuff.

Almost seven years have passed since the first film and it's the fight to keep young John Connor alive. The T-800 (Schwarzenegger) and a new terminator made of goo, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) go back to fight over little John Connor. Machines have never been so cool! Arnold Schwarzenegger gives the performance of his career and it's the best thing that ever happened to me! He wears leather, has the cool sunglasses and motorcycle, truly vast! The T-800 is programmed to protect the boy to ensure the future doesn't change and the liquid thing is programmed to terminate the boy. A fight to remember forever! Both machines are unstoppable, but the liquid has the advantage. Not fair! Arnold's fist just goes right through the gooey mess and it doesn't work. It was distraught that Arnold could not stop the mean machine no matter what he tried. James Cameron is the King of the World, not for &quot;Titanic&quot; but for this mesmerizing piece of genius.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AA78TCLHXPJOK	Timothy G. Berntsen	Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made. It has inspired novels, comic books, games, two more sequels (one of which is in production), and a TV series (The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which is my favorite show since Firefly). Needless to say, this is a film who's greatness is never to be doubted.Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray disc is crap. It uses the old MPEG2 video encoder, so the picture quality is not what it ought to be on this format. The special features are absolutel bare bones, which is a darned shame since Extreme Edition and Ultimate Edition were both loaded up with lots of great goodies for fans to dig into. I would have settled for just getting the content from those two releases here in standard definition, just because they were so thorough and complete. Sadly, we get none of that here.The worst sin that this disc commits of all though, is that it does not include the special extended version. The extended cut of T2 is the definitive version of the movie-- once you've seen it, there's really no reason to go back and watch the original theatrical version. There was a load of good stuff that got added to the extended cut, and a lot of it was very important for the story. Whoever put this crappy Blu-Ray disc together obviously made it with the intention of double dipping in the future. If you must watch T2 in high definition now, then I won't stop you from buying it. However, be warned that in a few months it's bound to become a coaster when they put out a brand new version containing the extended cut, immaculate picture quality, and loads of special features. This disc is a temporary Terminator fix, at best.	2.0	No extended edition and bare bones features = not buying	2008-09-25	7	7	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3JADS9AZXTBAG	"Timstuff ""tim16733"""	"This is a really cool movie. Even 11 years after it's release, the special effects still look convincing, and the story and acting is excellent (as long as you don't think too hard about the time travel). The story is that in the future, a self aware computer system called Skynet has ravaged the planet with a nuclear war, to wipe out the humans. However, a military resistance lead by strategic genius John Connor is mere inches from defeating Skynet, so the Machines, in a last-ditch effort send a Terminator, an unstopable Cyborg that looks like a Human to kill John Connor's mother, thus preventing his birth! However, John Connor lears of this, and sends a lone soldier named Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother. Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, thus concieving John Connor, and destroy the Terminator, with Kyle dying in the process. That is what is chronicled in the first Terminator.In T2: Judgment Day, the machines devise an even better plan for wiping out John Connor. They send a more advanced terminator to the early 90's to kill John Connor himself while he is still a boy. The adult John Connor lears of this, and re-programs a Terminator to protect his child self in the past. Thus, the story for Terminator 2 unfolds.The movie is awsome, but there is something VERY annoying about this film, and for that reason I will deduct a star from it. This movie could have EASILY been PG-13, had it not been for an over-abundance of foul language, and some ""un-artistic"" eye gouging scenes. If it haden't been for these two things, I'd say this would be a perfect film to show to the whole family. It's got a thought provoking story, and had it been milder in the language and more ""artistic"" in the eye gouging scenes, kids would be captivated by things like John Connor's frienship with his robotic protector. If you want to let your kids see it, I suggest that you see it yourself first, and fast forward through the eye gouging and one scene with alot of un-presidented profanity. However, there might be a bit too many ""F-Words"" scattered throught the film for it to be clean enough even so. Still though, for the more mature of us, this is a great film. And for the kids, you could always take them to the 3D show at Universal Studios."	4.0	Awsome! However, I won't give it 5 stars because...	2002-09-07	4	1	3
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A14DD374X1PVQG	Tim the Duke	I haven't read all 531 reviews here as of this writing, but most everyone seems to focus on the 2nd DVD with the Hi-Def content. I actually bought the Extreme DVD for the high def content, but then decided the set was worth it for the 1st DVD alone.The 1st DVD disc has two things that totally thrilled me. An interactive mode which completely details all the special effects on screen and lets you break-away at several key-points to hear about sound, special effects and production notes from many of the people involved in the film. To me this is much more compelling than a Director's narrative.The other thing that totally blew me away on the 1st DVD is the Dolby Headphone Soundtrack. I've heard many headphone oriented surround technologies, but nothing like this. The sound over headphones is truely awesome. If I din't know I was watching a movie I would absolutely think the dogs barking in one particular scene were outside my condo. I actually prefer it to listening to the soundtrack over my thousand dollar speaker system.One other note the picture quality of the 1st DVD seems signifigantly better than the quality of the origional DVD release of T2. I often found it hard to beleive I was watching a DVD.I didn't consider myself a huge T2 fan before I bought this DVD, but it has defintely made me a bigger one. The high-def content is nice, but it doesn't make the set in my opinion.	5.0	The 1st DVD is also worth it.	2004-03-31	0	0	0

There is so much stuff on it, it will take  you hours to see it all (6 hours of content is what the label says). It  also includes a 32-page booklet and the DVD was enclosed in a metal cover,  very cool.Anyway, one thing I was happy to see is that both Dolby  Digital and DTS sound tracks are included. Actually Dolby Digital EX, and  DTS ES, which I think are advanced formats.  I think that most DTS DVDs  don't include all the extras for some reason, so I haven't bought any yet.  Most surround sound fans are aware of the battle between the two formats,  as to which one has the best sound. Now you can hear it for yourself if you  have both Dolby and DTS decoders. I do and I must say I was most impressed  with the DTS version. But to be fair, I haven't watched the Dolby version  yet (That will be tonight).  If you do watch both versions, review here  which one you think is better.The special edition version has added  scenes, which adds to the movie. For example: You get to see the first  terminator learn to smile.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2L2VG7PRBN4Y2	Tom Scholfield	This movie like the original is one of the greatest action movies of all time.  The way this movie is put together so intricatley.  There is one scene near the begining where the T1000 is chasing the boy and Arnold is  chasing the T1000 you just can not get any better than this, this has to be  one of the most intense scenes ever filmes and produced.  All the  characters are introduced to each other and to the audience in one  amazingly action packed scene.  The sound on this film is also amazing,  from gun shots to gates to the amazing bass, is always use this movie to  show off my Home Theatre.  This is truly one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's and  James Cameron's best films, and the Special Edition is even better.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A38QJ7JUUTVLKX	"Tom Servo ""Robot"""	Terminator 2 marks a rare occurance in film history, it's better than the first one! Yes that it very rare, how many times have that happened. Not many I can think of. After James Cameron pushed the envelope of computer-generated special effects in The Abyss, he turned this hotly anticipated sequel to Terminator into a well-written, action-packed showcase for advanced special effects and for one of the most invincible villains ever imagined. The bad guy in the previous is now the good guy fighting an even more powerful villian, T-1000 ), whose liquid-metal construction makes him seemingly unstoppable. The fate of the future lies in the balance, with Linda Hamilton reprising her role as the rugged woman whose son will change the course of history. The third installment is coming out soon, and I suggest seeing all of them. If you're going to buy this one, buy the first as well. 5 Stars definately deserved.	5.0	The Best so far in the series	2003-01-29	0	0	0

They said this was what The Terminator would have been with a bigger bugdet but the 1st film had a love story to keep it going. This film does not have that so it hardly ever slows down (which is'nt not a bad thing).

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A33V25KHAU1SP7	ToughCustomer86	"This review is for the German Steelbook version of T2: Director's Cut only, on HD DVD format.Just wanna start off by saying i am a big fan of HD DVDs, mostly because they're no longer produced and sort of collectible, also because they have quite a lot of integrity, high quality menus, lossless sound (in this case the German company ""Kinowelt"" went all the way and added 7.1 channel DTS surround sound), all the extras and special features of the US blu ray counterpart (some in German only) except the theatrical and special code editions of the movie, and... Oh yeah,  the movie is mastered in Full 1080p High Def! If ur a fan of rare items with integrity, then definately get this steel case high resolution disc, and don't worry the movie was produced in both German 7.1 and Englisch 7.1, also a 2.0 Englisch surround sound headphone option for those of us who only have a stereo or quadrophonic sound system, (like me).I've never seen T2 look better, even though the film was originally shot on Super 35mm grain film stock. This master is about 80% HD transfer, yet does still carry some of the grainy look in several scenes. I would definately buy this great item again, just wish ""Kinowelt"" would have included the theatric and special CODE edition of T2, and that the SKYNET link from 2008 was still supported by some kind of back up website... Overall the director's cut on this disc is well worth the $$$, especially this HI-RES transfer, surround sound, 50+ special features, and steelbook case. The movie and all features were burned on only 1 disc for whatever reason.I had a ball experiencing T2: Ultimate HD edition... :)-b(Note: This product does require an HD-DVD ROM optical drive -w- Arcsoft Total Media Theatre 3 or 5, or an HD DVD player/Xbox 360 HD DVD drive to uncode and play the movie.)"	4.0	ALMOST PERFECT	2012-05-08	1	1	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Most sequels are imperfect remakes of the originals that they were based upon. However, (and not including trilogies), once in awhile a sequel is made that is worthy of its predecessor. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is such a movie.The original movie is a great piece of science fiction action cinema. T2 follows the story about a decade where the original ended. The original Terminator, the T-800, that Skynet had first sent back into time had failed to eliminate Sarah Connor before her son was born. However, a backup plan had already been thought of and the massive computer sent another Terminator, the T-1000 (an experimental model) further ahead into time to terminate John Connor before he reached maturity. However, the human resistance had their game on and sent another protector back in time, too. This time a Terminator would be a guardian.Over a decade since it's original theatrical release, it is amazing how fresh and current T2 looks and feels. The action is intense, the special effects are state of the art, and the acting quite believable. The movie is full of allegorical allusions and subtle visuals that speak volumes. For example, as my brother pointed out, it's kind of frightening that T2 warns about machines taking over the world, yet we live in a society where many are totally dependent upon machines to do their bidding for them. Have machines already taken over and we just don't realize it? Not many sci-fi action pictures can make a person think that deeply.	5.0	Worthy Sequel.	2003-04-18	4	4	0

Not only do you get the extended edition of the movie, but also the special extended edition that put a real end to the Terminator story line.  (They didn't show this edition for obvious reason.  Otherwise, there shouldn't be a T3.)You also get hours and hours of seemed endless extra behind the scene materials.The metal cover packaging is best fit this film.It's harder to find this edition now, but if you do come across anyone of these, don't let it slip away from your fingers.	5.0	The best Terminator 2 on recorded media you could find.	2004-10-26	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3Q4BPS221HV1M	"""uber_gamer"""	If your interested in the real differences from a technical perspective then here it goes:The ultimate Edition DVD that has been out for about a year now has the best special features and extras.The new just released EXTREME EDITION, the very DVD on this page, has the best picture and sound possible from the source material. The developers have gone back and copied the original source in extremely high resolution, of course your average TV can only get a fraction of the resolution this is actually displaying but High Definition TV can see it in all its glory. So in reality this DVD was made for the future high definition DVD players and HDTV systems that will be released probably within the next 3 years.The EXTREME edition does have the best picture and sound because the bit-rates are much higher than the Ultimate Edition. But because of this the DVD can not hold as much extra features and such. The Extreme Edition does feature the first EVER James Cameron commentary on T2, and it is exceptionally interesting stuff! If you don't own the Ultimate Edition then this Extreme Edition is definitely worth it. But if you do own the Ultimate Edition, you probably would be fine without this DVD unless you absolutely must have the best experience possible regardless of special features or you are a collector or extreme fan of the series. Think of this edition as a companion to your Ultimate Edition.	4.0	To buy or not to buy, is your question...	2003-06-10	6	6	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3F5EJTBEQ74TC	"Ufowriter ""Ufowriter"""	Terminator 2 - almost certainly the most violent film I have ever viewed in my entire life. The ever thickening plot, surrounding a vision that robots from the future will, one day, rule the world, and lead mankind into a deathly destruction, features the T2000 robot prototype, who is brought to this Earth to save the innocent humans on the planet. This film is sentimental, in some parts, as the T2000 has absolutely no sense of conscience, love or compassion. Therefore, he will kill whenever he thinks that something is wrong. Moreover, the child who is being protected by this ultrahuman - a yob, and a criminal youth at that - is made somewhat kinder, as the film progresses, as it is only his responsibility to teach the learning robot humanity. This film is definitely violent, with scenes of death, violence and murder enraging the viewer with fright and deep worry, though it is usually the 'good' characters who get the better of the camera, as is conventional with all violent films like this. I believe that this movie is somewhat a little too violent, though the sentimentality included in the way the younger characters teach humanity and manners is a lesson for us all: only use violence in absolute desperation. A good film, though a tad verging on horror, when it comes to violence.	3.0	Inconceivably Violent	2004-08-30	4	0	4

Also if you plan on downloading this movie to your PSP, don't.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3SVVA9OJJKZL0	Victoria Hestin	I'm not too big on the gratuitous swearing or the blood and guts in it, my main reason for liking it so much is Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor. To me it's what a female action hero should be. She's smart, ruthless, tough, and they actually have her get her hair messed up. If they made her a villain, she'd be even scarier than she already is. I like that they have her doing exercises to stay fit and get sweaty doing so. And to those who say she's not 'feminine', she's a mother. What's more 'feminine/womanly' than that? That's actually her whole focus, protecting her son.As to the special features, I haven't watched them all yet, I will say though that the review that said there was only one version of the movie on disc 1 is wrong. There is the theatrical version and the special edition. I have watched both, but I will not watch the special/uncut version again, some of the scenes I didn't like. The booklet was a welcome surprise, I didn't know there was one included. The metal casing is also nice, because I have 2 very inquisitive Siamese kittens.SPOILER ALERT:During the freeway chase when the T1000 is in the helicopter, I noticed after a few viewings that he forms a 2nd pair of arms/hands so he can pilot and shoot at the same time, and that is just CHEATING!	4.0	This is one of my favorite movies	2013-11-03	0	0	0

I'm from Europeand cannot obtain some kind of a license for playback of the HD portion. This extreme edition is worth having because of thesharper image of the extended edition of T2, but those fans who seek documentaries and interviews better look for Ultimate edition.In my opinion a true Terminator fan must own both editions. Also the packaging of this edition is much better than ofthe ultimate but it's a shame that there's no booklet.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A1X3A046VOFBVP	Walter R. Moss	This movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie that he has ever made. After 6 years (I think) of waiting after The Terminator, Arnold has graced us with his best movie ever. Not even Predator could match this performance he gives. Fans of the first Terminator will be shocked, surprised, but hopefully not saddended by his turn from vilian to the best on-screen hero. The director (James Cameron) does his best to try to portray Arnold as a ...hero that everyone could look up to and he even puts in a few hidden jokes that the Terminator would not normally do, like smile. The other cd is packed with cast and crew interviews and a behind the scenes look at the making of T:2 3-D. That is a great show (I have been there and been on it). All in all, if you have not seen this movie in this format, go out and buy it. P.S. there is a third movie with nothing left out.

So don't expect any of the extra footage. Alright, so this is the Blu Ray edition of T2: Judgment Day so it should be amazing like the movie right? NO. This Blu Ray edition features no special features, a regular DTS-6.1 audio soundtrack and a MPEG-2 video transfer. Thus, the film looks grainy (which is not good for this film), colors can look washed out and the black levels aren't the best. Detail is good, and close up shots look great but given that this is one of the earliest BR releases, it doesn't live up to today's standard. Don't get me wrong, it does look better than the DVD editions for the most part but it doesn't justify a true high definition version of this film. So we have a sub-par looking high definition release of T2 that lacks any special features (Come on, no special features at all? We've had like 5 releases of the film on DVD loaded with so much bonus features and this has none?? WHY?). All in all, is it worth the money? Not really. I found this at Wal-Mart for a flat $10.00 so it was worth it just to watch it again but not the same can be said for everyone else. My opinion, if you own the DVD and a Blu Ray player, you're good for now. In May when the new Terminator film releases, there will be a new release of T2 that will present a better video and audio transfer as well as some special features and multiple versions of the film. It's called the SkyNet Edition. There's also supposed to be a Ultimate Edition with like 6 discs, featuring every edition of the movie on DVD plus the Blu Ray version. Just wait.	3.0	Bad Release, Just Wait Until May	2009-02-08	8	8	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"""T2"" has been reissued on DVD so often by Lion's Gate and its predecessor studios that it has become an industry unto itself. That said, this is the best edition so far but it is flawed. First up if you don't have the latest firmware updates, it won't make it past the Lion's Gate logo. Secondly, once you do have that firmware installed due to the design, Java menu or both it takes forever to load on most machines.The good news is that we get the bulk of the previous DVD ultimate edition from a couple of years back. That's also the bad news for those looking for new extras because there really aren't any just stuff repurposed from the previous release.As far as the film itself it looks good although it looks like an older HD transfer to me. There is fine grain throughout and contrary to an earlier review at the Digital Bits it doesn't quite look like it's been overprocessed with DNR. Evidently according to that site the actual encoding may have been part of the process that created the look that it was over DNR'd for this release. There's quite a bit of fine detail evident throughout on second viewing. I still thought the film looked a bit soft considering it was shot in Super 35mm and based on previous viewings of the film part of that could be due to the encoding as well as the an the possibility that this uses an older HD master (probably the one used to prepare the DVD version from a couple of years back). Either way while it doesn't look perfect, it's still a firm step up from the DVD and the previous theatrical version on Blu-ray.This includes all three versions of the movie (for the last version you have to input the date of ""Judgment Day"" to access the version with the alternate ending added to the film)including the theatrical and extended cuts of the movie on a single seamless branching edition of the film.The sound is spectacular with the finest 6.1 mix I've heard and it's Lossless for those that are interested.There's also an edition with a flimsy but attrarctive T2 head that divides up the extras and various editions onto separate discs allowing for a higher bit rate for the visuals.Reportedly after Cameron finishes ""Avatar"" (remember this IS a rumor), he'll turn his attentiont to remastering this again. You can get this version or wait until that reported version hits the market. Either way this looks extremely good but could look better but sounds the best it has ever sounded."	4.0	"Yet another reissue of ""T2"" with some flaws but worthwhile until Cameron can remaster it..."	2009-05-25	14	13	1

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	Although it hasn't stopped me from watching the movie about 15 times since its release, I must say that T2 doesn't hold up to scrutiny quite as well as its predecessor or its successor in the Terminator trilogy.  This movie cost about $100 million to make, which is a huge sum today and was even bigger back in 1991.  And while that hefty budget did provide the movie with special effects that were vastly superior to those of the original (no claymation mock-ups of Arnold's face this time out), it detracted from many of the qualities that had made the original Terminator such an intelligent and frightening film.  With so much money to spend on such stunning visuals (and make no mistake, this movie *was* a visual stunner of the highest order), James Cameron and Co. no longer had to focus as much on tiny aspects like atmosphere, characterization, or realism, and in the long run the product suffers as a result.Perhaps the worst part of the movie is the presence this time around of John Connor himself.  If this kid is going to be the savior of mankind, I question whether mankind is even worth saving.  He starts the movie as a grating, whiny-voiced twerp, and he pretty much stays there until the end.  And what's even worse, he takes Arnold down with him, turning a mighty Terminator into a sensitive, new-agey guy right before our very eyes.  I more or less have to avert my eyes during the last five minutes or so, and I'm sure I'm not alone.Ok, enough from the complaint department, now for the good stuff.  I've said a lot already about the special effects, and this movie's hypertrophic budget did enable Cameron to pull off scenes he could scarcely have dreamed of back in 1984.  T2 is highlighted by a succession of stunning set pieces that almost single-handedly revolutionized the action genre.  The chase scenes and shootouts are among the most spectacular ever put to film, and there are even a few old-fashioned beatdowns thrown in for good measure.  Not to mention, this movie sees the completion of Sarah Connor's transformation from hapless would-be victim to bona fide tough chick, complete with plenty of muscle tone and a new-found expertise with martial arts and automatic weapons.  I, for one, think change was for the better in this case.Since T2 was of course a sequel, it was only natural to up the ante in the villain department, and this movie came through in a big way.  The original Terminator was a scary enough killing machine, and in T2 we get not only the return of Arnold, but an even more frightening &quot;bad&quot; Terminator in the form of the T-1000.  Made of an ultra-futuristic liquid metal (try not to think whether such a thing is scientifically feasible), the T-1000 slices and dices its way through unsuspecting humans with such efficiency it makes Arnold's old-school T-800 seem like a cuisinart.  And while Robert Patrick is nowhere near as imposing as Arnold, nor as easy on the eyes as T3 villainess Kristanna Loken (well, duh), he did manage to perfect the steely glare that the role required.In the end, T2 is a much more than satisfactory viewing experience.  It doesn't have the malevolent mood of the original, and it's not quite as intelligent as the latest (last?) installment, but for grandiose action it hardly gets better than this.  The movie also further develops the trilogy's emphasis on fate and free will, with more intimations of the future horrors that await mankind if we continue on our present course.  The intimations of impending apocalypse are kept largely off-screen, but despite (or perhaps because of) that fact, it may be most frightening of all.	4.0	A great movie, but not quite a great Terminator movie	2004-01-19	4	3	1
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3INSYC2IWTKA4	whitsbrain	"This ""Extreme DVD"" edition of ""Terminator 2"" was already released a few years ago so if you already own it, skip this re-release.  However, this DVD is a shining example of delivering what DVD (and Blu-Ray for that matter) should.  There are great ""making of"" extras, an interactive ""pop-up"" feature, a fantastic James Cameron commentary and other extras that make this a can't miss purchase.The ""Extreme DVD"" edition of ""Terminator 2"" adds a number of scenes to the theatrical version that clear up some of the questions I had.  For example, in the scene where the T-1000 has Sarah call for John in the steel mill.  I always wondered why it didn't just kill Sarah and imitate her voice and appearance.  As it turns out, this occurs after the T-1000 has been frozen, shattered and reformed.  Several moments in between these events reveals that the liquid terminator is malfunctioning which could explain why it needed Sarah to call out to John.  It isn't just a case of being afraid to kill off main characters after all.""T2"" is another James Cameron classic and if you haven't seen it you're missing out on a great film.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A14T6T24LSRO2F	William Cannon	"I agree with Mr. Big's review. I watched the original 2006 blu-ray release, and I found the picture to be far too light and pretty noisy. After reading the reviews on amazon of the 2006 disc, I decided to wait for a re-release, which I hoped would offer better picture quality. In my opnion, the ""skynet edition"" does exactly that. The blacks are deeper, and the colors are as a result richer. There is some loss of fine detail, but it's still a noticeable improvement over the DVD releases and, IMHO, a welcome addition to the rather large family of T2 discs.On to the movie itself --- the disc contains the theatrical version, which I personally prefer. Left out is a dream sequence scene, in which Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, hero of the first film) visits Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to admonish Sarah to do whatever she can to protect son John (Edward Furlong), who will become the leader of the human resistance after judgment day. While it was certainly nice to see future soldier Reese again on the director's cut DVD (I think Biehn is the most underrated part of the first film), this scene felt tacked on, which is probably why Cameron didn't include it in the theatrical release. Also thankfully left out is a hokey scene in which John teaches the T-800 terminator (Arnie) how to smile.Bottom line, this is a better quality blu-ray than the 2006 edition, and since amazon is offering it for $14.99, a relative bargain if you want to have the thus-far best T2 disc."	4.0	This is the one.	2009-04-27	0	0	0

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3GUNXVYK34085	William F. Flanigan Jr.	This DVD has three (count 'em, if you can!) films on it.  The original theater release version.  An ultimate edition version.  And THE EXTENDED SPECIAL EDITION version.  To get to see the latter you need a special code/procedure (shades of video-game code pounders!) to access such gems as: (1) what has got to be the ultimate Dolby Digital and THX lead-in to the opening credits of any DVD movie yet created for us mere mortals; (2) scenes of what the bad Terminator does in John Connor's room (in his foster-parent's home) early in the film; (3) graphic illustrations that the bad Terminator is becoming dysfunctional early on in the steel foundry towards the end of the film; and (4) an epilogue that definitively precludes future Terminator sequels.  Sound and video are &quot;reference quality&quot; for your home theater system which means, folks, it doesn't get any better than this!  Supplemental video material is copious and tied to which film version you have chosen to view.  The physical packaging is, well, truly unbelievable.  I'd recommend buying two copies: one to play with; and one as an investment--I'm NOT kidding.

I don't think there is anything they can do to make rear screen projection backgrounds look any better on HD (I'm sure they never considered it a problem in 1991).The colors from the explosions, night scenes and steel mill look really good.  Big improvement over the old one.  The scenes where Arnold is shooting at the cops with the mini-gun, then grenade launcher, then the subsequent blowing up of the computer lab are wonderful in high-def with the sound cranked all the way up!  Just never gets old!I liked the 2003 commentary track with James Cameron the most.  You know this movie is cool when you watch it, you just don't know exactly why until you here this guy talk through some of the scenes.  Rare opportunity to hear one of the greatest film makers ever talk through the whole thing.  The attention to detail is incredible.

A mediocre story that we're  given only only to get the audience from one action scene to the next.  The  movie is entertaining on the basis that you've seen the far superior first  film.  The film does do what Cameron wanted it to, however.  That was to  build a new level of special effects in the early 90's.  On that level this  is a succesful film, but almost seems more like a sequel to The Abyss  rather than The Terminator.  Just as The Abyss brought cg up a notch, so  does this film.

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"There's already great reviews regarding the movie, so I'm just going to add the differences between the R1 DVDs.DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ULTIMATE EDITION and EXTREME EDITION DVD:Extreme has better sound and picture quality, but you don't really notice unless you are watching it on a HUGE screen with a very expensive Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound system (THX approved of course), and have a guy that produced the DVD sitting next to you pointing out the VERY slight differences in quality.If I remember correctly, the Extreme edition is the only release that has a director's commentary featuring Cameron and William Wisher. UE has a commentary featuring lots of cast and crew that's pieced together from other interviews.The Extreme Edition has lots of making of and behind the scenes clips that can be accessed right from the movie. As you're watching, a Cyberdyne logo will appear up in the corner of the screen. If you click on it, it'll take you to extra info about that particular scene, behind the scenes footage, interviews, etc. I think some of the clips are different from those included in the extras of the UE version, and some are the same. When the clip is done, it'll return you right to the part of the movie you were at, and continue the movie. (There's also a menu page where these clips can be accessed directly without having to go into the movie.)Extreme also has DVD-ROM features that Ultimate doesn't have, such as a Windows Media Player 9 High-Definition transfer of the 139 minute theatrical cut. Extreme also has a 9-10 minute montage of behind the scenes clips that aren't on UE.Another difference between the two is that the UE contains the 139 minute theatrical cut, 152 minute director's cut, AND 156 minute extended director's cut of the film (it has the alternate ending and a scene that shows the T-1000 searching John's room), while the Extreme only has the 139 and 152 minute versions of the film. The 156 minute version is an easter egg on the UE though, which can be accessed on Disc 1/Side 1.Where is it?Select the ""Special Edition"" option at the main menu. Enter 8, 29, 97 at the special edition screen to access the ""Extended Special Edition"" version of the film.What is it?Two extra scenes will appear during the special edition (director's cut) version of the movie.Note: Some remote controls require the +10 button to be used to enter the numbers, other DVD players will need to have Enter pressed after each individual digit.As for soundtracks, the UE features: Dolby EX 6.1, DTS ES 6.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 and the cast and crew commentary.The Extreme features a Dolby Digital EX 5.1 soundtrack, Dolby headphone audio track, and the Cameron commentary.Ultimate has the better ""extras"", and the 156 minute cut of the film.So it's up to you. Go for the same film with less extras (Extreme), or the same film with more extras (Ultimate).However, if you love the UE, I'd wait for the movie to hit a Hi-Definition format before you go buying the movie again."	5.0	Terminator 2: Judgement Day	2005-06-29	5	5	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3OI841P5R6FCH	Zagnorch	I already owned the VHS set of the Special Edition when the first DVD  release of T2 hit the streets. I rented it and found that it was just the  theatrical cut. Even though it had superior picture and sound compared to  VHS, I decided to wait until the full cut was released. And, after finally  experiencing the finished product, I can sincerely state that it was well  worth the wait.Now I'm able to view both the theatrical and Special  Edition, as well as other deleted scenes. Some of those restorations  include Sarah Connor dream sequence featuring `T1' martyr Kyle Reese, the  garage head surgery, John Connor trying to teach the Terminator to smile,  and several other little moments that add to the movie's suspense and  style.The picture quality's a little better than my original VHS tape,  which was excellent in itself. The upside to this is I don't have to worry  about the picture quality degrading after endless viewings. It's the sound,  however, that's improved by leaps and bounds. The film starts with opening  demos of both Dolby and THX sound, both of which just blew me away before  the movie's opening sequence even began! It's definitely a big step up from  the VHS edition, which was just above adequate.Like the Special Edition  DVD release of that other James Cameron gem `The Abyss', `T2 Ultimate  Collection' is jam-packed with extras. Enough to keep a big-time film buff  entertained for hours without ever actually viewing the movie itself. Two  `making of' documentaries, trailers, shooting script, production stills,  and much more. Altogether, over six hours worth of stuff! There's even a  `making of' featurette on the Universal Studios attraction T2 3D. And if  the DVD's extra features weren't enough, also included is a fairly thick  booklet detailing the history and making of the film.The aluminum  slipcase gives the total package a proper look, but can easily get  scratches, dings, and dents if you're not too careful. Another downside is  that it fits quite loosely over the snap case. If you plan to pull it out  off your shelf for viewing, I strongly suggest you get a good grip on it  first. Or you can just put the slipcase aside and place just the snap case  alone on your DVD shelf.I hope you enjoy `T2 Ultimate Edition' as much  as I do!`Late!	5.0	Truly the Ultimate!

0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	ALGDLRUI1ZPCS	Zo	I enjoy all of the Terminator movies...but this is far and away my favorite of the set.  It truly has everything you could want from an action movie.  Highly recommended.	5.0	This is Arnold at his best!	2014-03-18	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2GVGYN3NYORVT	Zoransis	"Arnold is back, this time as a friendly cyborg against a living metal adversary in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. What's new about the Skynet Edition is the film is expanded, and the interactivity (including Blu-Ray Live) is about as extreme as it gets regarding T2. I did not have a 2.0 compliant player that connects to the Internet, so I cannot comment about the live content, which tends to be dynamic and therefore could/might change if I were to comment about it anyway.The total runtime of the extra content is not 30 or even 20 minutes if I recall, but it does make parts of the film make more sense or at least a bit better laugh, like when the T1000 is asked, ""Are we learning yet?"" These clips, put back in, perhaps add a little more gratuitous gore and cyberbabble to the story, which is likely why they were cut out of the theatrical version, which you can opt to view as well.As with well-made Blu-Ray movies, the image is sharp as a tack, the sound of explosions and other sounds are very real and visceral, and really put you into it. It makes me wish for a surround speaker system!This is a classic, both of Schwarzenegger's action films, and of the cyborg menace sci-fi flicks that came before and after. It had some cutting-edge effects for its time, and some still are seldom used or seen today. It's one of those amazing films that comes cheaply, easy to add to your library and keep to remember when sci-fi was a mix of effects, mind games, and terror. It's a pretty wild ride."	5.0	He Be Back	2012-07-25	0	0	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A2TGKFAKABC71J	Z. Wolf	I'm not going to bother giving my opinion on the content of the movie, you can search all over the net if you're interested in that.Overall, it's a pretty decent transfer (averages from 12-20ish mbps). Sound is excellent. The skynet edition is pretty interesting, the menus are some of the coolest looking I've seen.A great buy at the price.	5.0	Blu Ray- Good transfer, excellent sound	2012-01-23	3	3	0
0784010188	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	A3IDBWT605PTL7	ZZrider	This review is for the Collectors set with skull.  The skull is very solid, well made and will look great on your shelf.  It comes with batteries and there's also a on/off switch underneath the base.  The eyes light up and it plays sound effects from the movie.  The sound is terrible though, it just sounds like static noise.  The discs come in a separate case and you can also store them in the base of the skull.  The blue-ray disc is a pain and wouldn't register my internet connection and takes forever to load.  DTS and 5.1 sound wouldn't work on blue-ray for some reason.  The sound on the DVD versions worked great so it must be a blue-ray defect.  I'm pleased with the set except for the sound problems.  If you're a fan this might be worth picking up but it's far from perfect.	3.0	Great skull, so so blue-ray	2009-05-22	2	2	0
